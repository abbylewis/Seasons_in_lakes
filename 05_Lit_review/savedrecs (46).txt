BMAA producers occur globally, colonizing almost all habitats and represent species from distinct phytoplanktonic groups, i.e., cyanobacteria, diatoms, and dinoflagellates. Bioaccumulation of BMAA in invertebrate and vertebrate organisms has also been registered around the globe. In the Baltic Sea, BMAA has been detected in several commercial fish species, raising the question of the bioaccumulation of BMAA in Swedish limnic systems. Here we find the presence of BMAA in water samples from Lake Finjasjon and identify its bioaccumulation patterns in both plankti-benthivorous and piscivorous fish, according to fish species, total weight, gender, and season of collection. For the first time, a large number of fish individuals were used in order to draw conclusions on BMAA bioaccumulation in a closed ecological community based on a statistical approach. We may, therefore, conclude that feeding patterns (plankti-benthivorous) and increased age of fish may lead to a higher tissue concentration of BMAA.

However, it is still unclear how extensively permafrost degradation has influenced surface and subsurface water systems due to very sparse observations. Isotope mass models combining tritium and Rn-222 measurements are developed here to quantify the contributions of groundwater discharge and thawing permafrost to rivers and lakes in the Source Area of the Yellow River. Results demonstrate the spatial variability of permafrost thaw impacts and confirm significant influence on surface and subsurface runoff processes including effects on water yield capacity and water drainage connectivity. While results to date are conclusive, further work to refine the method and extend observations is warranted.					; Gibson, John/D-1897-2009	Gibson, John Joseph/0000-0001-5952-0228; Wan, Chengwei/0000-0003-1596-4091													0236-5731	1588-2780				NOV	2019	322	2					561	578		10.1007/s10967-019-06720-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10967-019-06720-5													WOS:000493694600033
J	Schwörer, C; Henne, PD; Tinner, W				Schwoerer, Christoph; Henne, Paul D.; Tinner, Willy			A model-data comparison of Holocene timberline changes in the Swiss Alps reveals past and future drivers of mountain forest dynamics	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Mountain vegetation is strongly affected by temperature and is expected to shift upwards with climate change. Dynamic vegetation models are often used to assess the impact of climate on vegetation and model output can be compared with paleobotanical data as a reality check. Recent paleoecological studies have revealed regional variation in the upward shift of timberlines in the Northern and Central European Alps in response to rapid warming at the Younger Dryas/Preboreal transition ca. 11700years ago, probably caused by a climatic gradient across the Alps. This contrasts with previous studies that successfully simulated the early Holocene afforestation in the (warmer) Central Alps with a chironomid-inferred temperature reconstruction from the (colder) Northern Alps. We use LandClim, a dynamic landscape vegetation model to simulate mountain forests under different temperature, soil and precipitation scenarios around Iffigsee (2065m a.s.l.) a lake in the Northwestern Swiss Alps, and compare the model output with the paleobotanical records. The model clearly overestimates the upward shift of timberline in a climate scenario that applies chironomid-inferred July-temperature anomalies to all months. However, forest establishment at 9800 cal. BP at Iffigsee is successfully simulated with lower moisture availability and monthly temperatures corrected for stronger seasonality during the early Holocene. The model-data comparison reveals a contraction in the realized niche of Abies alba due to the prominent role of anthropogenic disturbance after ca. 5000 cal. BP, which has important implications for species distribution models (SDMs) that rely on equilibrium with climate and niche stability. Under future climate projections, LandClim indicates a rapid upward shift of mountain vegetation belts by ca. 500m and treeline positions of ca. 2500m a.s.l. by the end of this century. Resulting biodiversity losses in the alpine vegetation belt might be mitigated with low-impact pastoralism to preserve species-rich alpine meadows.

Subglacial floods of various magnitudes - events occurring once per year or less frequently with discharges larger than a few hundred cubic metres per second - are often invoked to explain the erosive power of subglacial water flow. In this study we examine whether subglacial floods are necessary to carve bedrock channels, or if more frequent melt season events (e.g. daily production of meltwater) can explain the formation of substantial bedrock channels over a glacial cycle. We use a one-dimensional numerical model of bedrock erosion by subglacial meltwater, where water flows through interacting distributed and channelized drainage systems. The shear stresses produced drive bedrock erosion by bed- and suspended-load abrasion. We show that seasonal meltwater discharge can incise an incipient bedrock channel a few tens of centimetres deep and several metres wide, assuming abrasion is the only mechanism of erosion, a particle size of D=256 mm and a prescribed sediment supply per unit width. Using the same sediment characteristics, flood flows yield wider but significantly shallower bedrock channels than seasonal meltwater flows. Furthermore, the smaller the shear stresses produced by a flood, the deeper the bedrock channel. Shear stresses produced by seasonal meltwater are sufficient to readily transport boulders as bedload. Larger flows produce greater shear stresses and the sediment is carried in suspension, which produces fewer contacts with the bed and less erosion. We demonstrate that seasonal meltwater discharge can excavate bedrock volumes commensurate with channels several tens of metres to a few hundred metres wide and several tens of metres deep over several thousand years. Such simulated channels are commensurate with published observations of tunnel valleys and inner gorges. Copyright (c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Water quality observations in the marine aquaculture complex of the Deeba Triangle, Lake Manzala, Egyptian Mediterranean coast	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Coastal aquaculture is faced with extreme variation in water quality. The Deeba Triangle on Lake Manzala is the largest marine coastal aquaculture-producing area on the Egyptian Mediterranean. Samples from 16 ponds were taken during four seasons (2014-2015), to investigate the variation of 12 water quality parameters at that region. We tested the hypothesis that there is no spatial or temporal variation in water quality of the fish ponds. Fish ponds were statistically clustered into three groups (p = 0.0005) coincident with their geographical location. Hypersaline and transparent waters characterized the western ponds; higher dissolved oxygen and higher nutrients characterized the central region. These spatial differences were principally due to variations in salinity and nutrients of the water sources used for irrigation of the ponds and to differences in the aeration management styles. Strong seasonality was seen in water temperature (following air temperature), nutrients, and turbidity (following the seasonal cycles of various water sources from the Lake Manzala and the seasonality of the petrochemical plants effluents close to these ponds). We conclude that municipal effluents significantly affected, spatially and temporally, the quality of the irrigation water used for coastal aquaculture purposes, which consequently might affect fish yield.

Pigment carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures in euxinic basins	GEOBIOLOGY												The carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures of chloropigments and porphyrins from the sediments of redox-stratified lakes and marine basins reveal details of past biogeochemical nutrient cycling. Such interpretations are strengthened by modern calibration studies, and here, we report on the C and N isotopic composition of pigments and nutrients in the water column and surface sediment of redox-stratified Fayetteville Green Lake (FGL; New York). We also report C-13 and N-15 values for pyropheophytin a (Pphe a) and bacteriochlorophyll e (Bchl e) deposited in the Black Sea during its transition to a redox-stratified basin ca. 7.8 ka. We propose a model for evolving nutrient cycling in the Black Sea from 7.8 to 6.4 ka, informed by the new pigment data from FGL. The seasonal study of water column nutrients and pigments at FGL revealed population dynamics in surface and deep waters that were also captured in the sediments. Biomass was greatest near the chemocline, where cyanobacteria, purple sulfur bacteria (PSB), and green sulfur bacteria (GSB) had seasonally variable populations. Bulk organic matter in the surface sediment, however, was derived mainly from the oxygenated surface waters. Surface sediment pigment C-13 and N-15 values indicate intact chlorophyll a (Chl a) was derived from near the chemocline, but its degradation product pheophytin a (Phe a) was derived primarily from surface waters. Bacteriopheophytin a (Bphe a) and Bchl e in the sediments came from chemocline populations of PSB and GSB, respectively. The distinctive C-13 and N-15 values for Chl a, Phe a, and Bphe a in the surface sediment are inputs to an isotopic mixing model that shows their decomposition to a common porphyrin derivative can produce non-specific sedimentary isotope signatures. This model serves as a caveat for paleobiogeochemical interpretations in basins that had diverse populations near a shallow chemocline.					; Arthur, Michael/E-2872-2014; Freeman, Katherine/H-5140-2011	Fulton, James/0000-0001-7213-8015; Freeman, Katherine/0000-0002-3350-7671; 													1472-4677	1472-4669				JUL	2018	16	4					429	445		10.1111/gbi.12285	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gbi.12285								29577577					WOS:000434965600007

In this study, we investigated N2O fluxes and nitrification and denitrification rates at the sediment-water interface and analyzed monthly the relationships between these processes in different areas of Taihu Lake over a one-year period. Annual maximum nitrification and denitrification rate and N2O flux were observed during June in an algae-dominated area of the lake and measured 17.80, 235.51, and 31.49 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1), respectively. The nitrification rate ranged from 0 to 1.18 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1) at other sampling sites, with less variation. The denitrification rate showed clear seasonal variation, with lower levels between August and January (0.01-8.57 mu mol N M(-2)h(-1); average = 1.49 mu mol N m(-2)h(-1)) and a rapid increase between February and July (1.03-235.51 mu mol N M-2 h(-1); average = 41.73 mu mol N M-2 h(-1)).The N2O flux ranged from -0.64 to 1.5 mu mol N M-2 h(-1), with little variability except for a much higher rate (31.49 mu mol N M-2 h(-1)) in June in algae-dominated areas. N2O flux was significantly positively correlated with nitrification and denitrification rates in most lake zones. By comparing the slopes of the regression equations, we found that N2O emissions from the sediment -water interface were influenced predominantly by nitrification, suggesting that lower N2O fluxes from the sediment water interface in Taihu Lake are caused primarily by lower nitrification rates.					; ZHANG, YI/AAU-5378-2020	Yu, Juhua/0000-0002-6398-6175; 														2073-4441				JUL	2018	10	7							911	10.3390/w10070911	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10070911													WOS:000442579700094

Whole mitogenome sequencing refines population structure of the Critically Endangered sawfish Pristis pristis	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												The largetooth sawfish Pristis pristis (Linnaeus, 1758) is a highly threatened euryhaline elasmobranch that in recent times has undergone a significant range contraction. It now only remains in a few areas, with northern Australia being the main stronghold. Previous work using a single mitochondrial gene approach suggested the existence of regional barriers to gene flow in northern Australia. In this study, whole mitochondrial sequences of 92 P. pristis from 7 river drainages across northern Australia were used to refine the population structure. This approach revealed barriers to gene flow at a scale as fine as between adjacent river drainages. Except for those flowing into the Gulf of Carpentaria, all river drainages appeared to host a genetically distinct population. The apparent genetic homogeneity in the Gulf is probably due to freshwater connectivity between river drainages, either during the last glaciation event when the Gulf was a freshwater lake or through contemporary wet season flooding. These results suggest that each river drainage across the species' range should be considered a discrete management unit unless there is evidence of freshwater connectivity. More broadly, the improved resolution of population structure obtained with whole mitogenome analysis compared to single mitochondrial gene approaches suggests that female reproductive philopatry may have been overlooked in previous studies of some elasmobranch species.

Results show that the changing stage of annual lake level variations is evident, and average onset time of the lake dry season has advanced since the 1990s. Investigation indicates that the Yangtze River discharge has a greater impact on annual lake level variations than the lake's catchment inflow.

Assessment of microcystin distribution and biomagnification in tissues of aquatic food web compartments from a shallow lake and evaluation of potential risks to public health	ECOTOXICOLOGY												The objectives of this study were: (1) to examine the distribution and bioaccumulation of microcystins in the main components of the food web (phytoplankton, zooplankton, crayfish, shrimp, mussel, snail, fish, frog) of Lake Pamvotis (NW Greece), (2) to investigate the possibility of microcystin biomagnification and (3) to evaluate the potential threat of the contaminated aquatic organisms to human health. Significant microcystin concentrations were detected in all the aquatic organisms during two different periods, with the higher concentrations observed in phytoplankton and the lower in fish species and frogs. This is the first study reporting microcystin accumulation in the body of the freshwater shrimp Atyaephyra desmsaresti, in the brain of the fish species common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and in the skin of the frog Rana epirotica. Although there was no evidence for microcystin biomagnification, the fact that microcystins were found in lake water and in the tissues of aquatic organisms, suggests that serious risks to animal and public health are possible to occur. In addition, it is likely to be unsafe to consume aquatic species harvested in Lake Pamvotis due to the high-concentrations of accumulated microcystins.

A biological and chemical approach to restoring water quality: A case study in an urban eutrophic pond	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Efforts to improve water quality of eutrophic ponds often involve implementing changes to watershed management practices to reduce external nutrient loads. While this is required for long-term recovery and prevention, eutrophic conditions are often sustained through the recycling of internal nutrients already present within the waterbody. In particular, internal phosphorus bound to organic material and adsorbed to sediment has the potential to delay lake recovery for decades. Thus, pond and watershed management techniques are needed that not only reduce external nutrient loading but also mitigate the effects of internal nutrients already present. Therefore, our objective was to demonstrate a biological and chemical approach to remove and sequester nutrients present and entering an urban retention pond. A novel biological and chemical management technique was designed by constructing a 37 m(2) (6.1 m x 6.1 m) floating treatment wetland coupled with a slow-release lanthanum composite inserted inside an airlift pump. The floating treatment wetland promoted microbial denitrification and plant uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus, while the airlift pump slowly released lanthanum to the water column over the growing season to reduce soluble reactive phosphorus. The design was tested at the microcosm and field scales, where nitrate-N and phosphate-P removal from the water column was significant (alpha = 0.05) at the microcosm scale and observed at the field scale. Two seasons of field sampling showed both nitrate-N and phosphate-P concentrations were reduced from 50 mu g L-1 in 2020 to < 10 mu g L(-1 )in 2021. Load calculations of incoming nitrate-N and phosphate-P entering the retention pond from the surrounding watershed indicate the presented biological-chemical treatment is sustainable and will minimize the effects of nutrient loading from nonpoint source pollution.

We investigated the bioaccumulation of eight metal(loid)s (As, Co, Cu, Hg, Mn, Pb, Se, and Zn) in three size categories of planktonic organisms - seston (0.7-64 mu m), mesozooplankton (200-500 mu m), and macrozooplankton (> 500 mu m) - sampled from six freshwater lakes in two seasons in the Yangtze River Delta, China. Our results highlight phytoplankton biomass is the major driver on metal(loid) bioaccumulation in the studied anthropogenic-impacted subtropical lakes, mainly via affecting site-specific water physiochemical characteristics and plankton communities. However, such impact is highly dependent on chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration. The bioaccumulation of metal(loid)s in size-fractionated plankton declined significantly with increasing phytoplankton biomass when Chl-a was below-50 mu g L-1, mainly owing to the reduced metal(loid) bioavailability and subsequent bioaccumulation at more productive sites (with elevated pH and dissolved organic carbon), rather than algal bloom dilution. To a lesser extent, phytoplankton growth dilution and the smaller body-size of zooplankton at more productive sites also contributed to the lower metal(loid) bioaccumulation. The bioaccumulation of metal(loid)s was enhanced under severe algal bloom conditions (when Chl-a concentration was higher than-50 mu g L-1). Although the underlying mechanisms still require further investigations, the potential risks of metal(loid) bioaccumulation under severe algal bloom conditions deserve special attention.					; Kainz, Martin/AAG-6268-2021	Kainz, Martin/0000-0002-2388-1504; Wang, Rui/0000-0002-1131-6030; Zheng, Siwen/0000-0003-0862-2827													0043-1354	1879-2448				OCT 1	2022	224								119075	10.1016/j.watres.2022.119075	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.119075		SEP 2022						36116191					WOS:000861750600003

The concentrations of MCs in P. rubescens and various zooplanktonic taxa (filter-feeders and predators) were assessed in different water strata (epi-, meta- and hypolimnion) using replicated sampling over a 24-hour survey. The presence of P. rubescens in the gut content of various zooplanktonic taxa (Daphnia, Bosmina and Chaoborus) was verified by targeting the cyanobacterial nucleic adds (DNA). These results highlighted that cyanobacterial cells constitute a part of food resource for herbivorous zooplanktonic taxa during metalimnic bloom periods. Furthermore, presence of MCs in Chaoborus larvae highlighted the trophic transfer of MCs between herbivorous zooplankton and their invertebrate predators. Our results suggest that zooplanktonic herbivores by diel vertical migration (DVM) act as vectors of MCs by encapsulating grazed cyanobacteria. As a consequence, they largely contribute to the contamination of zooplanktonic predators, and in fine of zooplanktivorous whitefish. Indeed, we estimated the relative contribution of three preys of the whitefish (i.e. Daphnia, Bosmina and Chaoborus) to diet contamination. We showed that Chaoborus and Daphnia were the highest contributor as MC vectors in the whitefish diet (74.6 and 20.5% of MC-LR equivalent concentrations, respectively). The transfer of MCs across the different trophic compartments follows complex trophic pathways involving various trophic levels whose relative importance in fish contamination might vary at daily and seasonal scale.

The Hill of Six Lakes revisited: new data and re-evaluation of a key Pleistocene Amazon site	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The new analyses of a sedimentary record of Lake Pata in the Hill of Six Lakes, in NW Amazon and its correlation with other Quaternary proxy records in the region provide new insights regarding the vegetation and climate of the lowland forest during the Last Glacial. Despite what has been reported previously in the literature, the sedimentary and pollen records are not continuous. The hill remained forested; however, clear signals of structural change are seen in the record, which indicate that the area experienced a significantly drier climate during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The herbs and taxa that are known to be more dominant in seasonally dry forests were all more abundant during the glacial part of the record, and the cool-adapted elements were mixed with warm lowland elements, which indicates a temperature depression. A comparison of the palaeoecological data with other regional geoenvironmental records of the Upper Negro River basin and other areas of the Amazon provides additional support for a cooler and more seasonal environment during the middle Pleniglacial, which then became drier during the LGM. A "wet" LGM is strongly refuted; therefore, the palaeoclimatic and ecological models that used the previous proxy data from Six Lakes to sustain "wet" conditions and a "continuous forest record" during the LGM to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental conditions in the Amazon should be reviewed.

The sampling was conducted in dry and rainy seasons during 2012. Water samples were collected from 8 stations along the river and analyzed using standard methods. The results showed that temperature, pH, conductivity, TDS, SO4, and TH were classified as class I, while DO, turbidity, and BOD were categorized under class II, and NH3-N, TSS, COD, and OG were categorized as class III based on NWQS, Malaysia. Moreover, NO3 was classified under class IV, while PO4 and FC were categorized as class V and exceeded the allowable threshold levels. Therefore, the river was slightly polluted with NH3-N, TSS, COD, and NO3, whereas it is extremely contaminated with PO4 and FC. Furthermore, cluster analysis classified 8 sampling stations into three clusters based on similarities of water quality features. Furthermore, factor analysis of the water quality datasets generated three factors with total variance of 94.05% and pointed out that water quality deterioration in the river was associated with industrial and agricultural activities, livestock farming, and erosion. Therefore, the river water can be used for irrigation with precaution but extensive treatment needed before using for domestic purposes.

In this study, an analysis of Water Pollution Index (WPI), Daniel Trend Test, Cluster Analysis and Discriminant Analysis are applied as an integrated approach to quantitatively explore the spatial and temporal variations and the latent sources of water pollution in the Shanchong River basin, Northwest Basin of Lake Fuxian, China. We group all field surveys into 2 clusters (dry season and rainy season). Moreover, 14 sampling sites have been grouped into 3 clusters for the rainy season (highly polluted, moderately polluted and less polluted sites) and 2 clusters for the dry season (highly polluted and less polluted sites) based on their similarities and the level of pollution during the two seasons. The results show that the main trend of pollution was aggravated during the transition from the dry to the rainy season. The Water Pollution Index of Total Nitrogen is the highest of all pollution parameters, whereas the Chemical Oxygen Demand (Chromium) is the lowest. Our results also show that the main sources of pollution are farming activities alongside the Shanchong River, soil erosion and fish culture at Shanchong River reservoir area and domestic sewage from scattered rural residential area. Our results suggest that strategies to prevent water pollutionat the Shanchong River basin need to focus on non-point pollution control by employing appropriate fertilizer formulas in farming, and take the measures of soil and water conservation at Shanchong reservoir area, and purifying sewage from scattered villages.					wang, quan/GXG-6960-2022; , 吴老师/AAW-9978-2020; Wang, Quan/GXG-6960-2022	Wang, Quan/0000-0002-3559-4932													1932-6203					APR 2	2015	10	4							e0118590	10.1371/journal.pone.0118590	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0118590								25837673					WOS:000352139000004

Water-table height and microtopography control biogeochemical cycling in an Arctic coastal tundra ecosystem	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Drained thaw lake basins (DTLB's) are the dominant land form of the Arctic Coastal Plain in northern Alaska. The presence of continuous permafrost prevents drainage and so water tables generally remain close to the soil surface, creating saturated, suboxic soil conditions. However, ice wedge polygons produce microtopographic variation in these landscapes, with raised areas such as polygon rims creating more oxic microenvironments. The peat soils in this ecosystem store large amounts of organic carbon which is vulnerable to loss as arctic regions continue to rapidly warm, and so there is great motivation to understand the controls over microbial activity in these complex landscapes. Here we report the effects of experimental flooding, along with seasonal and spatial variation in soil chemistry and microbial activity in a DTLB. The flooding treatment generally mirrored the effects of natural landscape variation in water-table height due to microtopography. The flooded portion of the basin had lower dissolved oxygen, lower oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and higher pH, as did lower elevation areas throughout the entire basin. Similarly, soil pore water concentrations of organic carbon and aromatic compounds were higher in flooded and low elevation areas. Dissolved ferric iron (Fe(III)) concentrations were higher in low elevation areas and responded to the flooding treatment in low areas, only. The high concentrations of soluble Fe(III) in soil pore water were explained by the presence of siderophores, which were much more concentrated in low elevation areas. All the aforementioned variables were correlated, showing that Fe(III) is solubilized in response to anoxic conditions. Dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations were higher in low elevation areas, but showed only subtle and/or seasonally dependent effects of flooding. In anaerobic laboratory incubations, more CH4 was produced by soils from low and flooded areas, whereas anaerobic CO2 production only responded to flooding in high elevation areas. Seasonal changes in the oxidation state of solid phase Fe minerals showed that net Fe reduction occurred, especially in topographically low areas. The effects of Fe reduction were also seen in the topographic patterns of pH, as protons were consumed where this process was prevalent. This suite of results can all be attributed to the effect of water table on oxygen availability: flooded conditions promote anoxia, stimulating dissolution and reduction of Fe(III), and to some extent, methanogenesis. However, two lines of evidence indicated the inhibition of methanogenesis by alternative e- acceptors such as Fe(III) and humic substances: (1) ratios of CO2:CH4 evolved from anaerobic soil incubations and dissolved in soil pore water were high; (2) CH4 concentrations were negatively correlated with the oxidation state of the soluble Fe pool in both topographically high and low areas. A second set of results could be explained by increased soil temperature in the flooding treatment, which presumably arose from the increased thermal conductivity of the soil surface: higher N mineralization rates and dissolved P concentrations were observed in flooded areas. Overall, these results could have implications for C and nutrient cycling in high Arctic areas where warming and flooding are likely consequences of climate change.

The multitude of indicators currently used in biomonitoring lacks consistency and thus constrains the comparability of assessments at an international scale. Therefore, there is an argument to define and validate metrics with more universal application that can be applied EU-wide. We explored two metrics based on macrophyte taxonomic composition, the empirically based Intercalibration Common Metric for lake macrophytes (ICMLM) and the expert-based Ellenberg Index (EI), for their ability to detect eutrophication in different types of European lowland lakes. Data from 1474 unique lake-years from 11 countries were used to explore relationships between these metrics and the seasonal mean concentration of total phosphorus (TP) using linear regression. ICMLM gave a linear and relatively strong (R = 0.72, p < 0.0001) response over the entire spectrum of TP concentrations, whereas EI performed best in lakes with the TP concentrations up to 250 mu g L-1 (R = 0.64, p < 0.0001) and was largely insensitive to higher phosphorus concentrations. Both metrics performed better in Nordic lakes than in the Central-Baltic ones. The responses of both metrics to TP were not modified or only very weakly modified by altitude, lake size and mean depth but were significantly affected by alkalinity. The ICMLM-TP relationship was stronger in lakes with water alkalinity > 0.2 meq L-1 and significantly weaker in less buffered lakes. EI performed better in lakes with alkalinity <1.0 meq L-1, whereas in high alkalinity lakes the response was significantly weaker. In all the lakes and in lakes from all the size, depth and alkalinity types, ICMLM was more strongly correlated with TP than EI and was proportionally less sensitive to alkalinity. We also tested the effect of including helophytes on the metric response to eutrophication pressure by comparing the strength of the relationships to TP of the Ellenberg Index calculated firstly using only hydrophyte taxa (EI'(HYDR)) and secondly using all macrophyte taxa including both hydrophytes and emergent vegetation (EI'(TOT)). The differences in metric performance in all the lakes and all the size, depth and alkalinity types, except for the Nordic lakes, were non-significant. Thus, including helophytes generally did not significantly improve the strength of the EI-TP relationships. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Engdaw, F; Hein, T; Beneberu, G				Engdaw, Flipos; Hein, Thomas; Beneberu, Getachew			Heavy Metal Distribution in Surface Water and Sediment of Megech River, a Tributary of Lake Tana, Ethiopia	SUSTAINABILITY												Excess heavy metal concentrations caused by severe anthropogenic activities are among the major threats of aquatic pollution in developing countries like Ethiopia. So far, there is limited information regarding concentrations of selected toxic heavy metals in the freshwater bodies of northern Ethiopian highlands. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the current status and spatial distributions of heavy metals in water and sediment samples of the Megech River located in the North Gondar zone of the Amhara region from November 2018 to January 2019. Six different sampling sites (M1-M6) were identified based on the anthropogenic influence. A total of 30 water and 30 sediment samples were collected along the course of the river. Results revealed that concentrations of Cu (0.11 to 0.17 mg L-1), Zn (0.11 to 0.16 mg L-1) and Cr (0.03-0.05 mg L-1) in the water were within international guidelines for domestic use. In the sediment, maximum concentrations of heavy metals detected at site M2 were within the recommended sediment quality guideline for aquatic systems. Generally, higher concentrations of heavy metals were observed at sites with higher anthropogenic activity (M2). Therefore, continuous monitoring and seasonal studies with representative samples including benthic organisms and macrophytes are needed to quantify the impact on downstream sections.

Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were measured for Lake Michigan salmonines and their prey collected from 2014 to 2016. Bayesian ellipse and mixing model analyses were used to quantify isotopic niche characteristics and diets, respectively, among species and years. During the 3-year study period, abundance and size structure of preferred alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) prey changed substantially and offered an opportunity to explore predator isotopic niche response and diet shifts along a prey resource gradient. Results suggested increased reliance on alewives, especially small alewives, over the study period and were consistent with greater availability of this prey. However, differential use of alewife size classes and alternative prey sources by salmonine predators was apparent, which suggested possible resource partitioning. Characterization of ecological niche overlap using stable isotopes likely requires consideration of shared resource availability as well as specific prey and habitat preferences.					; Kornis, Matt/GRF-0356-2022; Happel, Austin/AAE-8165-2020	Hook, Tomas/0000-0001-9185-6741; Leonhardt, Benjamin/0000-0002-7140-4227; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				MAR	2022	79	3					487	502		10.1139/cjfas-2021-0027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2021-0027													WOS:000761477200010

However, the main types of fluoroquinolones present in aquaculture systems have not been determined. The objectives of the present study were to explore the occurrence of residual fluoroquinolone antibiotics in fish muscle tissues sampled from across the entire aquaculture season in the Tai Lake basin in China and to assess the dietary risks associated with the upcoming vendible fish in the last month of the aquaculture season. Fluoroquinolones were detected in 95.69% of all fish samples, and the concentrations ranged from the limit of quantification (LOQ) to 47 108.00g<bold>kg</bold>-1. Enrofloxacin contributed the most among the 9 fluoroquinolone antibiotics tested. Of the 4 fish species studied, enrofloxacin was present in bream at significant (p<0.05) concentrations in August, with an average value of 321.45g<bold>kg</bold>-1, while enrofloxacin concentrations peaked in crab and shrimp in September, with average values of 6949.60 and 460.82g<bold>kg</bold>-1, respectively. However, different patterns were observed in perch, suggesting that other categories of antibiotics may be used in the production of this fish. Dietary risk assessment showed that the residual levels and estimated daily intake in bream, perch, and shrimp were far below the maximum residual level and acceptable daily intake. However, the average residual level in crab exceeded the maximum residual level, and the estimated daily intake value accounted for 78.49% of the acceptable daily intake, indicating potential consumption risk. In summary, the present study aims to guide the production and consumption of aquatic products. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017;36:2899-2905.

Bio-accumulation of lanthanum from lanthanum modified bentonite treatments in lake restoration	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Lanthanum (La) modified bentonite (LMB) is one of the available mitigating agents used for the reduction of the phosphorus (P) recycling in eutrophic lakes. The potential toxicity of the La from LMB to aquatic organisms is a matter of concern. In this study the accumulation of La was investigated in the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii, in chironomid larvae and in several fish species during periods up to five years following in situ LMB applications. The application of LMB increased the La concentration of exposed plants and animals. During the first growing season following LMB applications, the La content of E. nuttallii increased 78 fold (3.98-310.68 mu g La g(-1) DW) to 127 fold (2.46-311.44 mu g La g(-1)). During the second growing season following application, the La content decreased but was still raised compared to plants that had not been exposed. The La content of chironomids was doubled in the two years following LMB application, although the increase was not significant. Raised La concentrations in fish liver, bone, muscle and skin were observed two and five years following to LMB application. Liver tissues showed the highest La increase, ranging from 6 fold (0.046-0.285 mu g La g(-1) DW) to similar to 20 fold (0.080-1.886 mu g La g(-1), and 0.122-2.109 mu g La g(-1)) two years following application and from 6 fold (0.046-0.262 mu g La g(-1)) to 13 fold (0.013-0.167 mu g La g(-1)) after five years in pelagic and littoral fish. The La content of the liver from Anguilla anguilla (eel) had increased 94 fold (0.034-3.176 mu g La g(-1)) two years and 133 fold (0.034 -4.538 mu g La g(-1)) five years following LMB application. No acute and chronic effects of La accumulation were observed and human health risks are considered negligible. We advocate the long-term study of effects of La accumulation following future LMB applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Detecting Submesoscale Cold Filaments in a Basin-Scale Gyre in Large, Deep Lake Geneva (Switzerland/France)	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Submesoscale filaments are a well-documented feature of oceanic flow fields. Based on the analysis of high-resolution 3D numerical simulations, field observations, and remote sensing imagery, this study, carried out in Lake Geneva, Western Europe's largest lake, provides for the first time evidence that submesoscale filaments also exist in a lake. Field observations confirm that submesoscale, cold-water filaments are formed at the edges and in the center of a counterclockwise rotating large-scale gyre during summertime above the thermocline, as indicated by 3D numerical simulation results and remote sensing. Cold submesoscale filaments were well-developed with sharp lateral temperature gradients (similar to 1-2 degrees C) during summertime. Locally, these filaments can significantly increase the depth of the upper mixed layer when a relatively strong thermocline exists in the near-surface layers and cause upward and downward vertical velocities comparable to those reported for oceanic filaments. Plain Language Summary Remote sensing images and numerical simulations show that in the oceans, submesoscale elongated or curved filaments are trapped within larger rotating currents. Filaments have physical properties that are different than neighboring water masses, and can significantly impact biological-physical processes in oceans. Geostrophic/quasi-geostrophic gyres, that is, large-scale rotating surface currents, have also been observed in large lakes. However, the existence and role submesoscale filaments play in lakes has not been documented. In a novel approach, we combined remote sensing, numerical simulations, and field observations and could confirm the presence of submesoscale filaments in Lake Geneva, the largest lake in Western Europe. Due to its size, Lake Geneva exhibits a rich diversity of both counterclockwise and clockwise rotating basin-scale gyres containing filaments. Field observations confirmed that such submesoscale features are formed at the edges and in the center of a large-scale counterclockwise rotating gyre located in the widest part (14 km) of Lake Geneva during summertime. During this season, the upper mixed layer of the lake is relatively shallow with a strong thermocline below. The mixed layer depth is found to locally increase due to the presence of cold-water filaments.

Mathias; Sanchez-Perez, Jose Miguel			Assessment of suspended sediment load variability in the Tonle Sap and Lower Mekong Rivers, Cambodia	CATENA												The Mekong River in Southeast Asia, one of the world's great rivers, has been facing disruption of its sediment balance and resultant impacts on nutrient fluxes, aquatic ecology, floodplains and the delta. Using monitoring data from 1993 to 2018, we estimated the temporal variability of sediment loads in Tonle Sap and Lower Mekong Rivers in Cambodia, assessing the sediment linkage between the Tonle Sap Lake and the Mekong mainstem, which are connected by a seasonally reversing flow through the Tonle Sap River. We estimated the annual sediment in the Mekong mainstem of 72 +/- 38 Mt/year at Kratie (upstream) and 78 +/- 22 Mt/year at Chroy Changvar from 1993 to 2018 (just upstream of the Chatumuk confluence). Our sediment load estimation of the Mekong River is consistent with other recent estimates of sediment load on the Lower Mekong. However, the result is lower than reported in some older studies (prior to the 2000s), which is consistent with sediment trapping by dams on Upper Mekong mainstem and major tributaries. Our analysis indicates that Tonle Sap Lake provided 0.65 +/- 0.6 Mt/year of sediment annually to the Lower Mekong River from 1995 to 2000. However, since 2001, Tonle Sap Lake has become a sink for sediment, accumulating an average of 1.35 +/- 0.7 Mt annually. Net storage of sediment in Tonle Sap Lake reduces the annual sediment transport to the delta, further compounding the effects of reduced sediment delivery to the delta resulting from upstream dam development and instream sand mining.					; SANCHEZ PEREZ, Jose/O-7198-2014; SOK, Ty/HKW-6412-2023; sauvage, sabine/P-1742-2015	Kondolf, G.Mathias/0000-0001-5639-9995; SOK, Ty/0000-0001-7185-698X; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				JUL	2021	202								105291	10.1016/j.catena.2021.105291	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105291		MAR 2021											WOS:000643594100052

Distributed discharge and sediment concentration predictions in the sub-humid Ethiopian highlands: the Debre Mawi watershed	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Experimental research in the Ethiopian highlands found that saturation excess induced runoff and erosion are common in the sub-humid conditions. Because most erosion simulation models applied in the highlands are based on infiltration excess, we, as an alternative, developed the Parameter Efficient Distributed (PED) model, which can simulate water and sediment fluxes in landscapes with saturation excess runoff. The PED model has previously only been tested at the outlet of a watershed and not for distributed runoff and sediment concentration within the watershed. In this study, we compare the distributed storm runoff and sediment concentration of the PED model against collected data in the 95-ha Debre Mawi watershed and three of its nested sub-watersheds for the 2010 and 2011 rainy seasons. In the PED model framework, the hydrology of the watershed is divided between infiltrating and runoff zones, with erosion only taking place from two surface runoff zones. Daily storm runoff and sediment concentration values, ranging from 0.5 to over 30mm and from 0.1 to 35gl(-1), respectively, were well simulated. The Nash Sutcliffe efficiency values for the daily storm runoff for outlet and sub-watersheds ranged from 0.66 to 0.82, and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency for daily sediment concentrations were greater than 0.78. Furthermore, the model uses realistic fractional areas for surface and subsurface flow contributions, for example between saturated areas (15%), degraded areas (30%) and permeable areas (55%) at the main outlet, while close similarity was found for the remaining hydrology and erosion parameter values. One exception occurred for the distinctly greater transport limited parameter at the actively gullying lower part of the watershed. The results suggest that the model based on saturation excess provides a good representation of the observed spatially distributed runoff and sediment concentrations within a watershed by modelling the bottom lands (as opposed to the uplands) as the dominant contributor of the runoff and sediment load.

However, refilling the rivers with reclaimed water may result in groundwater pollution. A three-year field monitoring program was conducted to assess the effect of a riverbank filtration (RBF) system on the removal of nitrogen and organics from the Qingyang River of Beijing, which is replenished with reclaimed water. Water samples from the river, sediment, and groundwater were collected for NO3-N, NH4-N, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) was measured. The results indicate that about 85% of NO3-N was removed from the riverbed sediments. Approximate 92% of NH4-N was removed during the infiltration of water from river to aquifer. On average, 54% of COD was removed by RBF. The attenuation of NO3-N through RBF to the groundwater varied among seasons and was strongly related to water temperature. On the other hand, no obvious temporal variability was identified in the removal of COD. These results suggest that the RBF system is an effective barrier against NO3-N, NH4-N and COD in the Qingyang River, as well as those rivers with similar geological and climatic conditions refilled with reclaimed water.

Hasibur; Chen, Zhongbing; Zhai, Jun			Methane emission from water level fluctuation zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir: Seasonal variation and microbial mechanism	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Periodic and significant water level fluctuations within the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) create a complex water level fluctuation zone (WLFZ) that can significantly influence greenhouse gas emissions. However, the scarcity of comprehensive studies investigating long-term monitoring and analysis of CH4 flux patterns and underlying mechanisms concerning water level variations, environmental characteristics, and microbial communities has limited our understanding. This study conducted a four-year monitoring campaign to examine in situ CH4 emissions from three representative sampling sites. Results indicated that the CH4 flux remained relatively stable at lower water levels, specifically at the control site (S1). However, water level fluctuations significantly influenced CH4 emissions at the sampling sites situated within the WLFZ. Notably, the highest CH4 flux of 0.252 +/- 0.089 mg/(m2 center dot h) was observed during the drying period (June to August), while the lowest CH4 flux of 0.048 +/- 0.026 mg/(m2 center dot h) was recorded during the flooding period. Moreover, CH4 emissions through the water-air interface surpassed those through the soil-air interface. The CH4 flux positively correlated with organic carbon, temperature, and soil moisture. The relative abundance of methane metabolism microorganisms peaked during the drying period and decreased during the impounding and flooding periods. The primary methanogenesis pathway was hydrogenotrophic, whereas methanotrophic processes were mainly aerobic, with Ca. Methylomirabilis governing the anaerobic methanotrophic process. Overall, the current findings serve as crucial theoretical references for understanding CH4 emissions and carbon metabolism processes within WLFZ environments.

Recent studies have focused on understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of water conditions using long-term data series. In this study, water conditions of Lake Taihu during non-cyanobacterial/cyanobacterial growth periods were assessed based on water quality index (WQI), trophic level index (TLI), chlorophyll a concentration, and algal density; the spatio-temporal changes in water quality were quantified, and their corresponding driving forces were discussed. The study employed water quality data from 2013 to 2018 and algal density data from 2013 to 2017. The results revealed that the water conditions varied over the years; it was the poorest in 2013, improved slightly in 2014, deteriorated during 2015-2017, and improved again in 2018. Slow algal growth was observed from May to July, which accelerated from August-September. The TLI in Lake Taihu may increase due to significant inflow during wet years, which may increase the eutrophication area and algae density in the following year, necessitating extreme caution. The northwestern part of Lake Taihu exhibited a lower WQI and higher TLI than its southeastern part. In the bays with high TLI, the WQI during the cyanobacterial growth period was lower than the non-cyanobacterial growth period; the converse was observed in bays with low TLI. The results of this study imply that water conditions of Lake Taihu could be enhanced by reducing the nutrient load in wet seasons and wet years and improving the hydrodynamic conditions through water diversion, especially in Zhushan and Meiliang bays.

In this study, we investigated the spatial-temporal variations of eutrophication parameters (secchi depth, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll-a, trophic level index, and trophic state index) and their relationships with lake morphology, watershed land use, and socioeconomic factors in the Yunnan Plateau lakes. Discussion Results indicated that about 77.8% of lakes were eutrophic according to trophic state index. The plateau lakes showed spatial variations in water quality and could be classified into high-nutrient and low-nutrient groups. However, because watersheds were dominated by vegetation, all eutrophication parameters except chlorophyll-a showed no significant differences between the wet and dry seasons. Lake depth, water residence time, volume, and percentage of built-up land were significantly related to several eutrophication parameters. Agricultural land use and social-economic factors had no significant correlation with all eutrophication parameters. Stepwise regression analyses demonstrated that lake depth and water residence time accounted for 73.8% to 87.6% of the spatial variation of single water quality variables, respectively. Redundancy analyses indicated that lake morphology, watershed land use, and socioeconomic factors together explained 74.3% of the spatial variation in overall water quality. The results imply that water quality degradation in the plateau lakes may be mainly due to the domestic and industrial wastewaters. This study will improve our understanding of the determinants of lake water quality and help to design efficient strategies for controlling eutrophication in the plateau region.

Whereas NPF has been shown to occur relatively frequently at several sites in Scandinavia, it was found to be nearly absent at a mid-continental site in Siberia. To explore this issue further, we made measurements of aerosol size distributions between 10 and 420 nm diameter at two remote sites in the transition region between temperate and boreal forest in British Columbia, Canada. The measurements covered 23 d during the month of June 2019, at the time when NPF typically reaches its seasonal maximum in remote midlatitude regions. These are the first such measurements in a near-pristine region on the North American continent. Although the sites were only 150 km apart, there were clear differences in NPF frequency and intensity between them. At the Eagle Lake site, NPF occurred daily, and nucleation-mode particle concentrations reached above 5000 cm(-3). In contrast, at the Nazko River site, there were only six NPF events in 11 d, and the nucleation-mode particle concentrations only reached about 800 cm(-3). The reasons for this difference could not be conclusively resolved with the available data; they may include air mass origins, preexisting aerosols, and the density and type of forest cover in the surrounding regions. In contrast to observations in other temperate and boreal environments, we found that NPF at our sites occurred at nighttime just as frequently as during daytime. Together with the lack of identifiable sources of sulfuric acid precursor species in the fetch region of our sites, this suggests that nucleation of extremely low volatility organics was the predominant NPF mechanism. Our results indicate that extended measurement campaigns with a more comprehensive set of instrumentation to investigate the role of NPF in the remote forest regions of North America are essential for a deeper scientific understanding of this important process and its role in the global aerosol budget.

Current Magnitude and Mechanisms of Groundwater Discharge in the Arctic: Case Study from Alaska	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												To better understand groundwater surface water dynamics in high latitude areas, we conducted a field study at three sites in Alaska with varying permafrost coverage. The natural groundwater tracer (Rn-222 radon) was used to evaluate groundwater discharge, and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was used to examine subsurface mixing dynamics. Different controls govern groundwater discharge at these sites. In areas with sporadic permafrost (Kasitsna Bay), the major driver of submarine groundwater discharge is tidal pumping, due to the large tidal oscillations, whereas at Point Barrow, a site with continuous permafrost and small tidal amplitudes, fluxes are mostly affected by seasonal permafrost thawing. Extended areas of low resistivity in the subsurface alongshore combined with high radon in surface water suggests that groundwater surface water interactions might enhance heat transport into deeper permafrost layers promoting permafrost thawing, thereby enhancing groundwater discharge.

Relationship among physicochemical conditions, chlorophyll-a concentration, and water level in a tropical river-floodplain system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The free-flowing Usumacinta River maintains an average annual water-level fluctuation of 6.7m. This study evaluated relationships between 14 physicochemical and biological variables and key factors in four water-level conditions in a river-floodplain system. The analysis incorporated intra-annual variation in all variables, with each selected in accordance with multiple statistical and physicochemical criteria. Possible correlations were examined as a function of various physicochemical and biological factors at each water level. Within the study area, defined by a temporal gradient in principal component 1, the yearly river overflow above the bankfull stage is characterized by water with a low level of total suspended solids. Data on riverine wetlands suggest that seasonal changes are key to determining intra- and inter-annual chlorophyll-a levels and water clarity. However, opposite trends are observed for high and low water-level conditions. Nutrient enrichment cannot be taken as the key physicochemical factor of water level, under either water-level conditions, due to the lack of a temporal gradient in principal component 2 and the high biochemical variability of nitrate and orthophosphate levels. In conclusion, the hypothesis was accepted for the production of phytoplankton biomass and light attenuation at low and high water levels, as both were dependent on intra-annual changes. The increases in chlorophyll-a related to the minimal variability at the lowest water level open the opportunity to gauge this relationship as a possible environmental predictor for river-floodplain systems.

J	Longley, KR; Huang, WR; Clark, C; Johnson, E				Longley, Kenya Rolle; Huang, Wenrui; Clark, Clayton; Johnson, Elijah			Effects of nutrient load from St. Jones River on water quality and eutrophication in Lake George, Florida	LIMNOLOGICA												Nutrient contamination in surface waters can pose a health risk for humans and aquatic life. The influx of Nitrogen and Phosphorus can cause an increase in algal blooms resulting in eutrophication of the water body. Eutrophication describes the trophic state or the health of a water body as it relates to the level of algae biomass. Water quality for this research is represented by the presence of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) which is an indicator of the activity within the water body. In this study, trophic state analysis and relations between Chl-a and nutrients in Lake George, Florida, have been conducted. Three zones within Lake George are established to prepare a succinct analysis of the existing monthly and seasonal averages across the water body. Statistical analyses, including multiple regression analysis, were used in this study to establish the relationship between Chl-a and nutrients, Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP). Traditional single-variable regression analysis shows good correlations between the Chl-a and TN loading and poor relationship with TP, which indicate that TN loading is the controlling factor. Single-variable regression was also used to compare the inlet load contributions to the lake loading which was found to be conclusive. Multivariate regression analysis for all three zones were conducted to obtain acceptable to good relationship between Chl-a and nutrient (TN, TP) with the monthly R values for zones 1, 2, 3, are 0.72, 0.82, and 0.80 respectively, indicating nutrient is the dominant factor for eutrophication in the lake. Multivariate regression equations between Chl-a and nutrient (TN,TP) were used to investigate scenarios to reduce nutrient load at the inlet so as to control Chl-a concentrations in the lake to avoid eutrophic conditions. It was found that the TN inlet loading would have to be reduced by more than 75% for zone 1, 65% in zone 2 and less than 25% for zone 3 in order to not exceed the current EPA approved numeric criteria for Florida Lakes. It was also determined that both TN and TP concentrations are co-limiting in the lake based on Carlson's criteria. Assessments by both Trophic State Index (TSI) method and Total Nutrient Status Index (TNI) methods indicate eutrophic conditions in the lake under current conditions.																			0075-9511	1873-5851				JUL	2019	77								125687	10.1016/j.limno.2019.125687	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2019.125687													WOS:000485794700006
J	Heng, K; Chevalier, M; Lek, S; Laffaille, P				Heng, Kong; Chevalier, Mathieu; Lek, Sovan; Laffaille, Pascal			Seasonal variations in diet composition, diet breadth and dietary overlap between three commercially important fish species within a flood-pulse system: The Tonle Sap Lake (Cambodia)	PLOS ONE												Tropical lakes and their associated floodplain habitats are dynamic habitat mosaics strongly influenced by seasonal variations in hydrologic conditions. In flood-pulse systems, water level oscillations directly influence the connectivity to floodplain habitats for fish. Here, we aimed to investigate whether seasonal changes in the water level of a flood-pulse system (the Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia) differentially affect diet breadth and dietary overlap of three common and commercially important fish species (Anabas testudineus, Boesemania microplepis and Notopterus notopterus) presenting important differences in their life-cycle (e.g. seasonal migration). For this purpose, the three fish species were sampled at four locations spread over the lake and their stomach contents extracted for analyses. Dietary differences were investigated across seasons regarding the diet composition and diet breadth of each species as well as the amount of dietary overlap between species. We found that the proportion of empty stomachs changed similarly across seasons for the three species, thus suggesting that ecological differences between species are not sufficient to outweigh the effect of seasonal variations in resource abundance. In contrast, changes in diet composition were species-specific and can be explained by ecological and behavioral differences between species. Diet breadth differed between species in all seasons, except during the wet season, and tended to be higher during the dry season when dietary overlap was the lowest. These variations likely result from changes in the diversity and amount of resources and may lead to habitat use shifts with potential implications for competitive interactions. In particular, increasing connectivity to floodplain habitats may reduce the competitive pressure during the wet season, while resource scarcity during the dry season may constrain individuals to diversify their diet to avoid competition. Overall, our results suggest a considerable plasticity in the feeding behavior of the three species as demonstrated by seasonal variation in both diet breadth and dietary overlap. Such variations can be explained by a number of factors and processes, including changes in resource availability or competitive interactions between individuals for resources, whose relative influence might vary depending on the magnitude and the timing of the flood-pulse driving the connectivity to floodplain habitats. Gaining knowledge on the seasonal evolution of fish's diet is relevant for fisheries management and conservation and our result could be used to guide aquaculture development in Cambodia.					; chevalier, mathieu/AAU-6540-2020	Chevalier, Mathieu/0000-0002-1170-5343; 													1932-6203					JUN 18	2018	13	6							e0198848	10.1371/journal.pone.0198848	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198848								29912953					WOS:000435528600054

J	Martin, HA				Martin, H. A.			Cenozoic climatic change and the development of the arid vegetation in Australia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Australia has not always been arid, and the central desert was once well watered. This paper traces the changes in climate and vegetation, leading to the present aridity. At the beginning of the Cenozoic, continental Australia had a warm and humid climate, and the vegetation was mainly meso-micro-thermal (warm to cool temperate) rainforest. Central Australia experienced seasonal rainfall and there may have been limited aridity in the northwest. By the mid-late Eocene, rainforest in central Australia was restricted to the well-watered valley bottoms, with sclerophyll vegetation on the slopes and ridges. In the latest Eocene-earliest Oligocene, there was an abrupt cooling of ocean waters and the diversity of megathermal angiosperms decreased. The early-mid-Miocene was warm-humid and there was a considerable diversity of forest types. Woodlands and Casuarinaceae forests became more common. Central Australia was seasonal, with a very warm season of high evaporation. In Western Australia, regular flows in the palacodrainage systems had stopped by the mid-Miocene and this marked the first major step towards aridity. The late Miocene was cool and dry, with a major reduction of rainforests and an increase of Eucalyptus/casuarinaceous sclerophyll forests in inland southeastern Australia. Regular burning became a feature of the eucalypt forests. Rainforest persisted, however, along the east coast and highlands of Australia. Central Australia became more and with dry woodland and chenopod shrublands. Rainforests continued to decrease during the Pliocene and grasslands developed in central northern Australia. By the early Pleistocene, the modern climatic regime had been established, but precipitation was higher than today. Cycles of open, shrubland/grasslands/herbfields and wooded vegetation accompanied the and glacial and humid interglacial cycles (respectively). About 0.5 Ma, there was a change to a drier climate, but it was still wetter than today. The last glacial period was particularly harsh, and the present interglacial period is drier than the previous interglacial. Aridity has thus increased in a number of steps, following the first major step towards aridity in the early Miocene. Distinctive elements of the vegetation can be traced back to times when the and zone was humid and supported rainforest.

Previous studies have focused on exchange flux between the surface water and groundwater in seasonal lakes, but the process of solute transport at the sediment-water interface under the effect of seasonal water level fluctuations remains unclear. In this study, laboratory flume experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate non-reactive solute transport and exchange in a seasonal lake under effects of hydrological connectivity, water level amplitude, sediment permeability and solute source. The results show that the recharge pattern between seasonal lakes and rivers or main lakes is determined by the seasonal water level. The solute transports from the groundwater of seasonal lakes to the main lake during the dry season, while the reverse applies during the wet season. The perennial hydrological isolation increases the concentration in the overlying water and pore water of the seasonal lake by 20.5% and 28.7%, respectively. The solute concentration in the overlying water and pore water of the seasonal lake decreases by 55.2% and 51.5%, respectively, when solute source occurs in the main lake compared with that occurs in the seasonal lake. The amplification of water level amplitudes leads to an increase of 6.46% and 10.55% in the solute concentration drop from the overlying water, respectively. These findings contribute to improving water resource utilization and protecting aquatic ecological environment in floodplain systems. Floodplains are usually populated and economically developed. Rivers such as Amazon River or main lakes such as Poyang Lake in floodplain systems are surrounded by many seasonal lakes that are subjected to floodplain process. Seasonal lakes serve an important ecological function by providing habitat for water birds and fish. The transport of solute in the surface water and groundwater is an important factor affecting the ecology and environment of seasonal lakes. To investigate solute transport in seasonal lakes, laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to describe the entire process. We find that water from high-water lakes flows toward low-water lakes. The decreasing water level of rivers or main lakes in recent years may lead to more serious pollution in seasonal lakes. The solute source occurring in the seasonal lake is more serious than that in the main lake. A stronger flooding process causes solutes in seasonal lakes to transport more easily to groundwater. These findings provide theoretical basis for better management of floodplain systems. Seasonality changes the water level difference between seasonal lakes and rivers or main lakes and affects the recharge patternThe disconnection of the overlying water causes the solute to be more concentrated in permanently isolated seasonal lakesSolute retention is higher in seasonal lakes when solute source occurs in seasonal lakes compared with that occurs in rivers or main lakes					Jin, Guangqiu/B-2590-2012; Zhang, ZT/GQG-9530-2022; Si-Yi, Zhang/ISS-2652-2023	Zhang, Siyi/0000-0003-2096-087X; Zhang, ZhongTian/0000-0002-4899-074X; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				DEC	2023	59	12							e2023WR034739	10.1029/2023WR034739	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023WR034739													WOS:001114052500001

Traditional assessments of organic matter, such as chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), are often time-consuming. Alternatively, optical measurements of dissolved organic matter (DOM) offer a rapid and reliable means of obtaining organic matter composition data. Here we employed DOM optical measurements in conjunction with parallel factor analysis to scrutinize CODMn and BOD5 variability. Validation was performed using an independent dataset encompassing six lakes on the Yungui Plateau from 2014 to 2016 (n = 256). Leveraging multiple linear regressions (MLRs) applied to DOM absorbance at 254 nm (a(254)) and fluorescence components C1-C5, we successfully traced CODMn and BOD5 variations across the entire plateau (68 lakes, n = 271, R-2 > 0.8, P < 0.0001). Notably, DOM optical indices yielded superior estimates (higher R-2) of CODMn and BOD5 during the rainy season compared to the dry season and demonstrated increased accuracy (R-2 > 0.9) in mesotrophic lakes compared to oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes. This study underscores the utility of MLR-based DOM indices for inferring CODMn and BOD5 variability in plateau lakes and highlights the potential of integrating in situ and remote sensing platforms for water pollution early warning.(c) 2023 The Authors.

Thus, the coastal region is of great economic and nutritional importance. The current research study investigates the seasonal deviations in coastal water quality at four different locations along the Gulf of Khambhat, Gujarat, India, for three consecutive seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon). The coastal water samples were collected and analyzed for the water quality in the prescribed study area. As a result, sea surface temperature, salinity, pH, EC, alkalinity, turbidity, salinity, total suspended particles, dissolved oxygen, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, chloride, sulfate, and nutrients such as nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, and total organic carbon were investigated at Gulf of Khambhat Region. The samples were collected from four different locations (Ghogha, Dumas, Dahej, and Purna). The multivariate statistical analysis indicates that oxygen, dissolved solids, salinity, nutrients, the natural, and anthropogenic conditions are the major factor that affects water quality. The water quality index was calculated to evaluate the seasonal water quality of GoK. The results revealed that the quality of water was moderate in pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon. The findings suggest that anthropogenic disturbances and the development of a variety of activities with increased point and non-point stormwater runoff are pumped directly into the coastal areas which damaged water quality. Therefore, the outcomes of physicochemical research of water quality indicators may be a useful tool for government leaders trying to ensure GoK's long-term sustainability.

Tropical floodplains secure the protein supply of millions of people, but only sound management can ensure the long-term continuity of such ecosystem services. Overfishing is a widespread threat to multitrophic systems, but how it affects ecosystem functioning is poorly understood, particularly in tropical freshwater food webs. Models based on temperate lakes frequently assume that primary producers are mostly bottom-up controlled by nutrient and light limitations, with negligible effects of top-down forces. Yet this assumption remains untested in complex tropical freshwater systems experiencing marked spatiotemporal variation. 2. We use consolidated community-based fisheries management practices and spatial zoning to test the relative importance of bottom-up versus top-down drivers of phytoplankton biomass, controlling for the influence of local to landscape heterogeneity. Our study focuses on 58 large Amazonian floodplain lakes under different management regimes that resulted in a gradient of apex-predator abundance. These lakes, distributed along similar to 600 km of a major tributary of the Amazon River, varied widely in size, structure, landscape context, and hydrological seasonality. 3. Using generalised linear models, we show that community-based fisheries management, which controls the density of apex predators, is the strongest predictor of phytoplankton biomass during the dry season, when lakes become discrete landscape units. Water transparency also emerges as an important bottom-up factor, but phosphorus, nitrogen and several lake and landscape metrics had minor or no effects on phytoplankton biomass. During the wet-season food pulse, when lakes become connected to adjacent water bodies and homogenise the landscape, only lake depth explained phytoplankton biomass. 4. Synthesis and applications. Tropical freshwaters fisheries typically assume that fish biomass is controlled by bottom-up mechanisms, so that overexploitation of large predators would not affect overall ecosystem productivity. Our results, however, show that top-down forces are important drivers of primary productivity in tropical lakes, above and beyond the effects of bottom-up factors. This helps us to understand the enormous success of community-based 'fishing agreements' in the Amazon. Multiple stakeholders should embrace socio-ecological management practices that shape both bottom-up and top-down forces to ensure biodiversity protection, sustainable fisheries yields and food security for local communities and regional economies.

Palynological and paleobotanical investigations of Paleogene sections in the Maoming basin, South China	STRATIGRAPHY AND GEOLOGICAL CORRELATION												The complex paleobotanical investigations carried out in the Maoming sedimentary basin (Guangdong Province, South China) yielded first data on the taxonomic composition and ecological properties of two large paleofloras from the Youganwo and Huangniuling formations. The palynomorph assemblages from these formations indicate their middle-late Eocene age (Lutetian-Bartonian and Priabonian for the former and latter, respectively). It is shown that sediments of the Youganwo Formation were deposited in an intermittently swamped lacustrine-fluvial plain, which gave way to a freshwater lake. Vegetation of this period was represented by wet subtropical forests with evergreen Fagaceae, Lauraceae, and Palmae. The Huangniuling flora reflects the biome of seasonal tropical forests developed in a broad fluvial plain and its margins. The Eocene floras of the Maoming Basin are marked by the appearance of several recent plant genera, which is also evident from finds of remains of their reproductive structures. The Eocene flora from low latitudes of South China exhibits a notable share of floral elements from middle and high latitudes of East Asia.

Disruption of thyroxine and sex hormones by 1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2-dibromoethyl)cyclohexane (DBE-DBCH) in American kestrels (Falco sparverius) and associations with reproductive and behavioral changes	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												1,2-dibromo-4-(1,2-dibromoethyl)cyclohexane (DBE-DBCH-formerly TBECH) is an emerging brominated flame retardant (BFR) pollutant with androgen potentiating ability and other endocrine disrupting effects in birds and fish. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of exposure to environmentally-relevant levels of DBE-DBCH on circulating levels of thyroid and sex steroid hormones in American kestrels, and if hormonal concentrations were related to previously reported changes in reproductive success and courtship behaviors. Sixteen kestrel pairs were exposed to 0.239 ng beta-DBE-DBCH/g kestrel/day by diet, based on concentrations in wild bird eggs, from 4 weeks before pairing until the chicks hatched (mean 82 d), and were compared with vehicle-only exposed control pairs (n=15). As previously reported, DBE-DBCH concentrations were not detected in tissue or eggs of these birds, nor were any potential metabolites, despite the low method limits of detection (<= 0.4 ng/g wet weight), suggesting it may be rapidly metabolized and/or eliminated by the kestrels. Nevertheless, exposed kestrels demonstrated changes in reproduction and behavior, indicating an effect from exposure. During early breeding, males were sampled at multiple time points at pairing and during courtship and incubation; females were blood sampled at pairing only; both sexes were sampled at the end of the season. All comparisons are made to control males or control females, and the relative differences in hormone concentrations between treatment and control birds, calculated separately for each sex, are presented for each time point. Males exposed to beta-DBE-DBCH demonstrated significantly (p=0.05) lower concentrations of total thyroxine (TT4) overall, that were 11-28% lower than those of control males at the individual sampling points, yet significantly higher (p=0.03) concentrations of free thyroxine (FT4), that were 5-13% higher than those of control males at the individual sampling points; females had similar concentrations of TT4 and FT4 at the time of pairing, and T-4 was similar in both sexes at the end of the breeding season. Testosterone (T) concentrations in the treatment males were significantly higher during early (85%) and mid-courtship (30%) (time*treatment p=0.001), whereas females demonstrated a reduction in T at the time of pairing (17%, p=0.05). In the treatment females, concentrations of 17 beta-estmdiol (E-2) showed a nonsignificant decrease (20%) and were positively correlated with T concentrations (p=0.03); E-2 concentrations were below quantification limits in males. For males, some variation in T was also significantly associated with their sexual behavior (p < 0.001) and FT4 concentrations (p=0.01). For females, there was no relationship between hormones measured at pairing and subsequent sexual behaviors or reproductive measures. This study demonstrates that exposure to beta-DBE-DBCH at levels that are likely below those experienced by wild birds, affects the thyroid and sex steroid axes in birds and thus may be a contaminant of concern for wildlife warranting further research.

Geomorphic and hydrologic controls of dust emissions during drought from Yellow Lake playa, West Texas, USA	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Numerous complex geomorphic and hydrologic factors have been identified that control dust emissions from playas, yet there are few measurements of dust emissions from playas during drought, which is assumed to enhance emissions, or during low-emission seasons. We used the PI-SWERL (Portable in situ Wind Erosion Laboratory) to measure dust emission potential at Yellow Lake, a saline playa in West Texas, USA, during the drought of 2011. Direct aeolian entrainment of dust occurred primarily on supply limited surfaces consisting of mud-cracked surfaces as well as crusts containing halite, thenardite, and gypsum. High-magnitude, low duration peaks in dust emissions occurred over parts of the playa underlain by shallow groundwater (<1 m) where conditions encouraged the crystallization of efflorescent salts. In contrast, surfaces characterized by loose sand-sized aggregates produced sustained dust emissions two to three orders of magnitude higher than the playa surface because aggregates broke apart during saltation. Prolonged drought at Yellow Lake will significantly change the frequency and type of dust emissions. We propose that a similar scenario characterizes dust production at many hydrologically similar playas. More research is needed to assess the impacts of changing groundwater levels on dust emissions in the context of extended drought and anthropogenic climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

NIR-red reflectance-based algorithms for chlorophyll-a estimation in mesotrophic inland and coastal waters: Lake Kinneret case study	WATER RESEARCH												A variety of models have been developed for estimating chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in turbid and productive waters. All are based on optical information in a few spectral bands in the red and near-infra-red regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The wavelength locations in the models used were meticulously tuned to provide the highest sensitivity to the presence of Chl-a and minimal sensitivity to other constituents in water. But the caveat in these models is the need for recurrent parameterization and calibration due to changes in the biophysical characteristics of water based on the location and/or time of the year. In this study we tested the performance of NIR-red models in estimating Chl-a concentrations in an environment with a range of Chl-a concentrations that is typical for coastal and mesotrophic inland waters. The models with the same spectral bands as MERIS, calibrated for small lakes in the Midwest U.S., were used to estimate Chl-a concentration in the subtropical Lake Kinneret (Israel), where Chl-a concentrations ranged from 4 to 21 mg m(-3) during four field campaigns. A two-band model without reparameterization was able to estimate Chl-a concentration with a root mean square error less than 1.5 mg m(-3). Our work thus indicates the potential of the model to be reliably applied without further need of parameterization and calibration based on geographical and/or seasonal regimes.

However, the contribution of bicarbonates to GPP has never been quantified in lakes along the seasons. To detect the origin of the inorganic carbon maintaining GPP, we analyze the daily stoichiometric ratios of CO2-O-2 and alkalinity-O-2 in a deep hardwater lake. Results show that aquatic primary production withdraws bicarbonate from the alkalinity pool for two-thirds of the year. Alkalinity rather than CO2 is the dominant inorganic carbon source for GPP throughout the stratified period in both the littoral and pelagic environments. This study sheds light on the neglected role of alkalinity in the freshwater carbon cycle throughout an annual cycle.

Seasonal differences in the relative activities of these groups might exist, since cultivated archaeal ammonia oxidizers have higher temperature optima than their bacterial counterparts. In this study, sediment collected from eutrophic freshwater Lake Taihu (China) was incubated at different temperatures (4 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 37 degrees C) for up to 8 weeks. We examined the active bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers in these sediment microcosms by using combined stable isotope probing (SIP) and molecular community analysis. The results showed that accumulation of nitrate in microcosms correlated negatively with temperature, although ammonium depletion was the same, which might have been related to enhanced activity of other nitrogen transformation processes. Incubation at different temperatures significantly changed the microbial community composition, as revealed by 454 pyrosequencing targeting bacterial 16S rRNA genes. After 8 weeks of incubation, [C-13] bicarbonate labeling of bacterial amoA genes, which encode the ammonia monooxygenase subunit A, and an observed increase in copy numbers indicated the activity of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in all microcosms. Nitrosomonas sp. strain Is79A3 and Nitrosomonas communis lineages dominated the heavy fraction of CsCl gradients at low and high temperatures, respectively, indicating a niche differentiation of active bacterial ammonia oxidizers along the temperature gradient. The C-13 labeling of ammonia-oxidizing archaea in microcosms incubated at 4 to 25 degrees C was minor. In contrast, significant C-13 labeling of Nitrososphaera-like archaea and changes in the abundance and composition of archaeal amoA genes were observed at 37 degrees C, implicating autotrophic growth of ammonia-oxidizing archaea under warmer conditions.

The H-2 and O-18 values of river waters exhibit significant spatial and temporal variations and the isotopic compositions vary with elevation, temperature and precipitation of the recharge area. Spatially, O-18 values of river waters from high mountain areas are lower than those from the lower reaches of the Xijiang River due to lower temperature and higher elevation for the recharge area. However, both H-2 and O-18 are enriched differently in river waters from the middle reaches during the high flow season, depending on the season and degree of anthropogenic disturbances (e.g. water impoundments). In contrast, deuterium excess (d-excess) values of waters from the middle reaches are substantially lower than those from the upper and lower reaches, suggesting that river waters may be resided in the reservoir and evaporation increases in the middle reaches of the Xijiang River.

Changes in the firn structure of the western Greenland Ice Sheet caused by recent warming	CRYOSPHERE												Atmospheric warming over the Greenland Ice Sheet during the last 2 decades has increased the amount of surface meltwater production, resulting in the migration of melt and percolation regimes to higher altitudes and an increase in the amount of ice content from refrozen meltwater found in the firn above the superimposed ice zone. Here we present field and airborne radar observations of buried ice layers within the near-surface (0-20 m) firn in western Greenland, obtained from campaigns between 1998 and 2014. We find a sharp increase in firn-ice content in the form of thick widespread layers in the percolation zone, which decreases the capacity of the firn to store meltwater. The estimated total annual ice content retained in the near-surface firn in areas with positive surface mass balance west of the ice divide in Greenland reached a maximum of 74 +/- 25 Gt in 2012, compared to the 1958-1999 average of 13 +/- 2 Gt, while the percolation zone area more than doubled between 2003 and 2012. Increased melt and column densification resulted in surface lowering averaging 0.80 +/- 0.39 myr(-1) between 1800 and 2800 m in the accumulation zone of western Greenland. Since 2007, modeled annual melt and refreezing rates in the percolation zone at elevations below 2100 m surpass the annual snowfall from the previous year, implying that mass gain in the region is retained after melt in the form of refrozen meltwater. If current melt trends over high elevation regions continue, subsequent changes in firn structure will have implications for the hydrology of the ice sheet and related abrupt seasonal densification could become increasingly significant for altimetry-derived ice sheet mass balance estimates.					; Mosley-Thompson, Ellen/Z-2100-2018; van den Broeke, Michiel Roland/F-7867-2011; Howat, Ian/A-3474-2008; Price, Stephen/E-1568-2013; Van den Broeke, Michiel/F-7867-2011	Mair, Douglas/0000-0001-7009-5461; Sole, Andrew/0000-0001-5290-8967; van den Broeke, Michiel Roland/0000-0003-4662-7565; Howat, Ian/0000-0002-8072-6260; Mosley-Thompson, Ellen/0000-0002-9665-3705; Price, Stephen/0000-0001-6878-2553; 													1994-0416	1994-0424					2015	9	3					1203	1211		10.5194/tc-9-1203-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1203-2015													WOS:000360659200012

Paleoclimate controls on lithium enrichment in Great Basin Pliocene-Pleistocene lacustrine clays	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Terminal lakes are important archives of continental hydroclimate and in some cases contain important economic resources. Here, we present an 2.9 m.y. lacustrine carbonate carbon and oxygen stable isotope record from a Great Basin continental drill core. We paired these measurements with bulk lithium concentrations to reveal a re- lationship between past climate and lithium enrichment in authigenic lacustrine clays. Further, we explored the possible effects of changing seasonality on the isotope record through the use of paired air mass trajec- tories and modern isotope data. Our find- ings show the evolution of the basin's mois- ture balance over million-year time scales, which we attribute to variations in precipi- tation seasonality as well as fluctuations in the amount of evaporation associated with changes in atmospheric moisture conver- gence and divergence. We found a positive correlation between the oxygen isotope values of the lake carbonate and the bulk sediment lithium concentrations, which we argue is indicative of evapoconcentration of the lake environment and subsequent enrichment of the authigenic clays. Our re- sults suggest a link between past hydrocli- mate changes and the formation of lithium- rich authigenic clays feeding high lithium concentrations in this modern brine aquifer system.					; Gao, Annabelle/MIT-4049-2025; Boutt, David/G-1146-2010; Ibarra, Daniel/E-6141-2013	Boutt, David/0000-0003-1397-0279; 													0016-7606	1943-2674				NOV 1	2023	135	11-12					3201	3212		10.1130/B36572.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B36572.1		MAR 2023											WOS:000976872200001

Thus, we investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of microplastics in the surface water of the Lanzhou section of the Yellow River in a semiarid region and the contributions of typical sources. The average concentration of microplastics in the surface water of the river was 0.98 particles (p) L- 1. The daily quantity flux and mass flux were 3.63 x 109 p d- 1 and 95.38 kg d- 1, respectively. Most of the microplastics in the river were fibers and fragments, composed of polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide, polypropylene and polyethylene. A large quantity and mass of microplastics were found in the high-flow period of the river. The hotspots of microplastic pollution were residential and tourist reaches. The spatial distribution of microplastics was influenced by anthropogenic factors. However, the main factor influencing the temporal distribution of microplastics was precipitation seasonality. Most of the microplastics in the surface water originated from drainage ditches. The direct contribution of microplastics from atmospheric deposition was also considerable. Our results suggest that the contribution of microplastics from atmospheric deposition to urban rivers is worthy of attention.																			0304-3894	1873-3336				OCT 5	2024	478								135570	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.135570	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.135570		AUG 2024						39173368					WOS:001301395100001

A total of 59 compounds (16 PAHs, 12 PCBs, 22 OCPs and 9 BuSn) were measured in 40 surface sediment samples collected during two campaigns. High concentrations of total PAHs were identified in the lagoon ranging from 122 to 19600 ng.g(-1). Several OCPs, including endrin, dieldrin, and lindane (Hexachlorocyclohexane or HCH or BHC) were found in high concentrations in Ichkeul Lake, ranging from 28 to 2012 ng g(-1). PAHs and OCPs varied seasonally, in response to the complex hydrology of the watershed. The concentrations of total PCBs ranged between 0.04 and 10.653 ng g(-1) and suggests low total PCBs sediment contamination, when compared to most international criteria. Total BuSn concentrations range between 67 and 526 ng.g(-1), which are relatively low when compared to most international criteria and ecological risk assessments. This is the first study of organic contamination in Ichkeul Lake (RAMSAR and UNESCO World Heritage site).

However, most digital twin applications in natural environments have focused on static digital scenes and little consideration for wetlands. The Poyang Lake is characterized by seasonal hydrologic changes, with periodic plant community successions, making it necessary to capture dynamic changes in the Poyang Lake ecological landscapes through dynamic three-dimensional (3D) scenes. This study selected typical landscapes to establish digital twin scenarios, presenting the virtual landscapes, distribution characteristics of flora and fauna in the Poyang Lake wetland, and seasonal changes in the lake water levels. The results can be used to restore the virtual Poyang Lake landscapes, including seasonal changes in the water surface, vegetation growth, and migratory bird activities. This construction process can be applied to similar digital twin constructs for flood-prone wetland watersheds, providing insights into digital twin watersheds or nature-oriented digital twin development.						chen, hao/0009-0004-9943-5924													1364-8152	1873-6726				OCT	2024	181								106168	10.1016/j.envsoft.2024.106168	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2024.106168		AUG 2024											WOS:001300144900001

Manganese(iv) oxide amendments reduce methylmercury concentrations in sediment porewater	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS												Manganese(iv) oxide (pyrolusite, birnessite) mineral amendments can reduce dissolved MeHg concentrations in sediment theoretically by inhibiting microbial sulfate reduction, which is a major methylation pathway in sediments. Anaerobic sediment slurry microcosms in which Hg methylation was stimulated by addition of labile organic carbon (acetate) and HgCl2 showed that manganese(iv) oxide reduced the percent MeHg in slurry porewater (filtered), by 1-2 orders of magnitude relative to controls. Sediment-water mesocosms with pyrolusite or birnessite either directly mixed into the top 5 cm or applied in a thin (5 cm) sand layer over sediment showed reductions in percent MeHg in porewater of 66-69% for pyrolusite and 81-89% for birnessite amendment. A thin sand layer alone resulted in 65% reduction. CO2 respirometry experiments showed that the amendments stimulated microbial activity. Microbial community census by PCR and DNA sequencing indicated that the addition of Mn(iv) oxides did not significantly alter the indigenous sediment microbial community structure, although a small increase in abundance of iron and manganese reducers was observed after a 2 week incubation period. The mechanism of decreasing MeHg relative to Hg concentrations in porewater likely involved an increase in the importance of Mn(iv) reduction (relative to sulfate reduction) in heterotrophic microbial metabolism in the sediments amended with Mn(iv) oxides. Manganese reduction was confirmed as the predominant biogeochemical redox process by microelectrode voltammetry profiling of the sediment microcosms, although adsorption to Mn oxide surfaces, enhanced MeHg demethylation, and abiotic reduction of Mn(iv) also may have been involved in reducing percent MeHg and suppressing net MeHg production. These results represent a novel approach for mitigating MeHg impacts from sediments with potential applicability to a range of aquatic settings including intertidal zones, tidal marshes, seasonal wetlands, reservoirs, and lakes.

Permanent ice loss is causing reductions to dry season streamflow, which is coupled with shifting demands and control over water access and entitlements in the region. A full evaluation of hydrologic inputs is required to inform future water management in the relative absence of glaciers. Over the last decade, new studies have shown groundwater to be a significant component of the regional water budget during the dry season, and it cannot be ignored when accounting for water quality and quantity downstream of the Cordillera Blanca's alpine catchments. Distinctive common features of the Cordillera Blanca's proglacial catchments are sediment-filled valleys that were once under proglacial lake conditions. The combination of lake sediments with other alpine depositional features results in storage and interseasonal release of groundwater that comprises up to 80% of the valley's streamflow during the driest months of the year. We summarize the emerging understanding of hydrogeologic processes in proglacial headwater systems of the region's principal river, the Rio Santa, and make suggestions for future research that will more clearly characterize the spatial distribution of stored groundwater within the mountain range. As glaciers continue to recede, differences in aquifer thickness and groundwater residence time between alpine catchments in the region will increasingly control dry season water availability at the local and basin scale.

A diatom-based paleolimnological re-assessment of previously polymictic Lake Opinicon, Ontario (Canada): crossing an ecological threshold in response to warming over the past 25 years	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Long-term changes in diatom community composition provided important insights into how multiple stressors affected shallow, macrophyte-dominated Lake Opinicon, Ontario (Canada) over the past similar to 200 years. A previous paleolimnological study of a sediment core collected in 1995 found that diatom responses to numerous large-scale cultural disturbances since the early nineteenth century were moderate in comparison to pronounced diatom responses to similar disturbances in nearby deeper lakes within the Rideau Canal system. The abundance of macrophytes in shallow and previously polymictic Lake Opinicon likely played an important role in maintaining a stable, clear-water equilibrium state. We examined diatom assemblages from a sediment core collected in 2019 to re-assess whether Lake Opinicon maintained its resistance to change over the past similar to 25 years. Despite numerous, intense early nineteenth and twentieth century cultural disturbances in Lake Opinicon's catchment (complete deforestation, flooding with the construction of the Rideau Canal), the highest rate of diatom compositional change occurred only in the past similar to 25 years, when planktonic diatoms became prevalent for the first time in the lake's postglacial history. This recent shift in assemblage composition is not explained by nutrient enrichment, as total phosphorus concentrations, measured since the 1970s, have declined significantly. The first appearance of zebra mussels (similar to 1990s) and significant increases in Secchi depth broadly co-occurred with the diatom assemblage shift, but precipitous declines in mussel populations since 2013 and a continued increase in planktonic diatom taxa suggest the impact of this invasive species was modest. Instead, changes in diatom assemblage composition were strongly related to increasing regional air temperatures. Limnological monitoring indicated that, over the past few decades, previously polymictic Lake Opinicon has experienced increasingly longer and more stable periods of thermal stratification that are consistent with observed trends in regional warming and reduced wind speed. These water column changes, which accompanied reduced ice cover duration, would have provided favourable conditions for planktonic diatom growth. We conclude that the nature and high rate of diatom compositional change over the past similar to 25 years signifies that an ecological threshold was crossed in response to warming and changes in lake thermal structure.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Balasubramaniam, Kapillesh/0000-0002-4318-7763; Ruhland, Kathleen/0000-0003-3994-3666; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2023	69	1					37	55		10.1007/s10933-022-00261-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-022-00261-w		AUG 2022											WOS:000842881600001

Avulsion processes at the terminus of low-gradient semi-arid fluvial systems: Lessons from the Rio Colorado, Altiplano endorheic basin, Bolivia	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Rio Colorado dryland river system in the southeast of the endorheic Altiplano Basin (Bolivia) terminates on a very flat coastal plain at the edge of the Salar de Uyuni, the world's largest salt pan with an area of ca. 12,500 km(2). Since the Pleistocene the basin has experienced several lake expansion and contraction cycles in response to wetter and drier climate periods, respectively. At present the basin is in a dry climate period which results in a lake level lowstand and progradation of fluvial systems such as the Rio Colorado onto the former lake bottom. The present field study of the terminus of the Rio Colorado shows that the river experiences a gradual downstream decrease of bankfull width and depth. This bankfull decrease is caused by the combined effects of: (1) extremely low gradient of the lake bottom and, hence, loss of flow energy, and (2) downstream transmission losses due to high evaporation potential and river water percolation through the channel floor. Peak water discharge in seasonal, short-duration rain periods causes massive overbank flooding and floodplain inundation. On satellite images the morphology of the river terminus has a divergent pattern and resembles a network of coeval sinuous distributary channels. However, field observations show that only one channel is active at low flow stage, and at high-flow stage an abandoned, partially infilled channel may be active as well. The active channel at its termination splits into narrow and shallow anastomosing streams before its demise on the lacustrine coastal plain. The rest of the channels which form the divergent network are older sediment-filled abandoned sinuous river courses with multiple random avulsion points. These channel deposits, together with extensive amalgamated crevasse-splay deposits, form an intricate network of fluvial sand deposits. Successive stages of progressively deeper crevasse-channel incision into the floodplain are the result of waning-stage return flow of floodwaters towards the main channel. This results in increased crevasse-channel width, depth and length, and redeposition of eroded lacustrine coastal-plain sediment at the junction of the crevasse channel with the present-day river. A sedimentary model is proposed in which deep river bank incision by return flow in crevasse-channels creates the preferential locus for river avulsion. In a Lowstand Systems Tract with little vertical accommodation increase, the recurring avulsed-river paths result in a thin but laterally extensive network of amalgamated channel-fill, point-bar, crevasse-channel and crevasse-splay deposits. The resulting sedimentary architecture could easily be mistaken as produced by a distributary system of simultaneously active fluvial channels. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Spatial and seasonal variability in the diet of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus): stable isotopes indicate that stomach contents overestimate the importance of dreissenids	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Our results provide new information that diet, carbon source and trophic position of an invasive fish species, round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), varies seasonally, spatially and with body size in littoral habitats of Lake Ontario. Based on stomach contents and stable isotopes, round goby fed at a higher trophic position in the cooler, less productive Kingston Basin relative to the Bay of Quinte. Bay of Quinte round goby were more reliant on terrestrial carbon, whereas littoral carbon dominated in the Kingston Basin. Although stomach contents suggested dreissenids were the dominant prey item of round goby, stable isotope mixing models estimated that dreissenids were never >39% and 11% of the diet in Bay of Quinte and Kingston Basin, respectively. Stable isotopes indicated amphipods, chironomids and cladocerans were the most important prey, and were at times common items in stomach contents, but this varied with site, season and year. Given their high abundance, the impact of round gobies on the benthic biodiversity of the Great Lakes may be more significant than indicated by stomach content analysis alone.

High temperature during early flowering and pod development stages significantly reduces the crop yield. The wild relatives of chickpeas can be potential donors for the introgression of heat and drought tolerance into cultivated chickpeas for crop improvement. Initially, 600 interspecific lines were derived from crosses between two elite cultivars, CDC Leader (kabuli chickpea) and CDC Consul (desi chickpea), and 20 accessions of Cicer reticulatum. The F-5 interspecific lines were tested for agronomic and seed quality traits including reaction to ascochyta blight disease under field conditions at two locations in 2018. A subset of 195 lines were selected based on resistance to ascochyta blight and acceptable seed quality. These lines were evaluated for their performance under suboptimal conditions at Lucky Lake (2019 and 2020) and Moose Jaw (2019), Saskatchewan, Canada, and Yuma, Arizona, United States (2019-2020). The lines were grown and evaluated at two seeding dates, normal (SD1) and late (SD2) seeding dates, at each location and year. The same lines were genotyped using Cicer60K Axiom (R) SNP chip. The population structure was determined based on 35,431 informative SNPs using fastStructure, and the interspecific lines were clustered at a k-value of 15. Significant marker-trait associations were identified for seed yield from SD1 and SD2 seeding dates, and stress tolerance indices (ATI, K1STI, MP, SSPI, and TOL) using phenotypic values both from individual locations and combined analyses based on BLUP values. SNP marker Ca2_34600347 was significantly associated with yield from both the seeding dates. This and other SNP markers identified in this study may be useful for marker-assisted introgression of abiotic stress tolerance in chickpea.																			1664-462X					AUG 19	2022	13								933277	10.3389/fpls.2022.933277	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.933277								36061786					WOS:000849643600001

Estimating evapotranspiration and groundwater flow from water- table fluctuations for a general wetland scenario	ECOHYDROLOGY												The use of diurnal water-table fluctuation methods to calculate evapotranspiration (ET) and groundwater flow is of increasing interest in ecohydrological studies. Most studies of this type, however, have been located in riparian wetlands of semi-arid regions where groundwater levels are consistently below topographic surface elevations and precipitation events are infrequent. Current methodologies preclude application to a wider variety of wetland systems. In this study, we extended a method for estimating sub-daily ET and groundwater flow rates from water-level fluctuations to fit highly dynamic, non-riparian wetland scenarios. Modifications included (1) varying the specific yield to account for periodic flooded conditions and (2) relating empirically derived ET to estimated potential ET for days when precipitation events masked the diurnal signal. To demonstrate the utility of this method, we estimated ET and groundwater fluxes over two growing seasons (2006-2007) in 15 wetlands within a ridge-and-swale wetland complex of the Laurentian Great Lakes under flooded and non-flooded conditions. Mean daily ET rates for the sites ranged from 4.0mmd(-1) to 6.6mmd(-1). Shallow groundwater discharge rates resulting from evaporative demand ranged from 2.5mmd(-1) to 4.3mmd(-1). This study helps to expand our understanding of the evapotranspirative demand of plants under various hydrologic and climate conditions. Published 2013.

Spatial variation of phytoplankton composition, biovolume, and resulting microcystin concentrations in the Nyanza Gulf (Lake Victoria, Kenya)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The Nyanza Gulf is a large shallow bay of Lake Victoria suffering from eutrophication by human activities. In order to characterize the harmful algal bloom formation as a consequence of eutrophication, both spatially and seasonally, environmental conditions, phytoplankton community composition, and microcystin (MC) concentrations were investigated monthly from Kisumu Bay, and bimonthly from the center of the gulf, as well as quarterly from the Rusinga Channel and the main basin of Lake Victoria between July 2008 and September 2009. The sites located in Kisumu Bay and the central gulf were most strongly affected by eutrophication, including increased nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton growth. More than 90% of the samples obtained from the gulf were dominated by cyanobacteria, whereas diatoms only dominated in the samples obtained from Rusinga Channel and the main lake. In general, Microcystis accounted for the largest part (> 50-90%) of cyanobacterial biovolume. MCs were found in 35 (54%) out of 65 samples and were detected throughout the study period in the gulf, but only in two out of eight samples from the Rusinga Channel and the main lake. A significant linear relationship between Microcystis biovolume and MC concentration was observed (n = 65, R (2) = 0.88, P < 0.001). The highest MC concentrations were recorded in Kisumu Bay between November and March (max. 81 mu g l(-1)) when Microcystis showed max. biovolume (18 mm(3) l(-1) in November 2008).

Ecosystem respiration (ER), which includes both autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration (HR), accounts for the largest land-to-atmosphere C fluxes. How ER responds to GE is still unclear, however, and to investigate this, a controlled GE experiment was conducted at a meadow grassland near Qinghai Lake, China. Animal exclusion enhanced ER and aboveground plant respiration (R-agb) by 10.5% and 40.1%, respectively, but it suppressed soil respiration by 12.4% and HR by 17.6%. Positive responses of ER and R-agb were linked to increased aboveground biomass, particularly graminoids biomass. Negative responses of soil respiration and HR were associated with GE-induced changes in microbial biomass C and nitrogen. These results show that grassland responded in complex ways to GE and that ER and its components were regulated by both abiotic and biotic factors. Moreover, the divergent responses of respiration components have important implications for models of terrestrial C cycles and climate under enhanced human activities and changes in land use.

This study sought to conduct an ecological and human health risk assessment of metals and heavy metals, including copper, as well as investigate their concentration, distribution, and source distribution. In terms of seasonal variation, the increases in Fe, Cr, As, Pb, and Hg were relatively large, and the spatial distribution of metals presented a three-level stepped distribution trend, gradually increasing from east to west. By further exploring the source and migration path of pollutants, our study found that the source of metals in the sediments of Qinghai Lake is mainly controlled by five rivers entering the lake. Enrichment factor (EF) calculations indicated that the metal accumulation or enrichment capacity of the three central points in Qinghai Lake Basin was strong. Interestingly, the enrichment capacity of Cu and Zn was the strongest among all metals but occurred at low and medium concentration levels, respectively. The Igeo and E-r(i) ecological risk assessment results indicated that the individual metals posed little to no ecological risks to the Qinghai Lake Basin. However, the multi-element environmental risk comprehensive index (RI) indicated that Hg (RI = 147.97) represented a slight ecological hazard, Mn (RI = 181.13) posed moderate ecological hazards, and Zn (RI = 386.66) posed strong ecological hazards. The human health risk assessment results showed that the heavy metals in the surface sediments of Qinghai Lake currently do not pose a threat to human health. This information may facilitate the implementation of more stringent monitoring programs in the aquatic ecosystem by the relevant regulatory authorities.					; Zhang, Jinbo/CAG-2629-2022; Wang, Shuhang/AAJ-7930-2020	Li, Zheng/0009-0005-9847-3459; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2023	30	2					5137	5149		10.1007/s11356-022-22293-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-22293-5		AUG 2022						35976588					WOS:000843827100006

However, most virome studies have been focused on marine or gut environments, thereby leaving the viral community structure of freshwater lakes unclear. Because the lakes located around the globe have independent ecosystems with unique characteristics, viral community structures are also distinctive but comparable. Here, we present data on viral metagenomes that were seasonally collected at a depth of 1m from Lake Soyang, the largest freshwater reservoir in South Korea. Through shotgun metagenome sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq platform, 3.08 to 5.54-Gbps of reads per virome were obtained. To predict the viral genome sequences within Lake Soyang, contigs were constructed and 648 to 1,004 putative viral contigs were obtained per sample. We expect that both viral metagenome reads and viral contigs would contribute in comparing and understanding of viral communities among different freshwater lakes depending on seasonal changes.

Supraglacial lakes on the Larsen B ice shelf, Antarctica, and at Paakitsoq, West Greenland: a comparative study	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												Supraglacial meltwater lakes trigger ice-shelf break-up and modulate seasonal ice-sheet flow, and are thus agents by which warming is transmitted to the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. To characterize supraglacial lake variability we perform a comparative analysis of lake geometry and depth in two distinct regions, one on the pre-collapse (2002) Larsen B ice shelf, Antarctica, and the other in the ablation zone of Paakitsoq, a land-terminating region of the Greenland ice sheet. Compared to Paakitsoq, lakes on the Larsen B ice shelf cover a greater proportion of surface area (5.3% cf. 1%), but are shallower and more uniform in area. Other aspects of lake geometry (e.g. eccentricity, degree of convexity (solidity) and orientation) are relatively similar between the two regions. We attribute the notable difference in lake density and depth between ice-shelf and grounded ice to the fact that ice shelves have flatter surfaces and less distinct drainage basins. Ice shelves also possess more stimuli to small-scale, localized surface elevation variability, due to the various structural features that yield small variations in thickness and which float at different levels by Archimedes' principle.

Diatoms have often been reported as valuable proxies for different kinds of anthropogenic activities. Diatom assemblages and 14 environmental variables from shallow, alkaline lakes from 2 different regions of the Carpathian basin (Europe) were investigated for 3 years to (1) elucidate the physical and chemical parameters and diatom assemblages of these lakes, (2) select the principle variables affecting the diatom communities, and (3) show the relevance of diatoms as ecological bioindicators. Water chemical characteristics of the lakes in the 2 regions differ significantly in anion concentrations (HCO3-, SO42-, and Cl-), platinum (Pt) units (colour), and oxygen saturation. Dominance by the stress-tolerant, motile diatom ecological guild, represented mainly by Nitzschia and Navicula species, was characteristic in these saline, turbid environments. Indicator species of the 2 regions were found to be different. Diatom assemblage composition was chiefly determined by conductivity and HCO3- and SO42- concentrations. Nutrient loads, extreme weather events, and consequences of habitat maintenance management were unequivocally identifiable by variations in the benthic diatom assemblage composition. Diatoms are valuable indicators for assessment of ecological status of these saline, alkaline lakes. Including these organisms in ecological status assessments of inland saline lakes may improve the effectiveness of directives for conservation management and might be useful in preserving these pristine habitats that depend on natural hydrological processes.

The average WL ranges between 1.3 and 2.3 m between the low-and high-water seasons. Seasonal as well as weak interannual variations between 2018 and 2019 are driven by rainfall regime over the catchment and associated river inflow. At sub-monthly scales, the lagoon is tidally choked: ocean tides can reach 90 cm, whereas in the lagoon semi-diurnal and diurnal tides hardly reach few centimeters. Choking conditions vary with river inflow and ocean tide amplitude, correctly represented by a simple tidal choking model. Diurnal modulation and asymmetry of the tide are stronger (weaker) during high (low) water period. We also observed WL variations of +/- 5-10 cm at a fortnightly frequency, stronger during wet (high-water) season. Superimposed on the seasonal, fortnightly and tidal WL variations, we further observed short-term high-frequency seiche events. Mostly observed during dry (low-water) conditions, they are characterized by typical standing-wave oscillations of 5-10 cm amplitudes and 3 h periods. They are forced by the passage of fast-moving squall-lines that induce strong wind variations, heavy rainfalls and rapid drop-off of the air temperature. Results obtained in this study provide useful metrics for the validation of flood forecasting models to be implemented in Benin, and elsewhere on the West African coastline.

Residence Time Controls on the Fate of Nitrogen in Flow-Through Lakebed Sediments	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												For many glacial lakes with highly permeable sediments, water exchange rates control hydrologic residence times within the sediment-water interface (SWI) and the removal of reactive compounds such as nitrate, a common pollutant in lakes and groundwater. Here we conducted a series of focused tracer injection experiments in the upper 20cm of the naturally downwelling SWI in a flow-through lake on Cape Cod, MA. We systematically varied residence time and reactant controls on nitrate processing, using isotopically labeled N-15 nitrate to monitor the effect of these changes on nitrate removal via denitrification. The addition of acetate, a labile carbon compound, triggered the lake SWI to switch from net production to net removal of nitrate. When acetate was combined with increased residence time created by controlled reductions in water flux, we observed a fivefold increase in nitrate removal, a 26-fold increase in N-2 production, and a 42-fold increase in N2O production. We demonstrate that water residence time is an important control on the fate of nitrate in these lake SWIs and illustrate that seasonal conditions that alter lake exchange rates and variability in lake carbon may predict dynamic nitrate removal across the SWI. Additionally, observed N2O production during the oxic pore water experiments paired with geophysical characterization of the sediment porosity revealed that the lake SWI has less mobile pores occupying upward of 50% of the total porosity volume, which function as reactive microzones for nitrate processing. Plain Language Summary In regions with extensive glacial deposits, like on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, kettle lakes are common features on the landscape. The permeable nature of kettle lake systems allows rapid exchange of groundwater and surface water through permeable sediment-water interfaces (SWIs), resulting in increasing frequent nitrate pollution from septic tanks and other nonpoint sources around these lakes. Here we investigated the ability of the lake SWI to remove nitrate in a glacial lake on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, United States. Specifically, we used an experimental apparatus to confine a portion of the lakebed SWI and control the lake level and water chemistry. Across these controlled experiments, we tested whether seasonal changes in lake level or carbon chemistry might have a larger effect on SWI nitrate removal. We found that reducing the lake level created slower water flow through the sediments, leading to a fivefold increase in nitrate removal. We also observed that about 1% of this nitrate removal resulted in the production of nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Overall, our study highlights that the nitrate removal function of these glacial lake SWIs are dynamic and likely vary seasonally as lake water levels, groundwater levels, and abundance of nitrate and reactive carbon change.					; Harvey, Judson/L-2047-2013; Zarnetske, Jay/F-4685-2010	Singha, Kamini/0000-0002-0605-3774; Harvey, Judson/0000-0002-2654-9873; Briggs, Martin/0000-0003-3206-4132; MahmoodPoor Dehkordy, Farzaneh/0000-0002-6854-291X; Lane, John/0000-0002-3558-243X; Zarnetske, Jay/0000-0001-7194-5245; Day-Lewis, Frederick/0000-0003-3526-886X; Hampton, Tyler/0000-0003-1087-2059													2169-8953	2169-8961				MAR	2019	124	3					689	707		10.1029/2018JG004741	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JG004741													WOS:000464653200017

However, food safety issues related to pesticide residues are important to consider with a food crop such as rice. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze thiamethoxam and chlorantraniliprole residues in rice hull, bran, and polished rice grains. The study was conducted during the 2012 cropping season at the Texas A&M Agrilife Research, David R. Wintermann Rice Research Station, near Eagle Lake, TX, USA. Rice was planted on May 5, 2012, using the cultivar 'Presidio'. Pesticide applications were performed at 5, 15, 25, and 35 days after flowering (DAF) using 1 and 2 times the recommended rate of 30 g active ingredient (ai) ha(-1) for thiamethoxam and 30 g ai ha(-1) for chlorantraniliprole. Sequentially, two treatments using the insecticides at recommended rate were applied at 5 and 25 DAF and at 5, 25, and 35 DAF. Insecticide residues were analyzed in different sample fractions: rice hull, bran, and polished rice grains. The samples were subjected to extraction using an accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) technique. Sample aliquots were analyzed using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 5 x 10(-5) mg kg(-1). Residues of thiamethoxam and chlorantraniliprole were detected in rice hull, bran, and polished rice grains, and the quantified values were greater in hull and in rice bran.

Here we present high-resolution biomarker records from the southern Beaufort Sea. Multi-proxy biomarker reconstruction suggests that the southern Beaufort Sea was nearly ice-free during the deglacial to Holocene transition, and a seasonal sea-ice cover developed during the mid-late Holocene. Superimposed on the long-term change, two events of high sediment flux were documented at ca. 13 and 11 kyr BP, respectively. The first event can be attributed to the Younger Dryas flood and the second event is likely related to a second flood and/or coastal erosion. The Beaufort Sea was nearly ice-free during the transition from the last deglacial to the Holocene, a period in which two episodes of high sediment flux suggest major glacial flood events, according to high-resolution multi-proxy biomarker records.					; Geibert, Walter/ABA-9785-2020; Mollenhauer, Gesine/AAD-8167-2019; Mollenhauer, Gesine/B-5190-2015; Hefter, Jens/LNR-6235-2024	Hefter, Jens/0000-0002-5823-1966; Fahl, Dr., Kirsten/0000-0001-9317-4656; Nam, Seung-Il/0000-0003-0006-0153; Stein, Ruediger/0000-0002-4453-9564; Wu, Junjie/0000-0001-7618-6989; Geibert, Walter/0000-0001-8646-2334; Mollenhauer, Gesine/0000-0001-5138-564X; 														2662-4435				OCT 9	2020	1	1							27	10.1038/s43247-020-00028-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43247-020-00028-z													WOS:000648594600002

Cyclic changes in Pennsylvanian paleoclimate and effects on floristic dynamics in tropical Pangaea	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY												Wetland floras narrowly define perceptions of Pennsylvanian tropical ecosystems, the so-called Coal Age. Such wetlands reflect humid to perhumid climate, leading to characterizations of Pennsylvanian tropics as everwet, swampy. These views are biased by the high preservation potential of wetlands. Sedimentation patterns, paleosols, and fossil floras indicate the presence of vegetation tolerant of subhumid to dry-subhumid, perhaps semi-arid climate in basins between peat formation times. Understanding the significance of this seasonally-dry vegetation has suffered from conceptual and terminological confusion. A clearer view has emerged as models for framing the data have improved. Basinal floras typical of seasonally-dry conditions, relatively low soil moisture regimes, are well documented but mainly from isolated deposits. Some of the earliest, dominated by primitive pteridosperms ("Flozfern" floras), occur in clastic rocks between European Early Pennsylvanian coal beds. lAter Early Pennsylvanian, fern-cordaitalean vegetation, different from coal floras, is preserved in marine goniatite bullions. Conifers are first suggested by late Mississippian Potoniesporites pollen. About the same time, in North America, broadleaf foliage, Lesleya and Megalopteris occur in basin-margin settings, on drought-prone limestone substrates. The best known, xeromorphic floras found between coal beds appear in the Middle through Late Pennsylvanian, containing conifers, cordaitaleans, and pteridosperms. The Middle Pennsylvanian appearances of this flora are mainly allochthonous, though parautochthonous occurrences have been reported. Parautochthonous assemblages are mostly Late Pennsylvanian. The conifer flora became dominant in western and central Pangaean equatorial lowlands in earliest Permian. Location of the humid-perhumid wetland flora during periods of relative dryness, though rarely discussed, is as, or more, perplexing than the spatial location of seasonally-dry floras through - time wetland plants had few migratory options and possibly survived in small refugia, within and outside of basins. Coupled oscillations in climate, sea level, and vegetation were driven most likely by glacial-interglacial fluctuations, perhaps controlled by orbital cyclicity. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to determine the eutrophication state of Lugu Lake. Specifically, the spatio-temporal variations of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution during the wet and dry sea-sons were investigated in Lianghai and Caohai, and the primary environmental effect factors were defined. Adopting the endogenous static release experiments and the exogenous improved export coefficient model, a novel approach (a combi-nation of internal and external sources) was developed for the estimation of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution loads in Lugu Lake. It was indicated that the order of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in Lugu Lake was Caohai > Lianghai and dry season > wet season. Dissolved oxygen (DO) and chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) were the main environmen-tal factors causing nitrogen and phosphorus pollution. Endogenous nitrogen and phosphorus release rates in Lugu Lake were 668.7 and 42.0 t/a, respectively, and exogenous nitrogen and phosphorus input rates were 372.7 and 30.8 t/a, re-spectively. The contributions of pollution sources, in descending order, were sediment > land-use categories > residents and livestock breeding > plant decay, of which sediment nitrogen and phosphorus loads accounted for 64.3 % and 57.4 %, respectively. Regulating the endogenous release of sediment and obstructing the exogenous input from shrubland and woodland are emphasized for the management of nitrogen and phosphorus contamination in Lugu Lake. Thus, this study can serve as a theoretical foundation and technical guide for eutrophication control in plateau lakes.

L.; Wilmers, Christopher C.; Levi, Taal			Environmental DNA from Residual Saliva for Efficient Noninvasive Genetic Monitoring of Brown Bears (Ursus arctos)	PLOS ONE												Noninvasive genetic sampling is an important tool in wildlife ecology and management, typically relying on hair snaring or scat sampling techniques, but hair snaring is labor and cost intensive, and scats yield relatively low quality DNA. New approaches utilizing environmental DNA (eDNA) may provide supplementary, cost-effective tools for noninvasive genetic sampling. We tested whether eDNA from residual saliva on partially-consumed Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) carcasses might yield suitable DNA quality for noninvasive monitoring of brown bears (Ursus arctos). We compared the efficiency of monitoring brown bear populations using both fecal DNA and salivary eDNA collected from partially-consumed salmon carcasses in Southeast Alaska. We swabbed a range of tissue types from 156 partially-consumed salmon carcasses from a midseason run of lakeshore-spawning sockeye (O. nerka) and a late season run of stream-spawning chum (O. keta) salmon in 2014. We also swabbed a total of 272 scats from the same locations. Saliva swabs collected from the braincases of salmon had the best amplification rate, followed by swabs taken from individual bite holes. Saliva collected from salmon carcasses identified unique individuals more quickly and required much less labor to locate than scat samples. Salmon carcass swabbing is a promising method to aid in efficient and affordable monitoring of bear populations, and suggests that the swabbing of food remains or consumed baits from other animals may be an additional cost-effective and valuable tool in the study of the ecology and population biology of many elusive and/or wide-ranging species.					; miller, sophie/JEZ-2826-2023; Harman, Jennifer/P-4833-2018	Levi, Taal/0000-0003-1853-8311; 													1932-6203					NOV 9	2016	11	11							e0165259	10.1371/journal.pone.0165259	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0165259								27828988					WOS:000387724300035

The Dry Puna as an ecological megapatch and the peopling of South America: Technology, mobility, and the development of a late Pleistocene/early Holocene Andean hunter-gatherer tradition in northern Chile	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					81st Annual Meeting of the Society-for-American-Archaeology	2016	Orlando, FL	Soc Amer Archaeol				Current scientific evidence shows that humans colonized South America at least 15,000 years ago, but there are still many unknown aspects of this process, including the major and minor migratory routes involved, and the pattern of successive occupation of a diverse continental mosaic of ecosystems. In this context, the role of the Andean highlands (>= 3400 meters above sea level) has been neglected, because of the supposedly harsh conditions for humans including hypoxia and cold climate. Nevertheless, the environmental and cultural resources available in the high Andes constitutes an important "megapatch" that should be assessed in terms of human settlement patterns. We review the evidence for late Pleistocene/early Holocene hunter-gatherer occupation of one part of this megapatch, the northern Chilean Dry Puna, in its palaeoecological context. We focus on lithic technology, faunal remains, radiocarbon dates, and other archaeological materials related to different social activities, which allow us to suggest that groups of hunter-gatherers organized and adapted their way of life to highland ecosystems through logistical mobility, and curatorial strategies for lithic tool kits that included projectile points and other formalized tools. The morphology and technological processes involved are recognized over vast territories along the high Andes. We identify this material expression as the high south central Andean Archaic hunter-gatherer tradition, which also featured long distance mobile settlement systems and communication processes over this broad and distinct megapatch. More speculatively, we outline the hypothesis that these highland ecosystems constituted a suitable migratory route that may have been key for the early peopling of the continent, and contrast it with the alternative hypothesis of the initially secondary and seasonally intermittent exploitation of this habitat by hunter-gatherers dispersing along the Pacific coastal corridor.

Assessment of Impacts of Climate Change on Tile Discharge and Nitrogen Yield Using the DRAINMOD Model	HYDROLOGY												The detrimental impacts of agricultural subsurface tile flows and their associated pollutants on water quality is a major environmental issue in the Great Lakes region and many other places globally. A strong understanding of water quality indicators along with the contribution of tile-drained agriculture to water contamination is necessary to assess and reduce a significant source of non-point source pollution. In this study, DRAINMOD, a field-scale hydrology and water quality model, was applied to assess the impact of future climatic change on depth to water table, tile flow and associated nitrate loss from an 8.66 ha agricultural field near Londesborough, in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. The closest available climate data from a weather station approximately 10 km from the field site was used by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) to generate future predictions of daily precipitation and maximum and minimum air temperatures required to create the weather files for DRAINMOD. Of the 28 models applied by MNRF, three models (CGCM3T47-Run5, GFDLCM2.0, and MIROC3.2hires) were selected based on the frequency of the models recommended for use in Ontario with SRA1B emission scenario. Results suggested that simulated tile flows and evapotranspiration (ET) in the 2071-2100 period are expected to increase by 7% and 14% compared to 1960-1990 period. Results also suggest that under future climates, significant increases in nitrate losses (about 50%) will occur along with the elevated tile flows. This work suggests that climate change will have a significant effect on field hydrology and water quality in tile-drained agricultural regions.

Impact of Seasonal Variation in Climate on Water Quality of Old Woman Creek Watershed Ohio Using SWAT	CLIMATE												The effect of the projected 21st century climate change on water quality in Old Woman Creek (OWC) watershed was evaluated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the precipitation and temperature projections from three best Global Climate Circulation Model (GCM)l ensemble downloaded from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). These three best GCMs (GFDL-ESM2M, MPI-ESM-MR, EC-EARTH) were identified as those closest to the multivariate ensemble average of twenty different GCM-driven SWAT simulations. Seasonal analysis was undertaken in historical (1985-2014), current to near future (2018-2045), mid-century (2046-2075), and late-century (2076-2100) climate windows. The hydrological model calibration was carried out using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and pareto optimization. Simulations were made for stream flow and nine water quality variables (sediment, organic nitrogen, organic phosphorus, mineral phosphorus, chlorophyll a, carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus) of interest. The average of twenty different CMIP5-driven SWAT simulation results showed good correlation for all the 10 variables with the PRISM-driven SWAT simulation results in the historical climate window (1985-2014). For the historical period, the result shows an over-estimation of flow, sediment, and organic nitrogen from January to March in simulations with CMIP5 inputs, relative to simulations with PRISM input. For the other climate windows, the simulation results show a progressive increase in stream flow with peak flow month shifting from April to March. The expected seasonal changes in each water quality variable have implications for the OWC estuary and Lake Erie water quality.					; Ortiz, Joseph/E-1144-2011; Confesor, Remegio/AAZ-6237-2020	Confesor, Remegio/0000-0002-7306-1432; Ortiz, Joseph/0000-0002-6583-3850; 														2225-1154				MAR	2021	9	3							50	10.3390/cli9030050	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli9030050													WOS:000633455000001

The Influence of Snow and Ice Albedo towards Improved Lake Ice Simulations	HYDROLOGY												Lake ice models are a vital tool for studying the response of ice-covered lakes to changing climates throughout the world. The Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMo) is a one-dimensional freshwater ice cover model that simulates Arctic and sub-Arctic lake ice cover well. Modelling ice cover in temperate regions has presented challenges due to the differences in ice composition between northern and temperate region lake ice. This study presents a comparison of measured and modelled ice regimes, with a focus on refining CLIMo for temperate regions. The study sites include two temperate region lakes (MacDonald Lake and Clear Lake, Central Ontario) and two High Arctic lakes (Resolute Lake and Small Lake, Nunavut) where climate and ice cover information have been recorded over three seasons. The ice cover simulations were validated with a combination of time lapse imagery, field measurements of snow depth, snow density, ice thickness and albedo data, and historical ice records from the Canadian Ice Database (for Resolute Lake). Simulations of High Arctic lake ice cover show good agreement with previous studies for ice-on and ice-off dates (MAE 6 to 8 days). Unadjusted simulations for the temperate region lakes show good ice-on timing, but an under-representation of ice thickness, and earlier complete ice-off timing (similar to 3 to 5 weeks). Field measurements were used to adjust the albedo values used in CLIMo, which resulted in improvements to both simulated ice thickness (similar to 3 cm MAE compared to manual measurements), and ice-off timing, within 0 to 7 days (2 days MAE) of observations. These findings suggest regionally specific measurements of albedo can improve the accuracy of lake ice simulations, which further our knowledge of the response of temperate and High Arctic lake ice regimes to climate conditions.					; Brown, Laura/F-5932-2011	Brown, Laura/0000-0002-3173-8433; Robinson, Alexis/0000-0002-5991-8866; Ariano, Sarah/0000-0002-5760-6586														2306-5338				MAR	2021	8	1							11	10.3390/hydrology8010011	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology8010011													WOS:000633114300001

Eradication of the Invasive Common Carp, Cyprinus carpio from a Large Lake: Lessons and Insights from the Tasmanian Experience	FISHES												Common carp (Cyprinus carpio, L. 1758) are the most abundant pest fish species in Australia, detrimental to ecosystem integrity and values, and in need of suitable management solutions. In January 1995, this destructive pest was discovered in two large, connected Tasmanian lakes-Lakes Crescent (23 km(2)) and Sorell (54 km(2)). After an initial assessment, carp were immediately contained to these waters using screens to prevent their escape down-stream, followed by swift legislation to enforce closure of the lakes to the public. Assessment and evaluation of carp numbers occurred throughout the eradication program, with effort focused on Lake Crescent. Beginning with undirected removal, techniques progressively evolved to more sophisticated targeted removal with assistance from biotelemetry, in conjunction with gill netting and electro-fishing. Real-time population estimates and in situ observations resulted in a detailed cumulative understanding of carp population dynamics, behaviour and seasonal habitat choice. This allowed strategic deployment of fences to block access to marshes, and the installation of steel traps within the fences. These gears specifically prevented spawning opportunities, while concurrently capturing mature fish. Following 12 years of adaptive and integrated effort, 7797 carp (fry, juvenile and adult) were captured from Lake Crescent, with the last carp being caught in December 2007. The subsequent 14 years of monitoring has not resulted in the capture of any carp, confirming the successful eradication of carp from Lake Crescent. These management practices have been successfully replicated in the larger Lake Sorell, where 41,499 carp (fry, juvenile and adult) have been removed. It is now estimated that there are few, if any carp remaining. Collectively, the techniques and strategies described here were reliable, and can be applied as a model to control or eradicate pest populations of carp in freshwater lakes elsewhere.					; Patil, Jawahar/B-9527-2012	Yick, Jonah/0000-0001-5464-0458; Patil, Jawahar G/0000-0002-2154-4627; 														2410-3888				MAR	2021	6	1							6	10.3390/fishes6010006	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fishes6010006													WOS:000635653000001

Determination of phytoplankton by microscopy has practical limitations that can constrain the scope of a study, but DNA metabarcoding may improve upon this through higher taxonomic resolution and the capacity to generate a large volume of assemblage data in comparatively little time. To determine if metabarcoding could replicate microscopy and expand the assessment of GSL phytoplankton, a 23S SSU rRNA metabarcoding and microscopy survey of Gilbert Bay was conducted in 2017 and 2018. Assemblage composition and relative abundances from each method were compared, and spatial and temporal assemblage changes from metabarcoding data were investigated using nonmetric multidimensional scaling. Metabarcoding differed from microscopy in multiple taxonomic assignments and relative abundances, with poor correlation for most categories. Diatoms were overrepresented by metabarcoding relative to microscopy, and chlorophytes underrepresented. However, metabarcoding revealed seasonal and spatial patterns in assemblage, detected seasonal patterns within phytoplankton sequences of very low abundance, and detected potential cryptic speciation within the lake's dominant Dunaliella viridis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed greater phytoplankton diversity than observed before in GSL, but demonstrated the need to improve taxonomic assignment of the resulting sequences, particularly within the diatoms. The expansion of detectable diversity and isolation of DNA sequences that can be traced through time and analyzed against environmental variables make metabarcoding a potentially effective tool for parallel use with microscopy in future GSL research.

Occurrence and distribution of emerging contaminants in mine-impacted lake water and potential use as co-tracers of anthropogenic activity in the subarctic region, Northwest Territories, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The emerging contaminant (EC) perchlorate (ClO4-), a blasting agent widely used in mining and refining operations, has been used as a practical indicator of mining activities. Widespread occurrence of ECs, such as pharmaceutical compounds, artificial sweeteners, and perfluoroalkyl substances, and their use as co-tracers of wastewater associated with anthropogenic activities in the urban and Arctic environments have been previously investigated. However, limited studies have reported the occurrence of these ECs and the feasibility of their use as co-tracers of anthropogenic activities in pristine waterbodies (e.g., continuous permafrost region) that receive effluent from mine sites. In this study, water samples were collected from the surface of 10 lakes within the Coppermine and Lockhart Watersheds in the continuous permafrost region in the Northwest Territories, Canada during the open water seasons of 2016, 2017, and 2018. Concentrations of 16 ECs were determined to delineate the spatial and temporal distribution of these compounds in waterbodies receiving effluent from mine sites. Slightly elevated concentrations of ClO4- (100-700 ng L-1), caffeine (0.2-5.9 ng L-1), acesulfame-K (0.5-1.5 ng L-1), perfluomoctanoic acid (PFOA; 5-34 ng L-1), perfluomoctane sulfonic acid (PFOS; 11-40 ng L-1), chloride (1.5-2.3 mg L-1), and sulfate (1.0-3.6 mg L-1) were observed across the two investigated watersheds, especially downstream of the mining sites. The concurrence of elevated concentrations of these target ECs combined with other dissolved constituents (chloride and sulfate) may indicate the influence of mining activity on the receiving waterbodies and the potential use of these compounds as co-indicators of anthmpogenic activity. Results from this study provide novel information on the distribution of 16 ECs in pristine waterbodies that receive effluents from mining sites in the Canadian subarctic in advance of more expansive human development and increased warming and melting of mine sites, including mine wastes.																			0013-9351	1096-0953				MAY 1	2022	207								112034	10.1016/j.envres.2021.112034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.112034		JAN 2022						34562482					WOS:000751879000005

An attempt to quantify the impact of changes in wetland extent on methane emissions on the seasonal and interannual time scales	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Climate variability impacts CH4 wetland sources as changes in flux density per unit area and via expansion or contraction of wetland areas in response to surface hydrological processes. This paper is a first attempt to isolate the role of varying wetland area on the seasonal and interannual variability of CH4 wetland emissions over the past decade. Wetland area extent at monthly intervals was provided over the period 1993-2000 by a suite of satellite observations from multiple sensors. The regionally variable fraction of wetland area was optimized using satellite observations of flooded area as a first estimate and further adjusted to match the seasonal cycle of CH4 fluxes retrieved from a global atmospheric inversion. Wetland flux densities of CH4 were calculated by coupling the ORCHIDEE global vegetation model with a process-based wetland CH4 emission model, calibrated by optimizing its parameters at the site level against representative CH4 flux time series. For boreal bogs north of 50 degrees N, we found that variations in area contributed about 30% to the annual flux. For temperate and tropical wetlands, the variations in area has almost no influence on the annual CH4 emissions but contributes significantly to the seasonal behavior, accounting for 40% and 66% of the seasonal amplitude of fluxes, respectively. In contrast, the interannual variability of wetland area appears to be the dominant cause of interannual variations in regional CH4 emissions from wetlands at all latitudes (largest in the tropics), with up to 90% of annual flux anomalies explained by wetland area anomalies in some years. For example, in 1998, boreal wetlands north of 50 degrees N contributed to approximately 80% of the positive anomaly according to our calculations. We also found that climate anomalies can lead to both increased emitting areas and decreased flux densities at the same time, with opposite effects on the total CH4 flux entering the atmosphere. With a view to forecasting the future trajectory of atmospheric methane content, our results point to the absolute necessity to be able to predict the variations in wetland extent, a hydrological problem, in order to affirm the reliability of simulations of changing methane emissions perturbed by climate.

J	Couture, S; Houle, D; Gagnon, C				Couture, Suzanne; Houle, Daniel; Gagnon, Christian			Increases of dissolved organic carbon in temperate and boreal lakes in Quebec, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Increases in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations have been reported in surface waters worldwide in the last 10 to 20 years. The causes behind these increases have been attributed to many factors, including climate change and decreasing depositions of atmospheric sulphate (SO42-). Trends in DOC concentrations and their potential causal factors were examined in a network of 30 lakes lying in undisturbed temperate and boreal catchments in the province of Quebec, Canada. Temporal trends in lake DOC concentrations were analysed with the seasonal Kendall test. For each lake, the variation in DOC concentration over time was assessed in light of the variation in SO42- concentration in precipitation, air temperature, precipitation and solar radiation using the forward stepwise multiple regression. Between 1989 and 2006, significant increases in DOC were observed in most of the lakes, the mean rate of change being 0.05 mg L-1 year(-1). Lake DOC concentrations were significantly explained by different models that yielded a variance explanation ranging from 13% to 77%. The models included long-term temperature variables (i.e. averaged over intervals of 10 years), short-term precipitation variables (i.e. summed over intervals 6 months), radiation (i.e. ice-free period prior to the DOC observation) and precipitation SO42- concentration as explanatory variables. Temporal changes in DOC concentrations seem more consistent with the evolution of climate parameters rather than SO42- concentrations despite the fact that most lakes were in the process of recovery, showing increases in pH.

Leopards (Panthera pardus) and spotted hyenas (Crocuta Crocuta) are higher order predators that are data deficient across much of their East African range and in Uganda, excepting for one peer-reviewed study on hyenas, there are presently no credible population estimates for these species. A lack of information on the population status and even baseline densities of these species has ramifications as leopards are drawcards for the photo-tourism industry, and along with hyenas are often responsible for livestock depredations from pastoralist communities. Leopards are also sometimes hunted for sport. Establishing baseline density estimates for these species is urgently needed not only for population monitoring purposes, but in the design of sustainable management offtakes, and in assessing certain conservation interventions like financial compensation for livestock depredation. Accordingly, we ran a single-season survey of these carnivores in the Lake Mburo National Park of south-western Uganda using 60 remote camera traps distributed in a paired format at 30 locations. We analysed hyena and leopard detections under a Bayesian spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) modelling framework to estimate their densities. This small national park (370 km(2)) is surrounded by Bahima pastoralist communities with high densities of cattle on the park edge (with regular park incursions). Leopard densities were estimated at 6.31 individuals/100 km(2) (posterior SD = 1.47, 95% CI [3.75-9.20]), and spotted hyena densities were 10.99 individuals/100 km 2 , but with wide confidence intervals (posterior SD = 3.35, 95% CI [5.63-17.37]). Leopard and spotted hyena abundance within the boundaries of the national park were 24.87 (posterior SD 7.78) and 39.07 individuals (posterior = SD 13.51) respectively. Leopard densities were on the middle end of SECR studies published in the peer-reviewed literature over the last 5 years while spotted hyena densities were some of the first reported in the literature using SECR, and similar to a study in Botswana which reported 11.80 spotted hyenas/100 km(2). Densities were not noticeably lower at the park edge, and in the southwest of our study site, despite repeated cattle incursions into these areas. We postulate that the relatively high densities of both species in the region could be owed to impala Aepyceros melampus densities ranging from 16.6-25.6 impala/km(2). Another, potential explanatory variable (albeit a speculative one) is the absence of interspecific competition from African lions (Panthera leo), which became functionally extinct (there is only one male lion present) in the park nearly two decades ago. This study provides the first robust population estimate of these species anywhere in Uganda and suggests leopards and spotted hyenas continue to persist in the highly modified landscape of Lake Mburo National Park.

J	Zavattieri, AM; Gutiérrez, PR; Monti, M				Zavattieri, Ana M.; Gutierrez, Pedro R.; Monti, Mariana			Middle Triassic freshwater green algae and fungi of the Puesto Viejo Basin, central-western Argentina: palaeoenvironmental implications	ALCHERINGA												Diverse freshwater green algal microfossils and dispersed fungal spores among rich terrestrial palynofloras were recovered from the upper part of the Quebrada de los Fosiles Formation, Puesto Viejo Group, cropping-out in the fault-bounded San Rafael Basin, Mendoza Province, Argentina. Sedimentological data suggest that the vegetation recorded from this unit grew in floodplains of high-sinuosity fluvial systems when intense episodic volcanic activity provided great quantities of ash deposits to the sites. Small and temporary shallow lake deposits and thin peat ponds were recorded at two sections, yielding palynofloras composed of variable contents of spores, pollen, freshwater algae and fungal associations. The taxa described and illustrated herein consist of representatives of colonial Chlorophyta algae (Botryococcus), a diverse group of Zygnematales zygospores represented by the genera Lecaniella, Maculatasporites, Mehlisphaeridium, Ovoidites and the incertae sedis algae Leiosphaeridia and Retirotundia as well as representatives of fungi assigned to Microsporonites and Portalites. Two new species of Ovoidites are described herein, Ovoidites tripartitus and Ovoidites circumplicatus, and the new combination Ovoidites scissus is also presented. The terrestrial and aquatic vegetation grew associated with shallow water bodies in floodplain environments developed under warm temperate, strongly seasonal climatic conditions. The environment was stressed by volcanism that probably restricted the colonization and development of the ecosystem. The occurrence of algal microfossils in the Quebrada de los Fosiles Formation suggest shallow and episodic locally restricted aquatic environments inhabited by autochthonous freshwater green algae consistent with the sedimentological evidence. A Middle Triassic age is inferred from recent radiometric dating obtained from the basal and upper ignimbrite beds of the Quebrada de los Fosiles Formation indicate an age of 243.9 +/- 2.0 Ma and 235.8 +/- 2.0 Ma, respectively, thus mostly constrained to the Ladinian age. The composition of the fossil flora (palynoflora and macroflora) also indicates Middle Triassic age. Ana M.

Tidal influence in redbeds: A palaeoenvironmental and biochronostratigraphic reconstruction of the Lower Tremp Formation (South-Central Pyrenees, Spain) around the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The Upper Cretaceous-Paleogene deposits of the Grey Unit, the Lower Red Unit and the Suterranya Limestone of the Tremp Formation (South-Central Pyrenees) preserve sedimentological and palaeontological features that suggest a connection with marine settings and which allow the age of these deposits to be reviewed. The deduced sedimentary environments for the Grey Unit and the Suterranya Limestone - lagoonal and coastal lake environments respectively - agree with those proposed by previous authors. However, a new depositional setting is proposed for the Lower Red Unit, that of a mixed-energy zone in a tide-dominated delta. This new interpretation is based on the presence of inclined heterolithic stratification in point bar deposits, along with flaser and lenticular bedding and the presence of in situ marine fossils - including those of planktonic foraminifera - and glauconite grains. These foraminifera were almost certainly transported, as a suspended load, from the open sea into meandering channels on flood tides. Their associated biostratigraphy suggests a Maastrichtian age for the Grey Unit and Lower Red Unit, and a late Danian age for the Suterranya Limestone. There is a significant hiatus between latter and former units that covers most of the Danian, and presumably includes the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jia, HF; Sun, ZX; Li, GH				Jia, Haifeng; Sun, Zhaoxia; Li, Guanghe			A four-stage constructed wetland system for treating polluted water from an urban river	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												A four-stage wetland was constructed to improve the water quality and flow pattern of a heavily polluted river in Luzhi Town, a water town in the Taihu Lake region of China. The four-stage constructed wetland system is composed of four interlinked units: a rapid filter, a down-flow subsurface constructed wetland, an up-flow subsurface constructed wetland, and a surface flow constructed wetland. The concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrogen and phosphorus, along the flow path of the constructed wetland, were measured and the pollutant removal efficiencies were calculated. The average removal rate over the whole wetland system was around 60% for COD and total phosphorus (TP), and around 70% for total nitrogen (TN) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N). The total annual reduction in COD, TN, NH4+-N, and TP by the whole system was about 3.16 t/yr, 0.57 t/yr, 0.13 t/yr, and 0.03 t/yr, respectively. Following treatment of river water via the four-stage constructed wetland system, significant improvements resulted in the water quality and flow pattern of the polluted river. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.

Relating dung fungal spore influx rates to animal density in a temperate environment: Implications for palaeoecological studies	HOLOCENE												The management of the remainder of Europe's once extensive forests is hampered by a poor understanding of the character of the vegetation and drivers of change before the onset of clearance for farming. Pollen data indicate a closed-canopy, mixed-deciduous forest, contrasting with the assertion that large herbivores would have maintained a mosaic of open grassland, regenerating scrub and forested groves. Coprophilous fungal spores from sedimentary sequences are increasingly used as a proxy for past herbivore impact on vegetation, but the method faces methodological and taphonomical issues. Using pollen trap data from a long-running experiment in Chillingham Wild Cattle Park, UK, we investigate the first steps in the mechanisms connecting herbivore density to the incorporation of fungal spores in sediments and assess the effects of environmental variables on this relationship. Herbivore utilisation levels correlate with dung fungal spore abundance. Chillingham is densely populated by large herbivores, but dung fungal spore influx is low. Herbivores may thus be present on the landscape but go undetected. The absence of dung fungal spores is therefore less informative than their presence. Dung fungal spores likely enter the sediment record through a different pathway from wind-borne pollen and thus dung fungal abundance is better expressed as influx rates than as percentage of total pollen. Landscape openness, vegetation type and site wetness do not distort the impact of utilisation levels on dung fungal spore representation. However, dung fungal spore influx varies markedly between seasons and years. Spores travel, leading to a background level of spore deposition across the landscape, and at times a depletion of spores, especially under wet weather conditions. Animal behaviour, as well as husbandry practices, can lead to the accumulation of dung, and thus fungal spores, in specific locations on the landscape that do not directly reflect grazing pressure.					; Shaw, Helen/AAL-1933-2021	Shaw, Helen/0000-0002-3887-741X; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2020	30	2					218	232	0959683619875804	10.1177/0959683619875804	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683619875804		SEP 2019											WOS:000491765200001

A better understanding of the physical processes controlling turbulent exchange dynamics over lakes is crucial to improve the numerical modelling of the lake-climate interaction. Four years of continuous measurements of energy and CO2 fluxes are conducted over a shallow highland lake (Lake Erhai) in China using eddy covariance (EC) technique from 2012 to 2015. It is found that the latent heat flux (LE) and sensible heat flux (H) has distinct diurnal and seasonal variations. The diurnal H and LE ranges from -31 to 21W/m(2) and from 31 to 171W/m(2), respectively. The heat is stored in the lake from January to June and released from July to the end of the year. The annual total evaporation of Lake Erhai varies from 1120.8 to 1228.5mm/a, which is always higher than the annual total precipitation. On diurnal scale, the CO2 uptake is observed during most of the midday period. On an annual scale, the Lake Erhai behaves as a net CO2 source, with an annual CO2 budget ranging from 117.5 to 161.7gCm(-2) a(-1). The temperature difference (T) between the water surface (T-s) and the air temperature (T-a), and the product of T and wind speed (U) are the major drivers of H from half-hourly to monthly scale. The main factors controlling LE are U and the product of U and the vapour pressure difference (VPD) on half-hourly and daily scales, the total cloud cover, and net radiation (R-n) on the monthly scale. Photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) and U has a close relationship with half-hourly and daily CO2 fluxes, respectively, while annual precipitation and T-s has a larger effect on annual CO2 fluxes.					; Liu, Huizhi/AAH-6107-2020; Du, Qun/AAJ-6868-2020; Wang, Lei/A-7836-2018; Liu, Yang/AAK-4123-2020	Du, Qun/0000-0002-2273-1854; liu, Huizhi/0000-0003-2875-419X; Xu, Anlun/0000-0003-1966-4627													0899-8418	1097-0088				NOV 15	2018	38	13					4723	4739		10.1002/joc.5692	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.5692													WOS:000450222100004

It hosts extensive reed stands that have colonized different habitat types. Two different stands were compared: a lake stand not directly influenced by the intermittent River Strzen and a riparian stand near River Strzen. Reed productivity (growth and assimilate allocation) was monitored for these reed stand types over 13 years (2007-2019), and this measurement was compared to monthly water levels and air temperatures. Reeds from the lake reed stand were significantly shorter with a lower shoot density, overall biomass production, and ratio of flowering plants. A correlation analysis revealed stronger and more numerous significant correlations between environmental and reed productivity parameters for the lake reed stand compared to the riparian reed stand. The variabilities of the growth and assimilate allocation parameters in the lake reed stand were both mostly explained by the combined water levels for June and July, which explained 47% and 52% of the variability, respectively. The most influential temperatures were in May, which explained 29% and 19% of the variability of growth and assimilate allocation parameters, respectively. For the riparian reed stand, water levels and temperatures out of the vegetation season appeared more important. Therefore, habitats with permanent water are more suitable for reeds than those with fluctuating water. However, fluctuating water conditions are expected to become more common due to climate change.

Changing snow depth in the Great Lakes basin (USA): Implications and trends	ANTHROPOCENE												In the Great Lakes basin of North America, snow plays a critical role in the regional hydroclimate, where snow ablation events can serve both as a resource and a hazard. The frequency and magnitude of an ablation event is governed by the availability of meteorological conditions to ablate snow, and the physical presence of snow to be ablated. While the meteorological conditions leading to ablation have been well documented, examining changes in atmospheric conditions alone have been unable to completely explain observed ablation trends. As such, this study applies a gridded snow depth dataset to evaluate snow depth variability, while speaking to the implications of such variability on ablation frequency and water resources. Snow cover is present in the basin from November - April, with the more northerly regions (Lake Superior and Lake Huron basins) exhibiting a deeper and more seasonally-persistent snowpack. Seasonal basin-wide snow depth decreased by approximately 25% from 1960 to 2009, with some of the most significant decreases occurring north of Lake Superior. Surface air temperatures are negatively associated snow depth, and warming temperatures are likely contributing to snow depth declines. These regional decreases in snow depth spatially corroborate previously observed decreases in the frequency of ablation events in the basin, and highlight the importance of examining both snow cover and meteorological conditions when seeking to explain snow ablation variability. The results from this study can be applied to inform water resource management decisions in the region. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Interannual variations in the hydrothermal regime around a thermokarst lake in Beiluhe, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Thermokarst is a term associated with the thaw of ice-rich permafrost and the resulting formation of irregular depressions in the landscape from thaw settlement. Thermokarst lakes may subsequently develop from ponds formed in depressions. These lakes commonly have collapsing shorelines, and the development of thermokarst terrain and associated thermal erosion may significantly influence the stability of infrastructure and the hydro thermal conditions of the surrounding permafrost. In this study, we examined interannual variations in the hydrothermal regime of a thermokarst lake in Beiluhe Basin based on field data measured in 2006-2013. The timing and nature of lake ice growth and melt were recorded. We observed considerable seasonal differences in lake water level (similar to 0.5 m) and differences in water level between the lake and the water table in the surrounding ground (over 1.0 m). The nearly-saturated ground at the lakeshore (similar to 35% in maximum volumetric water content) highlights the seepage effect from the lake to the surrounding ground. The vertical temperature profile from +2 m (air) to - 2 m (lake bottom) and to 60 m depth in the ground was measured. The annual mean air temperature, lake-surface temperature, and annual mean lake-bottom temperature in 2010-2011 were approximately -3.6, 0.4, and >5 degrees C, respectively. The thermal offsets between the air and the lake surface and between the lake surface and lake bottom were 3 and 7 degrees C, respectively. The annual mean lake-bottom temperatures ranged from 23 to 6.9 degrees C at water depths from 1.2 to 2.1 m. The asymmetry of the bathymetry has resulted in distinct thermal regimes beneath the lake bottom in different locations. A through-talik was present at the deepest side of the lake, but some permafrost extended laterally beneath the lake bottom at the shallower side, forming an hourglass shape in cross section at one end. Lateral thermal erosion along the lakeshore was linked to the lake-bottom temperature and lake depth. Variation in permafrost table depth from the lake center to the lakeshore was greater on the east side near deeper water (>= m) than at the west side where water was shallower (<= 70 cm). The results from this study have highlighted the hydrothermal relations between thermokarst lake development and permafrost conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Kettle holes mostly undergo pronounced wet-dry cycles. Fluctuations in water table, land-use, and management can affect sediment biogeochemical transformations and perhaps threaten the carbon stocks of these unique ecosystems. We investigated sediment and water of 51 kettle holes in NE Germany that differ in hydroperiod (i.e. the duration of the wet period of a kettle hole) and land-use. Our objectives were 1) to test if hydroperiod and land management were imprinted on the isotopic values (delta C-13, delta N-15) and C:N ratios of the sediment OM, and 2) to characterize water loss dynamics and kettle hole-groundwater connectivity by measuring the stable 6150 and BD isotope values of kettle hole water over several years. We found the uppermost sediment layer reflected recent OM inputs and short-term processes in the catchment, including land-use and management effects. Deeper sediments recorded the degree to which OM is processed within the kettle hole related to the hydroperiod. We see clear indications for the effects of wet-dry cycles for all kettle holes, which can lead to the encroachment of terrestrial plants. We found that the magnitude of evaporation depended on the year, season, and land-use type, that kettle holes are temporarily coupled to shallow ground water, and, as such, kettle holes are described best as partially-closed to open systems.

The result demonstrated that concentrations of the elements exhibited significant seasonality. The high total element concentrations were detected at sites close to the intensive mining and urban activities. The concentrations of the elements were under the permissible limits as prescribed by related standards with a few exceptions. The most of heavy metal pollution index (HPI) values were lower than the critical index limit, indicating the basically clean water used as habitat for aquatic life. As was identified as the priority pollutant of non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic concerns, and the inhabitants ingesting the surface water at particular site might be subjected to the integrated health risks for exposure to the mixed trace elements. Multivariate statistical analyses confirmed that Zn, As, Cd, and Tl were derived from mining and urban activities; V, Cd, and Pb exhibited mixed origin; and Co, Ni, and Cu mainly resulted from natural processes. Three categorized risk areas corresponded to high, moderate, and low risks, respectively.

The biomass of C. japonica comprises more than 90% of the total biomass of the macrobenthos in Lake Shinji. However, to manage this resource optimally, knowledge of the seasonal fluctuations of bivalve populations is required. Environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly being used to estimate the distribution and biomass of aquatic organisms. We used eDNA to estimate the distribution of a C. japonica population in Lake Shinji, Japan, to elucidate the environmental factors driving its habitat preferences in the lake. The eDNA concentrations of C. japonica along the eastern coast were significantly higher than those on the other coasts of the lake. Furthermore, eDNA concentrations fluctuated seasonally. eDNA concentrations of C. japonica were positively correlated with salinity at sampling sites, suggesting that preferred habitats were associated with salinity. The eDNA method represents a potentially useful monitoring tool, requiring minimal labor and time, to complement or replace conventional bivalve resource surveys and could be useful for the management of the C. japonica fishery. The present study confirmed its utility for estimating the seasonal distribution patterns and habitat preferences of C. japonica in Lake Shinji.

Y.; van den Broeke, Michiel R.; Herring, Thomas			Greenland Ice Sheet flow response to runoff variability	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												We use observations of ice sheet surface motion from a Global Positioning System network operating from 2006 to 2014 around North Lake in west Greenland to investigate the dynamical response of the Greenland Ice Sheet's ablation area to interannual variability in surface melting. We find no statistically significant relationship between runoff season characteristics and ice flow velocities within a given year or season. Over the 7 year time series, annual velocities at North Lake decrease at an average rate of similar to 0.9 perpendicular to 1.1 myr(-2), consistent with the negative trend in annual velocities observed in neighboring regions over recent decades. We find that net runoff integrated over several preceding years has a negative correlation with annual velocities, similar to findings from the two other available decadal records of ice velocity in western Greenland. However, we argue that this correlation is not necessarily evidence for a direct hydrologic mechanism acting on the timescale of multiple years but could be a statistical construct. Finally, we stress that neither the decadal slowdown trend nor the negative correlation between velocity and integrated runoff is predicted by current ice-sheet models, underscoring that these models do not yet capture all the relevant feedbacks between runoff and ice dynamics needed to predict long-term trends in ice sheet flow.					; Joughin, Ian/A-2998-2008; van den Broeke, Michiel Roland/F-7867-2011; Herring, Thomas/NPI-8957-2025; Behn, Mark/F-5813-2012; Van den Broeke, Michiel/F-7867-2011	Stevens, Laura A./0000-0003-0480-8018; Herring, Thomas/0000-0002-6030-0545; Joughin, Ian/0000-0001-6229-679X; van den Broeke, Michiel Roland/0000-0003-4662-7565; Behn, Mark/0000-0002-2001-1335; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				NOV	2016	43	21					11295	11303		10.1002/2016GL070414	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016GL070414													WOS:000389305000037

An analysis of MODIS-derived algal and mineral turbidity in Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Satellite-derived estimates of chlorophyll concentrations based on colour ratio algorithms traditionally fail in turbid waters such as those found in Lake Erie, resulting in chlorophyll concentrations often orders of magnitude in error and spatial distributions mirroring that of known suspended sediment distributions. Methods are presented here that were used to simultaneously extract algal and mineral suspended particulate matter for Lake Erie from the red and near-infrared bands of NASA's MODIS-Aqua sensor. Results produced spatially and temporally distinct seasonal cycles in agreement with bio-geo-physical processes on the lake. Derived imagery was used to monitor seasonal cycles of both algal and mineral particulate matter on the lake and determine areas of persistently elevated concentrations that may highlight regions of potential water quality concern.

We assessed the CH4 emissions of a drained and a rewetted temperate fen including emissions of managed and unmanaged drainage ditches over the course of 2.5 years, covering three vegetation periods. Ditch CH4 emissions in the rewetted fen were significantly higher than in the drained fen. In the rewetted fen ditches contributed up to 91% of the annual CH4 budget, despite covering only 1.5% of the area. In the drained fen CH4 emissions were solely made up of ditch emissions. When including CH4 uptake by the peat soil, the CH4 balance of the drained fen was neutral. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations likely had an enhancing effect on CH4 emissions while nitrate and sulfate in the ditch water seem to have had an inhibitory effect. Air and water temperature controlled seasonal variability of ebullitive as well as diffusive CH4 emissions. Ebullition contributed less than 10% to the overall CH4 budget in the ditches. Drainage ditches represent a hotspot of CH4 emissions and need therefore be taken into account when assessing the success of rewetting projects of peatlands.					; Guenther, Anke/LMN-0345-2024; Jurasinski, Gerald/AAH-6376-2021	Kohn, Daniel/0000-0001-5435-8831; Gunther, Anke/0000-0003-4419-1892; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				AUG	2021	41	6							71	10.1007/s13157-021-01465-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-021-01465-y													WOS:000691579000003

Often, ALT is measured through direct ground-based measurements. Recently, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements from airborne platforms have emerged as a method for observing seasonal thaw subsidence, soil moisture, and ALT in permafrost regions. This study validates airborne SAR-derived ALT estimates in three regions of Alaska, USA using calibrated ground penetrating radar (GPR) geophysical data. The remotely sensed ALT estimates matched the field observations within uncertainty for 79% of locations. The average uncertainty for the GPR-derived ALT validation dataset was 0.14 m while the average uncertainty for the SAR-derived ALT in pixels coincident with GPR data was 0.19 m. In the region near Utqiavik, the remotely sensed ALT appeared slightly larger than field observations while in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta region, the remotely sensed ALT appeared slightly smaller than field observations. In the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, near Toolik Lake, there was minimal bias between the field data and remotely sensed estimates. These findings suggest that airborne SAR-derived ALT estimates compare well with in situ probing and GPR, making SAR an effective tool to monitor permafrost measurements.					; Zhao, Yu-Huan/AAG-4792-2020; Clayton, Leah/OIT-9295-2025; Chen, Richard/HZM-2413-2023; Wig, Elizabeth/JQI-9390-2023	Huang, Lingcao/0000-0003-3072-7334; zebker, howard/0000-0001-9931-5237; Parsekian, Andrew/0000-0001-5072-9818; Sullivan, Taylor/0000-0001-6293-3015; Wig, Elizabeth/0000-0002-8604-0155; Michaelides, Roger/0000-0002-7577-6829; SCHAEFER, KEVIN/0000-0002-5444-9917; Clayton, Leah/0000-0002-7493-8101; 														2072-4292				AUG	2021	13	15							2876	10.3390/rs13152876	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13152876													WOS:000682348200001

Little is known about anoxia in earlier historic times under weaker human impact, or under prehistoric natural conditions with different trophic, land cover and climatic regimes. We use a novel approach that combines high-resolution hyperspectral imaging with mu-XRF and HPLC-pigment data, which allows us to assess chloropigments (productivity) and bacteriopigments (anoxia) at seasonal subvarve-scale resolution. Our similar to 9700 cal a BP varved sediment record from NE Poland suggests that productivity increased stepwise from oligotrophic Early Holocene conditions (until similar to 9200 cal a BP) to mesotrophic conditions in the Mid- and Late Holocene. Natural eutrophication was mainly a function of progressing landscape evolution with intense weathering under dense forest and warm-moist climatic conditions. Generally, anoxia increased with increasing productivity. Seasonal anoxia and some multi-decadal periods of meromixis were the common mixing patterns throughout the Holocene except for a period of persisting meromixis between similar to 5200 and 2000 cal a BP. Anthropogenic deforestation around 400 cal a BP resulted in substantially better lake oxygenation despite high productivity. In this small lake, aquatic productivity and lakeshore forest cover (wind shield) were more important factors controlling oxic/anoxic conditions than Holocene temperature variability.

Calcite precipitation in Lake Powell reduces alkalinity and total salt loading to the Lower Colorado River Basin	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Reservoirs can retain and transform carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and silica, but less is known about their effects on other biogeochemically relevant solutes. The salinization of freshwater ecosystems is a growing concern in many regions, and the role of reservoirs in salinity transport is an important research frontier. Here, we examine how a large desert southwest reservoir, Lake Powell, has altered the downstream transport of total dissolved solids (TDSs) as well as the dominant cations and anions comprising the TDS pool (SO42-, HCO3-, and Ca2+). Average downstream TDS concentrations have declined significantly since river impoundment and seasonal fluctuations in TDS concentrations have become more modulated, but year to year variation in TDS concentrations has remained similar. While some of the reductions in TDS concentration can be attributed to watershed management, we find that Lake Powell retains about 10% of the TDS loaded to the system (1991 Mg TDS d(-1)). Much of this retention is occurring in the forms of calcium and bicarbonate, likely via calcite precipitation, and is equivalent to an average burial of 522 mg C m(-2) d(-1), thus reducing the alkalinity of downstream water. Flow-weighted modeling suggests that, in the absence of Lake Powell, downstream salinity limits would be surpassed at the outflow to Lake Powell 41% of the time (vs. 0% of the time currently). Understanding the dominant mechanisms regulating solute transport through the reservoir is important given the relevance for downstream drinking water and irrigation concerns, biogeochemical cycling, and the high potential for reduced flows in the future.

Proxy benchmarks for intercomparison of 8.2 ka simulations	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP3) now includes the 8.2 ka event as a test of model sensitivity to North Atlantic freshwater forcing. To provide benchmarks for intercomparison, we compiled and analyzed high-resolution records spanning this event. Two previously-described anomaly patterns that emerge are cooling around the North Atlantic and drier conditions in the Northern Hemisphere tropics. Newer to this compilation are more robustly-defined wetter conditions in the Southern Hemisphere tropics and regionally-limited warming in the Southern Hemisphere. Most anomalies around the globe lasted on the order of 100 to 150 yr. More quantitative reconstructions are now available and indicate cooling of similar to 1 degrees C and a similar to 20% decrease in precipitation in parts of Europe as well as spatial gradients in delta O-18 from the high to low latitudes. Unresolved questions remain about the seasonality of the climate response to freshwater forcing and the extent to which the bipolar seesaw operated in the early Holocene.					anderson, david/E-6416-2011	Morrill, Carrie/0000-0002-1635-5469; Anderson, David/0000-0001-9507-6777; Gross, Wendy/0000-0002-4468-8666													1814-9324						2013	9	1					423	432		10.5194/cp-9-423-2013	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-9-423-2013													WOS:000316961900026

Persistence of amphibian metapopulation occupancy in dynamic wetlandscapes	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Context Occupancy and persistence of amphibian populations in patchy wetland habitats is influenced by landscape heterogeneity, species traits, and hydroclimatic variability. Such information is helpful for understanding the key drivers for reported world-wide declines in amphibian populations over past decades. Objectives The overarching goal of this study is to investigate how the combination of dynamic patch habitat attributes, as influenced by stochastic hydroclimatic forcing and landscape heterogeneity, and species traits drive long-term spatiotemporal patterns of wetland patch occupancy for amphibian metapopulations. Methods We used a data-model synthesis approach, integrating a long-term record of monitoring for Rana pipiens with simulations using a dynamic stochastic patch occupancy model, which links parsimonious representations of ecohydrological dynamics. Analyzed data were collected over a 20-yr period at the Cottonwood Lake Study Area in the Prairie Pothole Region in North Dakota, USA. Results The stability of the mean hydroclimatic forcing during the two decades of amphibian monitoring, and access to dense and diverse wetlands, contributed to persistence of the R. pipiens, despite seasonal spatiotemporal habitat dynamics. The amphibian occupancy pattern simulated for a larger domain surrounding the study area showed that the increased number of wetland habitats dampens variability in patch occupancy, contributing to persistence in the R. pipiens metapopulation. Conclusions The proposed framework is useful for understanding how spatial heterogeneity in habitat attributes and temporal variability in hydroclimatic forcing could affect metapopulation persistence in dynamic wetlandscapes. This integrated perspective can then be used to guide monitoring and management strategies based on statistically representative areas of heterogeneous and dynamic wetlandscapes.					; Bertuzzo, Enrico/U-7129-2017; Hoverman, Jason/D-1756-2013; Srinivasa Rao, Prof. P/ABG-1688-2021; Jawitz, James/G-5819-2013	Rao, P.

Robust and detailed comparison of well-dated and annually laminated sediment records is crucial for reconstructing abrupt and regionally time-transgressive changes as well as validation of spatial and temporal trajectories of past climatic changes. The VARved sediments DAtabase (VARDA) presented here is the first data compilation for varve chronologies and associated palaeoclimatic proxy records. The current version 1.0 allows detailed comparison of published varve records from 95 lakes. VARDA is freely accessible and was created to assess outputs from climate models with high-resolution terrestrial palaeoclimatic proxies. VARDA additionally provides a technical environment that enables us to explore the database of varved lake sediments using a connected data model and can generate a state-of-the-art graphic representation of a multisite comparison. This allows the reassessment of existing chronologies and tephra events to synchronize and compare even distant varved lake records. Furthermore, the present version of VARDA permits the exploration of varve thickness data. In this paper, we report in detail on the data-mining and compilation strategies for the identification of varved lakes and assimilation of high-resolution chronologies, as well as the technical infrastructure of the database. Additional palaeoclimatic proxy data will be provided in forthcoming updates.					; Neugebauer, Ina/AAG-2278-2020; Blanchet, Cecile/C-6370-2013	Koppl, Matthias/0009-0002-1393-1288; Pinkerneil, Sylvia/0009-0009-3564-4416; Ramisch, Arne/0000-0002-0173-4829; Neugebauer, Ina/0000-0002-8612-6573; Dorn, Mario/0000-0002-4761-1648; Brauser, Alexander/0000-0002-4411-3205; Blanchet, Cecile/0000-0002-7146-705X; Brauer, Achim/0000-0002-6655-9451; Schroder, Birgit/0000-0003-4807-6357													1866-3508	1866-3516				SEP 25	2020	12	3					2311	2332		10.5194/essd-12-2311-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-2311-2020													WOS:000575778400001

Studies proved high OPE detection in Yangtze River water, but there is limited information about the spatiotemporal distribution and transport flux of OPEs in sediment. The present study investigated 16 OPEs in sediment from upstream to mid-downstream of the Yangtze River. The mean concentration of OPEs was 84.30 ng/g, and alkyl-OPEs was the primary component. Great specific surface area and high content of organic carbon significantly increased OPE concentration in Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) by physical adsorption and chemical bonds (p p < 0.05), making TGR the most contaminated area in mainstream. No significant differences in OPE constituents were found in seasonal distribution. Four potential sources of OPEs were identified by principal component analysis and self-organizing maps, and traffic emissions were the dominant source for OPEs. The hazard quotient model results indicated that aryl-OPEs showed moderate risks in the mainstream of Yangtze River, alkyl-OPEs and Cl-OPEs showed low risks. TGR was a significant sink of OPEs in Yangtze River and buried 7.41 tons of OPEs in 2020, a total of 14.87 tons of OPE were transported into the sea by sediment.

The Negro River is the sixth-largest river in the world by water volume and contains two complex anabranching systems, the Anavilhanas and Mariua archipelagos, and despite its importance, there is a lack of hydrological survey data on its multichannel reaches. The objective of this study was to analyse the fluvial dynamics of the lower Negro River and the morphodynamics of the Anavilhanas Archipelago channels in the Amazon basin. The analysed set of fluviometric surveys and cartographic data indicated that the average water velocity and depth of the channels were the most sensitive variables for water discharge variability. In addition, the reduction in the width/depth ratio of the channels in the Anavilhanas region is associated with an increased number of islands, but not with a fluvial transport capacity increase. These landforms play an important role in modulating flood wave dynamics in the lower reach of the Negro River. Seasonal water storage occurs in the channels and lakes of the archipelago due to the backwater effect caused by the Amazon River, which is the main control in the spatiotemporal variation of water discharge along the Anavilhanas Archipelago.

J	Musie, M; Momblanch, A; Sen, S				Musie, Mulugeta; Momblanch, Andrea; Sen, Sumit			Exploring future global change-induced water imbalances in the Central Rift Valley Basin, Ethiopia	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Lake Ziway, the only freshwater lake in Ethiopia's Central Rift Valley basin, has been the source for irrigation, floriculture, fish farming and domestic water supply in the region for the last few decades. This study examined the impacts of the planned future agricultural developments and climate change on the lake water balance by an integrated application of the Soil Water Assessment Tool and Water Evaluation and Planning models. The future projections of precipitation and temperature from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment, CORDEX-AFRICA, under the Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5 were used for the climate change impact assessment. Nine irrigation development and climate change scenarios were developed and simulated to examine the separate and combined impacts on the lake water balance and supply coverages. The study showed that the planned future agricultural developments could result in a mean annual lake water level decline by about 0.15 m, with a considerable reduction (27% to 32%) in the outflow to the downstream Bulbula River. Climate change could increase evaporation losses from the shallow lake resulting in a drastic decrease in the lake water level, especially during the dry season. It could also significantly reduce (by about 74%) the amount of water flowing out of the lake. The combined impacts of future development and climate change are likely to reduce the supply coverages of most of the competing demands. Approaches need to be studied to minimize the lake water evaporation losses and explore water demand/supply management options.

We have monitored hydrology and stream chemistry over 3 years in ten nested catchments (0.6-15.1km(2)) with variable peatland cover (0%-22%) and groundwater influence in subarctic Sweden. Total waterborne C export, including dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), ranged between 2.8 and 7.3gm(-2)year(-1), representing similar to 10%-30% of catchment net ecosystem exchange of CO2. Several characteristics of catchment waterborne C export were affected by interacting effects of peatland cover and groundwater influence, including magnitude and timing, partitioning into DOC, POC, and DIC and chemical composition of the exported DOC. Waterborne C export was greater during the wetter years, equivalent to an average change in export of similar to 2gm(-2)year(-1) per 100mm of precipitation. Wetter years led to a greater relative increase in DIC export than DOC export due to an inferred relative shift in dominance from shallow organic flow pathways to groundwater sources. Indices of DOC composition (SUVA(254) and a(250)/a(365)) indicated that DOC aromaticity and average molecular weight increased with catchment peatland cover and decreased with increased groundwater influence. Our results provide examples on how waterborne C export and DOC composition might be affected by climate change. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The Relationship Between Continental Landscape Evolution and the Plant-Fossil Record: Long Term Hydrologic Controls on Preservation	TAPHONOMY: PROCESS AND BIAS THROUGH TIME, SECOND EDITION	Topics in Geobiology											Continental depositional environments preserve the majority of the macrofloral record since the advent of land-plant colonization in the mid-Paleozoic, and wetland representatives are encountered more commonly than those that grew under more seasonal conditions. It has been assumed that preservation potential and future recovery of plant debris are high once detritus is introduced into any appropriate environment of deposition (e.g., fluvial-lacustrine or paludal setting), regardless of prevailing associated climate, sediment load, or geochemistry at the time of emplacement or interval thereafter. If a plant fossil is identified in any part of a stratigraphic interval, even if it occurs solely as an impression, it has been presumed that favorable conditions persisted over time to facilitate this record. Conversely, the absence of fossil plants in a stratigraphic sequence commonly has been interpreted as the result of catastrophic perturbation across the landscape, rather than the ascribing their absence to taphonomic filters that may have operated millennia after burial. Terrestrial landscapes are affected by aggradational, equilibrium, and degradational processes that control not only the local or regional water table, but also the long-term fossilization potential of organic debris entombed within these sediments. Fossil plants have the highest preservation potential when high water tables are maintained long-term within soils (e.g., histosols, entisols, gleyed soils), or in settings that are maintained below the maximum draw down of the regional water table (e.g., channel barforms, abandoned channels, lakes) of aggradational landscapes. When landscapes reach equilibrium, extensive pedogenesis ensues and the development of deep mature soils (e.g., calcisols) results in the bacterial degradation of any previously buried plant debris due to extreme penetration of atmospheric gases. When sediment is removed during landscape degradation, the local and/or regional water table is reset lower in the unconsolidated stratigraphy, once again promoting rapid decay of previously buried detritus at depth. These processes, operating under time frames of centuries to millennia and longer (lath), control the ultimate preservational mode of plants recovered from the fossil record. This chapter reviews the factors influencing the preservation of terrestrial plants in both subaqueous and subaerial environments based on actualistic studies, and develops a conceptual framework for landscape evolution in continental regimes. A model is presented in which preservational mode is related to the taphonomic and sedimentary history of the landscape in which plant detritus is buried. Case studies of the plant-fossil record, ranging from the Triassic to the Eocene, in exclusively aggradational and in aggradational/degradational landscapes are presented.																			0275-0120		978-90-481-8642-6				2011	32						249	285		10.1007/978-90-481-8643-3_7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-8643-3_7	10.1007/978-90-481-8643-3												WOS:000284505600007

Here, this study investigated the spatiotemporal variations of CDOM in Fengshuba Reservoir and its catchments in China. Twenty-four surface water samples, 45 water samples (including surface water, middle water, and bottom water), and 15 pore water samples were collected from rivers, reservoir, and sediment of the reservoir, respectively. Then, three fluorescent components, namely two humic-like components (C1 and C2) and a tryptophan-like component (C3), were identified from the excitation-emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) for all samples. For spatial distributions, the levels of CDOM and two humic-like components in the reservoir were significantly lower than those in the upstream rivers (p < 0.01), indicating that the reservoir may act as a reactor to partly reduce the levels of exogenous input including CDOM and humic-like matters from the surrounding catchment. For temporal variations, the mean levels of CDOM and three fluorescent components did not significantly change in rivers, suggesting that perennial anthropic activity maybe an important factor impacting the concentration and composition of river CDOM but not the precipitation and runoff. However, these mean values of CDOM for the bulk waters of the reservoir changed markedly along with seasonal variations, indicating that the hydrological processes in the reservoir could control the quality and quantity of CDOM. The different correlations between the fluorescent components and primary water parameters in the river, reservoir, and pore water samples further suggest that the reservoir is an important factor regulating the migration and transformation of FDOM along with the variations of different environmental gradients.

J	Song, CQ; Huang, B; Ke, LH				Song, Chunqiao; Huang, Bo; Ke, Linghong			Heterogeneous change patterns of water level for inland lakes in High Mountain Asia derived from multi-mission satellite altimetry	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												High-altitude inland lakes in High Mountain Asia (HMA) are key indicators to climate change and variability as a result of mostly closed watersheds and minimal disturbance by human activities. However, examination of the spatial and temporal pattern of lake changes, especially for water-level variations, is usually limited by poor accessibility of most lakes. Recently, satellite altimeters have demonstrated their potential to monitor water level changes of terrestrial water bodies including lakes and rivers. By combining multiple satellite altimetry data provided by the Laboratoire d'Etudes en Geophysique et Oceanographie Spatiales (LEGOS) and Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) instrument on the NASA Ice, Cloud and land Elevation satellite (ICESat), this study examined water level changes of typical lakes in HMA at a longer timescale (in the 1990s and 2000s) compared with earlier studies on Tibetan lakes. Cross-evaluation of the radar altimetry data from LEGOS and laser altimetry data from ICESat/GLAS shows that they were in good agreement in depicting inter-annual, seasonal and abrupt changes of lake level. The long-term altimetry measurements reveal that water-level changes of the 18 lakes showed remarkable spatial and temporal patterns that were characterized by different trends, onsets of rapid rises and magnitudes of inter-annual variations for different lakes. During the study period, lakes in the central and northern HMA (15 lakes) showed a general growth tendency, while lakes in South Tibet (three lakes) showed significant shrinking tendency. Lakes in Central Tibet experienced rapid and stable water-level rises around mid-1990s followed by slowing growth rates after 2006. In contrast, the water-level rises of lakes in the northern and north-eastern Tibetan Plateau were characterized by abrupt increases in specific years rather than gradual growth. Meteorological data based on station observations indicate that the annual changes of water level showed strongly correlated with precipitation and evaporation but may not evidently related to the glacier melting induced by global warming.

Here, we collected surface water samples from 14 tributaries of the Yuan River, a secondary tributary of the Yangtze River, which has been heavily impacted by human activities. We characterized the bacterioplankton communities by high-throughput sequencing techniques, and managed to identify the mechanisms governing bacterioplankton community assembly. The results showed that, in general, both landscape compositions and landscape configurations had significant effects on bacterial communities, and the effects were greater at the buffer scale than at the sub-basin scale. Additionally, there was no distinct distance-decay pattern for the effects of landscape structures on bacterial communities from the near-distance (100 m) to the long-distance (1000 m) buffer zones, with the maximal effects occurring in the 1000 m circular buffer (wet season) and 500 m riparian buffer (dry season) zone, respectively. Land use influenced the bacterioplankton community both directly through exogenous inputs (mass effect) and indirectly by affecting water chemistry (species sorting). Variance partitioning analyses showed that the total explanations of bacterial community variations by water chemistry and the intersections of water chemistry and land use (56.2% in wet season and 50.4% in dry season) were higher than that of land use alone (6.1% in wet season and 25.4% in dry season). These suggest that mass effects and species sorting jointly shaped bacterial community assembly, but that the effects of species sorting outweighed those of mass effects. Nevertheless, more biotic and abiotic factors need to be considered to better understand the microbial assembly mechanisms in anthropogen- ically influenced riverine ecosystems.

Potamodromous migrations in the Magdalena River basin: bimodal reproductive patterns in neotropical rivers	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY					Symposium on Fish and Aquatic Habitat Conservation in South America during the 21st Brazilian Ichthyology Meeting	2015	Recife, BRAZIL					Magdalena River basin potamodromous fishes have two annual reproductive seasons: the subienda in the first half of the year and the mitaca in the second. Both upstream migrations are c. 30-45 days long; after that, with the onset of the rainy season, fishes spawn and remain in the river (resident individuals) or start a downstream movement (the bajanza) to return to the Magdalena floodplain lakes (nursery, shelter and feeding grounds). Due to their particular gonad development the bocachico Prochilodus magdalenae and probably the comelcn Leporinus muyscorum are physiologically able to undertake two annual basin migrations. In the presence of dams or hydropower structures, fishes are able to find alternative migration routes. Some species should be re-classified in their migratory behaviour.

Impact of seasonality and anthropogenic impoundments on dissolved organic matter dynamics in the Klamath River (Oregon/California, USA)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Rivers play a major role in the transport and processing of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Disturbances that impact DOM dynamics, such as river impoundments and flow regulation, have consequences for biogeochemical cycling and aquatic ecosystems. In this study we examined how river impoundments and hydrologic regulation impact DOM quantity and quality by tracking spatial and seasonal patterns of DOM in a large, regulated river (Klamath River, USA). Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations decreased downstream and longitudinal patterns in DOC load varied by season. Export of DOM (as DOC) was largely driven by river flow, while DOM composition was strongly influenced by impoundments. Seasonal algal blooms in upstream lentic reaches provided a steady source of algal DOM that was processed in downstream reaches. DOM at upstream sites had an average spectral slope ratio (S-R)>1, indicating algal-derived material, but decreased downstream to an average S-R<1, more indicative of terrestrial-derived material. The increasingly terrestrial nature of DOM exported from reservoirs likely reflects degraded algal material that becomes increasingly more recalcitrant with distance from upstream source and additional processing. As a result, DOM delivered to free-flowing river reaches below impoundments was less variable in composition. Downstream of impoundments, tributary influences resulted in increasing contributions of terrestrial DOM from the surrounding watershed. Removal of the four lower dams on the Klamath River is scheduled to proceed in the next decade. These results suggest that management should consider the role of impoundments on altering DOM dynamics, particularly in the context of dam removal.

In this study, water and surface sediment samples from Bumbu River (BR) and Kokolo Canal (KC, named Jerusalem River) draining Kinshasa, the capital city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo were collected during the period of 2015-2017 from the same sites to assess the status of rivers contamination by heavy metals. Water samples were characterized for temperature (T), pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and dissolved oxygen (O-2). The concentrations of heavy metals including Cu, Cr, Zn, Cd, and Pb in sediment samples were determined using Inductive Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The Hg analysis was carried out using Advanced Mercury Analyser (AMA). The evaluation of the pollution degree was based on Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) as well as probable effect levels (PELs), Enrichment Factor (EF) and Geoaccumulation Index (Igeo). Spearman's Rank-order correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) were used in order to investigate the potential source of contaminants. The results show the high seasonal variability of the water physicochemical composition; for example, pH values varied significantly during the three years and ranged from 4.49 to 8.24 and 7.05-7.81 for BR and KC, respectively. The EC values ranged between 197-396 and 198-614 mu S cm(-1) for BR and KC respectively. The highest concentrations of heavy metals in sediments reached the values of (in mg.kg(-1)) 190.2 (Cu), 58.6 (Cr), 1117.9 (Zn), 1.2(Cd), 149.2 (Pb), and 11.8 (Hg). The results indicate high variability in metal concentrations in surface sediments according to sampling period and sites. In general, all metal concentrations showed a gradual increase with time, e.g. Cd and Pb consistently increased during the three sampling years. All analysed metals were above SQGs during the year 2017 and 2 to 4 times higher than PELs. EF and Igeo showed severe enrichment to extremely severe enrichment, and moderate to extremely polluted by Zn and Pb. Correlation analysis suggested that the metal contamination in the studied sites is caused by the anthropogenic activities as well as the influence of urban effluents discharge into the river receiving systems. The results of the present study will be helpful to assess and intervening effective management strategies at the local input source pollution level and similar environments.

Temperatures and extreme precipitation events have been increasing across this region over the past three decades. Accurate, high-resolution climate simulations are critical to assessing potential climate change risk in the Lake Champlain Basin. We evaluate the performance of a regional climate model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, to downscale ERA-Interim reanalysis data to 4 km for the Lake Champlain Basin. Specifically, we compare an ensemble of five WRF experiments with different physics configurations using a one-way, triple-nested domain (36, 12, and 4 km) over three 5-year periods (1980-1984, 1995-1999, and 2010-2014) to Daymet, a gridded observational dataset. We find that WRF simulations of the Lake Champlain Basin generally reproduce the observed temperature and precipitation seasonal cycles, but have cold and wet biases. The simulation of mean temperature by WRF is most sensitive to the choice of radiation scheme, while the simulation of mean precipitation is most sensitive to the choice of radiation, cumulus, and microphysics scheme. We find that turning the cumulus scheme on improves the simulation of the precipitation seasonal cycle at a 4 km resolution, but also substantially enhances the wet bias. Using a coarser resolution (36 km) produces smaller regionally averaged precipitation biases, but not improved correlations between simulated and observed monthly precipitation. Both spatial resolution and turning the cumulus scheme off have minor effects on simulated temperature.					; Huang, Huanping/Z-6027-2019	Huang, Huanping/0000-0002-6153-6357; Hanrahan, Janel/0000-0002-3509-0224; Bruyere, Cindy/0000-0001-6913-6705; Beckage, Brian/0000-0002-5908-6924; Osterberg, Erich/0000-0002-0675-1230; Clemins, Patrick J./0000-0002-7930-3025													0930-7575	1432-0894				JAN	2020	54	1-2					69	84		10.1007/s00382-019-04987-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-019-04987-8													WOS:000512056000005

It is necessary to understand its environmental effectiveness and mechanisms. In this study, sediments from un-dredged (UDR), fresh-dredged (FOR) and post-dredged (PDR, 3 years later) regions of Dongqian Lake were collected to compose sediment-water microcosms for evaluating the effects of dredging on nitrogen cycling. From 0 to 19 days, ammonia in the overlying Water greatly increased in UDR (603.1%) and FOR (269.3%), but slightly in PDR (88.7%). The increase of ammonia concentration in water was negatively correlated with DO which was higher in two dredged groups than that in un-dredged groups. These results suggest that dredging could lead to ammonia release to water column in a short term, while ammonia release risk is low few years after dredging. In addition to high DO content, high Eh values, low pH and sediment porosity in two dredged groups may weaken the attenuation of nitrate. TN contents in both sediment and overlying water indicate that nitrogen lost in un-dredged group while had no significantly change in two dredged groups, indicating the ability of nitrogen removal in dredged groups was weakened. Our study suggests that dredging may have potentials to weaken nitrate and/or nitrogen removal from lake systems over years. For this, we should pay more attention on dredging area in dredging projects. Moreover, dredging is better to be conducted in low temperature seasons after blocking external nutrient loadings.

This was done for periods ranging from a few days to multiple decades using erosion pins, bedframe measurements, annual surveys, and digital photogrammetry using historical aerial photographs. The relative significance of seasonal/annual processes versus response of the foredune system to broader geomorphic controls (e.g. relative sea level rise, storms, etc.) was also assessed. The data show that there are clear seasonal differences in the patterns of sand supply from the beach to the foredune at Greenwich and that there are differences in sediment supply to the foredune between the east and west reaches of the study area, resulting in ongoing differences in foredune morphology. They also demonstrate that models that incorporate wind climate alone, or even models that include other factors like beach moisture, would not be able to predict the amount of sediment movement from the beach to the foredune in this environment unless there were some way to parameterize system morphology, especially the presence or absence of a dune ramp. Finally, the data suggest that the foredune can migrate landward while maintaining its form via transfers of sediment from the stoss slope, over the crest, and onto the lee slope. Although the rate of foredune development or recovery after disturbance changes over time due to morphological feedback, the overall decadal evolution of the foredune system at Greenwich is consistent with, and supports, the Davidson-Arnott (2005) conceptual model of dune transgression under rising sea level.

The reliable reconstruction of such temperatures, however, requires robust calibration functions. Here, we investigated brGDGT distributions in surface sediments from 41 freshwater lakes located along an altitudinal gradient across the Alps (Central Europe) and spanning a MAAT range from 1.3 to 12.9 degrees C. Linear regression analysis demonstrates that fractional abundances of brGDGTs are strongly correlated with MAAT and MAF allowing to establish regional MBT'(5Me)-based transfer functions: MAAT (degrees C) = -2.19 + 31.91 x MBT'(5Me) (r(2) = 0.72; RMSE = 1.51 degrees C) and MAF (degrees C) = 4.81 + 15.64 x MBT'(5Me) (r(2) = 0.64, RMSE = 0.92 degrees C). Stepwise forward selection yielded the following, alternate temperature calibrations: MAAT (degrees C) = 7.11 + 67.66 x Ib - 13.54 x IIIa (r(2) = 0.72; RMSE = 1.47 degrees C) and MAF (degrees C) = 5.19 + 16.22 x Ia (r(2) = 0.66; RMSE = 0.98 degrees C). Our results demonstrate that the above calibration functions allow precise temperature reconstructions using lacustrine sediment records. However, our data also show that high-altitude lakes are more prone to warm bias and that lakes characterized by comparatively high abundances of 6-methyl brGDGTs show aberrant behaviors with temperature offsets up to similar to 7 degrees C. Determining the IR6Me, as an independent control complementary to the MBT'(5Me), is thus essential to validate the robustness of brGDGT-based temperature reconstructions of past climates. A cut-off value of 0.50 for the IR6Me is here proposed, after which MBT'(5Me)-reconstructed MAATs from lacustrine archives should be regarded as unreliable.

Hydrological connectivity and mixing of Lake Towuti, Indonesia in response to paleoclimatic changes over the last 60,000 years	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) is an important driver of global climate, but its response to and involvement in paleoclimate change is poorly constrained. We generated a new record of sediment geochemistry from Lake Towuti (2.5 degrees S, 121.5 degrees E), Indonesia, located in the heart of the IPWP, to investigate changes in hydrological connectivity with upstream lakes and the extent of lake mixing and oxygenation during paleoclimate changes over the last 60,000 years BP (60 ka). Lake Towuti is located at the downstream end of the Malili Lakes, a chain of large, ancient, and biologically diverse tectonic lakes occupying a geologically heterogeneous terrain in central Sulawesi, Indonesia. Major and trace element data from river and lake sediments suggest no changes in sediment provenance during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), indicating that some of the Malili Lakes remained hydrologically open despite a regionally drier climate. However, samples from the LGM are uniformly less enriched in trace elements than samples from the Holocene and Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS3), which suggests a decrease in weathering intensity during the LGM, likely in response to decreased precipitation and temperature. Changes in Fe and other redox-sensitive trace element concentrations indicate changes in water column oxygenation, with the highest oxygen availability occurring during the LGM (15-35 ka) likely due to more frequent and/or deeper mixing of Lake Towuti's water column. The glacial-interglacial trend in lake oxygenation corresponds with changes in regional precipitation and associated changes in the seasonal cycle. The high degree of faunal endemism in these lakes may be related to changes in the lake geochemistry associated with glacial-interglacial environmental variability driven by changing inputs and redox variability.

Mineral and Anthropogenic Indicator Inorganics in Urban Stormwater and Snowmelt Runoff: Sources and Mobility Patterns	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Inorganic chemicals in urban stormwater and snowmelt runoff originate from catchment geology and anthropogenic activities. The occurrence, partitioning and mobility of six minerals and six trace metal (TM) indicators of anthropogenic activities were studied in stormwater, snowmelt and baseflow in four urban catchments, and the sampling of inorganics was supplemented by measurements of electrical conductivity (EC), pH and total suspended solids (TSSs). Minerals occurred at concentrations several orders of magnitude higher (1-10(2) mg/L) than those of TMs (10(-2)-10(2) mu g/L) and reflected the composition of local groundwater seeping into sewers. Concentrations of Ca, K, Mg and Na were enhanced by baseflow contributions and followed closely the electrical conductivity. Al and Fe minerals occurred in insoluble forms, and their pollutographs were similar to those of TMs, whose concentrations mimicked, to some extent, the flux of TSS. The TMs with the highest and lowest particulate fractions were Cr&Pb and Cu&Zn, respectively. The concentrations of total TMs in snowmelt were two to four times higher than those in stormwater, and both sources likely exceeded some of the stormwater effluent limits (for Cd, Cu and Zn) proposed in Sweden. Where such concentrations depended on water hardness, the risk of toxicity might be reduced by elevated hardness of the monitored snowmelt and stormwater. Recognizing the good ecological status of the study area receiving water, Lake Storsjon, some protection against polluted runoff and snowmelt may be needed and could be achieved by implementing stormwater management measures controlling TSS and TMs.						Galfi, Helen/0000-0002-5667-8756; Osterlund, Helene/0000-0002-4732-7348													0049-6979	1573-2932				JUL	2017	228	7							263	10.1007/s11270-017-3438-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-017-3438-x								28757661					WOS:000405835900011

In the present study, we characterized psammic rotifer communities in terms of dominance structure, trophic traits, taxonomic and functional diversity at a seasonal scale in freshwater lakes across Estonia and coastal beaches of the Baltic Sea. A total of 42 rotifer species were found from the coastal beaches and 66 species from the lakes. Functional indices did not exhibit smaller seasonal variability and neither did they respond better to changes in the environment compared to taxonomic indices. However, there were differences how environmental variables affected these two broad groups of response variables. The taxonomy-based indices of rotifer communities were primarily driven by seasonal temperature regime, sediment characteristics and anthropogenic stressors, whereas the trait-based indices were a function of ecosystem types (freshwater or brackish water). The functional indices of the psammic rotifer communities strongly distinguished between freshwater and brackish habitats indicating that rotifers have different functional roles in food webs in fresh and brackish water environments.

The faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) used in the present study included Escherichia colt (E. colt) and Enterococcus (ENT). FIB and aerobic mesophilic bacteria (AMB) were quantified during July 2015 (dry season) and November 2015 (rainy season) in order to assess the quality of drinking water from wells (n = 3; P1-P3), and two rivers, the River Lukemi (RLK, n=3) and River Luini (RLN, n = 2) in the city of Kikwit, which is located in the province of Kwilu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kikwit is well known for its outbreaks of persistent and recurrent waterborne diseases including Entamoeba, Shigella, typhoid fever, cholera, and Ebola Viral Hemorrhagic Fever. Consequently, E. colt, ENT, and AMB were quantified in water samples according to the standard international methods for water quality determination using the membrane filtration method. The FIB characterization was performed for human-specific Bacteroides by PCR using specific primers. The results obtained revealed high FIB concentrations in river samples collected during both seasons. For example, E. colt respectively reached 4.3 x 10(4) and 9.2 x 10(4) CFU 100 mL(-1) in the dry season and the wet season. ENT reached 5.3 x 10(3) CFU 100 mL(-1) during the dry season and 9.8 x 10(3) CFU 100 mL(-1) in the wet season. The pollution was significantly worse in the wet season compared to the dry season. Surprisingly, no faecal contamination was observed in well water samples collected in the dry season while E. coil and ENT were detected in all wells in the wet season with values of 6, 7, and 11 CFU mL-1 for E colt in wells P1-P3, respectively and 3, 5, 9 CFU mL(-1)for ENT in the same wells. Interestingly, the PCR assays for human-specific Bacteroides HF183/HF134 indicated that 97-100% captured in all analyses of isolated FIB were of human origin. The results indicate that contamination of E. coil, ENT, and AMB in the studied water resources increases during the wet season. This study improves understanding of the microbiological pollution of rivers and wells under tropical conditions and will guide future municipal/local government decisions on improving water quality in this region which is characterised by persistent and recurrent waterborne diseases. Although the epidemiology can be geographically localised, the effects of cross border transmission can be global. Therefore, the research results presented in this article form recommendations to municipalities/local authorities and the approach and procedures can be carried out in a similar environment.

PFAS used daily in households and manufacturing plants end up in domestic sewage, and industrial effluents can be discharged to surface water. Urban watersheds located in low and middle-income countries (LMIC), which lack sanitation infrastructure, are potential recipients of waste containing PFAS. Yet, only a few studies report PFAS occurrence in urban reservoirs and lakes, especially those located in the Global South due to resource limitations. This is the first study aimed to assess PFAS occurrence and ecological risks in Pampulha Lake, Brazil, a site which represents the reality of many other urban watersheds in LMIC as it is surrounded by densely populated areas and manufacturing plants. Surface water samples were collected monthly for 1 year from four sampling points at Pampulha Lake. Sample analysis was based on US Environmental Protection Agency Method 1633, which employs solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Species sensitivity distribution (SSD) curves were built to identify potentially susceptible species based on detected water concentrations. Bioaccumulation was estimated for fish tissue. Short-chain (perfluorobutanesulfonic acid, PFBS and perfluorohexanoic acid, PFHxA) and long-chain PFAS (perfluorodecanoic acid, PFDA; perfluorooctanoic acid, PFOA; perfluorododecanoic acid, PFDoA; and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, PFOS) were detected at the mu g L-1 range. Total PFAS concentrations in the wet season were generally higher than in the dry season, likely due to limited capacity of the treatment plant processing water from tributaries which receive raw sewage. More than 5 % of aquatic species are potentially susceptible to chronic effects of PFOS at detected concentrations (0.2-2.2 mu g L1). Predicted bioaccumulation of PFOS in fish was above advisory diet intake levels for humans.

Part B: Designing the next monitoring-modelling-assessment cycle of adaptive management in Lake Erie	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												In Lake Erie, a wide variety of statistical and process-based models have significantly advanced our understanding of the major causal linkages/ecosystem processes underlying the local water quality problems. In this study, our aim is to identify knowledge gaps, monitoring assessment objectives, and management recommendations that should be critically reviewed through the iterative monitoring-modelling-assessment cycles of adaptive management. In the watershed, the presence of multiple SWAT applications provides assurance that a wide array of physical, chemical, and biological processes with distinct characterizations are used to reproduce the patterns of flow and nutrient export in agricultural lands. While there are models with more advanced mechanistic representation of certain facets of the hydrological cycle (surface runoff, groundwater and sediment erosion) or better equipped to depict urban settings, we believe that greater insights will be gained by revisiting several influential assumptions (tile drainage, fertilizer/manure application rates, land-use/landcover data) and recalibrating the existing SWAT models to capture both baseline and event-flow conditions and daily nutrient concentration (not loading) variability in multiple locations rather than a single downstream site. It is also critical to redesign land-use management scenarios by accommodating recent conceptual and technical advancements of their life-cycle effectiveness, the variability in their starting operational efficiency, and differential response to storm events or seasonality, as well as the role of legacy phosphorus. In the receiving waterbody, the development of data-driven models to establish causal linkages between the trophic status of Lake Erie and external phosphorus loading represents a pragmatic means to draw forecasts regarding the phyto-plankton community response to different management actions. Two critical next steps to further augment the empirical modelling work is the iterative updating as more data are acquired through monitoring and the introduction of additional explanatory variables that are likely associated with the occurrence of cyanobacteria-dominated blooms. The majority of the process-based models are not constrained by the available data, and therefore their primary value is their use as heuristic tools to advance our understanding of Lake Erie. The validation of their predictive power should become one of the overarching objectives of the iterative monitoring-modelling-assessment cycles. With respect to the projected responses of the system to nutrient loading reduction, we express our skepticism with the optimistic predictions of the extent and duration of hypoxia, given our limited knowledge of the sediment diagenesis processes in the central basin along with the lack of data related to the vertical profiles of organic matter and phosphorus fractionation or sedimentation/burial rates. Our study also questions the adequacy of the coarse spatiotemporal (seasonal/annual, basin- or lake-wide) scales characterizing the philosophy of both water quality management objectives and modelling enterprise in Lake Erie, as this strategy seems somewhat disconnected from the ecosystem services targeted. We conclude by emphasizing that the valuation of ecosystem services should be integrated into the decision-making process, as we track the evolution of the system over time.

J	Wu, L; Han, C; Zhu, GW; Zhong, WH				Wu, Ling; Han, Cheng; Zhu, Guangwei; Zhong, Wenhui			Responses of Active Ammonia Oxidizers and Nitrification Activity in Eutrophic Lake Sediments to Nitrogen and Temperature	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Ammonium concentrations and temperature drive the activities of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), but their effects on these microbes in eutrophic freshwater sediments are unclear. In this study, surface sediments collected from areas of Taihu Lake (China) with different degrees of eutrophication were incubated under three levels of nitrogen input and temperature, and the autotrophic growth of ammonia oxidizers was assessed using C-13-labeled DNA-based stable-isotope probing (SIP), while communities were characterized using MiSeq sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA genes. Nitrification rates in sediment microcosms were positively correlated with nitrogen inputs, but there was no marked association with temperature. Incubation of SIP microcosms indicated that AOA and AOB amoA genes were labeled by C-13 at 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C in the slightly eutrophic sediment, and AOB amoA genes were labeled to a much greater extent than AOA amoA genes in the moderately eutrophic sediment after 56 days. Phylogenetic analysis of C-13-labeled 165 rRNA genes revealed that the active AOA were mainly affiliated with the Nitrosopumilus cluster, with the Nitrososphaera cluster dominating in the slightly eutrophic sediment at 30 degrees C with low ammonium input (1 mM). Active AOB communities were more sensitive to nitrogen input and temperature than were AOA communities, and they were exclusively dominated by the Nitrosornonas cluster, which tended to be associated with Nitrosomonadaceae-like lineages. Nitrosomonas sp. strain Is79A3 tended to dominate the moderately eutrophic sediment at 10 degrees C with greater ammonium input (2.86 mM). The relative abundance responses of the major active communities to nitrogen input and temperature gradients varied, indicating niche differentiation and differences in the physiological metabolism of ammonia oxidizers that are yet to be described. IMPORTANCE Both archaea and bacteria contribute to ammonia oxidation, which plays a central role in the global cycling of nitrogen and is important for reducing eutrophication in freshwater environments. The abundance and activities of ammoniaoxidizing archaea and bacteria in eutrophic limnic sediments vary with different ammonium concentrations or with seasonal shifts, and how the two factors affect nitrification activity, microbial roles, and active groups in different eutrophic sediments is unclear. The significance of our research is in identifying the archaeal and bacterial responses to anthropogenic activity and climate change, which will greatly enhance our understanding of the physiological metabolic differences of ammonia oxidizers.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				SEP	2019	85	18							e00258-19	10.1128/AEM.00258-19	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00258-19								31253684					WOS:000483596700001

Prediction of Ice-Free Conditions for a Perennially Ice-Covered Antarctic Lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Although perennially ice-covered Antarctic lakes have experienced variable ice thicknesses over the past several decades, future ice thickness trends and associated aquatic biological responses under projected global warming remain unknown. Heat stored in the water column in chemically stratified Antarctic lakes that have middepth temperature maxima can significantly influence the ice thickness trends via upward heat flux to the ice/water interface. We modeled the ice thickness of the west lobe of Lake Bonney, Antarctica, based on possible future climate scenarios utilizing a 1D thermodynamic model that accounts for surface radiative fluxes as well as the heat flux associated with the temperature evolution of the water column. Model results predict that the ice cover of Lake Bonney will shift from perennial to seasonal within one to four decades, a change that will drastically influence ecosystem processes within the lake.					; Doran, Peter/ABS-7911-2022	Obryk, Maciej/0000-0002-8182-8656; 													2169-9003	2169-9011				FEB	2019	124	2					686	694		10.1029/2018JF004756	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JF004756													WOS:000461856100021

The mastery of the specific characteristics of each Vertisols in a given area requires detailed site-scale investigation. This work aims to study the properties of the Lake Chad Basin Vertisols, attempt to highlight their genetic processes and classification. These Vertisols are dark, clayey and massive, very compact, with deep wide-opened cracks and gilgai micro-relief. They show neutral to slightly alkaline pH, low organic matter content (0.7-2.73%) and high C/N ratio values (7.34-39.64). Ca2+ and Mg2+ are the most represented exchangeable cations (5.92-30.72% and 1.28-5.44%, respectively) on the absorption complex. Smectite is the main clay mineral species, but small contents of kaolinite, illite, quartz and feldspars are also present. The most concentrated elements in the profile are silica (61.07-77.78 wt.% SiO2), aluminium (7.08-15.54 wt.% Al2O3) and iron (1.78-6.92 wt.% Fe2O3). The Si/Al ratio (> 2) and chemical index of alteration (CIA) are moderate to high (56.76-88.39) and indicate a moderate to intense weathering. Such properties reflect the pedogenic influence of the environmental factors like contrasting climate, low topographic position and the alluvial parent material. The accumulation of basic cations favours the neosynthesis of smectite minerals typical of a dominant bisiallitisation process. The Vertisols profiles, due to the presence of a perched water table, enable to classify these soils as Epiaquerts and Endoaquerts Vertisols (USDA soil taxonomy) and Gleyics and Fulvics Vertisols (WEB). Their physical characteristics and notably their difficult water management constitute a limitation to agricultural activities.

This decline may bring challenges to food security in China because rice is the staple food for more than 60% of the Chinese population. It has been generally recognized that rapidly rising labor costs due to economic growth and urbanization in China is the key driving force of the double-to-single' rice cropping system adaption. However, not all provinces have shown a dramatic decline in DCR area, and labor costs alone cannot explain this difference. To elucidate the reasons for these inter-provincial distinctions and the dynamics of rice cropping system adaption, we evaluated the influencing factors using provincial panel data from 1980 to 2015. We also used household survey data for empirical analysis to explore the mechanisms driving differences in rice multi-cropping changes. Our results indicated that the eight provinces in the study can be divided into three spatial groups based on the extent of DCR area decline, the rapidly-declining marginal, core, and stable zones. Increasing labor cost due to rapid urbanization was the key driving force of rice cropping system adaption, but the land use dynamic vary hugely among different provinces. These differences between zones were due to the interaction between labor price and accumulated temperature conditions. Therefore, increasing labor costs had the greatest impact in Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei, where the accumulated temperature is relatively low and rice multi-cropping index declined dramaticly. However, labor costs had little impact in Guangdong and Guangxi. Differences in accumulated temperature conditions resulted in spatially different labor demands and pressure on households during the busy season. As a result, there have been different profits and rice multi-cropping changes between provinces and zones. Because of these spatial differences, regionally appropriate policies that provide appropriate subsidies for early rice in rapidly-declining marginal zone such as Zhejiang and Hubei should be implemented. In addition, agricultural mechanization and the number of agricultural workers have facilitated double-cropping; therefore, small machinery and agricultural infrastructure construction should be further supported.					; Wang, Yahui/JCO-6233-2023; Wang, Renjing/HGD-9718-2022	Jiang, Min/0000-0002-3510-9829; 													1002-0063	1993-064X				FEB	2019	29	1					127	138		10.1007/s11769-018-0972-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-018-0972-4													WOS:000455227500010

During the 2007-2010 freshet and open water seasons, we collected river water upstream and downstream of the Mackenzie River delta to quantify total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations and export. Upstream of the delta, flow-weighted mean concentrations of bulk THg and MeHg were 14.6 +/- 6.2 ng L-1 and 0.081 +/- 0.045 ng L-1, respectively. Only 11-13% and 44-51% of bulk THg and MeHg export was in the dissolved form. Using concentration-discharge relationships, we calculated bulk THg and MeHg export into the delta of 2300-4200 kg yr(-1) and 15-23 kg yr(-1) over the course of the study. Discharge is not presently known in channels exiting the delta, so we assessed differences in river Hg concentrations upstream and downstream of the delta to estimate its influence on Hg export to the ocean. Bulk THg and MeHg concentrations decreased 19% and 11% through the delta, likely because of particle settling and other processes in the floodplain. These results suggest that northern deltas may be important accumulators of river Hg in their floodplains before export to the Arctic Ocean.

J	Ji, L; Wang, Z; Zhang, L; Zhu, X; Ning, K				Ji, Lei; Wang, Zhi; Zhang, Lu; Zhu, Xue; Ning, Kang			Determining the primary sources of groundwater bacterial communities in a large-scale plain area: Microbial source tracking and interpretation for different land use patterns	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Groundwater quality has been profoundly affected by human activities, especially in large-scale plain areas with high population density. However, it remains unclear how groundwater has been influenced, especially at the microbial community level. Here, a metagenome-based microbial source tracking (MST) technique was used to track the sources of groundwater microbial communities associated with land use patterns in three-dimensional space in a large-scale plain area in the middle of the Yangtze River Basin. Although groundwater and surface water bacterial communities were different, there was considerable evidence of bacterial seeding from surface water to groundwater. Furthermore, the aquaculture pond was found to be the main contributor to the groundwater microbial community (similar to 41.0 % interpretation rate in both rainy and dry seasons). The contribution of farmland to the groundwater microbial community (39.2 %) was similar to that of the aquaculture pond during the rainy season, while it was higher than that during the dry season (29.9 %); however, the contribution of microbes from the lake to groundwater was low (6.9-8.7 %). Further, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and bacteria co-occurrence networks of aquaculture ponds and groundwater were more alike than those of other investigated aquatic systems. In addition, aquaculture ponds could bring non-negligible negative impacts to groundwater, such as pathogen infiltration and ARG enrichment. This work highlights the importance of the use of MST combined with land use patterns to reliably track the sources of groundwater microbial communities in large-scale plain areas and provides a deeper insight into the sources of groundwater pollution and protection of groundwater from a microbial perspective.					; Wang, Zhi/W-5911-2019; Ning, Kang/ABD-3446-2020	wang, zhi/0000-0002-6832-7013; Ning, Kang/0000-0003-3325-5387; Ji, Lei/0009-0007-0536-0063													0167-8809	1873-2305				OCT 15	2022	338								108092	10.1016/j.agee.2022.108092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2022.108092		JUL 2022											WOS:000860787700005

Through active surveillance from 2015 through 2019, 10,900 samples from wild birds in central China were collected, and 89 AIVs were isolated, including 2 subtypes of highly pathogenic AIV and 12 of low-pathogenic AIV; H9N2 and H6Ny were the dominant subtypes. Phylogenetic analysis of the isolates demonstrated that extensive intersubtype reassortments and frequent intercontinental gene exchange occurred in AIVs. AIV gene segments persistently circulated in several migration seasons, but interseasonal persistence of the whole genome was rare. The whole genomes of one H6N6 and polymerase basic 2 (PB2), polymerase acidic (PA), hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), M, and non-structural (NS) genes of one H9N2 virus were found to be of poultry origin, suggesting a spillover of AIVs from poultry to wild birds. Importantly, one H9N2 virus only bound to human-type receptor, and one H1N1, four H6, and seven H9N2 viruses possessed dual receptor-binding capacity. Nineteen of 20 representative viruses tested could replicate in the lungs of mice without preadaptation, which poses a clear threat of infection in humans. Together, our study highlights the need for intensive AIV surveillance. IMPORTANCE Influenza virus surveillance in wild birds plays an important role in the early recognition and control of the virus. However, the AIV gene pool in wild birds in central China along the East Asian-Australasian flyway has not been well studied. Here, we conducted a 5-year AIV active surveillance in this region. Our data revealed the long-term circulation and prevalence of AIVs in wild birds in central China, and we observed that intercontinental gene exchange of AIVs is more frequent and continuous than previously thought. Spillover events from poultry to wild bird were observed in H6 and H9 viruses. In addition, in 20 representative viruses, 12 viruses could bind human-type receptors, and 19 viruses could replicate in mice without preadaption. Our work highlights the potential threat of wild bird AIVs to public health.

By combining 216 simulation experiments using the LAKE2.0 model with the observations, we evaluated the effects of ice and snow albedo, ice (K-di) and water (K-dw) extinction coefficients on the lake ice phenology, water temperature, sensible and latent heat fluxes. The reference experiment performs well in simulating the lake temperature, with a small positive bias increasing with depth, but it underestimates the ice thickness. The increase of ice albedo, snow albedo and K-di induce a significant decrease in water temperature. Compared with the latent heat, the sensible heat flux is more sensitive to these three parameters. The ice thickness increases almost linearly with the increase of ice albedo but decreases with the increase of K-di. The ice thickness and frozen days vary little with K-dw, but increasing K-dw can decrease the water temperature. Compared with the ice albedo, the K-di and snow albedo have a large effect on the number of frozen days. This study brings to light the necessity to improve the parameterizations of the TP lakes freeze-thaw process.

Samples were collected at three sampling sites in January (dry season), May (wet season) and September (normal season) in 2019. Trophic level and stability status were assessed on the basis of the Shannon diversity index (H), species richness (S) and evenness (J) index. The different relationships between phytoplankton and the concentrations of several physicochemical parameters and the main soluble nutrients were evaluated by statistical tests. The results showed that there were 75 species belonging to seven groups of phytoplankton, including Chlorophyta (44 species), Bacillariophyta (12 species), Cyanophyta (9 species) and others (10 species). The phytoplankton community composition belongs to the Chlorophyta-Bacillariophyta-Cyanobacteria type structure; and Microcystis, Anabaena azotica Ley, Aphanizomenon, Melosira granulata were the main contributors to the dissimilarities in the temporal distributions of their communities. The phytoplankton density ranged from 4.42 x 10(6) to 8.99 x 10(6) particles/L, with an average of 6.45 x 10(6) particles/L, and the biomass was 4.42 x 10(6) similar to 8.99 x 10(6) particles/L, with an average of 6.45 x 10(6) particles/L. The variation ranges of the Shannon-Wiener index (H '), Margalef index (D) and Pielou evenness index (J) were 2.05 similar to 2.85, 4.12 similar to 6.60 and 0.61-0.78, respectively. This research shows that the water in the Hongmen Reservoir is clean and that the pollution level is light. The correlation analysis shows that total phosphorus and dissolved oxygen are the main factors affecting phytoplankton community structure in the Hongmen Reservoir.

Results show that these lakes are shallow, weakly stratified, and of polymictic type. These characteristics may have caused vertical mixing of limnological parameters. Seasonal changes were minor for most parameters, except for chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and cyanobacteria, which also showed considerable variation between lakes. In general, waters of these lakes were mostly acidic in nature (avg. pH 4.9-5.9), with high total Fe (up to 1.52mg/L) and low electrolytic conductivity (avg. 8.13-14 mS/cm) and total phosphorus (TP) (avg. 10-35.5 mg/L). Although the water bodies have good quality and classified as class I and II types according to CONAMA Resolution No. 357/05, trophic state index (TSI) varies from ultra-oligotrophic to eutrophic state, with higher trophic state observed for Vl, TI1 and TI2. Limnological characteristics of these lakes is highly influenced by lithological and morphological parameters. Principal component analysis (PCA) reveals that Chl-a and cyanobacteria are not solely influenced by TP and lower concentrations of all these parameters in Am lake are probably due to specificities of its catchment lithology. Phytoplankton taxa in the lakes are characterized by small chroococcales groups and desmids together with filamentous algae, more commonly observed in the dry season. The zooplankton community in the lakes is mainly dominated by rotifers, followed by cladocerans and copepods. Regarding species richness, zooplankton was highest in Vl, while phytoplankton is highest in TI1, and this aspect is most likely related to lake water levels.

They can represent a reservoir of water, and melting ice inside them can affect surface water hydrochemistry. Investigating the interactions between rock glaciers and water bodies is therefore necessary to better understand these mechanisms. With this goal, we elucidate the hydrology and structural setting of a rock glacier-marginal pond system, providing new insights into the mechanisms linking active rock glaciers and impounded surface waters. This was achieved through the integration of waterborne geophysical techniques (ground penetrating radar, electrical resistivity tomography and self-potentials) and heat tracing. Results of these surveys showed that rock glacier advance has progressively filled the valley depression where the pond is located, creating a dam that could have modified the level of impounded water. A sub-surface hydrological window connecting the rock glacier to the pond was also detected, where an inflow of cold and mineralised underground waters from the rock glacier was observed. Here, greater water contribution from the rock glacier occurred following intense precipitation events during the ice-free season, with concomitant increasing electrical conductivity values. The outflowing dynamic of the pond is dominated by a sub-surface seepage where a minor fault zone in bedrock was found, characterised by altered and highly-fractured rocks. The applied approach is evaluated here as a suitable technique for investigating logistically-complex hydrological settings which could be possibly transferred to wider scales of investigation.

J	Dangbé, E; Irépran, D; Perasso, A; Békollé, D				Dangbe, Ezekiel; Irepran, Damakoa; Perasso, Antoine; Bekolle, David			Mathematical modelling and numerical simulations of the influence of hygiene and seasons on the spread of cholera	MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES												Cholera is a bacterial disease, its spread is strongly influenced by environmental factors and some socio-economic factors such as hygiene standards and nutrition of the population. This paper is devoted to the modelling of the impact of climatic factors and human behaviour on the spread of cholera. The mathematical modelling incorporates the direct transmission and the indirect transmission due to environmental knowledge. Taking into account the effect of the intra-annual variation of climatic factors on the transmission of cholera, a non-autonomous ordinary differential equations is proposed to describe the dynamics of the transmission of cholera. When the infra-annual variation of climate is not incorporated into the model, the latter becomes autonomous. The basic reproductive number is calculated and the stabilities of equilibria are investigated. In the non-autonomous case, the disease extinction and uniform persistence of disease are investigated. The results suggest that the transmission and spread of cholera can be affected by climatic factors, the proportion of the undernourished individuals and the proportion of people who respect the hygiene standards. Finally, some numerical simulations are proposed using the parameters values of climatic factors and socio-economic factors of some localities situated in Lake Chad border between Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria.																			0025-5564	1879-3134				FEB	2018	296						60	70		10.1016/j.mbs.2017.12.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2017.12.004								29246773					WOS:000425071700006

Flow cytometric monitoring of bacterioplankton phenotypic diversity predicts high population-specific feeding rates by invasive dreissenid mussels	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Species invasion is an important disturbance to ecosystems worldwide, yet knowledge about the impacts of invasive species on bacterial communities remains sparse. Using a novel approach, we simultaneously detected phenotypic and derived taxonomic change in a natural bacterioplankton community when subjected to feeding pressure by quagga mussels, a widespread aquatic invasive species. We detected a significant decrease in diversity within 1 h of feeding and a total diversity loss of 11.6 +/- 4.1% after 3 h. This loss of microbial diversity was caused by the selective removal of high nucleic acid populations (29 +/- 5% after 3 h). We were able to track the community diversity at high temporal resolution by calculating phenotypic diversity estimates from flow cytometry (FCM) data of minute amounts of sample. Through parallel FCM and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis of environments spanning a broad diversity range, we showed that the two approaches resulted in highly correlated diversity measures and captured the same seasonal and lake-specific patterns in community composition. Based on our results, we predict that selective feeding by invasive dreissenid mussels directly impacts the microbial component of the carbon cycle, as it may drive bacterioplankton communities toward less diverse and potentially less productive states.					; Props, Ruben/AAV-4218-2020; Boon, Nico/B-4083-2011	Heyse, Jasmine/0000-0002-8858-9803; Boon, Nico/0000-0002-7734-3103													1462-2912	1462-2920				FEB	2018	20	2					521	534		10.1111/1462-2920.13953	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.13953								29027374					WOS:000425019400008

In this study, we collected Brachionus calyciflorus Pallas monthly from Lake Tingtang over the course of 1 year and clonally cultured them in the laboratory. Finally, 204 clones were established, and their nuDNA ITS1 and mtCOI sequences were analyzed. The phylogenetic relationships and GMYC model analyses revealed that B. calyciflorus was a species complex composed of three cryptic species. Cryptic species BcI-W, and BcII-S and Bc-SW underwent a clear seasonal succession. However, BcII-S and Bc-SW overlapped in June and July, and all the three cryptic species coexisted in November. Different preferences to water temperature might contribute to the seasonal succession. More investment in sexual reproduction accelerated the disappearance of cryptic species from the water column during the seasonal succession process. Differential responses in rate of population growth of the two overlapping cryptic species to increasing food level might reduce the intensity of competition between them and promote their coexistence over time. Differences in population growth rate partially resulted in the different relative abundances of the two overlapping cryptic species.

Environmental and lunar cues are predictive of the timing of river entry and spawning-site arrival in lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The associations were quantified between daily and interannual variation in the timing of a closed population of lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens migration and arrival at spawning sites with stream environmental and lunar covariates. Spawning data were gathered from 1262 fish in Black Lake, Michigan 2001 to 2008 and by video monitoring 2000 to 2002. Sex-specific variation in responses to external cues was also tested. Results showed that a greater number of individuals initiated migration from lake to riverine habitats at dawn and dusk relative to other times of the day. Current and lagged effects of water temperature and river discharge, and periods in the lunar cycle were important variables in models quantifying movements into the river and timing of adult arrival at spawning sites. Different suites of covariates were predictive of A. fulverscens responses during different periods of the spawning season. The timing of initiation of migration and spawning, and the importance of covariates to the timing of these events, did not differ between sexes. Stream flow and temperature covaried with other variables including day length and the lunar cycle. Anthropogenic disruption of relationships among variables may mean that environmental cues may no longer reliably convey information for Acipenseriformes and other migratory fishes.

HIGHLY SEASONAL AND PERENNIAL FLUVIAL FACIES: IMPLICATIONS FOR CLIMATIC CONTROL ON THE DOUGLAS CREEK AND PARACHUTE CREEK MEMBERS, GREEN RIVER FORMATION, SOUTHEASTERN UINTA BASIN, UTAH, USA	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												The early to middle Eocene Green River Formation consists of continental strata deposited in Laramide ponded basins in Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming. This study (1) documents fluvial and lacustrine strata from the Douglas Creek and Parachute Creek members of the middle Green River Formation, southeastern Uinta Basin, Utah, and (2) uses new interpretations of the link between climate and fluvial sedimentary expression to interpret the terrestrial evolution of early Eocene climate. The stratigraphy was analyzed via outcrops along a 10 km transect in Main Canyon on the Tavaputs Plateau, and is divided into three distinct, stratigraphically separated depositional settings: (1) the lowermost Interval 1 is dominated by amalgamated sandstone channels that contain 70-100% upper-flow- regime sedimentary structures. The channels are interpreted to represent fluvial deposits controlled by a highly seasonal climate, where most deposition was limited to seasonal flooding events. (2) Interval 2 is dominated by alternating siliciclastic and carbonate lacustrine deposits, interpreted as local pulsed fluvial siliciclastic input into shallow Lake Uinta, and periods of fluvial quiescence represented by littoral carbonate deposition. (3) The uppermost Interval 3 is dominated by erosionally-based, trough cross bedded sandstone channels interbedded with littoral lacustrine and deltaic deposits. The Interval 3 sandstone channels are interpreted as perennial fluvial deposits with relatively little variation in annual discharge, akin to modern humid-temperate fluvial systems. The stratigraphic transition from seasonally controlled (Interval 1) to perennial (Interval 3) fluvial deposits is interpreted to represent a fundamental shift in Eocene climate, from the peak hyperthermal regime of the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO) to a more stable post-EECO climate.

Placing prairie pothole wetlands along spatial and temporal continua to improve integration of wetland function in ecological investigations	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												We evaluated the efficacy of using chemical characteristics to rank wetland relation to surface and groundwater along a hydrologic continuum ranging from groundwater recharge to groundwater discharge. We used 27 years (1974-2002) of water chemistry data from 15 prairie pothole wetlands and known hydrologic connections of these wetlands to groundwater to evaluate spatial and temporal patterns in chemical characteristics that correspond to the unique ecosystem functions each wetland performed. Due to the mineral content and the low permeability rate of glacial till and soils, salinity of wetland waters increased along a continuum of wetland relation to groundwater recharge, flow-through or discharge. Mean inter-annual specific conductance (a proxy for salinity) increased along this continuum from wetlands that recharge groundwater being fresh to wetlands that receive groundwater discharge being the most saline, and wetlands that both recharge and discharge to groundwater (i.e., groundwater flow-through wetlands) being of intermediate salinity. The primary axis from a principal component analysis revealed that specific conductance (and major ions affecting conductance) explained 71% of the variation in wetland chemistry over the 27 years of this investigation. We found that longterm averages from this axis were useful to identify a wetland's long-term relation to surface and groundwater. Yearly or seasonal measurements of specific conductance can be less definitive because of highly dynamic inter- and intra-annual climate cycles that affect water volumes and the interaction of groundwater and geologic materials, and thereby influence the chemical composition of wetland waters. The influence of wetland relation to surface and groundwater on water chemistry has application in many scientific disciplines and is especially needed to improve ecological understanding in wetland investigations. We suggest ways that monitoring in situ wetland conditions could be linked with evolving remote sensing technology to improve our ability to better inform decisions affecting wetland sustainability and provide periodic inventories of wetland ecosystem services to document temporal trends in wetland function and how they respond to contemporary land-use change.

Besides commercial fishery, it also forms lucrative sport fishery in the Himalayan rivers. Samples of golden mahseer (Tor putitora) were collected from the river Kosi at Ramnagar area (lesser Himalayan region) of Uttarakhand, India during 2014-2016 to study reproductive biology and trace any changes in breeding phenology from earlier records. The observed breeding season was from July till September. In males (310-565 mm, 355-1750 g) and females (315-580 mm, 260-2500 g), GSI values surged from late June to early July and peaked in August. Absolute and relative fecundity ranged from 4217 to 8365 and from 3667 to 7348 per kg, respectively. The maximum water temperature was usually recorded in May (30.5 degrees C) and minimum (18.4 degrees C) in January. Sex ratio was estimated at 1: 1.25 with X-2 value of 3.20 and the difference was non-significant. The breeding phenology of golden mahseer may likely have gone through two distinct steps of transformation viz. shifting-prolongation (1911-1981) and reduction-stabilization (1981-present). Even after a probable reduction in duration of breeding season and shift (delay) in onset of breeding in Golden mahseer population of lesser Himalayan region during 1911-1981, some stabilization in breeding phenology appears to have been attained since 2000s.

However, the seasonal dynamics of glaciers on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau have rarely been reported in terms of glacier surface elevation and velocity. This paper presents a first attempt to explore the seasonal dynamics of the debris-covered Dagongba Glacier within the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. We use the multitemporal unoccupied aerial vehicle images collected over the lower ablation zone on 8 June and 17 October 2018, and 13 May 2019, and then perform an analysis concerning climatic fluctuations. The results reveal that the mean surface elevation decrease of the Dagongba Glacier during the warm season (2.81 +/- 0.44 m) was remarkably higher than the cold season (0.72 +/- 0.45 m). Particularly notable glacier surface elevation changes were found around supraglacial lakes and ice cliffs where ice ablation rates were similar to 3 times higher than the average. In addition, a larger longitudinal decline of glacier surface velocity was observed in the warm season than that in the cold season. In terms of further comparative analysis, the Dagongba Glacier experienced a decrease in surface velocity between 1982-83 and 2018-19, with a decrease in the warm season possibly twice as large as that in the cold season.					; Liu, Qiao/H-6525-2011; liu, guoxiang/I-8174-2013; xiang, wei/IWD-8393-2023	Fu, Yin/0000-0003-3839-2794; Cai, Jialun/0000-0002-8349-2711; Liu, Qiao/0000-0002-7285-5425; Zhang, Rui/0000-0002-0809-7682; 													0022-1430	1727-5652				AUG	2022	68	270					636	650		10.1017/jog.2021.123	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2021.123		DEC 2021											WOS:000737738700001

One of the most popular remote sensing satellite data for observing long-term dynamic changes in phytoplankton is Moderateresolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, it is worth noting that MODIS provides two images with different transit times: Terra (local time, about 10:30 am) and Aqua (local time, about 1:30 pm), which may result in a considerable bias in monitoring phytoplankton bloom areas due to the rapid migration of phytoplankton under wind or hydrodynamic conditions. To analyze this quantitatively, we selected MODIS Terra and Aqua images to generate datasets of phytoplankton bloom areas in Lake Taihu from 2003 to 2022. The results showed that Terra more frequently detected larger ranges of phytoplankton blooms than Aqua, whether on daily, monthly, or annual scales. In addition, long-term trend changes, seasonal characteristics, and abrupt years also varied with different transit times. Terra detected mutation years earlier, while Aqua displayed more pronounced seasonal characteristics. There were also differences in sensitivity to climate factors, with Terra being more responsive to temperature and wind speed on monthly and annual scales, while Aqua was more sensitive to nutrient and meteorological factors. These conclusions have also been further confirmed in Lake Chaohu, Lake Dianchi, and Lake Hulun. In conclusion, our findings strongly advocate for a linear relationship to fit Terra to Aqua results to mitigate long-term monitoring errors of phytoplankton blooms in inland lakes (R2 = 0.70, RMSE =101.56). It is advised to utilize satellite data with transit times between 10 am and 1 pm to track phytoplankton bloom changes and to consider the diverse applications resulting from the transit times of Terra and Aqua.

Spatial and Temporal Ecological Uniqueness of Andean Diatom Communities Are Correlated With Climate, Geodiversity and Long-Term Limnological Change	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												High-elevation tropical lakes are excellent sentinels of global change impacts, such as climate warming, land-use change, and atmospheric deposition. These effects are often correlated with temporal and spatial beta diversity patterns, with some local communities contributing more than others, a phenomenon known as local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) or ecological uniqueness. Microorganisms, such as diatoms, are considered whole-ecosystem indicators, but little is known about their sensitivity and specificity in beta diversity studies mostly because of the lack of large spatial and temporal datasets. To fill this gap, we used a tropical South American diatom database comprising modern (144 lakes) and paleolimnological (6 sediment cores) observations to quantify drivers of spatial and temporal beta diversity and evaluated implications for environmental change and regional biodiversity. We used methods of beta diversity partitioning (replacement and richness components) by determining contributions of local sites to these components (LCBDrepl and LCBDrich), and studied how they are related to environmental, geological, and historical human variables using Generalized Additive Models (GAM). Beta replacement time series were also analyzed with GAM to test whether there is widespread biotic homogenization across the tropical Andes. Modern lake ecological uniqueness was jointly explained by limnological (pH), climatic (mean annual precipitation), and historical human density. Local lake (conductivity) and regional geodiversity variables (terrain ruggedness, soil variability) were inversely correlated to replacement and richness components of LCBD, suggesting that not all lakes contributing to broad-scale diversity are targets for conservation actions. Over millennial time scales, decomposing temporal trends of beta diversity components showed different trajectories of lake diatom diversity as response of environmental change: i) increased hydroclimatic variability (as inferred by decreased temperature seasonality) mediating higher contribution of richness to local beta diversity patternsca.1000 years ago in Ecuador Andean lakes and ii) lake-specific temporal beta diversity trends for the lastca. 200 years, indicating that biotic homogenization is not widespread across the tropical Andes. Our approach for unifying diatom ecology, metacommunity, and paleolimnology can facilitate the understanding of future responses of tropical Andean lakes to global change impacts.

Estimation of phytoplankton carbon in inland waters on a large scale using remote sensing is useful for understanding, evaluating, and monitoring the carbon dynamics, and, in particular, for determining the spatial temporal variation of primary production in inland waters. In a correlation analysis of the phytoplankton carbon concentration and water components, the result revealed no significant correlation between the chlorophyll-a concentration and phytoplankton carbon concentration in inland waters. However, the absorption peak height of particles at 675 nm, which is defined as the absorption at 675 nm subtracted by that at 660 nm, was found to be closely correlated with the phytoplankton carbon concentration. Thus, the absorption peak height of particles at 675 nm could be used as an indicator of the phytoplankton carbon concentration. A semianalytical method based on the remote-sensing reflectance in Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) bands 8, 9, and 17 was developed to derive the absorption peak of particles at a wavelength of 675 nm. Finally, an algorithm for estimating the phytoplankton carbon concentration in inland waters using OLCI bands 8, 9, and 17 was constructed. From 2013 to 2018, eight field campaigns were conducted in inland lakes in different seasons, and the optical properties, optically active water components, and phytoplankton carbon concentrations were obtained. An assessment of its accuracy using an independent data set demonstrated that the algorithm performance is acceptable (mean absolute percentage error, 48.6%, and root mean square error, 0.36 mg/L). As a demonstration, the algorithm was successfully applied to map the phytoplankton carbon concentration in Taihu Lake and Chaohu Lake, China, using OLCI images acquired on December 5, 2017, and August 5, 2018 and December 8, 2017, and August 7, 2017, and the spatial variation of the phytoplankton carbon concentration in Taihu Lake and Chaohu Lake was thoroughly examined. A semianalytical remote-sensing method, instead of a traditional time-consuming approach, was developed in this article, which can be used to estimate phytoplankton carbon concentration quickly, and provides an effective way to map the phytoplankton carbon concentration in inland water on a large scale.

In this study, we proposed the combined use of HJ-1 charge-coupled device imaging and field observation to track the long-term SWT dynamics with environmental changes in Lakes Gaoyang, Hanfeng, and Changshou of the Three Gorges Reservoir, China. In situ remote sensing reflectance spectra were utilized to develop the characteristic spectral indexes for the SWT estimation in different water optical classes separated by a density peaks-based classification. Significant correlations were found between the red-, four-band, band ratio spectral indexes and SWT (determination coefficient >0.71 and root-mean-square error <8.32 nephelometric turbidity unit), suggesting a crucial role of the class-specific retrieval models for the SWT estimation in optically complex waters. The proposed method was further used to monitor the spatio-temporal SWT dynamics over the three lakes from 2008 to 2019, demonstrating that the significant SWT decline in Lakes Gaoyang and Hanfeng and the relatively stable trend in Lake Changshou during the 11-year period. Specifically, the SWT decreasing trends may be attributed to the water level linkage mechanism of Three Gorges and Wuyang Dams. In addition, analyses with simultaneous environmental factors showed that the seasonal and inter-annual variations of SWT appear to be closely correlated with water level and rainfall. Long-term remote tracking of the SWT dynamics presented in this study could provide new insight and reference for reservoir management in the post-Three Gorges Project Era.

J	Fastook, JL; Head, JW; Marchant, DR; Forget, F; Madeleine, JB				Fastook, James L.; Head, James W.; Marchant, David R.; Forget, Francois; Madeleine, Jean-Baptiste			Early Mars climate near the Noachian-Hesperian boundary: Independent evidence for cold conditions from basal melting of the south polar ice sheet (Dorsa Argentea Formation) and implications for valley network formation	ICARUS												Currently, and throughout much of the Amazonian, the mean annual surface temperatures of Mars are so cold that basal melting does not occur in ice sheets and glaciers and they are cold-based. The documented evidence for extensive and well-developed eskers (sediment-filled former sub-glacial meltwater channels) in the south circumpolar Dorsa Argentea Formation is an indication that basal melting and wet-based glaciation occurred at the South Pole near the Noachian-Hesperian boundary. We employ glacial accumulation and ice-flow models to distinguish between basal melting from bottom-up heat sources (elevated geothermal fluxes) and top-down induced basal melting (elevated atmospheric temperatures warming the ice). We show that under mean annual south polar atmospheric temperatures (-100 degrees C) simulated in typical Amazonian climate experiments and typical Noachian-Hesperian geothermal heat fluxes (45-65 mW/m(2)), south polar ice accumulations remain cold-based. In order to produce significant basal melting with these typical geothermal heat fluxes, the mean annual south polar atmospheric temperatures must be raised from today's temperature at the surface (-100 degrees C) to the range of 50 to 75 degrees C. This mean annual polar surface atmospheric temperature range implies lower latitude mean annual temperatures that are likely to be below the melting point of water, and thus does not favor a "warm and wet" early Mars. Seasonal temperatures at lower latitudes, however, could range above the melting point of water, perhaps explaining the concurrent development of valley networks and open basin lakes in these areas. This treatment provides an independent estimate of the polar (and non-polar) surface temperatures near the Noachian-Hesperian boundary of Mars history and implies a cold and relatively dry Mars climate, similar to the Antarctic Dry Valleys, where seasonal melting forms transient streams and permanent ice-covered lakes in an otherwise hyperarid, hypothermal climate.

The water column of these lakes tends to exhibit multiple theimoclines, and deep-water anoxia tends to spread quickly throughout the hypolimnion in all but the least productive lakes, complicating die interpretation of isolated temperature and dissolved- oxygen profiles. Here, multiple depth profiles of temperature, dissolved oxygen and conductivity from a diverse selection of 11 small tropical crater lakes in western Uganda are combined with time series of temperature-logger data to determine the occurrence and maximum depth of water-column mixing within a given time period. We propose three reliable indicators of past mixing: 1) presence of oxygen below the photic zone; 2) evidence of recent cooling at a given depth; and 3) disappearance of previously documented thermo- and chemoclines. The greatest depth of mixing can only be inferred with a fair degree of certainty from a chronosequence of at least two sets of profiles.

C	Wang, J; Liu, X		Lee, G		Wang, Jie; Liu, Xiang			The Imaginative Power and the Sad Feelings of the Poet Feelings after Reading "Release the Travelling Goose", "Release the Fish" and "Redeem the Chicken" by Bai Juyi	2014 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND EDUCATION MANAGEMENT (EEM 2014), PT 4	Advances in Education Research				4th International Conference on Education and Education Management (EEM 2014)	DEC 08-09, 2014	Singapore, SINGAPORE	Informat Engn Res Inst, Acad Conf Inst				How worried was Bai Juyi who was relegated to Jiangzhou as the minister of war in ancient China? But the poet was content with what he was that "while put in an important position, I will blossom my talents, and if not, I will hide my capacities and bide my time", and "the sages escape the muddy society", and "when the world is consistent with the correct reason, I can show my talents, and if the world is not in conformity with the correct reason, I will hide my talents", and he entrusted his thoughts and feelings to the mountains and rivers and poems and materials, and the seclusion and the Buddhism became the medicine to comfort his spirit. Conveniently read "Bai Juyi anthology", and I inadvertently read the three poems of "Release the travelling goose", "Release the fish" and "Redeem the chicken". In terms of these three poems, there were fewer comments in the successive dynasties. After reading, I have many feelings, so I wrote this essay. The title was initially determined as "The wild goose, the fish and the chicken, do not hesitate when you can leave". After a second thought, I realized that the person who released them was the poet Bai Juyi, and the wild goose, the fish, and the chickens are set free, so their lives were all in the hands of others. It is the thoughts when the poet who was relegated wrote these three poems that are worth fathoming. Li Yu of the Southern Tang Dynasty once wrote "how worried are you", and how worried was Bai Juyi who was relegated to Jiangzhou as the minister of war in ancient China? Bai Juyi was a famous poet in the late Tang Dynasty, with the word Le Tian, who was born in 772 AD, and died in 846 AD. At that time, the royal government was corrupted, and the society was unrest, when it was the transition from the old to the new time in a great mansion on the point of collapse. In all the contradictions, the military governorship in the superstructure, the eunuchs, and the partisanship were particularly prominent, which were the three big problems during the middle and late Tang Dynasty, and had a disastrous effect on the political economy. It can be said that the turbulent times also doomed that Bai Juyi would spend an extraordinary life. On June 3rd, the tenth year of Yuanhe, Xian Zong (Li Chun) (AD 815 years), on the road to the court in the morning, the prime minister Wu Yuanheng and the imperial censor Pei Du were murdered by the assassin sent by Li Shidao, the Zi Qing governor in charge of both civil and military affairs during the Tang Dynast (which was the official who had the discretionary jurisdiction on the military and political affairs of the states of Zizhou and Qingzhou, and the administrative ranges corresponded to the whole territory of Shandong province today and the north of Jiangsu province). Wu Yuanheng died on the spot, and Pei Du was seriously injured. In the face of such the event which shocked the entire court, the old eunuch power group and the bureaucratic group should take pleasure in other people's misfortune, and even turned a deaf ear to it, and they were not in a hurry to solve the case, which was obviously intended to shield the murderer. At that time, the official position of Bai Juyi was the Left Chancery Doctor, and the task was to serve the prince in the Eastern Palace, with the responsibility to educate the prince. He was furious, and then sparsely advocated to strictly punish the murderer, to well-regulate the laws and disciplines. However, the officials of the court and the local military governors acted in collusion, and were hand in glove with each other. Therefore, Bai Juyi's proposal was not only not adopted, but was also ejected from the capital by the rulers due to the mere duty of the hearsay charges, and was relegated to the Jiujiang minister of war in ancient China, when he was forty-four years old. Bai Juyi's poems, such as "Peach blossom in the Dalin Temple", "The spring outing to the Qian Tang Lake" and so on, all won universal praise, and were very popular. Especially the two of his long narrative poems "Song of Everlasting Sorrow" and "Song of Pipa" represented the crowning achievement of his art, and more is a compulsory course for the lovers of literature.																			2160-1070		978-1-61275-069-9				2014	66						177	182																WOS:000375963800038

We analyzed 360 samples of carps, phytoplankton and water collected in 2017 during dry and rainy seasons in the Tanzanian basin of Lake Victoria. Samples were tested using PCR (ompW and ctxA) with DNA extracted from bacterial isolates and samples enriched in alkaline peptone water. Isolates were screened with polyvalent antiserum O1 followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Whole genome sequencing and bioinformatics tools were employed to investigate the genomic characteristics of the isolates. More V. cholerae positive samples were recovered by PCR when DNA was obtained from enriched samples than from isolates (69.0% vs. 21.3%, p < 0.05), irrespectively of season. We identified ten V. cholerae O1 among 22 ctxA-positive isolates. Further studies are needed to serotype the remaining ctxA-positive non-O1 strains. Sequenced strains belonged to El Tor atypical biotype of V. cholerae O1 of MLST ST69 harboring the seventh pandemic gene. Major virulence genes, ctxA, ctxB, zot, ace, tcpA, hlyA, rtxA, ompU, toxR, T6SS, alsD, makA and pathogenicity islands VPI-1, VPI-2, VSP-1, and VSP-2 were found in all strains. The strains contained Vibrio polysaccharide biosynthesis enzymes, the mshA gene and two-component response regulator proteins involved in stress response and autoinducers for quorum sensing and biofilm formation. They carried the SXT integrative conjugative element with phenotypic and genotypic resistance to aminoglycoside, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, phenicol, and quinolones. Strains contained a multidrug efflux pump component and were resistant to toxic compounds with copper homeostasis and cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance proteins. The environmental strains belonged to the third wave of the seventh pandemic and most are genetically closely related to recent outbreak strains from Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda with as low as three SNPs difference. Some strains have persisted longer in the environment and were more related to older outbreak strains in the region. V. cholerae O1 of outbreak potential seem to persist in Lake Victoria through interactions with fish and phytoplankton supported by the optimum water parameters and intrinsic genetic features enhancing survival in the aquatic environment.

J	Xue, K; Zhang, YC; Duan, HT; Ma, RH				Xue, Kun; Zhang, Yuchao; Duan, Hongtao; Ma, Ronghua			Variability of light absorption properties in optically complex inland waters of Lake Chaohu, China	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Absorption coefficients of phytoplankton, colored detrital matter (CDM), non-algal particles (NAP), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and their relative contributions to total non-water absorption (at,) are essential variables for bio-optical and radiative transfer models. Light absorption properties showed large range and variability sampled at 194 stations throughout Lake Chaohu between May 2013 and April 2015. The at was dominated by phytoplankton absorption (a(ph)) and NAP absorption (a(d)). The contribution of CDOM absorption to a(t -) (w) was lower than 30%. Phytoplankton and NAP were the primary sources of spatial and vertical variability in absorption properties. Light absorption by CDOM, though significant in magnitude, was relatively constant. CDM absorption (a(dg)) was dominated by NAP. The spatial variation of the absorption coefficients from each of the optically active constituents were driven by several main inflow rivers in the western and middle part of Lake Chaohu. Algal blooms and bottom resuspension contributed to vertical variability as observed by phytoplankton and NAP profiles. Specific absorption of phytoplankton had significant spatial and seasonal variations without vertical variation. The spectral slope of absorption showed no significant spatial variability (p > 0.05). Variations of absorption affected different ranges of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) spectrum, thereby increasing the difficulty of applying the remote sensing algorithm in optically complex waters. Parameters and relationships presented in this study provide useful information for bio-optical models and remote sensing of lakes similar to Lake Chaohu in terms of optical properties.

Terrestrial prey fuels the fish population of a small, high-latitude lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The significance of terrestrial carbon subsidies in lake ecosystems has been under active research, but the contribution of terrestrial energy to the highest trophic levels has been explored less frequently. Here, we examined the terrestrial energy contribution to the ingested and assimilated diet of introduced brown trout (Salmo trutta) in a small, high-latitude lake using stomach content, stable isotope and fatty acid analyses. Stomach content analysis of brown trout indicated a terrestrial contribution of 29 % during the open-water season. Terrestrial prey was mainly composed of rodents (23 % in volume), but also amphibians and terrestrial insects. A longer term estimate, obtained with a mixing model (SIAR) for liver and dorsal muscle stable isotopes from 2010 and 2011, revealed a terrestrial contribution of 68.5 and 63.5 %, respectively. Through a similar model, fatty acid analysis on 2011 samples estimated a contribution of 71.5 %. Despite the relatively high proportion of rodents in the trout ingested diet, no correlation was evident between the long-term rodent cycles and terrestrial energy contribution estimated with stable isotopes of muscle. Terrestrial prey were an important long-term energy source for fish in small high-latitude lake, but its contribution was not directly dependent on the availability of pulsed resources such as small mammals.

J	Potter, IC; Chuwen, BM; Hoeksema, SD; Elliott, M				Potter, Ian C.; Chuwen, Benjamin M.; Hoeksema, Steeg D.; Elliott, Michael			The concept of an estuary: A definition that incorporates systems which can become closed to the ocean and hypersaline	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The majority of the definitions of estuaries have been based on the characteristics of estuaries in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. As previously pointed out (Day, 1980), such definitions do not take into account such features as periodic closure of their mouths and hypersaline conditions during dry periods, which characterise many estuaries in southern Africa and south-western Australia. There is also ambiguity as to whether an estuary sensu stricto must be fed by a river. The following definition was developed to encompass the main characteristics of all estuaries: An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of water that is either permanently or periodically open to the sea and which receives at least periodic discharge from a river(s), and thus, while its salinity is typically less than that of natural sea water and varies temporally and along its length, it can become hypersaline in regions when evaporative water loss is high and freshwater and tidal inputs are negligible. Estuaries are thus regarded as unique ecosystems, which, in the case of fishes, for example, are occupied by species that collectively represent a particular suite of guilds. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Toxins and Other Bioactive Metabolites in Deep Chlorophyll Layers Containing the Cyanobacteria Planktothrix cf. isothrix in Two Georgian Bay Embayments, Lake Huron	TOXINS												The understanding of deep chlorophyll layers (DCLs) in the Great Lakes-largely reported as a mix of picoplankton and mixotrophic nanoflagellates-is predominantly based on studies of deep (>30 m), offshore locations. Here, we document and characterize nearshore DCLs from two meso-oligotrophic embayments, Twelve Mile Bay (TMB) and South Bay (SB), along eastern Georgian Bay, Lake Huron (Ontario, Canada) in 2014, 2015, and 2018. Both embayments showed the annual formation of DCLs, present as dense, thin, metalimnetic plates dominated by the large, potentially toxic, and bloom-forming cyanobacteria Planktothrix cf. isothrix. The contribution of P. cf. isothrix to the deep-living total biomass (TB) increased as thermal stratification progressed over the ice-free season, reaching 40% in TMB (0.6 mg/L at 9.5 m) and 65% in South Bay (3.5 mg/L at 7.5 m) in 2015. The euphotic zone in each embayment extended down past the mixed layer, into the nutrient-enriched hypoxic hypolimnia, consistent with other studies of similar systems with DCLs. The co-occurrence of the metal-oxidizing bacteria Leptothrix spp. and bactivorous flagellates within the metalimnetic DCLs suggests that the microbial loop plays an important role in recycling nutrients within these layers, particularly phosphate (PO4) and iron (Fe). Samples taken through the water column in both embayments showed measurable concentrations of the cyanobacterial toxins microcystins (max. 0.4 mu g/L) and the other bioactive metabolites anabaenopeptins (max. similar to 7 mu g/L) and cyanopeptolins (max. 1 ng/L), along with the corresponding genes (max. in 2018). These oligopeptides are known to act as metabolic inhibitors (e.g., in chemical defence against grazers, parasites) and allow a competitive advantage. In TMB, the 2018 peaks in these oligopeptides and genes coincided with the P. cf. isothrix DCLs, suggesting this species as the main source. Our data indicate that intersecting physicochemical gradients of light and nutrient-enriched hypoxic hypolimnia are key factors in supporting DCLs in TMB and SB. Microbial activity and allelopathy may also influence DCL community structure and function, and require further investigation, particularly related to the dominance of potentially toxigenic species such as P. cf. isothrix.					; Miller, Todd/Y-3612-2019	Watson, L.

J	Rojo, C				Rojo, Carmen			Community assembly: perspectives from phytoplankton's studies	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Community assembly (CA) is a topic of growing interest in ecology due to global change, among other reasons. A review of the latter 20 years in plankton CA studies suggests some advancements and drawbacks. Most works deal with groups of same trophic level species and overlook food webs, except the proposal of the PEG model. Phytoplankton has focused the most on theoretical grounds of CA: (i) to find species associations and establish their templates (condition and resource matrices) in order to define assembly rules, (ii) to set the main assembling mechanisms arising from mean-trait studies and environmental constraints, and (iii) to debate on the predictable ability of that view. After the last decade of advancements, CA future will certainly foster not only by considering classical ecological mechanisms (abiotic selection, biotic interactions, history), but also by including evolutionary and metacommunity (i.e. regional) processes. Massive DNA metabarcoding of taxa, incorporation of novel traits (such as the proportional growth rate), consideration of non-dominant species and experimentation on templates and trajectories will certainly tune up and widen our view of CA, a topic very earlier tackled successfully by Colin Reynolds.

Seasonal habitat utilization provides evidence for site fidelity during both spawn and non-spawning seasons in Lake Ontario cisco Coregonus artedi	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Lake Ontario cisco Coregonus artedi population declined in the 20th century, and restoration of this species is a management objective. Management tools to restore cisco are limited because little is known about cisco spawning behavior and habitat use. We tagged 76 cisco from a remnant population in Chaumont Bay, Lake Ontario with acoustic transmitters and characterized seasonal habitat use from 2016 to 2021. We also used fine-scale acoustic telemetry, coregonine egg collections, and trap net catches to better understand cisco spawning behaviors related to spawn timing and site selection. Network analysis and Bayesian standard ellipse area indicated that cisco utilization of lake regions and bathythermal niche space varied by season. During spawning season, male cisco concentrated in Chaumont Bay over shallow (-3 m) rocky shoals where cisco egg deposition was the greatest. Spawning site fidelity to Chaumont Bay was observed for all male cisco surviving to successive years (n = 23). Acoustic-tagged females did not survive consecutive spawning seasons, but trap net catches indicated females were less abundant and occupied spawning areas for less time than males. Post spawn, some individual male cisco (n = 5/23) had differential, yet consistent, annual migrations to separate regions of Lake Ontario, suggesting fidelity to feeding sites. Our results reveal seasonal habitats used by male cisco and, importantly, caution that environmental changes to a single spawning site could negatively affect the remnant Chaumont Bay cisco population. Specialized conservation efforts may be necessary when cisco spawning aggregations have diverse post-spawn migratory behaviors but a central spawning ground.(c) 2023 The US Geological Survey.

The water quality parameters of Qujiang River basically meet the class 3 value of environmental quality standards for surface water (GB3838-2002, China). CPI varies from 0.62 to 1.06 and the water quality is characterized by slight pollution at the three monitoring sections. Cluster analysis (CA) results show that the months can be divided into three groups on the basis of similarities of the water quality characteristics: Group 1 (dry season), which includes January-April and November-December; Group 2 (flood season), that is, July; Group 3 (flat season), which consists of May-June and August-October. Principal component analysis (PCA) results identify four principal components (PCs) for the dry season and flood season, and five PCs for the flat season, thus explaining 58.23%, 82.94%, and 73.23% of the total variance, respectively. The results of the independent sample t-test show significant differences among the pH, Permanganate index (CODMn), Ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), Total nitrogen (TN), Fecal coliform (F.coli), and (Flow) Q in the three monitoring sections. Moreover, the pollution is more serious in Baita than Tuanbaoling and Sailong Section and the main problem in the Qujiang River is the high water organic and nitrogen nutrient pollutant content. Hence, monitoring and protection need to be strengthened in the Baita section of Qujiang River.

J	Zhang, ZZ; Yu, RH				Zhang, Zhuangzhuang; Yu, Ruihong			Assessment of Soil Erosion from an Ungauged Small Watershed and Its Effect on Lake Ulansuhai, China	LAND												Lake Ulansuhai, one of the main water sources for semi-arid areas of China, has a local deposit caused by soil erosion during past decades. However, a lack of monitor stations prevents better estimation of soil erosion levels. Therefore, we try to estimate soil erosion in the Huangtuyaozi (HTYZ) watershed, an ungauged small watershed of the lake's eastern watershed, by using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model and multi-source remote sensing data, and analyze its key drivers and effect on the lake siltation. The result showed that the soil erosion rate in the HTYZ watershed ranged from 0 to 129.893 t ha(-1) yr(-1) with an average of 6.45 t ha(-1) yr(-1) during 1986-2015. In particular, 80.06% of the area was less than 10 t ha(-1) yr(-1), and just 0.06% was over 50 t ha(-1) yr(-1), mainly in the mountain area, the southern part of the HTYZ watershed. Moreover, rainfall erosivity factor is the key factor, and rainfall during flood season plays a key role in soil erosion. Due to the soil erosion of HTYZ, siltation in Lake Ulansuhai reached 223.83 ha, with the annual siltation area increasing at a rate of 7.46 ha/yr. The results could provide a reference for estimating soil erosion of ungauged small watershed in semi-arid areas.

An Exploratory Study	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The haor landscape is a wetland ecosystem in northeast Bangladesh, comprising shallow depressions that undergo large changes in water inundation between the monsoon and dry seasons. Sediment is supplied to the haor from rivers originating in the adjacent Shillong Plateau, and can adversely affect these largely arable agricultural lands. The critical adverse effects of changing hydrology and enhanced sedimentation due to anthropogenic change include the reduction of natural water storage capacity, changes in the timing and magnitude of floods, and increasing loss and damage to crops, which consequently affect the livelihoods of wetland dwellers. This study employs a mixed-methods approach to investigate how sedimentation has affected the livelihoods of the residents and the pressures they experience. Cross-sectional surveys and interviews were conducted with 180 respondents in Lubar and Pochashul Haors (LPH), Sunamganj District, and allied with an analysis of satellite images that reveals the nature of landscape change over the past 56 years. Our findings confirm that sedimentation has been promoted through both natural processes of alluvial fan progradation and anthropogenic forcings. Enhanced sedimentation threatens the agriculture of the region and affects the livelihood of local inhabitants, leading to other societal issues related to income, education, employment, health, displacement, and sexual harassment. The mixed methods employed herein are essential tools to reveal these effects. In order to reduce the vulnerability of the local population, a transboundary dialog between India and Bangladesh is needed to realize measures to protect wetland resources and achieve progress towards environmental sustainability.

Our approach involved the following steps: (1) extracting bluff deformation rates (velocities along the line of sight of the satellite) using a stack of Sentinel-1A radar imagery in ascending acquisition geometry acquired between 2017 and 2021 and applying the Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS) InSAR time series analysis method; (2) generating high-resolution (5 cm) elevation models and orthophotos from temporal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys acquired in 2017, 2019, and 2021; and (3) comparing the temporal variations in mass wasting events to other relevant datasets including the ISBAS-based bluff deformation time series, lake level (LL) variations, and local glacial stratigraphy. We identified areas witnessing high line-of-sight (LOS) deformation rates (up to -21 mm/year) along the bluff from the ISBAS analysis and seasonal deformation patterns associated with freeze-thaw cycles, suggesting a causal effect. The acceleration of slope failures detected from field and UAV acquisitions correlated with high LLs and intensified onshore wave energy in 2020. The adopted methodology successfully predicts landslides caused by freezes and thaws of the slope face by identifying prolonged slow deformation preceding slope failures, but it does not predict the catastrophic landslides preceded by short-lived LOS deformation related to LL rise.

High N fertilization (urea) in the flooded paddy soils has caused adverse environmental impacts such as ammonia (NH3) volatilization, nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and nitrate (NO3-) leaching. This study aims to investigate the effects of N fertilization rates in combination with an iron amendment on rice yields and N losses from flooded paddy fields. We performed a 2-year field plot experiment with traditional rice-wheat rotation in China's Yangtze River Delta. The investigation consisted of seven treatments, including 100%, 80%, 60%, and 0% of the conventional N (urea and commercial organic manure) fertilization rate, and 80%, 60%, and 0% of the conventional N with the iron powder (>= 99% purity) amendment. The rice yields decreased with a reduction in the conventional N fertilization rate, whereas they were comparable after the iron application under the 80% and 60% conventional N rate. The critical N losses, including NH3 volatilization, N2O emissions, and NO3- and NH4+ leaching, generally decreased with a reduction in the conventional N fertilization rate. These N losses were significantly greater after the iron amendment compared with the non-amended treatments under the 80% and 60% conventional N fertilization rate in the first rice-growing season. However, it was comparable between the iron-amended and the non-amended treatments in the second season. Furthermore, NO3- leaching was the most significant N loss throughout the two rice seasons, followed by NH3 volatilization. The iron amendment significantly increased soil Fe2+ content compared with the non-amended treatments irrespective of N fertilization, suggesting the reduction of amended iron by iron-reducing bacteria and their simultaneous N fixation. A combination of the iron application with 60-80% of the conventional N fertilization rate could maintain rice yields similar to the conventional N fertilization rate while reducing the critical N losses in the flooded paddy field tested in this study. Our study leads to the establishment of novel and practical rice cultivation, which is a step towards the development of green agriculture.

However, frequencies adapted by different agencies might not be sufficient to provide an accurate indication of water quality status. In this study, data from low- and high-resolution water quality datasets were analyzed to determine the extent to which monitoring objectives could be achieved with different sampling frequencies, with a view to providing recommendations and best practices for water quality monitoring frequency in places with limited resources with which to implement a high-frequency monitoring plan. Water quality data from two watersheds (Maumee River and Raisin River) located in the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) were used since these watersheds have consistent records over substantial periods of time, and the water quality data available have a high resolution (at least daily). The water quality constituents analyzed included suspended solids (SS), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and nitrate + nitrite (NO2+3). Sources of pollutants for watersheds located in the WLEB include contributions from point sources like discharges from sewage treatment plants and non-point sources such as agricultural and urban storm runoff. Weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, and seasonal datasets were created from the original datasets, following different sampling rules based on the day of the week, week of the month, and month of the year. The resulting datasets were then compared to the original dataset to determine how the sampling frequency would affect the results obtained in a water quality assessment when different monitoring objectives are considered. Results indicated that constituents easily transported by water (such as sediments and nutrients) require more than 50 samples/year to provide a small error (< 10%) with a confidence interval of 95%. Monthly and seasonal sampling were found appropriate to report a stream's prevailing water quality status and statistical properties. However, these resolutions might not be sufficient to capture long-term trends, in which case bi-weekly samples would be preferable. Limitations of low-resolution sampling frequency could be overcome by including rainfall events and random sampling during specific time windows as part of the monitoring plan.

Resistance for norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, kanamycin monosulfate (KM), tetracycline (TC), and sulfamethoxazole (ST) was measured with Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. The prevalence of Escherichia coli ranged from 10 to 27CFU (colony-forming unit)ml(-1) in Kelani River in Sri Lanka, and most of the E. coli isolates were resistant to more than one antibiotic. However, the resistance for TC and ST was much higher than other antibiotics. We found that the resistance percentage for older antibiotics like TC and ST was higher than the newer antibiotics. We detected genes that confer resistance to TCs, sulfonamides, beta-lactams, and fluoroquinolones. Seasonal variation in the resistance of fluoroquinolones was much higher than the non-fluoroquinolones, but the effect was antagonistic. Overall, the significant seasonal variations imply the importance of mixed source and environmental conditions for development and transmission of antibiotic resistance.					kumar, manish/KIE-1953-2024; Honda, Ryo/A-2768-2014	Chaminda, Tushara/0000-0003-4909-5664; 													2059-7037					APR 13	2020	3	1							12	10.1038/s41545-020-0058-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41545-020-0058-6													WOS:000525490500001
J	Grey, J				Grey, Jonathan			The Incredible Lightness of Being Methane-Fuelled: Stable Isotopes Reveal Alternative Energy Pathways in Aquatic Ecosystems and Beyond	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												We have known about the processes of methanogenesis and methanotrophy for over 100 years, since the days of Winogradsky, yet their contributions to the carbon cycle were deemed to be of negligible importance for the majority of that period. It is only in the last two decades that methane has been appreciated for its role in the global carbon cycle, and stable isotopes have come to the forefront as tools for identifying and tracking the fate of methane-derived carbon (MDC) within food webs, especially within aquatic ecosystems. While it is not surprising that chemosynthetic processes dominate and contribute almost 100% to the biomass of organisms residing within extreme habitats like deep ocean hydrothermal vents and seeps, way below the reach of photosynthetically active radiation, it is perhaps counterintuitive to find reliance upon MDC in shallow, well-lit, well-oxygenated streams. Yet, apparently, MDC contributes to varying degrees across the spectrum from point sources to extremely diffuse sources. Certainly a good proportion of the evidence for MDC contributing to freshwater food webs comes from somewhere in the middle of that spectrum: from studies of seasonally stratifying lakes (mono- or dimictic) wherein, there is a defined gradient or boundary at which anoxic meet oxic conditions and consequently allows for close coupling of methanogenesis and methanotrophy. However, even seemingly well mixed (polymictic) lakes have a contribution of MDC contributing to the benthic biomass, despite an almost continual supply of photosynthetic carbon being delivered from the surface. Aside from the fundamental importance of identifying the carbon sources fuelling biomass production, stable isotopes have been integral in the tool box of palaeolimnologists seeking to identify how contributions from methane have waxed and waned over time. Here, we synthesize the current state of knowledge in the use of stable isotopes to trace MDC in primarily freshwater ecosystems.					; Grey, Jonathan/B-3346-2012	Grey, Jonathan/0000-0001-9069-2271; 													2296-701X						2016	4								8	10.3389/fevo.2016.00008	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2016.00008													WOS:000517761700008

Four sampling sites with different intensities of cage aquaculture activities were chosen and were evenly distributed from upstream to downstream of the Wujiangdu Reservoir. Elevated MeHg concentrations and the high percentage of MeHg in solid and liquid phases of the surface sediment demonstrated that the active Hg methylation process occurred downstream of the Wujiangdu Reservoir. In contrast, the absence of obvious peaks for MeHg in sediment from the upper reaches of the Wujiangdu Reservoir, consistent with low levels of organic matter, suggested that production of MeHg was limited. In sediment with high organic matter content, reduction occurred closer to the sediment surface, resulting in maximum MeHg concentration in these layers. The correlation between MeHg and organic carbon implied that organic matter content in the sediment originating from cage aquaculture activities can help to predict MeHg production rates in reservoirs, which could be used to assess possible MeHg contamination in a reservoir ecosystem.

Trends in rainfall and runoff in the Blue Nile Basin: 1964-2003	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Most of the water from the Nile originates in Ethiopia but there is no agreement on how land degradation or climate change affects the future flow in downstream countries. The objective of this paper is to improve the understanding of future conditions by analysing historical trends. During the period 1964-2003, the average monthly basin-wide precipitation and monthly discharge data were collected and analysed statistically for two stations in the upper 30% of the Blue Nile Basin and monthly and 10-day discharge data of one station at the Sudan-Ethiopia border. A rainfall-runoff model examined the causes for observed trends. The results show that, while there was no significant trend in the seasonal and annual basin-wide average rainfall, significant increases in discharge during the long rainy season (June to September) were observed at all three stations. In the upper Blue Nile, the short rainy season flow (March to May) increased, while the dry season flow (October to February) stayed the same. At the Sudan border, the dry season flow decreased significantly with no change in the short rainy season flow. The difference in response was likely due to the construction of weir in the 1990s at the Lake Tana outlet that affected the upper Blue Nile discharge significantly but affected less than 10% of the discharge at the Sudan border. The rainfall-runoff model reproduced the observed trends, assuming that an additional 10% of the hillsides were eroded in the 40-year time span and generated overland flow instead of interflow and base flow. Models concerning future trends in the Nile cannot assume that the landscape runoff processes will remain static. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Blakey, RV; Kingsford, RT; Law, BS; Stoklosa, J				Blakey, Rachel V.; Kingsford, Richard T.; Law, Brad S.; Stoklosa, Jakub			Floodplain habitat is disproportionately important for bats in a large river basin	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Floodplain ecosystems across the world have declined with river regulation and floodplain development, reducing flood frequency and extent and fragmenting flood-dependent vegetation. There is growing evidence that these changes to flooding disproportionately affect terrestrial taxa, such as bats. We compared bat activity and insect abundance across the floodplain mosaic (river, lake, vegetated wetland, floodplain forest, floodplain woodland) representing decreasing flooding histories, and two dry habitats (dry vegetation, agricultural). We replicated these habitats in each of six floodplain systems of the Murray-Darling Basin, a large semi-arid river basin (1,042,7301cm2) in south-eastern Australia. Our sites were spread across > 400,000 km(2), traversing climatic and hydrological gradients. Rivers and lakes with open water and riparian trees had greater total activity (5 times), foraging activity (14 times) and bat richness (1.5 times) than dry vegetation. Activities of all mesic bat species, as well as some widespread and arid-adapted bat species, were positively associated with floodplain habitats when compared with dry vegetation. Lowest overall total activity, foraging activity and richness were observed in dry agricultural (cropping, grazing and fallow) habitats, with two of six threatened species in our study area never recorded in agricultural habitats. Prey abundance was not correlated with bat activity or habitat. The mosaic of floodplain habitats appears to be of disproportionate value for bat communities compared to dominant land covers of agricultural and dry vegetation. Loss of floodplain habitats through continued river regulation and floodplain development are likely reduce diversity and abundance of bats that rely on floodplains for foraging and roosting. Lags in bat roost formation and forest structure mean these changes could take over a century to reverse. To sustain bat communities, we recommend increasing environmental flows to floodplains during the bat lactating season, implementing stronger protection of floodplains from river regulation and floodplain development and where possible, restoring floodplains affected by agriculture into functioning wetlands.					; Blakey, Rachel/AAD-9772-2019; Law, Brad/IAQ-8054-2023	Law, Bradley/0000-0002-3991-3865; Blakey, Rachel/0000-0002-6654-5703; Kingsford, Richard/0000-0001-6565-4134; 													0006-3207	1873-2917				NOV	2017	215						1	10		10.1016/j.biocon.2017.08.030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2017.08.030													WOS:000414883000001

Carbon isotope fractionation by anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria in euxinic Lake Cadagno	GEOBIOLOGY												Anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria utilize ancient metabolic pathways to link sulfur and iron metabolism to the reduction of CO2. In meromictic Lake Cadagno, Switzerland, both purple sulfur (PSB) and green sulfur anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (GSB) dominate the chemocline community and drive the sulfur cycle. PSB and GSB fix carbon utilizing different enzymatic pathways and these fractionate C-isotopes to different extents. Here, these differences in C-isotope fractionation are used to constrain the relative input of various anoxygenic phototrophs to the bulk community C-isotope signal in the chemocline. We sought to determine whether a distinct isotopic signature of GSB and PSB in the chemocline persists in the settling fraction and in the sediment. To answer these questions, we also sought investigated C-isotope fractionation in the water column, settling material, and sediment of Lake Cadagno, compared these values to C-isotope fractionation of isolated anoxygenic phototroph cultures, and took a mass balance approach to investigate relative contributions to the bulk fractionation signature. We found a large C-isotope fractionation between dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) in the Lake Cadagno chemocline. This large fractionation between the DIC and POC was also found in culture experiments carried out with anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria isolated from the lake. In the Lake Cadagno chemocline, anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria controlled the bulk C-isotope fractionation, but the influence of GSB and PSB differed with season. Furthermore, the contribution of PSB and GSB to bulk C-isotope fractionation in the chemocline could be traced in the settling fraction and in the sediment. Taken together with other studies, such as lipid biomarker analyzes and investigations of other stratified lakes, these results offer a firmer understanding of diagenetic influences on bacterial biomass.					; Canfield, Don/C-1735-2012; Posth, Nicole/OHR-5290-2025; Posth, Nicole/J-9608-2016; Frigaard, Niels-Ulrik/H-1277-2011	Bristow, Laura/0000-0003-4865-070X; Canfield, Don/0000-0001-7602-8366; Posth, Nicole/0000-0002-6695-6115; Frigaard, Niels-Ulrik/0000-0002-9389-8109													1472-4677	1472-4669				NOV	2017	15	6					798	816		10.1111/gbi.12254	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gbi.12254								28866873					WOS:000413045100005

MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Sympatric speciation has been debated in evolutionary biology for decades. Although it has gained in acceptance recently, still only a handful of empirical examples are seen as valid (e.g. crater lake cichlids). In this study, we disentangle the role of hypertrophied lips in the repeated adaptive radiations of Nicaraguan crater lake cichlid fish. We assessed the role of disruptive selection and assortative mating during the early stages of divergence and found a functional trade-off in feeding behaviour between thick-and thin-lipped ecotypes, suggesting that this trait is a target of disruptive selection. Thick-lipped fish perform better on nonevasive prey at the cost of a poorer performance on evasive prey. Using enclosures in the wild, we found that thick-lipped fish perform significantly better in rocky than in sandy habitats. We found almost no mixed pairs during two breeding seasons and hence significant assortative mating. Genetic differentiation between ecotypes seems to be related to the time since colonization, being subtle in L. Masaya (1600 generations ago) and absent in the younger L. Apoyeque (< 600 generations ago). Genome-wide differentiation between ecotypes was higher in the old source lakes than in the young crater lakes. Our results suggest that hypertrophied lips might be promoting incipient sympatric speciation through divergent selection (ecological divergence in feeding performance) and nonrandom mating (assortative mating) in the young Nicaraguan crater lakes. Nonetheless, further manipulative experiments are needed in order to confirm the role of hypertrophied lips as the main cue for assortative mating.					; Torres-Dowdall, Julian/MAI-3605-2025; Henning, Frederico/M-8042-2017; Machado-Schiaffino, Gonzalo/AAE-3114-2020; Meyer, Axel/C-9826-2009; Machado-Schiaffino, Gonzalo/Q-9480-2018; Henning, Frederico/AAS-2090-2020	Baumgarten, Lukas/0000-0002-9530-954X; Henning, Frederico/0000-0002-5359-504X; Meyer, Axel/0000-0002-0888-8193; Torres-Dowdall, Julian/0000-0003-2729-6246; Kautt, Andreas/0000-0001-7792-0735; Machado-Schiaffino, Gonzalo/0000-0002-4049-3247; 													0962-1083	1365-294X				APR	2017	26	8					2348	2362		10.1111/mec.14029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.14029								28133841					WOS:000400334600011

Stratification and horizontal exchange in Lake Victoria, East Africa	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We characterize stratification patterns over diel, seasonal, and annual time scales in inshore and offshore regions of Lake Victoria, East Africa; determine conditions leading to horizontal exchanges; and, using surface energy budgets derived from local meteorological stations and two reanalysis products, address whether stratification depends on advective as opposed to local processes. The largest change in the surface energy budget occurred when winds intensified at the end of the long rains, with the wind's intensification, duration, and spatial extent dependent on El Nino-Southern Oscillation cycles. These winds flush inshore waters and cause cross-basin upwelling similar to that observed in the deep African Great Lakes. Wedderburn numbers indicated mixing and cross-basin within-thermocline transport. The internal wave-induced mixing and enhanced latent heat fluxes of 2300 to 2400 W m(-2) contributed to the loss of seasonal stratification. Advection of cool water was required to balance the heat budget of northern offshore waters in the latter half of the southeast monsoon except in an El Nino year. Northern waters became weakly stratified after the southeast monsoon, with nocturnal winds contributing to heat transport and ventilation of the lower water column. Following the rainy season, downwelling by sustained southerly albeit low winds is a likely cause of the seasonal thermocline. Inshore waters are 0.2- 1.5 degrees C warmer than those offshore, conditions conducive to horizontal convective circulation except during onshore winds. The seasonal cycle of stratification and inshore-offshore and cross-basin exchanges are moderated by differential heating, cooling, and basin-scale thermocline tilting.

Five selected tissues, including liver, gill, bone, skin, and muscle were examined for the concentration of Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, and Ni. The concentrations of Cd and Pb were found high in the muscle tissues of the eels. Additionally, high amounts of Zn and Cu metals were observed in the liver, whereas the Cd, Pb, and Ni metals were highly detected in gill. The accumulation of Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, and Ni in both skin and bone of the eel seems to vary between seasons. Low levels of Zn, Cu, and Ni were identified in the muscle tissues of the eels. This study revealed that the concentration of Cd and Pb in the muscle tissues of Asian swamp eels exceeded the permissible limits by the US EPA, suggesting the consumption of the muscle may be hazardous and can severely affect one's health.

Accurate estimation of the sources and dynamic characteristics of POC is important for understanding the migration and transformation of organic carbon. However, the synchronous observation of POC sources with large areas through remote sensing is still challenging because of the complex composition of POC and the optical conditions of inland lakes. In this study, a three-band (1/ Rrs (689)-1/ Rrs (717)) x Rrs (697)) empirical algorithm of POC sources was constructed based on remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(lambda)) and the proportion of endogenous POC estimated from the field-measured stable isotope (delta 13CPOC) values. The validation and calibration results of the three-band algorithm showed robust performance, with MAPE and RMSE of estimated values and measured values of 10% and 0.07, respectively. The three-band algorithm had good simulation results for the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI), Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) spectra. The POC sources estimated by the three-band algorithm suggest that the endogenous POC of Taihu Lake in August showed a decreasing trend from 2006 to 2019. The variation in terrestrial POC was slow and stable for both annual and monthly variations. The analysis of POC sources with total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), water temperature, and wind speed indicated that terrestrial POC was closely related to wind speed (r = 0.33, P < 0.001), while endogenous POC was significantly associated with TP (r = 0.6, P < 0.001), TN (r = 0.56, P < 0.001), and water temperature (r = 0.49, P < 0.001). The use of remote sensing algorithms to evaluate POC from different sources is convenient and effective; furthermore, it helps to better understand the carbon cycle in lacustrine ecosystems.					huang, Changchun/E-6580-2016; Huang, Chulong/J-5873-2013; Huang, Tao/C-3315-2014; Huang, Chu-Long/J-5873-2013; Zhao, Zhilong/ABH-1134-2021	Zhilong, Zhao/0000-0002-4636-9888; Huang, Tao/0000-0003-4237-7087; Huang, Chu-Long/0000-0002-6047-3235; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2021	129								107907	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107907	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107907		JUN 2021											WOS:000685516500002

Wildlife species richness and densities in wildlife corridors of Northern Tanzania	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												Wildlife corridors are crucial for effective conservation in fragmented landscapes, yet these corridors are vanishing across Africa. In order to assess the relative conservation effectiveness of two distinct management areas linking Tarangire and Lake Manyara National Parks in Northern Tanzania, we assessed seasonal densities of wild and domestic species as well as species richness of large mammals over a 3 plus -year time period. Line distance sampling showed that livestock densities were considerably higher in a human-dominated area with little enforcement of natural resource utilization (Mto wa Mbu Game Controlled Area; CA) than in a Maasai pastoral area with stricter limitations and enforcement of natural resource utilization (Manyara Ranch; MR). Conversely, densities of most corridor-dwelling (giraffe, Kirk's dik dik, and ostrich) and migratory (Grant's gazelles, zebra, and wildebeest) wildlife species were mostly higher in MR compared to the CA. Large mammal species richness was about two times higher in MR than in the CA. Despite strong anthropogenic pressures on communal lands and natural resources, our long-term wildlife monitoring provides evidence of continued connectivity in the Tarangire-Manyara ecosystem. At the same time, we caution that continued land-use changes and illegal exploitation of wildlife resources severely threaten the functional connectivity of this ecosystem. Our comparative analysis highlights the conservation value of pastoral lands in East African savannahs, provided that additional stressors such as land-use changes and uncontrolled hunting of wildlife are restricted.

Catch-and-Release Rates of Sport Fishes in Northern Wisconsin from an Angler Diary Survey	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Recreational freshwater fisheries are key components of local economies in many regions. The quality of these fisheries can be affected not only by harvest but also by catch-and-release practices. Documenting catch and release among sport fish taxa is, therefore, important to fisheries researchers studying sport fishes and managers regulating these fisheries. We used an angler diary survey to assess taxon-specific effort, catch, harvest, release, and reason for release during the 2011 open-water season. Our study included information on 5,007 fishing trips taken by 652 anglers. These anglers visited 279 lakes spanning 11,761.5km(2) of northern Wisconsin. Muskellunge Esox masquinongy, black bass (i.e., Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu and Largemouth Bass M. salmoides), Northern Pike E. lucius, Walleye Sander vitreus, and panfish were released at rates of 99, 97, 86, 67, and 67%, respectively, when targeted by anglers. This study is the first to document black bass catch-and-release rates in the region and corroborates previous findings of Muskellunge and Walleye catch-and-release rates based on creel surveys. Voluntary catch and release was the most common reason for release. Our findings suggest that regulations may be much more generous than the harvest rates practiced by anglers and that catch-and-release angling practices may be an important factor affecting these sport fish populations.

Global and local drivers of the relative importance of allochthonous and autochthonous energy sources to freshwater food webs	ECOGRAPHY												Resource quantity (i.e. organic matter; OM) is a main driver of the prevailing energy pathway in freshwater food webs. The OM pool is mainly composed of allochthonous material, a primary resource for freshwater consumers. Contrastingly, small amounts of autochthonous OM (i.e. algae) can subsidize aquatic communities due to its higher nutritional quality. To date, there is no consensus about the relative importance of allochthonous and autochthonous OM for freshwater food webs or the environmental factors driving their relative importance. We fill this gap by evaluating the relative importance of allochthonous and autochthonous OM sources for freshwater food webs on a global scale through a meta-analytical approach. We gathered the outcome of stable isotope mixing models of 2789 cases from 58 published studies and calculated a response ratio between the mean contributions of allochthonous and autochthonous OM for freshwater consumers. Using mixed-effect models and a multimodel inference approach, we tested the influence of latitude, habitat type, ecosystem size, climate and terrestrial productivity over the response ratio. The relative contribution of autochthonous OM was higher in lotic systems. In lentic systems, increasing terrestrial productivity increased the relative contribution of autochthonous OM, while increasing precipitation and temperature seasonality reduced this relative contribution. We suggested that factors increasing terrestrial productivity might also boost autochthonous OM in these systems, while precipitation increases the transport of allochthonous OM to freshwater habitats. We did not find any relationship between environmental factors and the relative contribution of autochthonous OM for lotic systems. We concluded that the relative contribution of allochthonous and autochthonous energy sources to freshwater food webs differs between lotic and lentic ecosystems and it is dependent on multiple environmental factors.					; S.

In this study, a comprehensive inventory of fertilizer application to rice fields was compiled for China from 1979-2015. In 2015, fertilizer application was estimated to be 0.96 x 10(9) kg for early rice, 2.67 x 10(9) kg for single rice, and 1.11 x 10(9) kg for late rice. Based on the fertilizer application and region-specific emissions factors, ammonia (NH3) volatilizations from growing-season rice fields were estimated over the same period. We found that the total NH3 emissions increased during 1979-1998, while decreased during 1998-2015 with fluctuations. The decreasing trend of NH3 emission was likely attributed to changes of application proportions of ammonium bicarbonate (ABC) and other fertilizers. ABC and urea were the two dominant contributors, and contributed over 90% of the total NH3 emissions. Spatially, high emissions were identified in the Middle-lower Yangtze River Plain, Huaihe River Basin, Taihu Lake region, Pearl River delta and Sichuan basin. Monthly emissions patterns were estimated according to rice calendars. The damage from NH3 emissions was estimated as 26.79 billion yuan and accounted for 0.04% of the Gross Domestic Production of China in 2015. Finally, we discussed the NH3 reduction strategies from the perspective of both the government and farmers and suggested that an incentive scheme should be established to guide fanners to optimize traditional agricultural management.					ouyang, wei/AAM-8141-2020; Liu, Hongbin/U-1853-2019; He, Mengchang/B-6466-2012	wei, ouyang/0000-0002-5851-056X; He, Mengchang/0000-0001-8975-8034													0167-8809	1873-2305				OCT 1	2018	265						112	122		10.1016/j.agee.2018.05.025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.05.025													WOS:000443664900013

For example, freshwater zooplankton with different life-history strategies, such as sexual or parthenogenetic reproduction, may respond differently to increased mean temperatures and rapid temperature fluctuations. Therefore, we conducted a long-term (18months) mesocosm experiment where we evaluated the effects of increased mean temperature (4 degrees C) and an identical energy input but delivered through temperature fluctuations, i.e., as heat waves. We show that different rotifer prey species have specific temperature requirements and use limited and species-specific temperature windows for recruiting from the sediment. On the contrary, co-occurring predatory cyclopoid copepods recruit from adult or subadult resting stages and are therefore able to respond to short-term temperature fluctuations. Hence, these different life-history strategies affect the interactions between cyclopoid copepods and rotifers by reducing the risk of a temporal mismatch in predator-prey dynamics in a climate change scenario. Thus, we conclude that predatory cyclopoid copepods with long generation time are likely to benefit from heat waves since they rapidly wake up even at short temperature elevations and thereby suppress fast reproducing prey populations, such as rotifers. In a broader perspective, our findings suggest that differences in life-history traits will affect predator-prey interactions, and thereby alter community dynamics, in a future climate change scenario.

Phytoliths from excavated raised-field soil units, together with pollen and charcoal in sediment cores from two oxbow lakes, were analysed to provide a history of land use and agriculture at the El Cerro raised-field site. The construction of raised fields involved the removal of savanna trees, and gallery forest was cleared from the area by ad 310. Despite the low fertility of Llanos de Moxos soils, we determined that pre-Columbian raised-field agriculture sufficiently improved soil conditions for maize cultivation. Fire was used as a common management practice until ad 1300, at which point, the land-use strategy shifted towards less frequent burning of savannas and raised fields. Alongside a reduction in the use of fire, sweet potato cultivation and the exploitation of Inga fruits formed part of a mixed resource strategy from ad 1300 to 1450. The pre-Columbian impact on the landscape began to lessen around ad 1450, as shown by an increase in savanna trees and gallery forest. Although agriculture at the site began to decline prior to European arrival, the abandonment of raised fields was protracted, with evidence of sweet potato cultivation occurring as late as ad 1800.					; Iriarte, Jose/A-1141-2010; Walker, John/AAN-7817-2020	Whitney, Bronwen/0000-0002-2329-9645; Iriarte, Jose/0000-0002-8155-5360; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2014	24	2					231	241		10.1177/0959683613517401	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683613517401													WOS:000329828000010

Remote sensing permits studying the dynamics of vegetation productivity and wetlands in response to climate variability at different scales. In this study we identified the main climate variables that control vegetation dynamics and water balance in Cumbres Calchaquies, NW Argentina. For this, we built annual time series from 1986 to 2019 of Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI, to quantify spare vegetation productivity), lake area, and snow-ice cover of peatlands, as indicators of mountain productivity and hydrology. We used a decompose function to explore trend, seasonality and random signal of the three-time series, and explored for significant changes in the mean value of consecutive periods. We used correlational analysis to explore their associations with climate records at local, regional, and global scales. The results showed that, SAVI and hydrological indicators presented different fluctuation patterns more pronounced since 2012, when they showed divergent trends with increasing SAVI and decreasing lake area and snow-ice cover. The three indicators responded differently to climate; SAVI increased in warmer years and lake area reflected the water balance of previous years. Snow-ice cover of peatlands was highly correlated with lake area. La Nina had a positive effect on lake area and snow-ice cover and a negative on SAVI, while El Nino had a negative effect on SAVI. Fluctuations of lake areas were synchronized with lake area in the nearby Argentinian puna, suggesting that climate signals have regional extent. The information provided by the three hydroclimate indicators is complementary and reflects different climate components and processes; biological processes (SAVI), physical processes (snow ice cover) and their combination (lake area). This study provides a systematic accessible replicable tool for mountain eco-hydrology long-term monitoring.					; Carilla, Julieta/KFS-6353-2024	Carilla, Julieta/0000-0002-7034-4154; 													1664-462X					JAN 20	2023	13								1067096	10.3389/fpls.2022.1067096	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.1067096								36743541					WOS:000924391000001
J	Mayanglambam, B; Neelam, SS				Mayanglambam, Bhagita; Neelam, Siva Siddaiah			Physicochemistry and water quality of Loktak Lake water, Manipur, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY												A total of 32 surface water samples (pre - and post-monsoon) from different locations of Loktak Lake, Manipur, were studied for physicochemistry and water quality to assess its potability. Parameters, namely, water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), major ions (Ca-2+,Ca- Mg2+, Na-+,Na- K+, HCO3 & x2c9;, Cl & x2c9;, NO3 & x2c9;, PO43 & x2c9; and SO42 & x2c9;), dissolved silica (H4SiO4) and potentially toxic elements (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, Co, Cd and Pb) were analysed. The water is neutral to alkaline in pre-monsoon and slightly acidic to alkaline in post-monsoon. Twenty-five percent of the post-monsoon samples have a higher pH than the WHO acceptable limit. The water is soft with low EC and total dissolved solids (TDS). The pre-monsoon samples have a relatively higher concentration in the majority of parameters studied except HCO3 & x2c9;, SO42 & x2c9;, NO3 & x2c9;, PO43 & x2c9;, dissolved organic carbon and dissolved inorganic carbon. The concentration of cations (mg/L) follows an order of Ca2+> Mg2+> Na+ > K+ and that of anions HCO3 & x2c9; > Cl & x2c9; > NO3 & x2c9; > PO43 & x2c9; > SO42 & x2c9;. The concentration of Pb in the majority of samples was above the acceptable limit for drinking. The lake water chemistry is mainly derived from rock-forming minerals besides anthropogenic sources. Carbonate weathering dominantly influences the water chemistry along with a minor contribution from silicate weathering. The main hydro-geochemical facies is Ca-Mg-HCO3. The sodium adsorption ratio, Na%, residual sodium carbonate and the Wilcox diagram indicate the suitability of Loktak water for irrigation. Based on the water quality index, the majority of pre-monsoon samples are of poor category contrary to the post-monsoon samples which are of good category. Therefore, for its potability, pre-monsoon waters from the river inlets, the national park region and the lake's northeastern portion and post-monsoon waters from the Phubala River inlet and near the Thanga Island require pre-treatment.																			0306-7319	1029-0397				MAY 28	2022	102	7					1638	1661		10.1080/03067319.2020.1742888	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03067319.2020.1742888		APR 2020											WOS:000523342400001

Droughts and floods over the upper catchment of the Blue Nile and their connections to the timing of El Nino and La Nina events	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The Blue Nile originates from Lake Tana in the Ethiopian Highlands and contributes about 60-69% of the main Nile discharge. Previous studies investigated the relationship of sea surface temperature (SST) in the Pacific Ocean (Nino 3.4 region) to occurrence of meteorological and hydrological droughts in the Nile Basin. In this paper we focus on the dependence of occurrence of droughts and floods in the upper catchment of the Blue Nile on the timing of El Nino and La Nina events. Different events start at different times of the year and follow each other, exhibiting different patterns and sequences. Here we study the impact of these timing and temporal patterns on the Blue Nile droughts and floods. The comparison between the discharge measurements (1965-2012) at the outlet of the upper catchment of the Blue Nile and the El Nino index shows that when an El Nino event is followed by a La Nina event, there is a 67% chance for occurrence of an extreme flood. Furthermore, we also found that 83% of El Nino events starting in April-June resulted in droughts in the upper catchment of the Blue Nile. Although the current study is limited by the reduced number of samples, we propose that observations as well as global model forecasts of SST during this season could be used in seasonal forecasting of the Blue Nile flow.					; Giorgi, Filippo/C-3169-2013	Zaroug, Modathir/0000-0002-0846-9626; 													1027-5606	1607-7938					2014	18	3					1239	1249		10.5194/hess-18-1239-2014	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-18-1239-2014													WOS:000334501700023

In this study, we examined the relationship between crustacean zooplankton allochthony and production in a boreal lake that displays strong seasonal variability in t-OM inputs. Contrary to our hypotheses, we found no effect of allochthony on production at the community and the species levels. The high-frequency seasonal sampling (time-for-space) allowed for estimating the efficiency of zooplankton in converting this external carbon source to growth. From the daily t-OM inputs in the lake (57-3,027 kg C/d), the zooplankton community transferred 0.2% into biomass (0.01-2.36 kg C/d); this level was of the same magnitude as the carbon transfer efficiency for algal-derived carbon (0.4%). In the context of the boundless carbon cycle, which integrates inland waters as a biologically active component of the terrestrial landscape, the use of the time-for-space approach for the quantifying of t-OM trophic transfer efficiency by zooplankton is a critical step toward a better understanding of the effects of increasing external carbon fluxes on pelagic food webs.

J	Uugulu, S; Wanke, H				Uugulu, S.; Wanke, H.			Estimation of groundwater recharge in savannah aquifers along a precipitation gradient using chloride mass balance method and environmental isotopes, Namibia	PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH					18th WaterNet/WARFSA/GWPSA Symposium on Integrated Water Resources Development and Management - Innovative Technological Advances for Water Security in Eastern and Southern Africa	OCT 25-27, 2017	Swakopmund, NAMIBIA	WaterNet, WARFSA, GWPSA				The quantification of groundwater resources is essential especially in water scarce countries like Namibia. The chloride mass balance (CMB) method and isotopic composition were used in determining groundwater recharge along a precipitation gradient at three sites, namely: Tsumeb (600 mm/a precipitation); Waterberg (450 mm/a precipitation) and Kuzikus/Ebenhaezer (240 mm/a precipitation). Groundwater and rainwater were collected from year 2016-2017. Rainwater was collected monthly while groundwater was collected before, during and after rainy seasons. Rainwater isotopic values for delta O-18 and delta H-2 range from -10.70 to 6.10 parts per thousand and from -72.7 to 42.1 parts per thousand respectively. Groundwater isotopic values for delta O-18 range from -9.84 to -5.35 parts per thousand for Tsumeb; from -10.85 to -8.60 parts per thousand for Waterberg and from -8.24 to -1.56 parts per thousand for Kuzikus/Ebenhaezer, while that for delta H-2 range from -65.6 to -46.7 parts per thousand for Tsumeb; -69.4 to -61.2 parts per thousand for Waterberg and -54.2 to -22.7 parts per thousand for Kuzikus/Ebenhaezer. Rainwater scatters along the GMWL. Rainwater collected in January, February and March are more depleted in heavy isotopes than those in November, December, April and May. Waterberg groundwater plots on the GMWL which indicates absence of evaporation. Tsumeb groundwater plots on/close to the GMWL with an exception of groundwater from the karst Lake Otjikoto which is showing evaporation. Groundwater from Kuzikus/Ebenhaezer shows an evaporation effect, probably evaporation occurs during infiltration since it is observed in all sampling seasons. All groundwater from three sites plot in the same area with rainwater depleted in stable isotopic values, which could indicates that recharge only take place during January, February and March. CMB method revealed that Waterberg has the highest recharge rate ranging between 39.1 mm/a and 51.1 mm/a (8.7%-11.4% of annual precipitation), Tsumeb with rates ranging from 21.1 mm/a to 48.5 mm/a (3.5%-8.1% of annual precipitation), and lastly Kuzikus/Ebenhaezer from 3.2 mm/a to 17.5 mm/a (1.4% - 7.3% of annual precipitation). High recharge rates in Waterberg could be related to fast infiltration and absence of evaporation as indicated by the isotopic ratios. Differences in recharge rates cannot only be attributed to the precipitation gradient but also to the evaporation rates and the presence of preferential flow paths. Recharge rates estimated for these three sites can be used in managing the savannah aquifers especially at Kuzikus/Ebenhaezer where evaporation effect is observed that one can consider rain harvesting.

Habitat structure determines resource use by zooplankton in temperate lakes	ECOLOGY LETTERS												P>While the importance of terrestrial linkages to aquatic ecosystems is well appreciated, the degree of terrestrial support of aquatic consumers remains debated. Estimates of terrestrial contributions to lake zooplankton have omitted a key food source, phytoplankton produced below the mixed layer. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotope data from 25 Pacific Northwest lakes to assess the relative importance of particulate organic matter (POM) from the mixed layer, below the mixed layer and terrestrial detritus to zooplankton. Zooplankton and deep POM were depleted in 13C relative to mixed layer POM in lakes that can support deep primary production. A Bayesian stable isotope mixing model estimated that terrestrial detritus contributed < 5% to zooplankton production, and confirms the role of lake optical and thermal properties; deep POM accounted for up to 80% of zooplankton production in the clearest lakes. These results suggest terrestrial support of lake zooplankton production is trivial.

Significant changes of the total water storage (TWS) might be detectable by satellite-based data provided by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. To detect these store water changes, effects of other factors are to be removed first from these data due to band-limited representation of near-surface mass changes from GRACE. Here, we evaluated three current popular land surface models (LSMs) basing on in situ measurements and found that the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) demonstrates higher correlation than other analyzed models with the in-situ rainfall measurement. Then we used the WGHM outputs to remove climate-induced TWS changes, such as surface water storage, soil, canopy, snow, and groundwater storage. The residual results (GRACE minus WGHM) indicated a strong trend (3.85 +/- 2 km(3)/yr) that is significantly higher than the TGR analysis and hindcast experiments (2.29 +/- 1 km(3)/yr) based on in-situ water level measurements. We also estimated the seepage response to the TGR filling, contributions from other anthropogenic dams, and used in-situ gravity and GPS observations to evaluate dominant factors responsible for the GRACE-based overestimate of the TGR volume change. We found that the modeled seepage variability through coarse-grained materials explained most of the difference between the GRACE based estimate of TGR volume changes and in situ measurements, but the agreement with in-situ gravity observations is considerably lower. In contrast, the leakage contribution from 13 adjacent reservoirs explained similar to 74% of the TGR volume change derived from GRACE and WGHM. Our results demonstrate that GRACE-based overestimate TGR mass change mainly from the contribution of surrounding artificial reservoirs and underestimated TWS variations in WGHM simulations due to the large uncertainty of WGHM in groundwater component. In additional, this study also indicates that reservoir or lake volume changes can be reliably derived from GRACE data when they are used in combination with relevant complementary observations.					; Kaban, Mikhail/ABA-7286-2020	Wang, Linsong/0000-0002-3980-479X; Thomas, Maik/0009-0009-6964-3884; Ma, Xian/0000-0001-7765-7965; 														2072-4292				JAN 1	2019	11	1							99	10.3390/rs11010099	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11010099													WOS:000457935600099
J	Che, FF; Du, MM; Yan, CZ				Che, Feifei; Du, Miaomiao; Yan, Changzhou			Arsenate biotransformation by Microcystis aeruginosa under different nitrogen and phosphorus levels	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												The arsenate (As(V)) biotransformation by Microcystis aeruginosa in a medium with different concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) has been studied under laboratory conditions. When 15 mu g/L As(V) was added, N and P in the medium showed effective regulation on arsenic (As) metabolism in M. aeruginosa, resulting in significant differences in the algal growth among different N and P treatments. Under 0.2 mg/L P treatment, increases in N concentration (4-20 mg/L) significantly stimulated the cell growth and therefore indirectly enhanced the production of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), the main As metabolite, accounting for 71%-79% of the total As in the medium. Meanwhile, 10-20 mg/L N treatments accelerated the ability of As metabolization by M. aeruginosa, leading to higher contents of DMA per cell. However, As(V) uptake by M. aeruginosa was significantly impeded by 0.5-1.0 mg/L P treatment, resulting in smaller rates of As transformation in M. aeruginosa as well as lower contents of As metabolites in the medium. Our data demonstrated that As(V) transformation by M. aeruginosa was significantly accelerated by increasing N levels, while it was inhibited by increasing P levels. Overall, both P and N play key roles in As(V) biotransformation processes. (C) 2017 The Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Evidence of meltwater retention within the Greenland ice sheet	CRYOSPHERE												Greenland ice sheet mass losses have increased in recent decades with more than half of these attributed to surface meltwater runoff. However, the magnitudes of englacial storage, firn retention, internal refreezing and other hydrologic processes that delay or reduce true water export to the global ocean remain less understood, partly due to a scarcity of in situ measurements. Here, ice sheet surface meltwater runoff and proglacial river discharge between 2008 and 2010 near Kangerlussuaq, southwestern Greenland were used to establish sub- and englacial meltwater storage for a small ice sheet watershed (36-64 km(2)). This watershed lacks significant potential meltwater storage in firn, surface lakes on the ice sheet and in the proglacial area, and receives limited proglacial precipitation. Thus, ice sheet surface runoff not accounted for by river discharge can reasonably be attributed to retention in sub- and englacial storage. Evidence for meltwater storage within the ice sheet includes (1) characteristic dampened daily river discharge amplitudes relative to ice sheet runoff; (2) three cold-season river discharge anomalies at times with limited ice sheet surface melt, demonstrating that meltwater may be retained up to 1-6 months; (3) annual ice sheet watershed runoff is not balanced by river discharge, and while near water budget closure is possible as much as 54% of melting season ice sheet runoff may not escape to downstream rivers; (4) even the large meltwater retention estimate (54%) is equivalent to less than 1% of the ice sheet volume, which suggests that storage in en- and subglacial cavities and till is plausible. While this study is the first to provide evidence for meltwater retention and delayed release within the Greenland ice sheet, more information is needed to establish how widespread this is along the Greenland ice sheet perimeter.

PLOS ONE												Pigment-based chemotaxonomy and CHEMTAX software have proven to be a valuable phytoplankton monitoring tool in marine environments, but are yet underdeveloped to determine algal assemblages in freshwater ecosystems. The main objectives of this study were (1) to compare the results of direct microscopy and CHEMTAX in describing phytoplankton community composition dynamics in a large, shallow and eutrophic lake; (2) to analyze the efficiency of the pigment-based method to detect changes in phytoplankton seasonal dynamics and during rapid bloom periods; (3) to assess the suitability of specific marker pigments and available marker pigment: chlorophyll a ratios to follow seasonal changes in eutrophic freshwater environment. A 5-year (2009-2013) parallel phytoplankton assessment by direct microscopy and by CHEMTAX was conducted using published marker pigment: chlorophyll a ratios. Despite displaying some differences from microscopy results, the pigment-based method successfully described the overall pattern of phytoplankton community dynamics during seasonal cycle in a eutrophic lake. Good agreement between the methods was achieved for most phytoplankton groups - cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, diatoms and cryptophytes. The agreement was poor in case of chrysophytes and dinoflagellates. Our study shows clearly that published marker pigment: chlorophyll a ratios can be used to describe algal class abundances, but they need to be calibrated for specific freshwater environment. Broader use of this method would enable to expand monitoring networks and increase measurement frequencies of freshwater ecosystems to meet the goals of the Water Framework Directive.

Climate impacts on landlocked sea lamprey: Implications for host-parasite interactions and invasive species management	ECOSPHERE												Altered thermal regimes under climate change may influence host-parasite interactions and invasive species, both potentially impacting valuable ecosystem services. There is considerable interest in how parasite life cycle rates, growth, and impacts on hosts will change under altered environmental temperatures. Likewise, transformed thermal regimes may reduce natural resistance and barriers preventing establishment of invasive species or alter the range and impacts of established exotic species. The Laurentian Great Lakes are some of the most invaded ecosystems and have been profoundly shaped by exotic species. Invasion by the parasitic sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) contributed to major declines in many Great Lakes fish populations. In Lake Superior, substantial progress has been made towards controlling invasive sea lamprey and rehabilitating native fish populations. Surface water temperatures in Lake Superior have been increasing rapidly since 1980 presenting a new challenge for management. Here we test how thermal changes in Lake Superior have impacted the feeding and growth of the parasitic sea lamprey. Sea lamprey have increased in size corresponding with longer durations of thermal habitat (i.e., longer growing seasons) for their preferred hosts. To compare regional differences in sea lamprey feeding and growth rates, we used a bioenergetics model with temperature estimates from a lake-wide hydrodynamic model hindcast from 1979-2006. Spatial differences in patterns of warming across the lake result in regionally different predictions for increases in sea lamprey feeding rates and size. These predictions were matched by data from adult sea lamprey spawning in streams draining into these different thermal regions. Larger sea lampreys will be more fecund and have increased feeding rates, thus increasing mortality among host fishes. Resource management should consider these climate driven regional impacts when allocating resources to sea lamprey control efforts. Under new and evolving thermal regimes, successful management systems may need to be restructured for changing phenology, growth, and shifts in host-parasite systems towards greater impacts on host populations.

The niche of an invasive marine microbe in a subtropical freshwater impoundment	ISME JOURNAL												Growing attention in aquatic ecology is focusing on biogeographic patterns in microorganisms and whether these potential patterns can be explained within the framework of general ecology. The long-standing microbiologist's credo 'Everything is everywhere, but, the environment selects' suggests that dispersal is not limiting for microbes, but that the environment is the primary determining factor in microbial community composition. Advances in molecular techniques have provided new evidence that biogeographic patterns exist in microbes and that dispersal limitation may actually have an important role, yet more recent study using extremely deep sequencing predicts that indeed everything is everywhere. Using a long-term field study of the 'invasive' marine haptophyte Prymnesium parvum, we characterize the environmental niche of P. parvum in a subtropical impoundment in the southern United States. Our analysis contributes to a growing body of evidence that indicates a primary role for environmental conditions, but not dispersal, in the lakewide abundances and seasonal bloom patterns in this globally important microbe.

Human land uses enhance sediment denitrification and N2O production in Yangtze lakes primarily by influencing lake water quality	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Sediment denitrification in lakes alleviates the effects of eutrophication through the removal of nitrogen to the atmosphere as N2O and N-2. However, N2O contributes notably to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Human land uses (e.g. agricultural and urban areas) strongly affect lake water quality and sediment characteristics, which, in turn, may regulate lake sediment denitrification and N2O production. In this study, we investigated sediment denitrification and N2O production and their relationships to withinlake variables and watershed land uses in 20 lakes from the Yangtze River basin in China. The results indicated that both lake water quality and sediment characteristics were significantly influenced by watershed land uses. N2O production rates increased with increasing background denitrification rates. Background denitrification and N2O production rates were positively related to water nitrogen concentrations but were not significantly correlated with sediment characteristics and plant community structure. A significant positive relationship was observed between background denitrification rate and percentage of human-dominated land uses (HDL) in watersheds. Structural equation modelling revealed that the indirect effects of HDL on sediment denitrification and N2O production in Yangtze lakes were mediated primarily through lake water quality. Our findings also suggest that although sediments in Yangtze lakes can remove large quantities of nitrogen through denitrification, they may also be an important source of N2O, especially in lakes with high nitrogen content.

Chl observations from freshwater lakes are valuable for estimating lake productivity as well as assessing the role that these lakes play in carbon budgets. The standard 4 km NASA OceanColor L3 chlorophyll concentration products generated from MODIS and MERIS sensor data are not sufficiently representative of global chl values because these can only resolve larger lakes, which generally have lower chl concentrations than lakes of smaller surface area. Our new methodology utilizes the 300 m-resolution MERIS full-resolution full-swath (FRS) global dataset as input and does not rely on the land mask used to generate standard NASA products, which masks many lakes that are otherwise resolvable in MERIS imagery. The new method produced chl concentration values for 78,938 and 1,074 lakes in the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. The mean chl for lakes visible in the MERIS composite was 19.2 +/- 19.2, the median was 13.3, and the interquartile range was 3.90-28.6 mg m(-3). The accuracy of the MERIS-derived values was assessed by comparison with temporally near-coincident and globally distributed in situ measurements from the literature (n = 185, RMSE = 9.39, R-2 = 0.72). This represents the first global-scale dataset of satellite-derived chl estimates for medium to large lakes.

Dissolved organic matter signatures in urban surface waters: spatio-temporal patterns and drivers	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Advances in analytical chemistry have facilitated the characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which has improved understanding of DOM sources and transformations in surface waters. For urban waters, however, where DOM diversity is likely to be high, the interpretation of DOM signatures is hampered by a lack of information on the influence of land cover and anthropogenic factors such as nutrient enrichment and release of organic contaminants. Here we explored the spatio-temporal variation in DOM composition in contrasting urban water bodies, based on spectrophotometry and fluorometry, size-exclusion chromatography, and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry, to identify linkages between DOM signatures and potential drivers. The highly diverse DOM we observed distinguished lakes and ponds, which are characterized by a high proportion of autochthonous DOM, from rivers and streams where allochthonous DOM is more prevalent. Seasonal variation in DOM composition was apparent in all types of water bodies, apparently due to interactions between phenology and urban influences, such as nutrient supply, the percentage of green space surrounding the water bodies and point source pollution. Optical DOM properties also revealed the influence of effluents from wastewater treatment plants, suggesting that simple optical measurements can be useful in water quality assessment and monitoring, providing information about processes both within water bodies and in their catchments.

A daily water balance model was used to simulate the performance of a rainwater harvesting system using historical daily rainfall data for 20 years. The GCMs used to generate daily rainfall projections for 2025-2055 and 2060-2090 periods included; ACCESS1-0, BCC-CSM-1-M, CNRM-CM5, HADGEM2-CC, HADGEM2-ES and MIROC5. Analysis was based on the Ugandan weather seasons which included March, April, May (MAM) and September, October, November (SON) rain seasons in addition to December, January, February (DJF) and June, July, August (JJA) dry seasons. While an increase in reliability is predicted for the SON season, the worst-case scenario is projected during the MAM season with a reliability reduction of over 40% for the 2055-2090 period. This corresponds to a 27% reduction in water security for the same period. The DJF season is also expected to experience reduced water security by 1-8% for 2025-2055 and 2060-2090 with a 0.5 m(3) tank size. Therefore, some form of extra harvesting surface and increased tank size will be required to maintain 80% systems reliability considering climate change.					; Van der Bruggen, Bart/AAR-3676-2020	Van der Bruggen, Bart/0000-0002-3921-7472; Kisakye, Violet/0000-0002-7162-4780														2073-4441				JAN	2018	10	1							71	10.3390/w10010071	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10010071													WOS:000424397400068

This problem has been well-assessed and is most evident in dry environments. However, in humid regions, the potential effects of vegetation greenness on water yields under drought conditions are not well understood. To address this gap, we focused on the Poyang Lake watershed in the humid region of southern China. Based on the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index and a satellite-derived leaf area index dataset during the growing seasons of 1984 to 2013, several typical dry growing seasons were selected as the study conditions. An existing Water Supply Stress Index model was modified to investigate how the changes in vegetation greenness affected water yield and to explore potentially conflicting water demands between ecosystems and humans under drought conditions. Our results showed that an increase of 20-80% in vegetation greenness generally resulted in a reduction of 3-27% in water yield under drought conditions. Large reductions in water yield mainly were observed in forested areas due to large increases in forest greenness. Moreover, increased vegetation greenness caused a 2 to 3 times greater reduction in water yield during continuing and intensifying droughts than during a short moderate drought period. Thus, in this study, during continuing and intensifying droughts, increased vegetation greenness can cause or aggravate water conflicts in sub-watersheds with high forest cover and high human water demands. Therefore, given the increasing frequency of extreme climatic events, afforestation with a targeted approach should be implemented as it would provide the most benefits. In addition, selective harvesting in forested areas with high density could be an effective strategy to maintain water supply in humid regions.

Seasonal trends in eDNA detection and occupancy of bigheaded carps	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Bigheaded carps, which include silver and bighead carp, are threatening to invade the Great Lakes. These species vary seasonally in distribution and abundance due to environmental conditions such as precipitation and temperature. Monitoring this seasonal movement is important for management to control the population size and spread of the species. We examined if environmental DNA (eDNA) approaches could detect seasonal changes of these species. To do this, we developed a novel genetic marker that was able to both detect and differentiate bighead and silver carp DNA. We used the marker, combined with a novel occupancy model, to study the occurrence of bigheaded carps at 3 sites on the Wabash River over the course of a year. We studied the Wabash River because of concerns that carps may be able to use the system to invade the Great Lakes via a now closed (ca. 2017) connection at Eagle Marsh between the Wabash River's watershed and the Great Lakes' watershed. We found seasonal trends in the probability of detection and occupancy that varied across sites. These findings demonstrate that eDNA methods can detect seasonal changes in bigheaded carps densities and suggest that the amount of eDNA present changes seasonally. The site that was farthest upstream and had the lowest carp densities exhibited the strongest seasonal trends for both detection probabilities and sample occupancy probabilities. Furthermore, other observations suggest that carps seasonally leave this site, and we were able to detect this with our eDNA approach.

CDOM plays a critical role in water optical attenuation and in biogeochemical processing. In this study the optical absorption properties and spatial distribution of CDOM were investigated during the wet season in Poyang Lake. Results showed that the absorption coefficients of CDOM varied significantly in four sections that contain different levels of turbidity. The absorption coefficients of CDOM in the section dominated by wetland water were higher than that in other sections. The study found that the absorption coefficients of CDOM were ranged from 1.59 to 4.71 m(-1) with an average value of 2.77 +/- 0.76 m(-1) at 355 nm, and from 0.39 to 1.14 m(-1) with an average value of 0.70 +/- 0.19 m(-1) at 440 nm, respectively. Spectral analysis with specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm, absorption ratio between 250 and 365 nm and spectral slope indicated that CDOM in Poyang Lake was relatively high in molecule weight and aromaticity from terrestrial allochthonous inputs. Comparison of water samples revealed that CDOM in wetland contributed water had lower molecule weight and aromaticity influenced by autochthonous sources. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and coefficients of CDOM absorption were significantly correlated at the range from 280 to 440 nm, especially at shorter wavelengths, which suggests that CDOM can be used as an effective DOC indicator in Poyang Lake. This study established a field-based knowledge for remote sensing measurements of CDOM in the largest fresh water lake in China. (C) 2017 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Eutrophication forcings on a peri-urban lake ecosystem: Context for integrated watershed to airshed management	PLOS ONE												Peri-urban lakes increasingly experience intensified anthropogenic impacts as watershed uses and developments increase. Cultus Lake is an oligo-mesotrophic, peri-urban lake near Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada that experiences significant seasonal tourism, anthropogenic nutrient loadings, and associated cultural eutrophication. Left unabated, these cumulative stresses threaten the critical habitat and persistence of two endemic species at risk (Coastrange Sculpin, Cultus population; Cultus Lake sockeye salmon) and diverse lake-derived ecosystem services. We constructed water and nutrient budgets for the Cultus Lake watershed to identify and quantify major sources and loadings of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). A steady-state water quality model, calibrated against current loadings and limnological data, was used to reconstruct the historic lake trophic status and explore limnological changes in response to realistic development and mitigation scenarios. Significant local P loadings to Cultus Lake arise from septic leaching (19%) and migratory gull guano deposition (22%). Watershed runoff contributes the majority of total P (53%) and N (73%) loads to Cultus Lake, with substantial local N contributions arising from the agricultural Columbia Valley (41% of total N load). However, we estimate that up to 66% of N and 70% of P in watershed runoff is ultimately sourced via deposition from the nutrient-contaminated regional airshed, with direct atmospheric deposition on the lake surface contributing an additional 17% of N and 5% of P. Thus, atmospheric deposition is the largest single source of nutrient loading to Cultus Lake, cumulatively responsible for 63% and 42% of total N and P loadings, respectively. Modeled future loading scenarios suggest Cultus Lake could become mesotrophic within the next 25 years, highlighting a heightened need for near-term abatement of P loads. Although mitigating P loads from local watershed sources will slow the rate of eutrophication, management efforts targeting reductions in atmospheric-P within the regional airshed are necessary to halt or reverse lake eutrophication, and conserve both critical habitat for imperiled species at risk and lake-derived ecosystem services.

The detection and quantification of genes responsible for the synthesis of these odors on-site could be valuable for the prediction and treatment of T&O. In this study, SYBR Green and TaqMan real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays were established on the basis of conserved regions in cyanobacterial MIB cyclase gene (mic) and applied to the quantification of potential MIB-producing cyanobacteria in waters. These two qPCR assays showed the prescribed values of amplification efficiency (0.976 and 1.023, respectively) with linearity (R (2) > 0.99) in the range of 10(1) to 10(7) mic copies. Examination on environmental samples and cyanobacterial cultures indicated that qPCRs were rarely inhibited by background biomass, and the limit of quantification was at the level of 10(3) mic copies L-1 in natural waters. The seasonal variations of mic abundances in Lushui Reservoir, Donghu Lake, and Qinghai Lake of China were successfully quantified using the two qPCR protocols and indicated the applicability of these assays in field monitoring. Regression analysis revealed the positive correlation between mic abundance and MIB concentration, but no significant linear correlation was found between MIB-producing cyanobacteria and total cyanobacteria in investigated waters.

The Ichkeul Lake water and nutrient budget, net ecosystem metabolism (NEM), nutrient availability, and their seasonal changes are estimated using field data. A considerable anthropogenic-driven amount of nitrogen is transferred into N-2/N2O to the atmosphere during the dry season with predominance of denitrification-anammox processes. The primary production is impacted by forcing the ecosystem respiration to reduce the NEM so that the system is functioning as heterotrophic. Climate change and anthropogenic pressures are expected to exacerbate the current trends of water quality degradation, with possible negative impacts on Palearctic birds' population. Mitigation actions are possible, through the implementation of National Wetland Management Strategies that include nutrient load and water resources management.

J	Ylöstalo, P; Kallio, K; Seppälä, J				Ylostalo, Pasi; Kallio, Kari; Seppala, Jukka			Absorption properties of in-water constituents and their variation among various lake types in the boreal region	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We studied the absorption properties of in-water constituents among 15 boreal lakes belonging to various lake types. One of the lakes was also monitored frequently during its growth season to reveal the seasonal variation of absorption properties. Within the studied lakes, CDOM absorption a(CDOM)(442) varied from 0.4 to 15 m(-1). CDOM was clearly dominating the absorption signal at low wavelengths, but even at the red-end of the spectra its contribution to total absorption was notable, varying from 48 to 99% of total absorption (excl. water) at 442 nm and from 5 to 86% at 665 nm. Slope of the CDOM absorption spectra S-CDOM(400-700) varied from 12.9 to 193 mu m(-1). Higher slopes were obtained when the wavelength range was extended to the UV-range (350700 and 300-700 nm). Non-linear relationships were noted between a(CDOM) and S-CDOM calculated over various wavelength ranges. Despite the significant relationship between DOC concentration and a(CDOM), almost fivefold variation was noted in DOC-specific CDOM absorption at 442 nm. This variation was clearly associated with concurrent changes in S-CDOM. Non-algal particulate absorption varied from 0.037 to 1.8 m(-1) at 442 nm, contributing <1 to 34% of total absorption at 442 nm and <1 to 27% at 442 nm. Slope of the NAP absorption spectra S-NAP(380-700) varied from 7.6 to 12.8 mu m(-1). Despite of the apparent covariation between weight of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and a(NAP), six-fold variation was observed in SPM-specific NAP absorption at 442 nm, which was mostly associated with organic content of the particle pool. Contribution of phytoplankton pigments ranged from 1 to 28% of total absorption at 442 nm, and 13 to 86% at 665 nm, respectively. Chlorophyll a (Chla) specific absorption of phytoplankton pigments varied from 0.012 to 0.038 m(2) (mg Chlar)(-1) at blue peak, and from 0.008 to 0.020 m(2) (mg Chla)(-1) at red peak. Observed values cluster around the low-end of the previously reported range, indicating a high package effect of phytoplankton cells in lakes. Observed variation was modeled as function of Chla (ranging from 1.8 to 95 mg m(-3)). Parameters and relationships presented in this study provide useful information for remote sensing of lakes, as well as for various ecological and geochemical applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Studying the water use strategies of plants under different water conditions is of great significance for understanding the wetland vegetation patterns and performing ecological regulation of wetlands. The present study aims to quantify the contribution rates of potential water sources to Carex cinerascens in the Poyang Lake Wetland using stable isotope techniques and to assess water use efficiency (WUE) and water niche breadth to reveal the water use strategy of C. cinerascens and its response to water condition changes. The results showed that soil water in the 0-20 cm soil layer replaced lake water, becoming the main source of water for C. cinerascens during the growing season as a result of the decrease in the lake water levels and the change in soil water contents. The contribution rates of soil water in the 0-20 cm soil layer to the development of C. cinerascens in the 12-, 13-, and 14-m elevation zones increased by 31.4, 11.0, and 21.1 %, respectively. In addition, the contribution rate of soil water from the 20-40 cm soil layer was lower than that from the 0-20 cm soil layer, while rainwater exhibited the lowest contribution rates to the development of C. cinerascens. The aboveground parts exhibited higher WUE values than those of belowground parts at the growth stage, except in the 14-m elevation zone, and lower WUE values than those of the belowground parts at the maturation and wilting stages of C. cinerascens. According to the calculated Levins index, the water niche breadths of C. cinerascens were reduced and increased under abundant and insufficient water amounts, respectively. C. cinerascens adjusted the water source, WUE, and water niche breadth during the entire growing season to adapt to changing water conditions in the Poyang Lake Wetland, thereby reflecting the strong adjustability and adaptability of C. cinerascens. This study provides further insights into the relationships between wetland vegetation and hydrological changes, as well as a scientific basis for wetland ecological and hydrological regulation and vegetation restoration in the Poyang Lake Wetland.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				FEB	2023	146								109863	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.109863	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.109863		JAN 2023											WOS:000927504500001

Saturation indices of aqueous mineral phases as proxies of seasonal dynamics of a transitional water ecosystem using a geochemical modeling approach	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												The geochemistry and saturation indices (SI) of carbonate and non-carbonate mineral phases under standard thermodynamic conditions in an aqueous environment are largely influenced by the dynamic physico-chemical parameters. Based on the known feedback mechanisms of environmental parameters on the rates of mineralisation, the changes in environmental parameters such as pH, dissolved ionic concentrations and salinity were modelled as a function of their spatial and temporal distributions (dry and wet seasons) in a transitional aquatic ecosystem in South India, Pulicat lagoon. The investigation revealed the strong seasonal influence of these parameters on the magnitude and values of the SIs signalling dissolution or mineralisation. Hydroxyapatite and Talc were found to have higher positive SIs. Co-precipitation of calcite and aragonite were evident and found to be constrained by high salinities. Among the carbonates, dolomites and magnesium-calcites showed high SIs compared to calcite and aragonite, indicating that magnesium ions were incorporated into the mineral phases possibly due to the availability of nucleation sites through heterotrophic reactions. The formation of apatite was strongly influenced by pH changes, corresponding to low calcite precipitation in the wet season. High SI of hydroxyapatite, talc and silicate minerals indicate the low bioavailability of dissolved phosphate and silicates in the water during both the seasons. Strong evidences of seasonal control of pH, salinity and Total Dissolved Solids on the dissolution and mineralisation characteristics further influence nutrient bioavailability over varied spatio-temporal scales. The present study supports the potential application of the saturation indices as proxies to understand the complex biogeochemical dynamics of transitional water ecosystems.

Scott; Delgado-Huertas, Antonio			Vegetation, fire, climate and human disturbance history in the southwestern Mediterranean area during the late Holocene	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Detailed pollen, charcoal, isotope and magnetic susceptibility data from an alpine lake sediment core from Sierra Nevada, southern Spain record changes in vegetation, fire history and lake sedimentation since ca. 4100 cal yr BP. The proxies studied record an arid period from ca. 3800 to 3100 cal yr BP characterized by more xerophytic vegetation and lower lake levels. A humid period is recorded between ca. 3100 and 1850 cal yr BP, which occurred in two steps: (1) an increase in evergreen Quercus between 3100 and 2500 cal yr BP, indicating milder conditions than previously and (2) an increase in deciduous Quercus and higher lake levels, between ca. 2500 and 1850 cal yr BP, indicating a further increase in humidity and reduction in seasonal contrast. Humid maxima occurred during the Roman Humid Period, previously identified in other studies in the Mediterranean region. Intensified fire activity at this time could be related to an increase in fuel load and/or in human disturbance. An arid period subsequently occurred between 1850 and 650 cal yr BP, though a decrease in Quercus and an increase in xerophytes. The alternation of persistent North Atlantic Oscillation modes probably played an important role in controlling these humid-arid cycles. (c) 2012 University of Washington. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Spatio-temporal assessment, sources and health risks of water pollutants at trace levels in public supply river using multivariate statistical techniques	CHEMOSPHERE												The Joanes River is located in the northeast of Brazil, crosses the Camacari Petrochemical Complex, the largest integrated industrial complex in the Southern Hemisphere, which has over 90 companies in the chemical and petrochemical industry. The present study aims to evaluate spatial distribution, seasonal variation and identify possible sources of trace metal contamination in surface water samples of the Joanes River. Samples were collected in the dry (December 2018) and rainy (August 2019) seasons. Analysis of trace elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Mn and Pb) were performed by ICP-MS. A total of 60 water samples were obtained. Samples were analyzed using exploratory techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA). It was possible to characterize the samples according to the seasonal variation. The formation of two groups was observed. Among these, samples from the rainy season presented the higher levels of metals in relation to the samples of the dry season. Natural and anthropic sources of metal contamination were identified using CA. Similarity was shown in the relationship between the metals As-Pb and Ni-Cd-Cr-Cu in the dry season, and Cd-Ni and Pb-As-Cr-Cu in the rainy season. Dermal absorption (HQderm) and ingestion hazard quotients (HQing) routes exhibited values of less than one for all the elements analyzed for adults and children, in both rainy and dry seasons. This indicated that the pollutants analyzed posed little or no health risk over a lifetime of exposure. According to international guidelines (US EPA), the values of Cu, Pb and Cr were above the limit established.					da Silva Junior, Jucelino/AAA-3611-2021; dos Santos, Liz/Q-8289-2019; dos Santos, Ivanice/V-7580-2019; SOUZA, LAIS/GWZ-9113-2022; FERREIRA, SERGIO/I-1993-2013; Oliveira dos Santos, Liz/G-8703-2014	dos Santos, Ivanice/0000-0002-0390-2005; souza, lais/0009-0002-3737-7437; Oliveira dos Santos, Liz/0000-0003-2064-2097													0045-6535	1879-1298				NOV	2021	282								130942	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130942	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130942		JUN 2021						34091297					WOS:000698193400004

In natural open systems, evaporation should be considered as a time dependent function and a cumulative process. We applied and compared Craig-Gordon isotopic model with the Penman-Monteith physical evaporation model, after a biannual hydrologic cycle characterization in a natural semi-arid environment to determine annually reliable balance budgets and estimations. Our results show that isotopic evaporation rates reflect a sinusoidal behavior during isotopic fractioning rather than a lineal and constant evaporation rate. This sinusoidal behavior exhibits the influence of solar radiation and other meteorological variables that have not yet been considered in the C-G isotopic mass balance model. The estimation of isotopic evaporation in natural environments are reliable during the dry season while estimations of isotopic loss fraction (f) in the wet season behave as an isotopic mixing model of evaporated water-precipitation-runoff. Physical and isotopic methodologies are difficult to relate due to basic fundamentals and development conceptualizations: accordingly, further work is required to enhance the Craig-Gordon and Gonfiantini evaporation model and its relationship with physical methodologies in order to improve the estimation of evaporation in natural semiarid environments.

A total of 42 water samples were intermittently collected from different sites in 6 months across four seasons. Physicochemical characteristics of the ecosystem, bacterioplankton diversity and composition, the presence of co-occurrence patterns, and environmental predictors of ecological modules in the bacterioplankton network were determined. The central species played a more important role in regulating the structure and function of the bacterioplankton community and in responding to environmental contamination than the entire community. The relative abundance of the phylum Proteobacteria and the class Betaproteobacteria varied significantly between months and locations, which were identified as core functional taxa. A non-random co-occurrence pattern and function-driven modular structure were observed in the bacterioplankton co-occurrence network. Dissolved oxygen and ammonium nitrogen were the major and mutual environmental predictors of the bacterioplankton community composition, functional attributes and relative abundance of ecological modules. The results improve our understanding of the impact of anthropogenic contamination on bacterioplankton diversity and biogeochemical cycles and the formulation of strategies for bioremediation of the Taihu Watershed.					tong, jun/KWU-2376-2024														0168-6496	1574-6941				AUG	2020	96	8							fiaa137	10.1093/femsec/fiaa137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiaa137								32639543					WOS:000574373300018

Lake Pampulha, an impoundment that is a major tourist focus within the municipality of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais state, Brazil, provides an example of degradation of aquatic environments by disorganised urbanization. We evaluated the current recreational suitability of the lake using state government monitoring data (2012-2017) with reference to Brazilian legislation and a water quality index for contact recreation in Brazilian freshwaters, consideringE. coli(indicating faecal pollution and microbial hazards), cyanobacterial density (health risks and aesthetic quality), turbidity (aesthetics and safety associated with visual clarity), and pH (safety and eye-comfort). Our results show that, despite investments in pollution control, the recreational water quality of Lake Pampulha remains very poor. Contact recreation was most limited by persistent cyanobacterial blooms, but also faecal contamination and low visual water clarity. The effects of high phosphorus loading and faecal contamination from unsewered domestic wastewater is exacerbated by a tropical climate, promoting stable thermal stratification (favouring cyanobacterial dominance) and turbid wet-season runoff. Water quality indexing is a powerful tool not just for interpreting and communicating multiple metrics affecting water resources, but also for guiding rehabilitation efforts and tracking progress.

Water quality trends under rapid agricultural expansion and enhanced in-stream interception in a hilly watershed of Eastern China	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Conflicts between agricultural intensification and the increasing demand for clean water resources are growing worldwide. This study sought to understand how the negative consequences of agricultural expansion in fragile hilly watersheds can be mitigated by ecologically based engineering practices. We analyzed long-term and seasonal water quality trends in two sub-watersheds of the Tianmu Lake watershed in Eastern China. The Zhongtian and nearby Zhucao sub-watersheds are very similar in terms of climate, topography and other features that can influence water quality. Both are experiencing rapid expansion of tea plantations, but the Zhongtian River contains an engineered system of overflow dams and cascade wetlands that is absent from the Zhucao River. The multi-year averaged reduction (2009-2018) of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) from upstream to downstream reaches was 10%-15% greater in the engineered Zhongtian River compared to the non-engineered and free flowing Zhucao River, which has no interventions to reduce nutrient concentrations. Average annual reductions in TN, TP, and total suspended solids (SS) downstream of the engineered system reached 0.5%-4.0% of their multi-year averaged concentrations over this time interval. These reductions occurred despite a 2.3-fold expansion of tea plantation area in the engineered watershed, which contrasts with deteriorating water quality in the non-engineered watershed that had a 0.4-fold expansion of tea plantation area. Our results underscore the value of such engineered systems to improve water quality and help reconcile competing advantages of agricultural development and environmental protection in hilly watersheds, where there is limited in-stream processing of nutrients and the effects of human activities are substantial.					; ZHANG, WANGSHOU/AAO-2534-2021; Hyndman, David/G-1576-2010	zhang, wangshou/0000-0001-9473-4555; Hyndman, David/0000-0001-9464-8403													1748-9326					AUG	2020	15	8							084030	10.1088/1748-9326/ab8981	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ab8981													WOS:000560434800001

The goal of this paper was to extend a recently reported Acipenserid-derived PCR-based genotyping test to determine sex of lake sturgeon. We demonstrate that the recently reported AllWSex2 primers amplified the female sex-specific region in lake sturgeon of known sex, consistent with a ZZ/ZW mode of inheritance. Sanger sequencing of female lake sturgeon PCR products matched published sequences from female sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus), showing 100% query cover and 98% (63/64) identity. The ability to provide a rapid, cost-effective, and unambiguous determination of sex for lake sturgeon will allow managers to determine compositional estimates of sex ratios during any season, and for individuals at any age or size, which is of great utility for species characterized by delayed sexual maturity and lacking external sexual dimorphisms.

Multi-year wind dynamics around Lake Tanganyika	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Lake Tanganyika is the second largest freshwater lake in the world by volume and is of prime importance for the regional economy in East Africa. Although the lake is recognized as a key component of the regional climate system, little is known about atmospheric dynamics in its surroundings. To understand this role, we analyze winds around Lake Tanganyika as modeled by a high resolution (7 km) regional climate model (Consortium for Small-scale Modeling in Climate Mode) over the period 1999-2008. Modeled surface wind speed and direction are in very good agreement with high resolution (12.5 km) Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) satellite wind observations during the dry season. Comparison of a control run with a model simulation where all lake pixels are replaced by representative land pixels indicates that mean surface wind speed over Lake Tanganyika almost doubles due to lake presence. Furthermore, a region of higher surface wind speed in the central part of the lake is identified and confirmed by QuikSCAT observations. A combination of wind channeling along valley mountains and wind confluence on the upwind side of the lake is responsible for this speed-up. The lower wind speeds in the rest of the lake result from blocked conditions due to more pronounced orography. Finally, the model captures a zone of higher wind speed at around 2 km height, associated with the low-level Somali jet.

In the Lake Baringo basin in Kenya, communities and individual farmers restored indigenous vegetation inside enclosures in an effort to combat severe land degradation and address their livelihood problems. This study quantified the benefits of rangeland rehabilitation using yearly communal enclosures' utilisation data compiled by Rehabilitation of Arid Environments (RAE) Trust over a 6-year period (2005-2010). Results showed that communal enclosures provide a source of income through the sale of fattened livestock, harvested grass seeds, hay, honey and charcoal, among other products. Regression analysis showed an increasing total enclosure income with time. The enclosures also provide grasses for thatching, livestock feed and dry season grazing. Indirect products like milk, blood and meat are essential for household nutrition and food security. These benefits reinforce the management through incentive to maintain existing enclosures and establish new ones and therefore the increasing trend in rangeland enclosure. Increased soil and biomass carbon storage could come with other indirect environmental benefits including improvement in soil quality, land productivity for pasture production and food security, and prevention of land degradation, thus leading to economic, environmental and social benefit for the local agropastoralist communities.

Redox dynamics in the active layer of an Arctic headwater catchment; examining the potential for transfer of dissolved methane from soils to stream water	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The linkages between methane production, transport, and release from terrestrial and aquatic systems are not well understood, complicating the task of predicting methane emissions. We present novel data examining the potential for the saturated zone of active layer soils to act as a source of dissolved methane to the aquatic system, via soil water discharge, within a headwater catchment of the continuous permafrost zone in Northern Canada. We monitored redox conditions and soil methane concentrations across a transect of soil profiles from midstream to hillslope and compare temporal patterns in methane concentrations in soils to those in the stream. We show that redox conditions in active layer soils become more negative as the thaw season progresses, providing conditions suitable for net methanogenesis and that redox conditions are sensitive to increased precipitation during a storm eventbut only in shallower surface soil layers. While we demonstrate that methane concentrations at depth in the hillslope soils increase over the course of the growing season as reducing conditions develop, we find no evidence that this has an influence on stream water methane concentrations. Sediments directly beneath the stream bed, however, remain strongly reducing at depth throughout the thaw season and contain methane at concentrations 5 orders of magnitude greater than those in hillslope soils. The extent of substreambed methane sources, and the rates of methane transport from these zones, may therefore be important factors determining headwater stream methane concentrations under changing Arctic hydrologic regimes.

Michael; Yap, Mary; Baciocco, Colin			Topographic and orbital forcing of Titan's hydroclimate	ICARUS												The cause of the hemispheric asymmetry of Titan's methane lakes and seas is the subject of ongoing debate. A leading hypothesis posits that seasonal insolation asymmetries caused by Saturn's eccentric orbit lead to differences in net precipitation over the two poles, perhaps mediated by asymmetric atmospheric transport of moisture. But topographic variations have also been proposed to contribute, albeit without considering the importance of surface hydrology. Here we present general circulation model simulations including a synchronously coupled surface and ground hydrology scheme, testing the separate and combined influences of topography and orbital forcing on Titan's hydroclimate. We find that, while topography leads to warmer polar regions relative to a flat surface which in turn enhance methane loss to the atmosphere, the overall effect on the global distribution of surface methane liquid is minor. In particular, topography does not force any notable asymmetry in the meridional circulation, nor does it affect the seasonality of the methane cycle, though it does increase the regional heterogeneity of average precipitation at mid-latitudes. We also find that Titan's atmospheric methane transport robustly responds to orbital forcing, in agreement with previous results, but this is insufficient to overcome the distribution of surface liquids dictated by surface hydrology. We conclude that Croll-Milankovitch cycles are plausible on Titan, but potentially not the dominant driver of the current distribution of liquids; relatedly, our results suggest that the volume of the large seas and lakes has not varied substantially on millennial timescales.

Lake-Effect Rains over Lake Victoria and Their Association with Mesoscale Convective Systems	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												This article examined rainfall enhancement over Lake Victoria. Estimates of overlake rainfall were compared with rainfall in the surrounding lake catchment. Four satellite products were initially tested against estimates based on gauges or water balance models. These included TRMM 3B43, IMERG V06 Final Run (IMERG-F), CHIRPS2, and PERSIANN-CDR. There was agreement among the satellite products for catchment rainfall but a large disparity among them for overlake rainfall. IMERG-F was clearly an outlier, exceeding the estimate from TRMM 3B43 by 36%. The overestimation by IMERG-F was likely related to passive microwave assessments of strong convection, such as prevails over Lake Victoria. Overall, TRMM 3B43 showed the best agreement with the "ground truth" and was used in further analyses. Overlake rainfall was found to be enhanced compared to catchment rainfall in all months. During the March-May long rains the enhancement varied between 40% and 50%. During the October-December short rains the enhancement varied between 33% and 44%. Even during the two dry seasons the enhancement was at least 20% and over 50% in some months. While the magnitude of enhancement varied from month to month, the seasonal cycle was essentially the same for overlake and catchment rainfall, suggesting that the dominant influence on overlake rainfall is the large-scale environment. The association with mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) was also evaluated. The similarity of the spatial patterns of rainfall and MCS count each month suggested that these produced a major share of rainfall over the lake. Similarity in interannual variability further supported this conclusion. Significance Statement The article underscores the difficulty of IMERG-F and other passive microwave retrievals in assessing rainfall over inland water bodies.																			1525-755X	1525-7541				JUN	2021	22	6					1353	1368		10.1175/JHM-D-20-0244.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-20-0244.1													WOS:000663568900001

Assessing vulnerability and adopting alternative climate resilient strategies for livelihood security and sustainable management of aquatic biodiversity of Vembanad lake in India	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE												The present study was carried out at the Thycattussery area in Vembanad lake and assessed the ichthyo-diversity, variability in climatic variables, the exploited status of predominant small-scale sector fisheries (SSFs) and impact of climatic variables upon an existing SSF. Fish, as well as clam specimens collected from the study area, were identified. Diversity indices and dominance curves helped to identify monsoon (June-September) as the diverse season in the wetland. SIMPER (similarity percentage) analysis indicated that Villorita cyprinoides (clam) was the predominant species in the wetland with a mean relative abundance of 16.1%. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of variables with clam production identified calcium hardness and rainfall with axis loadings of -0.56 and 0.50 respectively as the variables predominantly contributing to clam production. Stepwise regression indicated that temperature and rainfall were the determinants of clam production. A decrease in rainfall and an increase in temperature at an annual rate of 0.02 and 0.8%, respectively, decreased the clam production by 5.37%/year in the study area. Further, the generalized linear model (GLM) indicated stagnancy in clam production until 2035 below 400,000 kg per year. The study introduced diversification of livelihood systems using clam culture in climate resilient pen structures (CRPS) as an adaptation strategy.					K.

To support the field campaign, an advanced research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to produce real-time forecasts and model evaluation. This paper summarizes the model performance and preliminary evaluation of the model against the observations. Results indicate that accurately forecasting fog is challenging for the WRF model, which produces large errors in the near-surface variables, such as relative humidity, temperature, and wind fields in the model forecasts. Specifically, compared with observations, the WRF model overpredicted fog events with extended duration in Salt Lake City because it produced higher moisture, lower wind speeds, and colder temperatures near the surface. In contrast, the WRF model missed all fog events in Heber City, as it reproduced lower moisture, higher wind speeds, and warmer temperatures against observations at the near-surface level. The inability of the model to produce proper levels of near-surface atmospheric conditions under fog conditions reflects uncertainties in model physical parameterizations, such as the surface layer, boundary layer, and microphysical schemes.					; Pu, Zhaoxia/ABN-0177-2022	Pardyjak, Eric/0000-0002-0180-0857; gultepe, ismail/0000-0002-8433-5953; Pu, Zhaoxia/0000-0003-4461-1789													0033-4553	1420-9136				SEP	2016	173	9					3165	3186		10.1007/s00024-016-1375-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00024-016-1375-z													WOS:000382941400012

Despite their ecological importance, the temporal variability in the structure of stream bacterioplankton communities remains understudied. We investigated the composition and temporal variability of stream bacterial communities and the influence of physicochemical parameters on these communities. We used barcoded pyrosequencing to survey bacterial communities in 107 streamwater samples collected from four locations in the Colorado Rocky Mountains from September 2008 to November 2009. The four sampled locations harboured distinct communities yet, at each sampling location, there was pronounced temporal variability in both community composition and alpha diversity levels. These temporal shifts in bacterioplankton community structure were not seasonal; rather, their diversity and composition appeared to be driven by intermittent changes in various streamwater biogeochemical conditions. Bacterial communities varied independently of time, as indicated by the observation that communities in samples collected close together in time were no more similar than those collected months apart. The temporal turnover in community composition was higher than observed in most previously studied microbial, plant or animal communities, highlighting the importance of stochastic processes and disturbance events in structuring these communities over time. Detailed temporal sampling is important if the objective is to monitor microbial community dynamics in pulsed ecosystems like streams.

J	Li, MT; Xu, KQ; Watanabe, M; Chen, ZY				Li, Maotian; Xu, Kaiqin; Watanabe, Masataka; Chen, Zhongyuan			Long-term variations in dissolved silicate, nitrogen, and phosphorus flux from the Yangtze River into the East China Sea and impacts on estuarine ecosystem	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Variations of dissolved silicate (DSi) flux in the Yangtze River have caused great concern among scientists. Analysis of spatial and temporal variations of DSi indicates that the distribution of DSi concentration (DSiC) is closely related to the occurrence of bedrocks in the river cathchment. On average, the upper Yangtze River and Dongting and Poyang Lake of the middle Yangtze basin serve as the major DSi sinks, retaining 3.39 x 10(4) t y(-1), 5.59 x 10(4) and 2.51 X 10(4) t y(-1). The middle and low Yangtze River remains DSi sources, emitting 2.85 x 10(4) and 2.48 x 10(4) t y(-1), respectively. Geochemical data at Datong hydrological station recorded the flux of nutrients entering into the sea during the flood season, i.e. 74% for DSi, 73% for DIN (Dissolved Inorganic Nitrate) and 68% DIP (Dissolved Inorganic Phosphate). The yearly DSiC and flux show a sharp decrease since 1950s. The mean DSiC was 109.47, 91.09, and 77.56 mu mol l(-1) in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, respectively. The mean DSi fluxes for the same time period were 2.72, 2.23, and 2.13 x 10(6) t. A PP (primary productivity) model estimates 3.14 x 10(5) t of DSi (13.08% of the annual mean flux entering into the sea) was fixated within the 162 reservoirs in 2002. On the other hand, DIN and DIP concentration and flux have increased greatly since the 1950s. Fertilizer application peaked after the 1980s can interpret these high DIN and DIP. A sharply decreasing DSi flux and quickly increasing DIN and DIP fluxes into the sea have enhanced eutrophication and caused frequent harmful algal blooms in coastal waters. On average, red-fide frequency was from 0.04 during 1933-1979 to 7.0 during 2000-2002. The Skeletonema costatum (siliceous alga), the red-tide-predominant species that is in positive proportion to DSi flux, decreased from 33% during the 1980s to 24% during 2000-2002. The present data evidence the increase of Prorocentrum dentatum (non-siliceous alga) from 12.5% in the 1980s to 36% in 2000-2002, which tends to be dominant species of the red tides off the Yangtze estuary. The number of big dams in the Yangtze River basin will double in the next 30-50 years. This will significantly influence the variations of nutrient fluxes in the river basin and estuary, in relation to health management of river-coast ecosystem. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Carbon dioxide dynamics in a lake and a reservoir on a tropical island (Bali, Indonesia)	PLOS ONE												Water-to-air carbon dioxide fluxes from tropical lakes and reservoirs (artificial lakes) may be an important but understudied component of global carbon fluxes. Here, we investigate the seasonal dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) dynamics in a lake and a reservoir on a tropical volcanic island (Bali, Indonesia). Observations were performed over four seasonal surveys in Bali's largest natural lake (Lake Batur) and largest reservoir (Palasari Reservoir). Average CO2 partial pressures in the natural lake and reservoir were 263.7 +/- 12.2 mu atm and 785.0 +/- 283.6 mu atm respectively, with the highest area-weighted partial pressures in the wet season for both systems. The strong correlations between seasonal mean values of dissolved oxygen (DO) and pCO(2) in the natural lake (r(2) = 0.92) suggest that surface water metabolism was an important driver of CO2 dynamics in this deep system. Radon (Rn-222, a natural groundwater discharge tracer) explained up to 77% of the variability in pCO(2) in the shallow reservoir, suggesting that groundwater seepage was the major CO2 driver in the reservoir. Overall, the natural lake was a sink of atmospheric CO2 (average fluxes of -2.8 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) while the reservoir was a source of CO2 to the atmosphere (average fluxes of 7.3 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Reservoirs are replacing river valleys and terrestrial ecosystems, particularly throughout developing tropical regions. While the net effect of this conversion on atmospheric CO2 fluxes remains to be resolved, we speculate that reservoir construction will partially offset the CO2 sink provided by deep, volcanic, natural lakes and terrestrial environments.

Quantifying the extent of surface meltwater in Antarctica on a large scale is a challenging task. Traditional methods, such as thresholding, have many limitations. We used a deep learning method, the U-Net with attention blocks, to automatically extract surface meltwater from Sentinel-2 images. We inserted attention mechanism blocks into U-Net to assign different weights to all pixels and channels to utilize the high resolution and multiple channels of Sentinel-2 images. The model was used to map surface water bodies in Sentinel-2 images, and the average accuracy reached 0.9969 on the test dataset. In East Antarctica, the Amery ice shelf (AIS) exhibits the largest surface meltwater area. Studying surface meltwater dynamics on the AIS is useful for understanding the East Antarctic mass balance and demonstrating the model performance. We analyzed the classification results for surface water bodies on the AIS from January 2017 to 2022. Spatially, 96% of surface water bodies are concentrated inland of the AIS from 70(?) S to 73(?) S and account for 93% of the region 20 km from the coastline of the AIS. Temporally, the water body area varies considerably in different years, with a maximum in 2017 (932.54 km(2)) and a minimum in 2021 (58.34 km(2)). The spatial distribution of surface water bodies on the AIS is controlled by the firn air content (FAC), katabatic winds, bare rocks, and blue ice. The interannual variability is associated with complex climate factors, including temperature, surface net solar radiation, snowfall, and snowmelt, among which temperature and snowfall show a strong correlation.					wang, lijuan/AAN-4034-2021; Yang, Shuhu/ISU-8049-2023	Yang, Shuhu/0000-0001-9967-7756; Tang, Xueyuan/0000-0002-6226-4891													0196-2892	1558-0644					2023	61								4301013	10.1109/TGRS.2023.3275076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2023.3275076													WOS:001000313600019
J	Li, XM; Liang, J; Hou, JZ; Zhang, WJ				Li, Xiumei; Liang, Jie; Hou, Juzhi; Zhang, Wenjing			Centennial-scale climate variability during the past 2000years on the central Tibetan Plateau	HOLOCENE												It is currently suggested that climate change on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) was influenced alternately by the monsoon and the Westerlies. However, the mechanisms driving Holocene climate change on the TP remain unclear, since the extent of the influence of individual atmospheric circulation systems has not yet been clearly defined because of the shortage of high-quality paleoclimatic records. This is especially true in the central TP, where only a few ice core and paleolimnological records are available. Here, we present a decadal-resolution temperature record from Dagze Co in the central TP for the past 2000years, based on the unsaturation index of long-chain alkenones, using an updated temperature calibration, and a record of precipitation isotopes from compound-specific isotope ratios of leaf waxes. The centennial-scale variation of the temperature and precipitation isotope records captures well-known climatic events over the past 1000years, for example, the Little Ice Age', which was cooler and drier than the Medieval Warm Period'. However, the relationship between temperature and the precipitation isotope records differed during the interval at 2000-1000cal. yr BP compared to the past 1000years, probably because of changes in precipitation seasonality and the additional influence of the Westerlies on the central TP. In addition, the temperature records exhibit a prominent 210-year cyclicity, suggesting a possible influence of solar radiation on temperature variability.					梁, 洁/GRY-6915-2022; Xiumei, Li/JFA-3042-2023; Hou, Juzhi/W-5655-2018; Zhang, Wenjing/JDC-9818-2023	Hou, Juzhi/0000-0002-8512-5739; liang, Jie/0000-0003-2726-923X													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUN	2015	25	6					892	899		10.1177/0959683615572852	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683615572852													WOS:000354861200001
J	Roach, J; Griffith, B; Verbyla, D; Jones, J				Roach, Jennifer; Griffith, Brad; Verbyla, Dave; Jones, Jeremy			Mechanisms influencing changes in lake area in Alaskan boreal forest	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												During the past similar to 50 years, the number and area of lakes have declined in several regions in boreal forests. However, there has been substantial finer-scale heterogeneity; some lakes decreased in area, some showed no trend, and others increased. The objective of this study was to identify the primary mechanisms underlying heterogeneous trends in closed-basin lake area. Eight lake characteristics (delta O-18, electrical conductivity, surface : volume index, bank slope, floating mat width, peat depth, thaw depth at shoreline, and thaw depth at the forest boundary) were compared for 15 lake pairs in Alaskan boreal forest where one lake had decreased in area since similar to 1950, and the other had not. Mean differences in characteristics between paired lakes were used to identify the most likely of nine mechanistic scenarios that combined three potential mechanisms for decreasing lake area (talik drainage, surface water evaporation, and terrestrialization) with three potential mechanisms for nondecreasing lake area (subpermafrost groundwater recharge through an open talik, stable permafrost, and thermokarst). A priori expectations of the direction of mean differences between decreasing and nondecreasing paired lakes were generated for each scenario. Decreasing lakes had significantly greater electrical conductivity, greater surface : volume indices, shallower bank slopes, wider floating mats, greater peat depths, and shallower thaw depths at the forest boundary. These results indicated that the most likely scenario was terrestrialization as the mechanism for lake area reduction combined with thermokarst as the mechanism for nondecreasing lake area. Terrestrialization and thermokarst may have been enhanced by recent warming which has both accelerated permafrost thawing and lengthened the growing season, thereby increasing plant growth, floatingmat encroachment, transpiration rates, and the accumulation of organic matter in lake basins. The transition to peatlands associated with terrestrialization may provide a transient increase in carbon storage enhancing the role of northern ecosystems as major stores of global carbon.																			1354-1013	1365-2486				AUG	2011	17	8					2567	2583		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02446.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02446.x													WOS:000292308300006

Chlorophyll-nutrient relationships of different lake types using a large European dataset	AQUATIC ECOLOGY					Conference on Relationships Between Ecological and Chemical Status of Surface Waters (REBECCA)	MAY 21-24, 2007	Oslo, NORWAY					In Europe there is a renewed focus on relationships between chemical determinands and ecological impact as a result of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). In this paper we use regression analysis to examine the relationship of growing season mean chlorophyll a concentration with total phosphorus and total nitrogen using summary data from over 1,000 European lakes. For analysis, lakes were grouped into types with three categories of mean depth, alkalinity and humic content. The lakes were also divided into broad geographic regions covering Atlantic, Northern, Central/Baltic and for some types the Mediterranean areas of Europe. Chlorophyll a was found to be significantly related to both total phosphorus and total nitrogen, although total phosphorus was almost always found to be the best predictor of chlorophyll. Different nutrient chlorophyll relationships were found for lakes according to mean depth and alkalinity, although no significant effect of geographic region or humic content was found for the majority of lake types. We identified three groups of lakes with significantly different responses. Deep lakes had the lowest yield of chlorophyll per unit of nutrient, low and moderate alkalinity shallow lakes the highest and high alkalinity lakes were intermediate. We recommend that the regression models provided for these three lake groups should be used for lake management in Europe and discuss the limitations of such models.

We conducted a comparative study of biogeochemical variations in three major European rivers-the Rhine, Danube, and Seine-which reveals the impacts of different carbonate outcrops and human impacts (agricultural activities and sewage input) on the changes in the limiting nutrients and phytoplankton community compositions of flowing water systems. N limitation was observed in the Rhine and Danube owing to their low average NO3- loads (4.04-6.45 mg/L). Although the extensive outcrops of carbonate rocks in the Seine catchment result in high average HCO3- concentrations of similar to 4.68 mmol/L, the elevated inorganic C input did not match the high average NO3- loads (similar to 19.38 mg/L), driven by intensive agricultural activity and urban sewage input, demonstrating a potential C limitation on productivity. Our results show that the productivity of the Seine River, determined by the chlorophyll-a concentration, was significantly related to the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration (coefficient of determination: R-2 = 0.68, P < 0.05). Our results demonstrate that changes in DIC content can significantly alter the dominant phytoplankton species in the water column. The high inputs of DIC and aqueous CO2(aq) to the Seine lead to Bacillariophyta proportions that are 3.96-8.81 % and 19.87-22.56 % higher than those of the Rhine and Danube in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. This can be explained by the difference in the efficiency of carbon concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) among phytoplankton species. Therefore, to mitigate river eutrophication and improve the quality of the aquatic environment, we suggest that future water-carbon management in the flowing water systems with abundant nutrients should consider C-limitation alleviation and its potential effect for reducing the abundance of harmful algae.

J	Duffy, PR				Duffy, Paul R.			Site size hierarchy in middle-range societies	JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY												Site size hierarchy is an archaeological pattern commonly used to identify regional political hierarchy in state-level and stateless middle-range societies. Although a number of archaeologists have acknowledged that several processes can produce site size hierarchy, many scholars in North America and Eurasia continue to assume that this settlement pattern is solely generated by single process hierarchical, politically centralized societies. This assumption, I believe, limits our ability to build an accurate database of societies with emergent inequality. In this paper, I review the processes potentially responsible for producing site size hierarchy, and draw on ethnohistoric case studies from the Great Lakes region and Papua New Guinea to illustrate these processes. I then assess the possible mechanisms that created site size hierarchy for a prehistoric case in Middle Bronze Age Hungary (1750-1400 BC)-an area where the signature is almost universally assumed to index regional political hierarchy. However, I reveal that the Hungarian case study instead points to several other processes including aggregation, dispersal and community fission that lie behind this pattern. These examples suggest that site size hierarchies, when interpreted uncritically as social hierarchies, may overestimate the degree of political centralization in prehistoric societies.

A new method to estimate global freshwater phytoplankton carbon fixation using satellite remote sensing: initial results	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Freshwater phytoplankton carbon fixation is an important water quality parameter that can provide information about the health of lake ecosystems as well as their impacts on regional carbon cycling dynamics. Traditional field methods for measuring and monitoring primary production are unable to capture the necessary spatial and temporal variability at the global scale due to the sheer number and diversity of the world's lakes. Satellite remote sensing offers a potential tool to quantify freshwater lake primary production on a global scale. A new straightforward remote sensing approach was developed to estimate global freshwater carbon fixation from satellite observable lakes using a straightforward depth-integrated model (DIM). A key component of this approach is the estimation of the light utilization index, psi, for freshwater systems. A significant negative linear model to estimate growing season psi as a function of latitude was developed from data acquired through an exhaustive literature review. In conjunction with a previous remote sensing generated freshwater chlorophyll-a concentration data set, the DIM was used to compute growing season carbon fixation for 80,000 freshwater lakes. While these estimates are rough and could exhibit large errors for any given lake, they provide a reasonable synoptic global estimate of freshwater carbon fixation. In general, growing season areal carbon fixation was shown to decrease with increasing latitude in both northern and southern hemispheres. Carbon fixation rates in the southern hemisphere were found to be significantly higher than in the northern hemisphere, with the African continent exhibiting the highest rates. Total daily carbon fixation (areal rate x lake area) was estimated at 1.03 teragrams of carbon per day (Tg C day(-1)) with approximately 71% occurring in the northern hemisphere. Total fixation was highest in North America, which was dominated by a very large number of Canadian Shield lakes. In general, total carbon fixation was well explained by total lake surface area, except in the far northern latitudes where lakes are more oligotrophic due to limited nutrient availability. This analysis resulted in a new freshwater carbon fixation product that provides new insights into the role freshwater lakes play in the global carbon budget.

The Impact of Storms on Legionella pneumophila in Cooling Tower Water, Implications for Human Health	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												At the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS) in Aiken, SC, cooling tower water is routinely monitored for Legionella pneumophila concentrations using a direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) technique. Historically, 25-30 operating SRS cooling towers have varying concentrations of Legionella in all seasons of the year, with patterns that are unpredictable. Legionellosis, or Legionnaires' disease (LD), is a pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria that thrive both in man-made water distribution systems and natural surface waters including lakes, streams, and wet soil. Legionnaires' disease is typically contracted by inhaling L. pneumophila, most often in aerosolized mists that contain the bacteria. At the SRS, L. pneumophila is typically found in cooling towers ranging from non-detectable up to 10(8) cells/L in cooling tower water systems. Extreme weather conditions contributed to elevations in L. pneumophila to 10(7)-10(8) cells/L in SRS cooling tower water systems in July-August 2017. L. pneumophila concentrations in Cooling Tower 785-A/2A located in SRS A-Area, stayed in the 10(8) cells/L range despite biocide addition. During this time, other SRS cooling towers did not demonstrate this L. pneumophila increase. No significant difference was observed in the mean L. pneumophila mean concentrations for the towers (p < 0.05). There was a significant variance observed in the 285-2A/A Tower L. pneumophila results (p < 0.05). Looking to see if we could find "effects" led to model development by analyzing 13 months of water chemistry and microbial data for the main factors influencing the L. pneumophila concentrations in five cooling towers for this year. It indicated chlorine and dissolved oxygen had a significant impact (p < 0.0002) on cooling tower 785A/2A. Thus, while the variation in the log count data for the A-area tower is statistically greater than that of the other four towers, the average of the log count data for the A-Area tower was in line with that of the other towers. It was also observed that the location of 785A/2A and basin resulted in more debris entering the system during storm events. Our results suggest that future analyses should evaluate the impact of environmental conditions and cooling tower design on L. pneumophila water concentrations and human health.

J	Wei, D; Zhao, H; Huang, L; Qi, YH; Wang, XD				Wei, Da; Zhao, Hui; Huang, Lin; Qi, Yahui; Wang, Xiaodan			Feedbacks of Alpine Wetlands on the Tibetan Plateau to the Atmosphere	WETLANDS												The alpine wetlands of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) contribute 30%-40% of China's natural wetlands, and they are experiencing changes in climate, i.e. warming of 0.26 degrees C 10 yr(-1) (since the 1950s), as well as considerable human impacts. Consequently, alpine wetland extent show strong response to these impacts in most part, a reduction since the 1970s, followed by a recovery since the 2000s. In the eastern TP, they suffered stronger human regulations in Zoige mires, i.e. decades' drainage and recent restoration. These alpine wetlands have long been considered as a vital CH4 source, while inventories and model simulations estimated these wetlands emit roughly 1 Tg CH4-C yr(-1) and predicted an increase due to increased temperature and recovery of wetland extent. The alpine wetlands are generally a CO2 sink of roughly 15.8 Tg CO2 yr(-1), mitigating half of their emitted CH4, and satellite-based observations of vegetation greening have observed that their plants took more CO2 from the atmosphere. Furthermore, the alpine wetlands provide a biophysical cooling effect, due to higher evaporative energy loss during early growing seasons. Variations in both climate changes and human influences have been well documented and indicate that these alpine wetlands provide vital feedbacks to the climate.

Fish assemblage dynamics in a Neotropical floodplain relative to aquatic macrophytes and the homogenizing effect of a flood pulse	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The presence of aquatic macrophytes is a key factor in the selection of habitats by fish in floodplain lakes because these plants enhance the physical and biological complexities of aquatic habitats. The seasonal flood pulse may influence this interaction, but there is no information in the literature about the effects that flood events may have on macrophytes assemblages and its associated effects on fish assemblages. Thus, this article aimed to investigate whether species richness, evenness and similarities in fish assemblage composition differed between littoral areas vegetated with macrophytes and unvegetated areas, before and after a flood. We sampled three lakes in the floodplain of the upper Parana River basin. Sampling was conducted before (December 2004 and January 2005) and after (early March, late March and May 2005) a flood event. Overall, species richness and evenness were higher in macrophytes-covered areas. Before the flood, the composition of fish assemblages was distinct when comparing vegetated and unvegetated areas. After the flood, the similarity in fish assemblage composition was higher, indicating a homogenization effect of floods for fish inhabiting littoral areas of floodplain lakes. After the flood, opportunistic species dominated the fish assemblages in aquatic macrophytes, apparently restructuring assemblages in the littoral, restarting a succession process. Thus, the observed homogenization effect of the flood could minimize biological interactions and could induce fish assemblages to begin a new process of structurization.					; Gomes, Luiz/D-5886-2013; Agostinho, Angelo/S-1538-2019; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/D-5888-2013	gomes, Luiz/0000-0001-7295-723X; Miranda, Leandro/0000-0002-2138-7924; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/0000-0002-4707-9444													0018-8158	1573-5117				APR	2012	685	1					97	107		10.1007/s10750-011-0870-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-011-0870-6													WOS:000300673500006

Vertical heterogeneities of cyanobacteria and microcystin concentrations in lakes using a seasonal In situ monitoring station	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												A high frequency, high resolution, seasonal research station was deployed to quantify a wide range of local meteorological conditions, water temperature, and water chemistry, including phycocyanin, in two different eutrophic stratified Minnesota lakes. The monitoring effort was coupled with discrete weekly sampling measuring nutrients, cyanobacteria composition, and microcystin concentrations. Our objective was to describe the vertical and seasonal distributions of cyanobacteria biovolume (BV) and microcystin concentrations (MC) using physical lake variables. Two types of BV distributions were observed above the thermocline upward in the water column. The first distribution depicted BV uniformly distributed over the diurnal surface layer (h(SL)), and the second BV distribution displayed local BV maxima. A quantitative relationship was developed to determine the anticipation of observing a uniform distribution as a function of the surface layer Reynolds number (Re-SL), the dimensionless ratio of inertial to viscous forces. The uniform distribution was observed systematically for Re-SL > 50,000. MC was observed to accumulate above the thermocline and have a vertical distribution similar to BV, thus depending on Re-SL. This is important for directing sampling efforts, because it narrows the range of BV and MC heterogeneity above the thermocline, and suggests a vertical sampling protocol to detect potential maxima and compute representative depth-average concentrations. We explored the temporal variability of the MC to BV ratio, spatially averaged in the epilimnion (MCep/BVep). The maximum MCep/BVep occurred before the maximum BVep and specifically, during the onset of significant biomass growth in both lakes. This observation is notable because the maximum MCep occurs before the visual signs of enhanced cyanobacterial accrual are less recognizable to the public and to monitoring efforts. Our findings could have important implications for predicting MC distribution and guiding monitoring strategies for quantifying MC concentrations in small stratified lakes. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The lake is now divided into different individual seasonal or perennial lake pools. Paradoxically, our understanding of the hydrology of the lake in its present state remains poor. In particular there is a lack of fundamental hydrological data to quantify the drought and limited information about water management options. The hydrologic changes are the driving forces for the natural resources associated with the lake i.e. fisheries, recession cultivation on the lake floor and green vegetation for livestock. Whereas the yearly cycle of the natural resources has become fairly predictable in the southern pool of the lake, variability and vulnerability have increased greatly in the northern pool. Here we use a hydrological model of Lake Chad developed recently to i) reconstruct the past levels and inundated areas in order to compensate for the lack of hydrological data and, ii) simulate the effects on the lake of modifications in the entering fluxes, either by abstraction for irrigation purposes, addition from an inter basin transfer or impact of climate change. The study period runs from 1973 to 2011 with a total inundated area of the lake ranging between 1800 and 15,000 km(2). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Phenological variation in annual timing of hibernation and breeding in nearby populations of Arctic ground squirrels	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Ecologists need an empirical understanding of physiological and behavioural adjustments that animals can make in response to seasonal and long-term variations in environmental conditions. Because many species experience trade-offs between timing and duration of one seasonal event versus another and because interacting species may also shift phenologies at different rates, it is possible that, in aggregate, phenological shifts could result in mismatches that disrupt ecological communities. We investigated the timing of seasonal events over 14 years in two Arctic ground squirrel populations living 20 km apart in Northern Alaska. At Atigun River, snow melt occurred 27 days earlier and snow cover began 17 days later than at Toolik Lake. This spatial differential was reflected in significant variation in the timing of most seasonal events in ground squirrels living at the two sites. Although reproductive males ended seasonal torpor on the same date at both sites, Atigun males emerged from hibernation 9 days earlier and entered hibernation 5 days later than Toolik males. Atigun females emerged and bred 13 days earlier and entered hibernation 9 days earlier than those at Toolik. We propose that this variation in phenology over a small spatial scale is likely generated by plasticity of physiological mechanisms that may also provide individuals the ability to respond to variation in environmental conditions over time.					; Richter, Melanie/JAO-1215-2023; Buck, C.

Berry			Aeolian Material Transport and Its Role in Landscape Connectivity in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Arid regions, particularly polar and alpine desert environments, have diminished landscape connectivity compared to temperate regions due to limited and/or seasonal hydrological processes. For these environments, aeolian processes play a particularly important role in landscape evolution and biotic community vitality through nutrient and solute additions. The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) are the largest ice-free area in Antarctica and are potentially a major source of aeolian material for the continent. From this region, samples were collected at five heights (5, 10, 20, 50, and 100cm) above the surface seasonally for 2013 through 2015 from Alatna Valley, Victoria Valley, Miers Valley, and Taylor Valley (Taylor Glacier, East Lake Bonney, F6 (Lake Fryxell), and Explorer's Cove). Despite significant geological separation and varying glacial histories, low-elevation and coastal sites had similar major ion chemistries, as did high-elevation and inland locations. This locational clustering of compositions was also evident in scanning electron microscopy images and principal component analyses, particularly for samples collected at 100cm above the surface. Compared to published soil literature, aeolian material in Taylor Valley demonstrates a primarily down-valley transport of material toward the coast. Soluble N:P ratios in the aeolian material reflect relative nutrient enrichments seen in MDV soils and lakes, where younger, coastal soils are relatively N depleted, while older, up-valley soils are relatively P depleted. The aeolian transport of materials, including water-soluble nutrients, is an important vector of connectivity within the MDV and provides a mechanism to help homogenize the geochemistry of both soil and aquatic ecosystems.					; Adams, Byron/C-3808-2009	Cary, Stephen/0000-0002-2876-2387; MCKNIGHT, DIANE/0000-0002-4171-1533; Adams, Byron/0000-0002-7815-3352; Welch, Susan/0000-0002-2890-0065; Welch, Kathleen/0000-0003-1028-3086; Khan, Alia/0000-0002-4425-1528; Diaz, Melisa/0000-0001-6657-358X													2169-9003	2169-9011				DEC	2018	123	12					3323	3337		10.1029/2017JF004589	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2017JF004589													WOS:000455484300011

In this paper, the terrestrial water storage variations in the Poyang Lake Basin are recovered from the GRACE gravity data from January 2003 to March 2014 and compared with the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) hydrological models and satellite altimetry. Furthermore, the impact of soil moisture content from GLDAS and rainfall from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) on TWS variations are investigated. Our results indicate that the TWS variations from GRACE, GLDAS and satellite altimetry have a general consistency. The TWS trends in the Poyang Lake Basin determined from GRACE, GLDAS and satellite altimetry are increasing at 0.0141 km(3)/a, 0.0328 km(3)/a and 0.0238 km(3)/a, respectively during the investigated time period. The TWS is governed mainly by the soil moisture content and dominated primarily by the precipitation but also modulated by the flood season of the Yangtze River as well as the lake and river exchange water.

The results indicated that stratification of the reservoir had great effects on temperature and oxygen profiles, and both the functional diversity and the composition of the bacterial community strongly reflected the significant vertical stratification in the reservoir. The results of the Biolog method showed a significantly higher utilization of carbon sources in the hypolimnion than in the epilimnion. The result of pyrosequencing also showed a significantly higher species diversity and richness in the hypolimnion than in the epilimnion with different dominant phylum. Redundancy analysis also indicated that the majority of environmental variables, especially pH and dissolved oxygen, played key roles in shaping bacterial community composition. Our study provides a better understanding of the functional diversity of bacterial communities, and the response of microorganisms to seasonal thermal stratification.

This locality includes several sections, named Kosika 1-4 and Borehole 2 Kosika that are described in detail for the first time. Drilling, sediment descriptions, and sampling were performed during the 2008-2015 field seasons. Application of complex biostratigraphical methods and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates were used to reconstruct the Neopleistocene (Middle-Late Pleistocene) palaeoenvironment in the Lower Volga area. During the Tyurkyan Period (at the early beginning of the Neopleistocene), regression of the Apsheronian Sea began. Lithological features and the presence of freshwater molluscs demonstrate that deposits accumulated in rivers and lakes under humid climatic conditions. Molluscs, ostracods, and dinoflagellates inhabited the Baku Sea. Climate was arid at the beginning of this period and humid during a later phase. Several changes affecting the marine and fluvial environments characterise the Early Khazar period. In particular, the climate oscillated from humid conditions at the beginning to an arid state, then returned to a more humid setting at the end of this period. These changes are indicated by palynological and malacological data. Regression of the Early Khazar Sea occurred during Singil time, when rivers, lakes, and limans (lagoons) existed. Large mammals inhabited plains that were covered by extensive vegetation. The climate during this period was humid and slightly cooler than the present day climate. Late Khazar and Khvalyn transgressions occurred during the Late Neopleistocene. When the Late Khazar Sea retreated from the territory, river valleys became the dominant landscape feature. Floodplains of Late Khazar rivers became sites of deposition of loamy and sandy material emplaced during flood events. At the end of this regressive period, the climate was arid and dry enough to allow for accumulation of anhydrite sediment in shallow lagoons and lakes. Afterwards, the Khvalyn transgression began, as indicated by the occurrence of specific key mollusc species. Fluvial-marine deposits formed geological bodies representative of an undersea delta, which in relief form the Baer Knolls. The modern Volga valley was formed during the Holocene.					; Titov, Vadim/C-3238-2016; Galina, Aleksandrova/AAW-8215-2020; Tesakov, Alexey/K-2299-2018; Murray, Andrew/A-4388-2012; Danukalova, Guzel/A-8103-2014	Sadikhov, Emin/0000-0002-4699-1546; Murray, Andrew/0000-0001-5559-1862; Titov, Vadim/0000-0001-5938-5775; Galina, Aleksandrova/0000-0001-5402-6968; Simakova, Aleksandra/0000-0001-5214-8216; Yakovleva, Tatyana/0000-0003-0353-3171; Danukalova, Guzel/0000-0001-7602-5923; Shevchenko, Alexander/0009-0008-6752-9458													1040-6182	1873-4553				FEB 25	2020	540						38	67		10.1016/j.quaint.2018.11.036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2018.11.036													WOS:000522974800004

Based on a 2-year study of 9 coastal lakes along the southern Baltic Sea, representing freshwater, transitional, and brackish ecosystems, we have shown that benthic fauna was structured by sea water intrusion (=fluctuation of salinity). The increase in salinity gradient resulted in a decreasing trend in the richness and abundance of benthic species, while the diversity showed a slightly positive trend, but below statistical significance (p < 0.05). The abundance of benthic organisms was the highest in brackish costal lakes, where the marine component of fauna was identified. Due to the greatest instability of environmental conditions in lakes periodically linked with the sea (transitional), we found the lowest species number, a-diversity, and abundance, regardless of the season. Salinity appears as a key factor in controlling the functioning of the ecotone (coastal lakes, lagoons) between the marine and terrestrial environments. Salinity is a prerequisite for the proper assessment of the ecological status of coastal lakes and the development of effective methods of protecting coastal lakes. Benthic communities were studied in nine Polish coastal lakes of the Baltic Sea; representing three levels of hydrological connection with the sea (isolated, periodically connected, and permanently connected), with resultant differences in salinity (freshwater, transitional, and brackish). The lakes classified in this way allowed us to investigate biodiversity in relation to the degree of environmental pressure. Stress intensity in coastal water bodies, resulting from contrasting marine and terrestrial influences, varied from mild to severe. Spatial variation in environmental predictors affected species richness more strongly than seasonal fluctuations. The broader the spatial salinity gradient, the smaller the species number recorded. Differences in the intensity of natural instability only slightly affected species number and a-diversity. In Baltic coastal lakes, characterized by low salinity (max. 7.5 PSU), benthic faunal communities were dominated by large populations of opportunistic species. This applied primarily to closed systems and those periodically influenced by seawater intrusion. The marine component of fauna played a more important role in increasing the diversity of benthos in permanently open water bodies (brackish). The highest density of benthic fauna was recorded in them, whereas low values were associated with the strongest instability, observed in lakes periodically linked with the sea (transitional).

However, the seasonal nutrients variation, eutrophication pattern, and Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) response adjacent to Guangdong coastal water were still scarcely. In this study, to clarity the seasonal nutrients variation, eutrophication pattern, and Chl-a, response adjacent to coastal water, the spatiotemporal dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphorus (DIP) patterns and Chl-a were explored by field observation using 52 stations in the coastal waters of Guangdong Province during the dry (April and May), wet (July and August) and normal (October and November) seasons in 2020. The results showed that the variability of Chl-a, DIN and DIP were significantly different in seasons (P<0.01), and the mean concentrations of Chl-a, DIN and DIP were 11.97 +/- 28.12 <mu>g/L, 25.84 +/- 35.72 mu mol/ L and 0.59 +/- 0.71 mu mol/L.Among them, the mean value of Chl-a increased significantly from 9.99 +/- 9.84 mu g/L in the dry season to 18.28 +/- 38.07 mu g/L in the wet season, and then decreased significantly to 7.65 +/- 27.64 mu g/L in the normal season.The mean DIN value decreased significantly from 30.68 +/- 43.58 mu mol/L in the dry season to 21.91 +/- 35.45 mu mol/L in the wet season, and then increased to 24.91 +/- 26.12 mu mol/L in the normal season. the mean DIP value decreased from 0.58 +/- 0.73 mu mol/L in the dry season to 0.48 +/- 0.65 mu mol/L in the wet season and then increased significantly to 0.70 +/- 0.73 mu mol/L in the normal season. In addition, the DIN and DIP concentrations at most monitoring stations met the Grade II national seawater quality standards, and only a few monitoring stations fail to meet the Grade IV national seawater quality standard. The DIN/DIP ratios ranged from 2.05 to 259.47, with an average of 43.77 +/- 41.01, far exceeding the Redfield ratio, indicating the presence of P limitation in the nearshore waters of Guangdong Province. Besides, the EI values in the coastal waters of Guangdong Province are higher at 0.00 and 82.51, with an average of 4.16 +/- 10.90. DIN and DIP were significantly and positively correlated with COD in each season (P<0.05). Moreover, DIN/DIP showed significantly positive correlations with Chl-a in all seasons (P<0.01), indicating that high Chl-a concentrations could be sustained by the nutrients supply in marine ecosystems. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the integrated management of land and sea and effectively mitigate regional estuarine and coastal water eutrophication and harmful algal blooms.																				2296-7745				AUG 10	2023	10								1236609	10.3389/fmars.2023.1236609	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1236609													WOS:001093663800001

The Effects of Intra-Annual Variability of River Discharge on the Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Saltmarsh Vegetation at River Mouth Bar: Insights from an Ecogeomorphological Model	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS												Natural or human-induced intra-annual variation of river discharge alters estuarine hydrological regimes and further affects habitat conditions for saltmarsh vegetation, particularly at the river mouth bar. In this study, numerical experiments were performed in Delft3D to simulate the evolution of a schematized river mouth bar under prototypical unsteady river discharge scenarios. The simulated hydrodynamic and morphodynamic changes were used to drive a vegetation dynamics model developed based on Spartina alterniflora in real time to model the resultant vegetation responses throughout the plant life history. Our results show that the imposed seasonal high flow can create more potential suitable habitat for the vegetation expansion and at the same time, cause marsh erosion through flood-induced drag force and substrate erosion. The overall effect of the trade-off between expansion and erosion depends on the timing, magnitude and duration of the high flow as well as its carried sediment concentration, leading to three vegetation response regimes, namely, minimal impact with small flood, erosion with big flood and low sediment supply, and expansion with big flood and high sediment supply. Besides, the timing of the high flow determines whether the vegetation has enough time to occupy the newly created subaerial area after the high flow and thereby affects the overall saltmarsh extent. The proposed vegetation response regimes are verified in principle in real cases such as Yellow River Estuary, Wax Lake Delta and Yangtze River Estuary. Our findings can help inform water diversion projects in river deltas to restore coastal wetlands in terms of suitable sediment supply and timing, etc.					Gualtieri, Carlo/A-5686-2009														1726-2135	1684-8799				DEC	2023	42	2					108	122		10.3808/jei.202300498	http://dx.doi.org/10.3808/jei.202300498		AUG 2023											WOS:001049734200001

However, irrigation water diverted from the Yellow River carries a large amount of salt into the desert oases in the Hetao plain. It is of the utmost importance to determine the characteristics of water and salt transport. Research was carried out in the Hetao plain of Inner Mongolia. Three methods, i.e., water-table fluctuation (WTF), soil hydrodynamics, and solute dynamics, were combined to build a water and salt balance model to reveal the relationship of water and salt transport in sand dune-wasteland-lake systems. Results showed that groundwater level had a typical seasonal-fluctuation pattern, and the groundwater transport direction in the sand dune-wasteland-lake system changed during different periods. During the crop-growth period (5 May-27 October), the average evapotranspiration values of the sand dune, wasteland-sand dune junction, and wasteland were 31-42% of the reference evapotranspiration. The water consumption of sand dune was 1.95 times that of the wasteland-sand dune junction, and 1.88 times that of wasteland. Water loss of the lake was 761.25-869.05 mm (5 May-27 October). The lake is facing the risk of drying up. The vertical salt transport of groundwater at the sand-dune site was 1.13 times that at the wasteland-sand dune junction site, and 1.82 times that at the wasteland site. Of the groundwater salt of the sand dune, 54% was accumulated in the groundwater of the wasteland-sand dune junction. Of the groundwater salt of the wasteland-sand dune junction, 53% was accumulated in wasteland groundwater, and the remaining 47% was accumulated in the lake. Salt storage of the 1 m soil layer of the sand dune was 85% that of the wasteland-sand dune junction, and 82% that of the wasteland. Research results provide a theoretical basis for the ecohydrology of the Hetao plain.					; guoshuai, wang/AAE-2447-2021	Miao, Qingfeng/0000-0002-2584-6833; 														2073-4441				DEC	2020	12	12							3454	10.3390/w12123454	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12123454													WOS:000602845900001

Large linear wastewater ponds that lack anti-seepage measures can act as river channels that cause the deterioration of groundwater quality. This study investigated the groundwater recharge by leakage of the Tanghe Wastewater Reservoir, which is the largest industrial wastewater channel on the North China Plain. Additionally, water quality evolution was investigated using a combination of multivariate statistical methods, multi-tracers and geochemical methods. Stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen indicated high levels of wastewater evaporation. Based on the assumption that the wastewater was under an open system and fully mixed, an evaporation model was established to estimate the evaporation of the wastewater based on isotope enrichments of the Rayleigh distillation theory using the average isotope values for dry and rainy seasons. Using an average evaporation loss of 26.5% for the input wastewater, the estimated recharge fraction of wastewater leakage and irrigation was 73.5% of the total input of wastewater. The lateral regional groundwater inflow was considered to be another recharge source. Combing the two end-members mix model and cluster analysis revealed that the mixture percentage of the wastewater decreased from the Highly Affected Zone (76%) to the Transition Zone (5%). Ion exchange and redox reaction were the dominant geochemical processes when wastewater entered the aquifer. Carbonate precipitation was also a major process affecting evolution of groundwater quality along groundwater flow paths. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hu, Q; Feng, S; Guo, H; Chen, G; Jiang, T				Hu, Qj; Feng, Song; Guo, Hua; Chen, Guiya; Jiang, Tong			Interactions of the Yangtze river flow and hydrologic processes of the Poyang Lake, China	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Recently available hydrological data from Hukou station at the junction of the Poyang Lake with the Yangtze River along with other data from stations in the Poyang Lake basin have allowed further examination and understanding of the basin effect (basin discharge generated by rainfall) and the Yangtze River blocking effect on variations of the Poyang Lake level and floods at annual to decadal scales. Major results show that the basin effect has played a primary role influencing the level, of Poyang Lake and development of severe floods, white the Yangtze River played a complementary rote of blocking outflows from the take. In most cases, only when the basin effect weakened did the river effect become large, a relationship indicating that the river's blocking effect diminishes when the take level is high from receiving large amount of basin discharge, albeit a few exceptions to this relationship occurred when river flow also was elevated from receiving large rainfall discharges in upstream areas. Moreover, the basin effect has become stronger in the period 1960-2003 in accordance with the increase of warm season rainfall in the Poyang Lake basin. In particular, large increases of the basin's rainfall in the 1990s corresponded to the most severe floods (in 1998, 1995, and 1992) of the last 4 decades. The strong increase of warm season rainfall in the Poyang Lake basin in the 1990s is consistent with the recent southward shift of major warm season rain bands in eastern China. Results of this study provide a utility for improving predictions of the Poyang Lake level and floods, which affect a population of about 10 million. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Impact of Soil Depth and Topography on the Effectiveness of Conservation Practices on Discharge and Soil Loss in the Ethiopian Highlands	LAND												Restoration of degraded landscapes through the implementation of soil and water conservation practices is considered a viable option to increase agricultural production by enhancing ecosystems. However, in the humid Ethiopian highlands, little information is available on the impact of conservation practices despite wide scale implementation. The objective of this research was to document the effect of conservation practices on discharge and sediment concentration and load in watersheds that have different soil depths and topography. Precipitation, discharge, and sediment concentration were measured from 2010 to 2012 in two watersheds in close proximity and located in the Lake Tana basin, Ethiopia: Tikur-Wuha and Guale watersheds. The Tikur-Wuha watershed has deep soils and a gentle slope stream channel. The Guale watershed has shallow soils and a steep slope stream channel. In early 2011, the local community installed upland conservation measures consisting of stone and soil bunds, waterways, cutoff drains, infiltration furrows, gully rehabilitation, and enclosures. The results show that conservation practices marginally decreased direct runoff in both watersheds and increased base flow in the Tikur-Wuha watershed. Average sediment concentration decreased by 81% in Tikur-Wuha and 45% in Guale. The practices intended to increase infiltration were most effective in the Tikur-Wuha watershed because the deep soil could store the infiltrated water and release it over a longer period of time after the rainy season than the steeper Guale watershed with shallow soils.					; Dagnew, Dessalegn/R-6652-2019; Tilahun, Seifu/ABE-2501-2020	steenhuis, tammo/0000-0003-0508-9350; 														2073-445X				DEC	2017	6	4							78	10.3390/land6040078	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land6040078													WOS:000419224200013

Distribution of these communities is one of the most important factors in the variation of the N cycling in warm-monomictic lakes. However, the effects of the alternation of water stratification and mixing periods on the ecology of microbial communities involved in these processes are rarely studied in this type of aquatic ecosystem. We explored vertical and seasonal patterns of picoplankton and the genetic potential for ammonium oxidation (amoA gene for bacteria and archaea), denitrification (nirS and nirK), anammox (hzsA), and DNRA (nrfA) and their relationships with the main limnological variables in Lake Alchichica (Central Mexican Plateau) to provide insight into the distribution and importance of these planktonic communities in warm-monomictic tropical lakes. Ten depths were sampled during late stratification (November 2015) and mixing (February 2016) periods, covering the epilimnion, metalimnion (oxycline), and hypolimnion layers in the first case. We showed that temperature and oxygen stratification shaped the distribution of picoplankton and functional N genes in this lake. These communities also varied in relation to nutrient availability and underwent temporal changes throughout the water column. The amoA genes, along with autotrophic picoplankton, were more abundant during the stratification, indicating that nitrification could be potentially more important during this period, mainly at the oxycline layer. Denitrifying genes showed strong variations during the stratification period, with highest gene copy numbers at the oxycline and hypolimnion layers. Anoxic conditions were characterised by a relative increase in the abundance of the nrfA gene with depth, which was positively correlated with NH4+ concentration. On the other hand, the hzsA gene was not detected in any sample. Our findings highlight the importance of thermal stratification as one of the main factors influencing the genetic potential for N transformations within the water column in warm-monomictic tropical lakes.					; Macek, Miroslav/B-5428-2015; Merino-Ibarra, Martin/KPY-5742-2024; Merino-Ibarra, Martín/KPY-5742-2024; Alcocer, Javier/S-7672-2019; Pajares, Silvia/J-5205-2014	Alcocer, Javier/0000-0002-0535-7936; Macek, Miroslav/0000-0003-0600-3539; Merino-Ibarra, Martin/0000-0002-6690-3101; PAJARES, SILVIA/0000-0002-0864-8659; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2017	62	7					1180	1193		10.1111/fwb.12935	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12935													WOS:000403021500006

In this study, the dissolved organic matter (DOM) quantity and quality in a newly constructed dam reservoir and its tributaries were monitored monthly during the initial impounding period (July to November 2014) using a size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with online organic carbon detector (OCD). The highest values were observed in the month of August with the highest precipitation for the bulk dissolved organic carbon (DOC), specific UV absorbance (SUVA), and most of the assigned size fractions (except for biopolymers) in the tributaries, indicating that allochthonous sources of DOM were dominant in the feeding stream waters of the reservoir. The bulk DOC and high molecular weight humic substance fraction (similar to 1 kDa) were generally co-varied with the monthly precipitation in the tributaries, while building blocks (350-500 Da), and low molecular weight (LMW) acids and neutrals showed different trends. In a dam site, the smaller molecular fractions became more abundant during the dry season (September to November), presumably due to the in-reservoir processes such as photo- and bio-degradation. Our results also revealed that storms mobilized a large amount of highly aromatic soil-derived DOM to the reservoir. A depth profile at the dam site showed the water is well mixed up to a depth of similar to 20 m. The SEC-OCD data coupled with non-metric multidimensional scaling provided a clear visualization of the spatiotemporal variations in DOM composition, which shed new light on the DOM composition formed in a newly constructed dam reservoir and also on the strategies for future water treatment options.

Hydroclimatic Controls on Salt Fluxes and Halite Deposition in the Dead Sea and the Shaping of "Salt Giants"	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												As the only deep hypersaline, halite-precipitating lake on Earth today, the Dead Sea is the single modern analog for investigating the mechanisms by which large-scale and thick salt deposits, known as "salt giants", have accreted in the geological record. We directly measure the hydroclimatic forcing and the physical limnologic processes leading to halite sedimentation, the vertical thermohaline structure, and salt fluxes in the Dead Sea. We demonstrate that changes in these forcing lead to strong seasonal and regional variations in the stratification stability ratio, triggering corresponding spatiotemporal variations in thermohaline staircase formation and diapycnal salt flux, and finally control the thickness of the halite layer deposited. The observed staircase formation is consistent with the mean-field gamma instability, causing layering in double-diffusive convection. We show that double diffusion and thermohaline staircase formation drive the spatial variability of halite deposition in hypersaline water bodies, underlying and shaping "salt giants" basin architecture.

Dissolved organic matter composition and reactivity in Lake Victoria, the world's largest tropical lake	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We report a data set of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition (stable carbon isotope signatures, absorption and fluorescence properties) obtained from samples collected in Lake Victoria, a large lake in East Africa. Samples were collected in 2018-2019 along a bathymetric gradient (bays to open waters), during three contrasting seasons: long rainy, short rainy and dry, which corresponded to distinctly water column mixing regimes, respectively, stratified, semi-stratified and mixed regimes. Eight DOM components from parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) were identified based on three-dimensional excitation-emission matrices (EEMs), which were aggregated into three main groups of components (microbial humic-like, terrestrial humic-like, proteinlike). Spatially, the more productive bays were characterized by higher DOM concentration than deeper more offshore waters (fluorescence intensity and DOC were similar to 80% and similar to 30% higher in bays, respectively). Seasonally, the DOM pool shifted from protein-like components during the mixed regime to microbial humic-like components during the semistratified regime and to terrestrial humic-like components during the stratified regime. This indicates that pulses of autochthonous DOM derived from phytoplankton occurred when the lake was mixing, which increased the availability of dissolved inorganic nutrients. Subsequently, this freshly produced autochthonous DOM was microbially processed during the following semi-stratified regime. In the open waters, during the stratified regime, only terrestrial refractory DOM components remained because the labile and fresh stock of DOM created during the preceding mixed season was consumed. In the bays, the high terrestrial refractory DOM during the stratified regime may be additionally due to the allochthonous DOM input from the runoff. At the scale of the whole lake, the background refractory DOM probably comes mainly from precipitation and followed by river inputs.

M.; Steele, Owen; Gloutney, Mark			Species-Habitat Relationships and Priority Areas for Marsh-Breeding Birds in Ontario	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Populations of marsh-breeding birds have declined throughout the southern Laurentian Great Lakes basin. To advance conservation of these species, we used occupancy modeling, a regional prioritization scheme, and data from Birds Canada's Great Lakes Marsh Monitoring Program (2016-2018) to describe species-habitat relationships and identify priority habitat areas for 7 obligate marsh-breeding bird species in southern Ontario, Canada: American bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), common gallinule (Gallinula galeata), least bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), marsh wren (Cistothorus palustris), pied-billed grebe (Podilymbus podiceps), sora (Porzana carolina), and Virginia rail (Rallus limicola). Given these species respond to land cover at widely varying spatial scales, we initially identified the most informative scale (buffer = 100 m, 200 m, 400 m, 800 m, 1,600 m, 3,200 m, or 6,400 m) for marsh, urban, agricultural, and forest cover to increase model performance. We also considered climate variables, whether sample sites were along a Great Lakes coastline or inland, and covariates influencing detection. Occupancy was best explained by land cover at a wide range of spatial scales depending on the species. All species except Virginia rail responded positively to marsh cover; American bittern and Virginia rail responded negatively to urban cover; least bittern, pied-billed grebe, and Virginia rail responded negatively and sora responded positively to agricultural cover; and American bittern, common gallinule, marsh wren, and pied-billed grebe responded negatively and Virginia rail responded positively to forest cover. Only American bittern responded negatively to mean May-June temperature; only pied-billed grebe responded positively to start of growing season; and only Virginia rail had higher occupancy at inland marshes compared to coastal. We combined predictions from the best model for each of 5 species with reasonably good model fit (we excluded sora and Virginia rail) to identify priority habitat areas for marsh-breeding birds. Expansion of wetland conservation work from existing priority areas based on waterfowl to also include these new additional priority areas based on marsh-breeding birds will be an important step towards conservation of all birds, and will help slow or maybe even reverse declining population trends. Some restoration activities outside but adjacent to priority areas will also be important for rebuilding marshes for these species across this intensively farmed and developed region.

J	He, Y; Wang, XY; Xu, FL				He, Yong; Wang, Xiangyu; Xu, Fuliu			How reliable is chlorophyll-a as algae proxy in lake environments? New insights from the perspective of n-alkanes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Chlorophyll -a (Chl-a) has been employed as the golden proxy of algae biomass and algae cell densities in lake environments for many years. However, how reliable Chl-a is as algae proxy in lake environments needs further evaluation. Here, we take the eutrophic Lake Chaohu and 46 lakes and reservoirs across China as objects on temporal and spatial scales, respectively, to resolve this issue from the perspective of n-alkanes. Our results showed that Chl-a ranged from 10.5 to 735 mu g.L-1 with a geometric mean of 92.4 mu g.L-1 in Lake Chaohu. There were no statistically significant correlations between Chl-a and algae cell densities in all seasons (Pearson's correlation, p > 0.05), and also for macrophytes and terrestrial plants input (p > 0.05). It was related to the complex changes of environmental factors. By contrast, Chl-a ranged from 7.1 to 1608 mu g.L-1 with a geometric mean of 125 mu g.L-1 in nationwide lakes and reservoirs, and its occurrence was not only related to algae, but also associated with macrophytes and terrestrial plants (p < 0.05). In summary, Chl-a can be applied as an algae proxy, but its application is subject to certain restrictions. Besides, the multiple sources of Chl-a in lake environments may result in an overestimation of algae cell densities. Compared to Chl-a, biogenic n-heptadecane (bio C17) could be regarded as a potential alternative. Hence, we compared the advantages and disadvantages of bio C17 and Chl-a in the aspects of specificity, accuracy, sensitivity and applicability. We found that for most scenarios, their limitations could be surmounted by each other, but failed in some scenarios. Accordingly, an ensemble proxy system may be used for more reliable representation of algae in lake environments.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				AUG 25	2022	836								155700	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155700	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155700		MAY 2022						35523340					WOS:000806244500004

CO2 fluxes from mariculture ponds with swimming crabs, kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) (CS) and mariculture ponds with swimming crabs, kuruma shrimp and razor clams (with different clam densities from low to high, CSB1, CSB2, CSB3, respectively) were measured during the farming season. The CO2 fluxes of CS, CSB1, CSB2, and CSB3 were -25.37,-30.23,-28.81 and -12.18 mg m(-2) h(-1), respectively. All the ponds acted as CO2 sinks across the water-air interface. Our results showed that water pH was a good indicator of the CO2 flux, and a pH value of 8.24 was the critical value dividing the dataset into influxes or effluxes in the mariculture ponds. Net primary production was also significantly correlated with the CO2 flux and is considered a key driver regulating the CO2 flux. Our findings indicate that the low clam stocking density used in this study could enhance the CO2 sink across the water-air interface by promoting phytoplankton biomass and net primary production, whereas the CO2 sink may be weakened with an increase in clam density due to a decline in phytoplankton biomass and net primary production.

J	Zhang, CX; Wang, LL; Zhu, H; Tang, HW				Zhang, Chengxiao; Wang, Lingling; Zhu, Hai; Tang, Hongwu			Integrated hydrodynamic model for simulation of river-lake-sluice interactions	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING												In this paper, an integrated model for simulating the hydrodynamic process of river-lake-sluice (RLS) systems is presented. It includes a novel one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) coupling method called the coupling-zone iteration-correction (CZIC) method, and an improved numerical algorithm for the sluice problem. The 1D river-network model and the 2D lake model are coupled by establishing a coupling region, and iterative correction is carried out to ensure the accurate transfer of hydraulic parameters. The convergence conditions of the CZIC method are discussed theoretically, and the proper spatial step of the coupling zone is adopted according to different inflow conditions to ensure stable computation. In order to deal with the transition of flow regimes during the gate operation, a method for calculating the discharge capacity is presented. In addition, a general difference coefficient of the river reach is deduced for hydrodynamic calculation with sluices included. Simulations on open channels demonstrate that (1) simulated values of the CZIC method are consistent with the results of the full 2D model; (2) the sluice solving algorithm can stably handle the flow transition between the orifice flow and weir flow. Furthermore, the developed integrated model is applied to the middle and lower reaches of the Huaihe River, including the Hongze Lake and fifteen sluices. Numerical simulation results reproduced the hydrodynamic process during the flood season of 2007 accurately and efficiently. The errors of the present model are also compared with that of the MIKE model, and the results show that the proposed methods perform better than MIKE, especially in rising and flood periods. Therefore, it seems likely that the developed integrated model will work well in hydrodynamic modelling of large-scale complex RLS systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Tiberghien, D				Tiberghien, Denis			Adrien Rist (1841-1923), member of ''Societe Medico-Psychologique'' (1881) and founder of a private health for insane in Versaille : ''La Chataigneraie'' (1889) (Partie I)	ANNALES MEDICO-PSYCHOLOGIQUES												Professor Edouard Rist (1871-1956), a former president of the Academy of Medicine (1948), wrote an unpublished text entitled "His Memories". This text allows us to sketch the portrait of his father: Adrien Rist (1841-1923) and to review the professional career of this alienist doctor who always had a deep sense of loyalty and attachment to France and its culture. Coming from a family of surgeons, his grandfather Jean-Louis Rist (1769-1839) was a surgeon of the Grande-Armee like his uncle Come Damien Rist (1760-1826) and their father Jean Nepomucene Sebastien Rist (1725-1798) was too a surgeon in Wissembourg. It was under the July Monarchy that A. Rist (1841-1923) was born in Strasbourg. Raised in a Protestant family, he enrolled at the Military Health Service School in Strasbourg. He left the school after one year to enroll in the medical school of the same city. However, he finished his medical study in Paris. After his externship, he was accepted as an intern on December 26, 1864. Five years later (1869), he was a doctor of medicine and became the first one to make known in France the psychophysical law of Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-1887), which bridges the gap between psychology and the exact sciences. Then, he returned to Strasbourg where he opened a medical practice and started to prepare for the aggregation in physics at the University of Gottingen (Germany). He stayed there long enough to fall in love with Emma Cornelia Gess (1848-1928), a native of Wurttemberg, to whom he married on April 5, 1870. Three months after his marriage, the war with Prussia broke out. During the conflict, his wife gave birth in Strasbourg to a boy named Edouard (1871-1956). Thus, his new family life and the Franco-Prussian war and its outcome deterred him from passing the aggregation. But also, A. Rist chooses to leave Alsace so as not to renounce his French nationality. After a brief stay in Le Havre (Normandy), he decided to expatriate to Switzerland. In order to be able to practice in this country, A. Rist passed the examinations in the canton of Vaud where he provided an important memorandum on the legislation of insane persons. In 1867, the Champ de l'Air Hospital for the insane was transferred to the Bois-de-Cery located near Lausanne where six years later (1873) a new hospital called "Asile de Cery"was inaugurated. Authorized to practice in Switzerland, A. Rist became in 1873 the first doctor-director of the Bois-de-Cery. A few years earlier, the first private psychiatric clinic in Romanisch Switzerland opened: La Metairie. In 1877, he became the director of this establishment located not far from the previous one at about forty kilometers away still on the banks of Lake Geneva. Board of Directors of this private establishment composed of a majority of Geneva bankers was able to receive about forty patients of well-to-do condition who came from all over the world. A. Rist lived there with his family and the organization at La Metairie was based on the participation of the insane in the family life of the doctor. A. Rist's children (Edouard, Charles, Elisabeth and Eve) founded the "Children's Society" which aimed to give concerts and theatrical performances to the patients of La Metairie. Also, they contributed when patients ran away. At the Metairie, A. Rist received the visit of Alexandrovitch Herzen (1839-1906) who was a professor of physiology at the medical faculty of Lausanne (1881) and whose father, Alexander Ivanovich Herzen (1812-1870) was the father of Russian populist socialism. However, the separation from his children who were studying in France and the tragic death of his daughter Elisabeth at the age of 17 were two factors that led to his return to France. In 1889, A. Rist and his wife decided to leave La Metairie. Rudolf Friedreich Fetscherin (1829-1892), a former assistant physician at the Waldau (Bern; 1859) succeeded him. A. Rist moved to Versailles near Paris where he opened a nursing home at 11 rue des Deux-Moulins: La Chataigneraie. (C) 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The dependence of synchrony on timescale and geography in freshwater plankton	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Spatial synchrony is defined by related fluctuations through time in population abundances measured at different locations. The degree of relatedness typically declines with increasing distance between sampling locations. Standard approaches for assessing synchrony assume isotropy in space and uniformity across timescales of analysis, but it is now known that spatial variability and timescale structure in population dynamics are common features. We tested for spatial and timescale structure in the patterns of synchrony of freshwater plankton in Kentucky Lake, U.S.A. We also evaluated whether different mechanisms may drive synchrony and its spatial structure on different timescales. Using wavelet techniques and matrix regression, we analyzed phytoplankton biomass and abundances of seven zooplankton taxa at 16 locations sampled from 1990 to 2015. We found that zooplankton abundances and phytoplankton biomass exhibited synchrony at multiple timescales. Timescale structure in the potential mechanisms of synchrony was revealed primarily through networks of relationships among zooplankton taxa, which differed by timescale. We found substantial interspecific variability in geographic structures of synchrony and their causes: all mechanisms we considered strongly explained geographic structure in synchrony for at least one species, while Euclidean distance between sampling locations was generally less well supported than more mechanistic explanations. Geographic structure in synchrony and its underlying mechanisms also depended on timescale for a minority of the taxa tested. Overall, our results show substantial and complex but interpretable variation in structures of synchrony across three variables: space, timescale, and taxon. It seems likely these aspects of synchrony are important general features of freshwater systems.					; Sheppard, Lawrence/KFB-7678-2024	Walter, Jonathan/0000-0003-2983-751X; Sheppard, Lawrence/0000-0002-9032-2059; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2019	64	2					483	502		10.1002/lno.11054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.11054													WOS:000461865500005
J	Fiori, AM; Foroni, I				Fiori, Anna Maria; Foroni, Ilaria			Reservation Forecasting Models for Hospitality SMEs with a View to Enhance Their Economic Sustainability	SUSTAINABILITY												In many tourism destinations, sustainability of the local economy leans on small and medium-sized hotels that are individually owned and operated by members of the community. Suffering from seasonality more than their big competitors, these hotels should undertake marketing initiatives to counteract wide demand fluctuations. Such initiatives are most effective if based on accurate occupancy forecasts, which must be performed at the individual hotel level. In this aim, the present paper suggests a demand forecasting approach adapted to specific features that characterize reservation data for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the hospitality sector. The proposed framework integrates historical and advanced booking methods into a forecast combination with time-varying, performance-based weights. Whereas historical methods use only past observations about the number of guests recorded on a particular stay night to forecast future room occupancy (long-term perspective), advanced booking methods predict bookings-to-come based on partially accumulated data from reservations on hand (short-term perspective). In order to provide a possible solution to data sparsity issues that affect the application of advanced booking models to hospitality SMEs, a procedure that incorporates length-of-stay information directly into the reservation processing phase is also introduced. The methodology is tested on real time series of reservation data from three Italian hotels, located either in a city center (Milan) or in a typical destination for seasonal holidays (Lake Maggiore). Model parameters are calibrated on a training dataset and the accuracy of the occupancy forecasts is evaluated on a holdout sample. The results validate earlier findings about combinations of long-term and short-term forecasts and, in addition, show that using performance-based weights improves the quality of forecasts. Reducing the risk of large forecast failures, the proposed methodology can indeed have practical implications for the design and implementation of effective demand-side policies in hospitality SMEs. These policies are expected to provide a competitive advantage that can be crucial to the sustainability of small establishments in a context of growing global tourism.

Palaeogeography of tropical seasonal coastal wetlands in northern Britain during the early Mississippian Romer's Gap	EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH												The lower Mississippian Ballagan Formation of northern Britain is one of only two successions worldwide to yield the earliest known tetrapods with terrestrial capability following the end-Devonian mass extinction event. Studies of the sedimentary environments and habitats in which these beasts lived have been an integral part of a major research project into how, why and under what circumstances this profound step in the evolution of life on Earth occurred. Here, a new palaeogeographic map is constructed from outcrop data integrated with new and archived borehole material. The map shows the extent of a very low-relief coastal wetland developed along the tropical southern continental margin of Laurussia. Coastal floodplains in the Midland Valley and Tweed basins were separated from the marginal marine seaway of the Northumberland-Solway Basin to the south by an archipelago of more elevated areas. A complex mosaic of sedimentary environments was juxtaposed, and included fresh and brackish to saline and hypersaline lakes, a diverse suite of floodplain palaeosols and a persistent fluvial system in the east of the region. The strongly seasonal climate led to the formation of evaporite deposits alternating with flooding events, both meteoric and marine. Storm surges drove marine floods from the SW into both the western Midland Valley and Northumberland-Solway Basin; marine water also flooded into the Tweed Basin and Tayside in the east. The Ballagan Formation is a rare example in the geological record of a tropical, seasonal coastal wetland that contains abundant, small-scale evaporite deposits. The diverse sedimentary environments and palaeosol types indicate a network of different terrestrial and aquatic habitats in which the tetrapods lived.					; Davies, Sarah/ITT-3963-2023	Millward, David/0000-0001-5234-4735; 													1755-6910	1755-6929				MAR	2019	109	1-2			SI		279	300	PII S1755691018000737	10.1017/S1755691018000737	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1755691018000737													WOS:000512150800018

Multiple Remotely Sensed Lines of Evidence for a Depleting Seasonal Snowpack in the Near East	REMOTE SENSING												The snow-fed river basins of the Near East region are facing an urgent threat in the form of declining water resources. In this study, we analyzed several remote sensing products (optical, passive microwave, and gravimetric) and outputs of a meteorological reanalysis data set to understand the relationship between the terrestrial water storage anomalies and the mountain snowpack. The results from different satellite retrievals show a clear signal of a depletion of both water storage and the seasonal snowpack in four basins in the region. We find a strong reduction in terrestrial water storage over the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observational period, particularly over the higher elevations. Snow-cover duration estimates from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products point towards negative and significant trends up to one month per decade in the current era. These numbers are a clear indicator of the partial disappearance of the seasonal snow-cover in the region which has been projected to occur by the end of the century. The spatial patterns of changes in the snow-cover duration are positively correlated with both GRACE terrestrial water storage decline and peak snow water equivalent (SWE) depletion from the ERA5 reanalysis. Possible drivers of the snowpack depletion are a significant reduction in the snowfall ratio and an earlier snowmelt. A continued depletion of the montane snowpack in the Near East paints a bleak picture for future water availability in this water-stressed region.					; Aalstad, Kristoffer/ABA-6167-2020; Sen, Omer/K-7734-2018; Yılmaz, Yeliz/ABE-8053-2020	SEN, OMER LUTFI/0000-0002-8186-8594; Yilmaz, Yeliz A./0000-0001-7937-5056; Aalstad, Kristoffer/0000-0002-2475-3731														2072-4292				MAR 1	2019	11	5							483	10.3390/rs11050483	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11050483													WOS:000462544500011

Using long-term monthly to seasonally data (1997-2014), we investigated the spatial and temporal variations in nitrogen in Dongting Lake, the second largest freshwater lake in China. The average concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) in the eastern, southern, and western parts of the lake were 1.77, 1.56, and 1.35 mg/L, respectively, in 2014. TN pollution was generally worse in the southern area than in the western area. Concentrations showed temporal variation, and were significantly higher during the dry season than during the wet season. Based on the concentration and growth rate of TN, three different stages were identified in the long term lake data, from 1997 to 2002, from 2003 to 2008, and from 2009 to 2014, during which the concentrations and the growth rate ranged from 1.09-1.51 mg/L and 22.09%-40.03%, 1.05-1.57 mg/L and -9.05%-7.74%, and 1.68-2.02 mg/L and 57.99%-60.41%, respectively. The main controls on the lake water TN concentrations were the quality and quantity of the lake inflows, spatial and temporal variations in hydrodynamic conditions within the lake (flow velocity, flow direction), and point and nonpoint inputs from human activities.

Part of DOC is optically inactive. Therefore, lake DOC content cannot be mapped directly. The objectives of the current study were to estimate the relationships of DOC and other water and environmental variables in order to find the best proxy for remote sensing mapping of lake DOC. The Boosted Regression Trees approach was used to clarify in which relative proportions different water and environmental variables determine DOC. In a studied large and shallow eutrophic lake the concentrations of DOC and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were rather high while the seasonal and interannual variability of DOC concentrations was small. The relationships between DOC and other water and environmental variables varied seasonally and inter annually and it was challenging to find proxies for describing seasonal cycle of DOC. Chlorophyll a (Chl a), total suspended matter and Secchi depth were correlated with DOC and therefore are possible proxies for remote sensing of seasonal changes of DOC in ice free period, while for long term interannual changes transparency-related variables are relevant as DOC proxies. CDOM did not appear to be a good predictor of the seasonality of DOC concentration in Lake Vortsjarv since the CDOM DOC coupling varied seasonally. However, combining the data from Vortsjarv with the published data from six other eutrophic lakes in the world showed that CDOM was the most powerful predictor of DOC and can be used in remote sensing of DOC concentrations in eutrophic lakes.

Nevertheless, we documented, in this study, an unusual occurrence of the eelgrass Zostera marina L in north China, with biomass markedly higher than other temperate areas in the world. Seasonal changes in biometric variables and the biomass of Z. marina were examined in a shallow marine lagoon of Swan Lake, an important nature reserve for swans (Cygnus cygnus). Results showed that shoot height of eelgrass varied seasonally, with maximum values (>170 cm) being recorded in June 2009 and minimum values (<25 cm) in January-March 2010. The highest shoot density was recorded in August 2009 (645 shoots m(-2)) and the lowest in March 2010 (334 shoots m(-2)). Eelgrass biomass also varied seasonally, from >1000 g DW m(-2) in August 2009 to <100 gDW m(-2) in March 2010. Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus content in different parts of eelgrass also varied seasonally. The N and P contents in rhizomes were significantly lower than that in leaves and leaf sheaths. Annual average C/N ratios in leaves, leaf sheaths, and rhizomes were 14.99 +/- 2.97, 13.31 +/- 4.59, and 18.50 +/- 4.99, respectively; and annual average C/P ratios were 248.82 +/- 81.7, 199.8 +/- 87.5, and 289.2 +/- 95.1, respectively; the abovementioned deviations suggest P enrichment of eelgrass in the lagoon, compared with the global range for the species. Water temperature is the most important environmental factor that impacts the seasonal variation in this species. The increased distribution area and high productivity of Z. marina were mostly attributed to local conservation efforts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Surface and subsurface flow effect on permanent gully formation and upland erosion near Lake Tana in the northern highlands of Ethiopia	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Gully formation in the Ethiopian Highlands has been identified as a major source of sediment in water bodies, and results in sever land degradation. Loss of soil from gully erosion reduces agricultural productivity and grazing land availability, and is one of the major causes of reservoir siltation in the Nile Basin. This study was conducted in the 523 ha Debre-Mawi watershed south of Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, where gullies are actively forming in the landscape. Historic gully development in a section of the Debre-Mawi watershed was estimated with semi structured farmer interviews, remotely sensed imagery, and measurements of current gully volumes. Gully formation was assessed by instrumenting the gully and surrounding area to measure water table levels and soil physical properties. Gully formation began in the late 1980's following the removal of indigenous vegetation, leading to an increase in surface and subsurface runoff from the hillsides. A comparison of the gully area, estimated from a 0.58 m resolution QuickBird image, with the current gully area mapped with a GPS, indicated that the total eroded area of the gully increased from 0.65 ha in 2005 to 1.0 ha in 2007 and 1.43 ha in 2008. The gully erosion rate, calculated from cross-sectional transect measurements, between 2007 and 2008 was 530 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in the 17.4 ha area contributing to the gully, equivalent to over 4 cm soil loss over the contributing area. As a comparison, we also measured rill and interrill erosion rates in a nearby section of the watershed, gully erosion rates were approximately 20 times the measured rill and interrill rates. Depths to the water table measured with piezometers showed that in the actively eroding sections of the gully the water table was above the gully bottom and, in stable gully sections the water table was below the gully bottom during the rainy season. The elevated water table appears to facilitate the slumping of gully walls, which causes the gully to widen and to migrate up the hillside.

This methodology involves the use of a wavelet-based filter to interpolate missing information and reduce the noise component in the time-series data, as proposed in a previous study. The smoothed time profiles of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVT), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), and the Difference Value between EVI and LSWI (DVEL) are obtained from MOD09 8-day composite time-series data (resolution: 500 m; time period: 2000-2005). The proposed algorithm was applied to produce time-series inundation maps (WFFI products) for the five annual flood seasons over the period from 2000 to 2004. The WFFI products were validated via comparisons with Landsat-derived results and inundation maps based on RADARSAT images, hydrological data, and digital elevation model data. Compared with the RADARSAT-derived inundation maps at the province level, the obtained RMSE range from 364 to 443 km(2) and the determination coefficients [R-2] range from 0.89 to 0.92. Compared with Landsat-derived results at the 10-km grid level, the obtained RMSE range from 6.8 to 15.2 km(2) and the determination coefficients [R-2] range from 0.77 to 0.97. The inundated area of flooded forests/marsh to the northeast of Tonle Sap Lake were underestimated, probably because of extensive vegetation cover in this area. The spatial characteristics of the estimated start dates, end dates, and duration of inundation cycles were also determined for the period from 2000 to 2004. There are clear contrasts in the distribution of the estimated end dates and duration of inundation cycles between large-scale floods (2000-2002) and medium- and small-scale floods (2003 and 2004). At the regional scale, the estimated start dates for the southern part of An Giang Province during 2003 and 2004 was distinctly later than that for surrounding areas. The results indicate that these triple-cropping areas enclosed by dikes increased in extent from 2003 to 2004. In contrast, the estimated end dates of inundation at the Co Do and Song Hart State Farms were clearly earlier than those for surrounding areas, although the estimated start dates were similar. Temporal changes in the inundation area of Flood pixels in the Dong Thap and Long An Provinces are in excellent agreement with daily water-level data recorded at Tan Chan Station. The estimated area of Long-term water body increased in size from 2000 to 2004, especially in coastal areas of the Ca Mau and Bac Lieu Provinces. Statistical data for Vietnam indicate that this trend may reflect the expansion of shrimp-farming areas. The WFFI products enable an understanding of seasonal and annual changes in the water distribution and environment of the Cambodia and the VMD from a global viewpoint. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Rapid socioeconomic development in the country affects farmers' management practices, and rice production has increased almost three-fold over two decades. However, detailed information about the recent changes in rice production is quite limited and mainly obtained from interviews and statistical data. Here, we analyzed MODIS LAI data (MCD152H) from 2003 to 2019 to quantify rice production changes in Pursat Province, one of the great rice-producing areas in Cambodia. Although the LAI showed large variations, the data clearly indicate that a major shift occurred in approximately 2010 after applying smoothing methods (i.e., hierarchical clustering and the moving average). This finding is consistent with the results of the interviews with the farmers, which indicate that earlier-maturing cultivars had been adopted. Geographical variations in the LAI pattern were illustrated at points analyzed along a transverse line from the mountainside to the lakeside. Furthermore, areas of dry season cropping were detected by the difference in monthly averaged MODIS LAI data between January and April, which was defined as the dry season rice index (DSRI) in this study. Consequently, three different types of dry season cropping areas were recognized by nonhierarchical clustering of the annual LAI transition. One of the cropping types involved an irrigation-water-receiving area supported by canal construction. The analysis of the peak LAI in the wet and dry seasons suggested that the increase in rice production was different among cropping types and that the stagnation of the improvements and the limitation of water resources are anticipated. This study provides valuable information about differences and changes in rice cropping to construct sustainable and further-improved rice production strategies.					; Iwahashi, Yu/GON-6463-2022; Hor, Sanara/AAU-1137-2021; Homma, Koki/AAH-7992-2019	Iwahashi, Yu/0000-0002-1291-6329; Homma, Koki/0000-0002-6285-6635; Hor, Sanara/0000-0001-8801-6805														2072-4292				MAY	2021	13	10							1971	10.3390/rs13101971	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13101971													WOS:000662568400001
J	Kallio, M; Kummu, M				Kallio, Marko; Kummu, Matti			Comment on 'Changes of inundation area and water turbidity of Tonle Sap Lake: responses to climate changes or upstream dam construction?'	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Recent hydropower development in the Mekong River has triggered a lot of discussion about its impact on flood dynamics along the river, as well as in one of the world's most productive lake-floodplain systems-the Tonle Sap Lake. A recent article by Wang et al (2020 Environ. Res. Lett. 15 0940a1) in this journal conclude that changes in precipitation have played a much larger role than the operation of hydropower dams, contradicting existing research. However, we argue that by using an annual mean discharge and inundation area Wang et al (2020 Environ. Res. Lett. 15 0940a1) ignore the fundamentals of the system: the difference between dry season water level and peak water level, and thus the extent of the flooded area, which is the key function of the flood pulse. Further, by using annual mean discharge authors are not able to capture the actual operation of hydropower dams, and thus their impacts. Hydropower dams consume very little water through evaporation, but shift the flow regime from wet to dry season. We show here that when taking into account the characteristics of the system, and analysing changes from anthropogenic impacts on low and high flows separately, dams play a central role in recent changes in the flood characteristics of the Mekong.					; Kummu, Matti/C-4797-2011	Kallio, Marko/0000-0002-6917-7790; Kummu, Matti/0000-0001-5096-0163													1748-9326					MAY	2021	16	5							058001	10.1088/1748-9326/abf3da	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abf3da													WOS:000649944000001

Denitrification in lake sediments can alleviate the effects of eutrophication through removal of N to the atmosphere as N2O and N-2. However, N2O contributes to the greenhouse effect and global warming. In this study, we measured three denitrification parameters (i.e., potential denitrification rate, unamended denitrification rate and net N2O production rate) in surface sediments which were collected from 7 sub-lakes of the Lake Donghu, one of the most eutrophic lakes in China. The results showed that a range of water quality and sediment characteristics (e.g., total N and total phosphorus) varied significantly among sub-lakes. The unamended denitrification rate varied between 0.51 and 26.0 ngN g(-1) h(-1), while the N2O production rate ranged from less than 0 to 1.68 ng N g(-1)h(-1). However, there was no significant difference among the sub-lakes in these denitrification parameters. The unamended denitrification rate was positively related to the water NO3 concentration and sediment moisture and bulk density. The findings of the present study suggest that sediments in eutrophic lakes can remove large quantities of N through denitrification and may become a significant source of N2O if the N input is maintained or to increase.

At the four studied sites, the thickness and mean annual temperature of permafrost are different. The temperatures at the top of permafrost (TTOP), i.e., the maximum depth(s) of seasonal frost and/or thaw penetration, are -1.9 A degrees C at the Chalaping site (CLP), -0.9 A degrees C at the site on the southern bank of the Zhaling Lake (ZLH), -0.4 A degrees C at the Maduo Town site (MDX), and 1.1 A degrees C at the site on the northern bank of the Eling Lake (ELH). Differences in the mean annual ground temperature of permafrost and TTOPs may be responsible for the differentiations in the freeze-thaw processes of soils in the active layer. With rising TTOPs, the ground thawing started earlier: CLP in early June, ZLH in late May, MDX in early May, and ELH in mid-April, while the freezing began later: CLP in early October, ZLH in early to mid-October, MDX in mid-October, and ELH in the mid- to late October. With increasing TTOPs, the freeze-up periods for permafrost sites were shortened: 202 days at CLP, 130 days at ZLH, 100 days at MDX, and the period of complete thaw was 89 days at ELH. At the CLP and ZLH sites, the two-directional ground freezing (downwards from ground surfaces and upwards from the permafrost table) and thawing finished in the same year, but the ground freezing at the MDX continued to the end of the next January, with very slow freezing rates in the end. At the ELH site, ground freezing kept on until early May when thawing began on the surface, and upward and downward thawing became increasingly stable in late June to early July. At each site, with rising TTOPs, the downward freezing accelerated in comparison with the upward freezing, and with an increasing proportion of downward frozen depth, and with the larger ratios of freezing to thawing duration. In summary, the patterns of thawing and freezing processes in the active layer in the SAYR differ from those in other parts of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to a noticeable extent.

Concentrations and Yields of Total Hg and MeHg in Large Boreal Rivers Linked to Water and Wetland Coverage in the Watersheds	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Large rivers are major contributors of mercury (Hg) fluxes to the ocean, as they integrate processes of loading and loss occurring at the watershed level. Stream-scale studies have revealed that specific landscape properties, such as wetlands or lakes, are hotspots for Hg and methylmercury (MeHg) loading, sinks and transformation, but we still do not know how they operate at the whole network scale and over large geographic gradients. In this study, we evaluate how landscape metrics are related to riverine concentrations and yields of total Hg and MeHg in 18 large boreal rivers draining watersheds ranging from 44 to 209,453 km(2), distributed along a 650 km latitudinal transect in the James Bay region of Quebec. Our analyses of landscape metrics using elastic net models and mixed models reinforce the role of wetlands as sources of MeHg, but further show that surface coverage of water in the watershed is the major driver of both Hg and MeHg concentrations and fluxes at the whole network scale. Our findings also demonstrate that seasonality modulates the relationship between landscape properties and Hg forms. Based on hydrologic data, we additionally estimate annual fluxes for the whole Eastern James Bay to 441 kg Hg and 14.6 kg MeHg, and average landscape yield to 1.24 g Hg km(-2) y(-1) and 0.041 g MeHg km(-2) y(-1). Our study provides tools to broadly predict riverine Hg concentrations and fluxes with only a few easily accessible landscape metrics, which were shown to be better predictors than physico-chemical variables.					del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019; Lapierre, Jean-Francois/F-1838-2010; Amyot, Marc/A-7182-2008	del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; Fink-Mercier, Caroline/0000-0003-4195-2991; Amyot, Marc/0000-0002-0340-3249; Lapierre, Jean-Francois/0000-0001-5862-7955													2169-8953	2169-8961				MAY	2022	127	5							e2022JG006892	10.1029/2022JG006892	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JG006892													WOS:000800181100001

Reduced idling has been found to be an effective policy tool for improving air quality, especially around schools, where it may also improve outcomes for asthmatic children. We studied two anti-idling campaigns in Salt Lake County, Utah to understand if reduced engine idling leads to behavioral change and subsequent reduction in traffic-related air pollution exposure of the related school. We found a 38% decrease in idling time following an anti-idling campaign and an 11% decrease in the number of vehicles idling at the school drop-off zones. The air quality measurements showed improvement in the middle of the campaign, but seasonal variability as well as atmospheric inversion events had substantial effects on overall ambient pollutant concentrations. This study provides an encouraging starting point to develop more effective anti-idling campaigns to protect the health of children, school staff, and the surrounding community.

Their relationship can assist in land-use management and improve land-use efficiency. In this study, a water quality survey of rivers and lakes was performed in 2020 to analyze the effects of land use and the landscape pattern on the water quality of the rivers and lakes in the Baoan Lake basin and is expected to provide a reference for land use planning. The results demonstrated that the effects of land use on water quality were generally higher during the dry season than during the wet season; however, the opposite was demonstrated for the landscape pattern index. Cropland and urban land were closely correlated with deteriorating water quality, with contributions to total nitrogen, total phosphorous, and ammonia nitrogen in the basin. The impact of the landscape pattern of the basin on water quality was controlled by the original land-use type. In addition, the landscape configuration formed different land-use types to produce different effects on water quality.

Annual average fluxes of global deposition, discriminating insoluble (3,5-20,7 g m(-2) year(-1)) and soluble-inorganic (7,1-45,5 g m(-2) year(-1)) aerosols are discussed, seasonal patterns are regarded, and an attempt to estimate the impact of the main sources is presented. The wide range of atmospheric deposition fluxes (DF) regarding soluble (DFSOL) and insoluble (DFINS) has been investigated taking into consideration the contribution from nearby to long-distance sources, such as African dust, or regional-to-nearby ones, which include agricultural dust in the Ebro Valley, industrial emissions at different parts, urban dust at all cities, or saline dust resuspension from a dissicated lake bed. DFSOL is made up of marine aerosols, prevailing in coastal areas, with few exceptions in the Ebro Valley; nitrogen-species, homogeneously distributed across the network, with few exceptions due to agricultural sources; mineral dust, enhanced in the Ebro Valley owing to regional and agricultural emissions; and phospathe, displaying comparable values to other studies in general, but three hotspots at regional background environments have been identified. DFINS particles followed the aridity pattern, especially where anthropogenic emissions take place. Our estimates indicate that the regional dust to DFINS in the Ebro Valley represented 23-30%, overpassing 50% at intensive agricultural areas. Similarly, urban-metropolitan contributions accounted for 37-45% at the four cities, and 55% at the industrial one. African dust deposition was enhanced in the Central Pyrenees (75-80%) as a result of the magnification of atmospheric washout processes, and in south-eastern Iberia (69%) owing to the higher frequency of dust outbreaks.

The aim of this study was to better understand the epidemiology of pediatric typhoid fever in Cambodia. We accessed routine blood culture data from Angkor Hospital for Children (AHC) in Siem Reap province between 2007 and 2014, and performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) on the isolated bacteria to characterize the S. Typhi population. The resulting phylogenetic information was combined with conventional epidemiological approaches to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of S. Typhi and population-level risk factors for reported disease. During the study period, there were 262 cases of typhoid within a 100 km radius of AHC, with a median patient age of 8.2 years (IQR: 5.1-11.5 years). The majority of infections occurred during the rainy season, and commune incidences as high as 11.36/1,000 in children aged <15 years were observed over the study period. A population-based risk factor analysis found that access to water within households and increasing distance from Tonle Sap Lake were protective. Spatial mapping and WGS provided additional resolution for these findings, and confirmed that proximity to the lake was associated with discrete spatiotemporal disease clusters. We confirmed the dominance of MDR H58 S. Typhi in this population, and found substantial evidence of diversification (at least seven sublineages) within this single lineage. We conclude that there is a substantial burden of pediatric typhoid fever in rural communes in Cambodia. Our data provide a platform for additional population-based typhoid fever studies in this location, and suggest that this would be a suitable setting in which to introduce a school-based vaccination programme with Vi conjugate vaccines.

We use two decades of measurements (January 1993-December 2014) from the TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P)-family satellite altimeters (T/P, Jason-1 and -2) to detect lake level variations at 23 lakes along their repeat ground tracks every 10 days. We employ an optimal processing technique to obtain quality measurements, including outlier detection, averaging and filtering. The lake level accuracies are improved by subwaveform retracking. Jason-1 delivers few measurements after waveform retracking and a cluster classification at most lakes. From January 1993 to December 2014, most lake levels in eastern Tibet rose, while those in western Tibet declined. In Qinghai, lake levels dropped before 2005 and then rose afterwards, coinciding with the measure in 2005 that protects the Qinghai ecosystem (e.g., grassland conservation). The overall pattern of lake level change in the QTP is largely affected by monsoons and lake locations. Most lake levels show clear annual and inter-annual oscillations. Certain lakes show alternating level highs and lows in the same seasons and varying amplitudes of annual oscillations due to lake level changes. We detect a sudden rise of lake level by 7 m caused by floods, varying lake level trends associated with the 199798 El Nino and other factors, and persistently rising and declining lake levels associated with the long-term precipitation trends in the QTP. The T/P-family satellites will continue to monitor lake levels here as long as the sea level monitoring program lasts, collecting a long-term climate record at highlands echoing sea level change.

Comparing ice and temperature simulations by four dynamic lake models in Harp Lake: past performance and future predictions	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Eastern Snow Conference (ESC)	JUN 04-06, 2013	Huntsville, CANADA					The physical dynamics of lake temperature and ice phenology are important in the modelling and management of temperate aquatic ecosystems. One-dimensional hydrothermal lake models have not been well evaluated in terms of how they simulate ice dynamics in particular. We chose four models (Hostetler, Minlake, Simple Ice Model or SIM and General Lake Model) to test and compare their performance modelling water temperature and ice dynamics using 16 years of field data from Harp Lake, an extensively studied inland lake in south-central Ontario. Each model produced satisfactory water temperature profiles over the simulated period, with small differences in the model performance. Model fits for ice phenology and ice thickness were, however, considerably lower than those for water temperature, with Minlake generating the best agreement with observed ice-on and ice-off dates as well as ice thickness, followed by SIM. The responses of lake ice dynamics to future climate scenarios were simulated by running each of the four models for 91 years, from 2010 to 2100. The predicted decrease in ice season length was significantly different among models, varying between 30 and 81 days, with an average of 48 days. Corresponding decreases in ice thickness varied between 0.11 and 0.20 m, averaging 0.17 m. This study demonstrates that uncertainty due to model performance and selection is considerable, and further testing and refinement of hydrothermal lake dynamic models are needed to improve predictive abilities for ice dynamics.

Major findings in a recent multi-lake comparison of data from lakes with long time series revealed: that a new state of equilibrium was typically reached for phosphorus (P) after 10-15 years and for nitrogen (N) after < 5-10 years; that the in-lake Total N:Total P and inorganic N:P ratios increased; that the phytoplankton and fish biomass often decreased; that the percentage of piscivores often increased as did the zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio, the contribution of Daphnia to zooplankton biomass, and cladoceran size. This indicates that enhanced resource and predator control often interact during recovery from eutrophication. So far, focus has been directed at reducing external loading of P. However, one experimental study and cross-system analyses of data from many lakes in north temperate lakes indicate that nitrogen may play a more significant role for abundance and species richness of submerged plants than usually anticipated when total phosphorus is moderate high. According to the alternative states hypothesis we should expect ecological resistance to nutrient loading reduction and P hysteresis. We present results suggesting that the two alternative states are less stable than originally anticipated. How global warming affects the water clarity of shallow lakes is debatable. We suggest that water clarity often will decrease due to either enhanced growth of phytoplankton or, if submerged macrophytes are stimulated, by reduced capacity of these plants to maintain clear-water conditions. The latter is supported by a cross-system comparison of lakes in Florida and Denmark. The proportion of small fish might increase and we might see higher aggregation of fish within the vegetation (leading to loss of zooplankton refuges), more annual fish cohorts, more omnivorous feeding by fish and less specialist piscivory. Moreover, lakes may have prolonged growth seasons with a higher risk of long-lasting algal blooms and at places dense floating plant communities. The effects of global warming need to be taken into consideration by lake managers when setting future targets for critical loading, as these may well have to be adjusted in the future. Finally, we highlight some of the future challenges we see in lake restoration research.

Samples of groundwater, collected under dry and wet conditions in coastal wells of UA, suggest a large degree of variability in both YREE abundance and normalized patterns. Although weathering or water-rock interactions (between the surface/groundwater and rock samples) were predicted to be the most probable source in explaining YREEs in groundwater samples, results to the contrary indicate that the groundwater do not inherit aquifer rock-like YREE signatures in the study area; this might be due to the relative stability of YREEs during the process of water-rock interactions, which suggest that methods based on YREEs can be beneficial in discrimination of water sources. Furthermore, findings demonstrated no significant relationship between Ce/Ce* and salinity (0.08 and 0.05 in wet and dry seasons, respectively), and between Eu/Eu* and salinity (0.1 and -0.04 in wet and dry seasons, respectively). Dissimilarity of patterns of YREEs in rock and water samples reveals YREEs as no conservative tracers in determining the UL saltwater intrusion into coastal groundwater. Therefore, the groundwater YREE concentrations and fractionation patterns in UA warrant controlling by coastal aquifer need to be controlled by other chemical weathering, adsorption, desorption, and solution complexation reactions. Finally, comparison of REE concentration values in groundwater samples with corresponding indicative admissible drinking water concentrations (IAC) demonstrated their suitability for drinking purposes.

Sediment cores were sampled during the dry and wet seasons, and at different locations along the Gambia River in the Kedougou region to evaluate the spatio-temporal trends of Hg distribution related to ASGM activities. The sediment samples were analysed for total mercury and trace element concentrations (Cr, Cu, Zn, Pb, As, and Sc). The results highlight high concentrations of total Hg (reaching up to 9.9 mg kg(-1)) in sediment cores sampled in the vicinity of ASGM operations, with the highest values reported for the dry season. The calculation of the Hg Enrichment Factor (EF) using Sc as refractory element confirms high enrichments around active sites of gold mining being proportional to the density of miners and the duration of mining activities. The Hg spatial distribution reveals a very local contamination and a limited downstream dispersion of the contaminant. The high Hg concentrations obtained at ASGM sites largely exceed the Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) and the Probable effect concentration (PEC) for the Protection of Aquatic Life recommendation. Our results demonstrate that the ASGM activities discharged large amounts of Hg into the Gambia River ecosystem and that the accumulation of Hg in sediments may represent a significant human health risk and a potential source of toxicity for aquatic organisms.

C	Luther, ME; Meyers, SD; Scudder, J			IEEE	Luther, Mark E.; Meyers, Steven D.; Scudder, Jeffrey			Real Time Observations of Oceanographic and Meteorological Parameters for Maritime Transportation: Origins and Novel Applications	OCEANS 2018 MTS/IEEE CHARLESTON					Conference on OCEANS MTS/IEEE Charleston	OCT 22-25, 2018	Charleston, SC	IEEE Charleston				The first NOAA Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System (PORTS (R)) was established in Tampa Bay, Florida, becoming operational in 1991 (https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports/index.shtml?port=tb). In April 2018, the Miami Physical Oceanographic Real-Time System was dedicated as the 30th such system in the US, followed closely by Port Everglades PORTS (R) in June 2018 as the 31st. PORTS (R) collects and disseminates real time meteorological and oceanographic data within major harbors around the US. PORTS (R) data are an essential component for maintaining the safety and efficiency of maritime operations. Before the advent of PORTS (R), knowledge of environmental conditions relevant to ship operations in US harbors was generally limited to wind and precipitation sensors at the local airports and similar shipboard instrumentation. Water levels were inferred from standard tide tables even though surface winds were known to produce significant deviations from predicted values. This incomplete knowledge often led to navigational errors and to accidents. This paper will review the history of PORTS (R) development, highlighting recent advances in sensor technologies and novel uses of PORTS (R) data. On May 9, 1980, the 580 foot, 20,000 ton hulk carrier Summit Venture was approaching a critical turn toward the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Tampa Bay, Florida and was overtaken by a violent, blinding thunderstorm. The ship veered off course and crashed into a main support pier of the bridge, collapsing the southbound span. Thirty-six people in vehicles fell into the water; 35 did not survive. The main ship channel into Tampa Bay port facilities was closed for 6 weeks, causing severe disruption to supplies of fuel and other commodities to the entire central Florida region. In the wake of the disaster, the local maritime community, led by the Tampa Bay Pilots Association and the Tampa Port Authority, petitioned the US Congress for funding to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to improve environmental monitoring capabilities in the bay. Nearly a decade later, the Tampa Bay Oceanography Project (TOP) began in 1990 as part of NOAA's Coastal Ocean Circulation Program (COCP). This included a 15 month study of currents, water levels, water temperatures, salinity, winds, and other meteorological/oceanographic parameters. By the end of the project, TOP had collected the largest number of circulation measurements in one estuary in the 100-year history of COCP. Successful completion of TOP was followed by permanent deployment of real-time telemetered sensors measuring winds, currents, and water levels at critical locations in the bay - the first official NOAA PORTS (R) installation. Since 1991, local operations and maintenance of the system have been directed by the Greater Tampa Bay Marine Advisory Council- PORTS, Inc., a non-profit consortium of maritime interests, through cooperative agreements with the NOAA National Ocean Service Center for Operational Products and Services and the University of South Florida Center for Maritime and Port Studies. The success of TB-PORTS made it a prototype for a national program. Within three years of TB-PORTS becoming operational, San Francisco Bay and Houston/Galveston Bay implemented their own PORTS (R) networks. Today PORTS (R) operates 24 hours a day/7 days a week in 31 locations around the coasts and Great Lakes of the United States and is a component of the Integrated Ocean Observing System national backbone. The local operation and maintenance of PORTS (R) facilities in each port remains funded by local maritime interests under the direction of NOAA/NOS/CO-OPS, who sets operational standards and manages the data quality control and dissemination through the Continuous Operational Real-Time Monitoring System (CORMS). PORTS (R) data are provided to the public through the NOAA website http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/ports.html . A prototype project in Tampa Bay provides PORTS (R) data to pilots aboard ships over the Automatic Identification System (AIS), now required on all commercial vessels over 20 m in length, in collaboration with the US Coast Guard R&D Center. The long time series observations of winds, currents, water levels, and other parameters in Tampa Bay from PORTS (R) has fueled numerous scientific studies on the dynamics of the estuary. New sensor technologies have been incorporated into the PORTS (R) data stream in recent years, including wave height, period, and direction, atmospheric visibility, and most recently, current measurements from sensors mounted on standard US Coast Guard aids to navigation buoys.

J	Yao, X; Wang, SR; Ni, ZK; Jiao, LX				Yao, Xin; Wang, Shengrui; Ni, Zhaokui; Jiao, Lixin			The response of water quality variation in Poyang Lake (Jiangxi, People's Republic of China) to hydrological changes using historical data and DOM fluorescence	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Poyang Lake is a unique wetland system that has evolved in response to natural seasonal fluctuations in water levels. To better characterize the response of water quality to hydrological variation, historical data were analyzed in combination with dissolved organic matter (DOM) fluorescence samplings conducted in situ. Historical data showed that long-term changes in water quality are mainly controlled by the sewage inputs to Poyang Lake. Monthly changes in water quality recorded during 2008 and 2012 suggest that water level may be the most important factor for water quality during a hydrological year. DOM fluorescence samples were identified as three humic-like components (C1, C2, and C3) and a protein-like component (C4). These obvious compositional changes in DOM fluorescence were considered to be related to the hydrodynamic differences controlled by water regimen. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed higher C1 and C2 signals during a normal season than the wet season, whereas C3 was lower, and C4 was higher in the dry season than in the wet or normal seasons. From the open lake to the Yangtze River mouth, increased C3 component carried by backflows of the Yangtze River to the lake resulted in these unique variations of PCA factor 2 scores during September. These obvious compositional changes in DOM fluorescence were considered to be related to the hydrodynamic differences controlled by water regimen. DOM fluorescence could be a proxy for capturing rapid changes in water quality and thereby provide an early warning signal for the quality of water supply.					; WANG, SHANSHAN/OKS-5896-2025	Yao, xin/0000-0002-4151-8784; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2015	22	4					3032	3042		10.1007/s11356-014-3579-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3579-z								25231740					WOS:000349319200067

However, the mechanisms and influence factors on lake pollution processes remain unclear. Therefore, this study investigates the distribution of DOM components and elucidate the role of ice-layer sieving its mechanisms within ice-water-sediments. Study identifies significant variations in the characteristics of DOM, protein-like substances tend to migrate towards the ice layer, while humic-like substances predominantly remain in water. This selective distribution is primarily influenced by the physical and chemical properties of DOM during the freezing process. The ice layer acts as a sieve, allowing smaller molecules such as protein-like substances to pass through more easily, while larger molecules like humic-like substances are retained in the water. Additionally, Temperature plays a pivotal role in affecting the contents of DOM. As the temperature decreases, the solubility of DOM decreases, leading to its precipitation and enrichment in sediments. Conversely, an increase in temperature can facilitate the release of DOM from sediments into the water. Furthermore, high content of total dissolved solids can affect the solubility and stability of DOM, potentially leading to changes in its composition and distribution. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between thermal processes and chemical dynamics within ice-covered aquatic environments. They offered valuable insights into the behavior of organic pollutants in frozen lake systems. The findings have potential implications for environmental management strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of climate.					tingting, Li/JQV-7820-2023; deng, yuxin/AHA-7496-2022; Yang, Yingying/GRS-1048-2022; Wang, Fu/LWJ-0729-2024														0048-9697	1879-1026				JUN 10	2024	928								172211	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172211	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172211		APR 2024						38583617					WOS:001233671000001

This makes them highly dynamic, and thus difficult to map and monitor from space. The Sentinel-1 constellation allows monitoring land changes regardless of cloud conditions and with a high frequency of pass. We use a time series of 33 Sentinel-1 dual-polarized images from 2016 to map seasonal changes at the artificial Lake of Kerkini, in Greece. The images are accessed and processed in Google Earth Engine via a Flask web application. Points of change within the time series and frequency of change were determined according to an omnibus-test statistic. The results were compared to an optical-based land cover map and gaging measurements. Frequency of change patterns matched different land cover types, indicating that frequency of change is related to the physical and structural properties of the land cover. This methodology can be used operationally to improve our understanding of ecosystems, enhance land cover maps, and to monitor wetland dynamics as well as cover changes caused by human activities.					; Muro Martin, Javier/IZD-7581-2023; Tompoulidou, Maria/AAX-7139-2020; Muro, Javier/IZD-7581-2023	Thonfeld, Frank/0000-0002-3371-7206; Muro Martin, Javier/0000-0001-5127-8983; Fitoka, Eleni/0000-0001-7725-6686; Tompoulidou, Maria/0000-0001-9711-591X; Strauch, Adrian/0000-0001-9309-1543													1545-598X	1558-0571				OCT	2019	16	10					1536	1539		10.1109/LGRS.2019.2903596	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2019.2903596													WOS:000489756100006

Three sites are in Norway: the mesotrophic Lysefjord (LF), Samnangerfjord (SF), and ROst Coastal Water (RCW); two sites are in China: the oligotrophic Lake Namtso (LN) and the eutrophic Bohai Sea (BS); and one site is in Uganda: the eutrophic Lake Victoria (LV). The site locations ranged from equatorial to subarctic regions, and they included water types from oligotrophic to eutrophic and altitudes from 0 m to 4700 m. The mean CDOM absorption coefficients at 440 nm [aCDOM(440)] and 320 nm [aCDOM(320)] varied in the ranges 0.063-0.35 m-1 and 0.34-2.28 m-1, respectively, with highest values in LV, Uganda and the lowest in the high-altitude LN, Tibet. The mean spectral slopes S280-500 and S350-500 were found to vary in the ranges of 0.017-0.032 nm-1 and 0.013-0.015 nm-1, respectively. The highest mean value for S280-500 as well as the lowest mean value for S350-500 were found in LN. Scatter plots of S280-500 versus aCDOM(440) and aCDOM(320) values ranges revealed a close connection between RCW, LF, and SF on one side, and BS and LV on the other side. CDOM seems to originate from terrestrial sources in LF, SF, BS, and LV, while RCW is characterized by autochthonous-oceanic CDOM, and LN by autochthonous CDOM. Photobleaching of CDOM is prominent in LN, demonstrated by absorption towards lower wavelengths in the UV spectrum. We conclude that high altitudes, implying high levels of UV radiation and oligotrophic water conditions are most important for making a significant change in CDOM absorption properties.					; Xing, Qianguo/AAR-7174-2021; Erga, Svein/I-2704-2017; Chen, Yi-Chun/O-8661-2017	xing, qian guo/0000-0002-9136-9051; SSENYONGA, TADDEO/0000-0003-4125-6080; Nima, Ciren/0000-0003-1770-1703														2073-4441				OCT	2019	11	10							1988	10.3390/w11101988	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11101988													WOS:000495598400033

In this study, multiple satellite remote sensing observations (e.g., GRACE, MODIS, Altimetry, and TRMM), hydrological models, and in situ data are used to characterize the flood phenomena over the Poyang Lake basin between 2003 and 2016. To improve the accuracy of the terrestrial water storage (TWS) estimates over the Poyang Lake basin, a modified forward-modeling method is introduced in the GRACE processing. The method is evaluated using the contaminated noise onboard observations for the first time. The results in both spectral and spatial domains infer a good performance of the method on the suppression of high-frequency noise while reducing the signal loss. After applying forward-modeling method, the TWS derived from the GRACE spherical harmonic coefficients presents a comparable performance with the solution derived from the newly released CSR Release05 mascon product over the Poyang Lake basin. The flood events in 2010 and 2016 are identified from the positive anomalies in non-seasonal TWSs derived by GRACE and hydrological models. The flood signatures also coincide with the largest inundated areas estimated from MODIS data, and the observed areas in 2010 and 2016 are 3370.3 km(2) (30% higher than the long-term mean) and 3445.0 km(2) (33% higher), respectively. The water levels in the Hukou station exceed the warning water level for 25 days in 2010 and 28 days in 2016. These continuous warning-exceeded water levels also imply the severe flood events, which are primarily driven by the local plenteous precipitation in the rainy season (1528 mm in 2010, 1522 mm in 2016).

Although several studies highlighted this trend at low latitudes of Western Pangaea, little is known from Central Pangaea environments. The discovery of new fossiliferous horizons in the Late Cisuralian Tregiovo Formation (Northern Italy), allowed a new palaeoenvironmental study based on fades analysis, ichnology, palaeobotany, plant-insect interaction and palynology. Three facies associations were identified (A-C), and correspond to floodplain lake, ephemeral lacustrine and distal alluvial fan environments, respectively. The tetrapod ichnoassociation is more diverse than previously known, including abundant diapsid and non-diapsid reptile tracks and rarer temnospondyl amphibian tracks. Plant fossils are characterized by a predominance of hinterland taxa (conifers), hygrophytic plants are present as well. The sporomorph association is dominated by miospores of Cordaitales, Voltziales, and Peltaspermales while trilete lycopsid and fern miospores are rare which corresponds well with the macroflora. Invertebrate trace fossils and feeding traces on plant fossils are described for the first time from the Tregiovo Basin suggesting transitional, low energy environments, and a relatively low level of herbivory, respectively. This study evidences the development in the Tregiovo Basin of a wet-and-dry (probably seasonal) climate, which became drier between facies associations A-B. This environment constitutes an important reference since few data are known to infer the Late Cisuralian climatic conditions of Central Pangaea. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the relative importance of these processes in frontal variation is difficult to assess and poorly understood, particularly for freshwater calving glaciers. To better understand the mechanism of seasonal variations involved in the ice front variations of freshwater calving glaciers, we measured front position, ice surface speed, air temperature, and proglacial lakewater temperature of Glaciar Perito Moreno in Patagonia. No substantial fluctuations in front position and ice speed occurred during the 15-year period studied (1999-2013), despite a warming trend in air temperature (0.059 degrees C a(-1)). Seasonal variations were observed both in the ice-front position (+/- 50 m) and ice speed (+/- 15%). The frontal ablation rate, computed from the frontal displacement rate and the ice speed, varied in a seasonal manner with an amplitude approximately five times greater than that in the ice speed. The frontal ablation correlated well with seasonal lakewater temperature variations (r = 0.96) rather than with air temperature (r = 0.86). Our findings indicate that the seasonal ice front variations of Glaciar Perito Moreno are primarily due to frontal ablation, which is controlled through subaqueous melting by the thermal conditions of the lake.					; Sugiyama, Shin/C-2511-2012; Minowa, Masahiro/AAX-1280-2021	Minowa, Masahiro/0000-0003-2667-9798; 														2296-6463				JAN 24	2017	5								1	10.3389/feart.2017.00001	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2017.00001													WOS:000393610600001

We used a multiscale, geographic information system based approach to assess the link between cholera outbreaks, climate, and environmental variables. We performed time-series analyses and field investigations in the main affected areas. Results showed that cholera greatly increased during El Nino warm events (abnormally warm El Ninos) but decreased or remained stable between these events. Most epidemics occurred in a few hotspots in lakeside areas, where the weekly incidence of cholera varied by season, rainfall, fluctuations of plankton, and fishing activities. During lull periods, persistence of cholera was explained by outbreak dynamics, which suggested a metapopulation pattern, and by endemic foci around the lakes. These links between cholera outbreaks, climate, and lake environments need additional, multidisciplinary study.

Using the guild ratio to characterize pelagic rotifer communities	HYDROBIOLOGIA					12th International Rotifer Symposium (ROTIFERA)	AUG 16-21, 2009	Humboldt Univ, Berlin, GERMANY	Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries (IGB)	Humboldt Univ			Ecological research is moving from a species-based to a functional-based approach to better understand the underlying principles that govern community dynamics. Studies of functional-based ecology, however, have been limited for zooplankton and particularly for rotifers. While rotifers show a variety of trophi types and coronal shapes, suggesting the importance of niche differentiation in their feeding strategy, relatively little is known of how this relates to rotifer dynamics. We used the guild ratio (GR', a ratio of raptorial to microphagous species), an index based on a functional trait (i.e. feeding strategy), as a novel approach to rotifer dynamics. We extracted the seasonal GR' by using seasonal trend decomposition and investigated similarities between study sites (Lake Washington, USA and Lake Caldonazzo, Italy) and its relation to cladocerans by cross-correlation analysis. Our study indicated that (i) raptorial and microphagous rotifers showed alternating dominance, and that raptorial rotifers and cladocerans had a synchronous pattern, (ii) the seasonal pattern of the GR' was consistent across different sampling frequencies, and (iii) the GR' was similar in both lakes. We interpreted these patterns as the general strength of the GR': discernment of species-environment relationships and robustness across sampling regimes. The limitations of the GR' (i.e. species identity is neglected, simplification of food preferences) can also be seen as its strong point: synthesis of multi-species patterns. In addition, the independence of GR' from species-level identification and its potential to make use of datasets with infrequent sampling intervals and low taxon resolution could further support its innovative aspect.

This study investigated the concentrations and ecological risks of two typical PBDEs, 2,2 ',4,4 '-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47) and decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE209), in surface waters across China from 2011 to 2018. The results showed that the concentration of BDE-209 (8.25 ng L-1) was higher than that of BDE-47 (1.02 ng L-1), and the concentrations of BDE-47 and BDE-209 in the lakes (2.56 ng L-1 and 22.19 ng L-1, respectively) were higher than those in the rivers (0.58 ng L-1 and 7.05 ng L-1, respectively). In addition, the concentration of BDE-209 in the wet season (2.61 ng L-1) was lower than that in the dry season (10.83 ng L-1), whereas the concentration of BDE-47 in the wet season (0.24 ng L-1) was a little lower than that in the dry season (0.99 ng L-1). BDE-47 and BDE-209 concentrations showed a gradual decrease in surface waters across China during the eight-year period. Based on the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) models, the 5% hazardous concentration (HC5) and predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) values were derived using the acute and chronic toxicity data of BDE-47 and BDE-209. Results showed that the PNEC values based on the acute and chronic toxicity data were 2.08 mu g L-1 and 0.52 mu g L-1 for BDE-47, respectively and 370 mu g L-1 and 0.34 mu g L-1 for BDE-209, respectively. The risk quotient (RQ) values of BDE-47 in surface waters across China were far smaller than 0.1 (low ecological risk). Similarly, the RQ values of BDE-209 were also smaller than 0.1, except for those at Baiyangdian Lake and Chaohu Lake, where the probability of 0.1 <= RQ < 1.0 (medium ecological risk) was approximately 10% based on 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations.

Water-level fluctuation is an important factor affecting the P fractions and P cycle in lakes sediments. Until now, no consensus has been reached on the spatial and temporal variation of P fractions with water-level fluctuation. In this study, we explored the impact of water level fluctuations on P fraction and P release risk in sediments of the Shijiu Lake Basin from new insights. Materials and methods Surface sediments from eight rivers and lake zones were collected in the dry season (January), the normal season (June), and the flooding season (September), respectively. The SMT, a sequential P fractionation protocol, was used to determine five different P pools: P bound to Fe and Al (Fe/Al-P), P associated with Ca (Ca-P), inorganic P (IP), organic P (OP), and total P (TP). We regarded the sum of Fe/Al-P and OP as bioavailable phosphorus (BAP) to assess the release risk of P. Interpolation analysis with ArcGIS 10.3 was used to predict the distribution and release risk of P. Results and discussion The results showed Fe/Al-P was the main form of IP in the dry season (average, 59.90%) while Ca-P was the predominant form in the normal (average, 63.60%) and flooding seasons (average, 61.64%). The highest potential risk of P release from sediments was in the dry season. In rivers where Fe/Al-P was the dominant form of BAP (57.35-82.74%), Fe/Al-P contents decreased significantly (P < 0.01) as the water level rose. The proportion of BAP in TP of XQ River in three water seasons maintained at a high level (80.11%, 66.37%, 59.85%). The increase of the BAP contents in the Guxi River was mainly due to the backwater of the Yangtze River. Agriculturally polluted rivers were more affected than industrially polluted rivers after experiencing heavy rainfall. Conclusions The results indicated the sediment P distribution patterns responded differently to water-level fluctuation, geographical location, and anthropogenic activities. Water-level fluctuation has different effects on river channels, estuaries, and lake zones. Industrially polluted rivers and agriculturally polluted rivers caused by anthropogenic activities presented different P fractions distributions. Differences in sediment P distribution patterns and responses suggested that approaches for aquatic ecosystem restoration and management of P should be evaluated with site-specific knowledge of sediment.

Bioenergetics modelling of grass carp: Estimated individual consumption and population impacts in Great Lakes wetlands	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), native to eastern Asia, have established populations throughout the Mississippi River basin and are now reproducing naturally in the Great Lakes basin. As a large herbivorous fish, there is. concern that an established grass carp population in the Great Lakes may threaten nearshore vegetated areas and wetlands. We parameterized a bioenergetics model for grass carp from the primary literature to quantify individual consumption levels and estimate the impacts of an established population on macrophytes in representative areas of Lakes Erie and Ontario. Individual life time consumption was estimated under average, cool and warm temperature conditions. Under average temperature conditions, a population of grass carp could consume up to 27.6 kg of vegetation per kg of fish per year, depending on energy density of the vegetation. When consumption was estimated for populations of various grass carp biomass densities, most simulated scenarios resulted in <50% of vegetation remaining in an invaded wetland after one year, with the majority of consumption from preadult stages. Direct impacts will likely exceed these effects due to losses to vegetation production potential from grass carp feeding early in the growing season and grass carp foraging activity resulting in plant damage or uprooting.

J	Ishikawa, A; Kitano, J				Ishikawa, Asano; Kitano, Jun			Diversity in reproductive seasonality in the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY												The annual timing of reproduction is a key life history trait with a large effect on fitness. Populations often vary in the timing and duration of reproduction to adapt to different seasonality of ecological and environmental variables between habitats. However, little is known about the molecular genetic mechanisms underlying interpopulation variation in reproductive seasonality. Here, we demonstrate that the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is a good model for molecular genetic analysis of variations in reproductive seasonality. We first compiled data on reproductive seasons of diverse ecotypes, covering marine-anadromous, lake and stream ecotypes, of three-spined stickleback inhabiting a wide range of latitudes. Our analysis showed that both ecotype and latitude significantly contribute to variation in reproductive seasons. Stream ecotypes tend to start breeding earlier and end later than other ecotypes. Populations from lower latitudes tend to start breeding earlier than those from higher latitudes in all three ecotypes. Additionally, stream ecotypes tend to have extended breeding seasons at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes, leading to nearly year-round reproduction in the most southern stream populations. A review of recent progress in our understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying seasonal reproduction in the three-spined stickleback indicates that photoperiod is an important external cue that stimulates and/or suppresses reproduction in this species. Taking advantage of genomic tools available for this species, the three-spined stickleback will be a good model to investigate what kinds of genes and mutations underlie variations in the physiological signalling pathways that regulate reproduction in response to photoperiod.					; Ishikawa, Asano/U-8590-2018	Kitano, Jun/0000-0001-8659-5698; Ishikawa, Asano/0000-0003-1628-8339													0022-0949	1477-9145				FEB	2020	223			1	SI				jeb208975	10.1242/jeb.208975	http://dx.doi.org/10.1242/jeb.208975								32034046					WOS:000541774100010

Cherenkov EAS arrays in the Tunka astrophysical center: From Tunka-133 to the TAIGA gamma and cosmic ray hybrid detector	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT					10th International Workshop on Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detectors (RICH)	JUL 29-AUG 04, 2018	Russian Acad Sci, Moscow, RUSSIA		Russian Acad Sci			One of the most informative methods of cosmic ray studies is the detection of Cherenkov light from extensive air showers (EAS). The primary energy reconstruction is possible by using the Earth's atmosphere as a huge calorimeter. The EAS Cherenkov light array Tunka-133, with similar to 3 km(2) geometrical area, is taking data since 2009. Tunka-133 is located in the Tunka Astrophysical Center at similar to 50 km west of Lake Baikal. This array allows us to perform a detailed study of the energy spectrum and the mass composition in the energy range from 6. 10(15) eV to 1018 eV. Most of the ongoing efforts are focused on the construction of the first stage of the detector TAIGA (Tunka Advanced Instrument for cosmic ray physics and Gamma Astronomy). The latter is designed for the study of gamma rays and charged cosmic rays in the energy range of 10(13) eV-10(18) eV. The TAIGA prototype will consist of similar to 100 wide angle timing Cherenkov stations (TAIGA-HiSCORE) and three IACTs deployed over an area of similar to 1 km(2). The installation of the array is planned to be finished in 2019 while the data-taking can start already during the commissioning phase. The joint reconstruction of energy, direction, and core position of the imaging and non-imaging detectors will allow us to increase the distance between the IACTs up to 800 m, therefore providing a low-cost, highly sensitive detector. The relatively low cost together with the high sensitivity for energies >= 30-50 TeV make this pioneering technique very attractive for exploring galactic PeVatrons and cosmic rays. In addition to the Cherenkov light detectors we intend to deploy surface and underground muon detectors over an area of 1 km(2) with a total area of about 1000 m(2). The results of the first season of coincident operation of the first similar to 4 m diameter IACT with an aperture of similar to 10 degrees. with 30 stations of TAIGA-HiSCORE will be presented.

Examining maternal and environmental transfer of mercury into American alligator eggs	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												American alligators are exposed to mercury (Hg) throughout their natural range and may maternally transfer Hg into their eggs. Wildlife species are highly sensitive to Hg toxicity during embryonic development and neonatal life, and information on Hg transfer into eggs is critical when attempting to understand the effects of Hg exposure on developing oviparous organisms. To examine Hg transfer in alligators, the objectives of the present study were to 1) determine Hg concentrations in yolk (embryonic and neonatal food source) from wild alligator eggs collected from three locations - Yawkey Wildlife Center SC (YWC), Lake Apopka FL (LA), and Lake Woodruff FL (LW); 2) examine the relationship between THg concentrations in wild alligator nest material and egg yolk at Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, FL; 3) examine the Hg concentrations in wild maternal female alligators (blood) and the THg in corresponding egg yolks and embryos across three nesting seasons at a single location (YWC), and evaluate the relationship between nesting female THg concentrations (blood) and their estimated age and number of nesting years (YWC); and 4) assess the transfer of biologically-relevant Hg concentrations (based on Hg measured in maternal female blood) into embryos using an egg-dosing experiment. Mean total Hg (THg) concentrations observed at each site were 26.3 ng/g +/- 11.0 ng/g (YWC), 8.8 ng/g +/- 5.1 ng/g (LA), and 22.6 ng/g +/- 6.3 ng/g (LW). No relationship was observed between THg in alligator nest material and corresponding yolk samples, nor between THg in maternal alligator blood and estimated age and number of nesting years of these animals. However, significant positive relationships were observed between THg in blood of nesting female alligators and THg in their corresponding egg yolk. We observed that 12.8% of the maternal blood THg is found in the corresponding egg yolk, and a highly significant correlation was observed between the two sample types (r = 0.66; p < 0.0001). The egg dosing experiment revealed that Hg did not transfer through the eggshell at developmental stage 19. Overall, this study provides new information regarding Hg transfer in American alligators which can improve biomonitoring efforts and may inform ecotoxicological investigations and population management programs in areas of high Hg contamination.

In this study, the abundance, shape, size, color, and polymer type of MPs in water and sediment in the Yitong River were determined. The results showed that MP abundance was higher in the rainy season than in the dry period, with urban sections generally exhibiting higher MP abundance than rural areas. The MPs were predominantly fibrous, ranging from 0.05 to 1 mm in size, and primarily black and transparent in color. Eleven polymer types were identified, with polyethylene (37.27 %), polypropylene (29.09 %), and polystyrene (12.73 %) being the top three. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the surface of MPs was rough, with varying degrees of holes and cracks, facilitating the attachment of other pollutants. The assessment of MP pollution based on the pollution load index (PLI) method indicated slight MP pollution, with a PLI value of <10 for the water body and <1 for the sediment. The assessment of the distribution characteristics and pollution levels of MPs establishes a foundation for the comprehensive analysis of MP pollution. It offers valuable guidance for managing MP pollution in the Yitong River and provides basic data for assessing the distribution characteristics and pollution risks in mid-temperate urban rivers.

However, for the seasonal ice-sealed reservoirs, antibiotic sampling and detecting conditions in water and fish are normally limited by the ice cover. Additionally, previous studies on the prediction of antibiotics accumulated in seasonal ice-sealed reservoir fish are scarce. This study presents a coupled model incorporating a multimedia fate model and a bioaccumulation model to predict antibiotic fate in water and the muscles, kidneys, and livers of fish in seasonal ice-sealed reservoirs. Prediction concentrations of florfenicol were higher than those of ofloxacin and norfloxacin in both water and fish from the seasonal ice-sealed reservoir. Log bioaccumulation factors of antibiotics in Cyprinus carpio and Hypo-phthalmichthys nobilis in January 2021 were higher than those in October 2020 by 21.5% and 12.6%, respec-tively. Antibiotics mean transfer fluxes from water to fish muscles, kidneys, and livers increased owing to the reservoir ice-cover formation date advancing by 13.0%, 77.1%, and 61.0%, respectively. This work provides a modeling tool for investigating the fate and mass transfer flux of antibiotics in biological and environmental phases in seasonal ice-sealed reservoirs.

Therefore, focusing on areas that contribute the most, so-called critical source areas (CSAs), can have economic and ecological benefits. CSAs are often determined using a modelling approach, yet it has proved difficult to calibrate the models in regions with limited data availability. Since identifying CSAs is based on the relative contributions of sub-basins to the total load, it has been suggested that uncalibrated models could be used to identify CSAs to overcome data scarcity issues. Here, we use the SWAT model to study the extent to which an uncalibrated model can be applied to determine CSAs. We classify and rank sub-basins to identify CSAs for sediment, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) in the Fengyu River Watershed (China) with and without model calibration. The results show high similarity (81%-93%) between the identified sediment and TP CSA number and locations before and after calibration both on the yearly and seasonal scale. For TN alone, the results show moderate similarity on the yearly scale (73%). This may be because, in our study area, TN is determined more by groundwater flow after calibration than by surface water flow. We conclude that CSA identification with the uncalibrated model for TP is always good because its CSA number and locations changed least, and for sediment, it is generally satisfactory. The use of the uncalibrated model for TN is acceptable, as its CSA locations did not change after calibration; however, the TN CSA number changed by over 60% compared to the figures before calibration on both yearly and seasonal scales. Therefore, we advise using an uncalibrated model to identify CSAs for TN only if water yield composition changes are expected to be limited. This study shows that CSAs can be identified based on relative loading es-timates with uncalibrated models in data-deficient regions.

The average concentrations of HONO, HNO3, HCl, SO2 and NH3 were 0.93, 1.16, 0.48, 9.29 and 5.54 mu g/m(3), respectively, and 2.8, 2.76, 8.28 and 2.48 mu g/m(3) for Cl-, NO3-, SO42- and NH4+. In the non-dust period, diurnal variations of SO42-, NO3- and their gaseous precursors showed similar change trend. NH4+ showed unimodal pattern whereas NH3 illustrated a bimodal pattern. HCl and Cl- showed an opposite diurnal pattern. In the dust event, temporal profiles of HCl and Cl-, SO2 and SO42- all presented similar change trend, and SO42- and Cl- preceded dust ions (Ca2+ and Mg2+) 13 h. The ratios of NO3- to SO42- were 0.65 in the non-dust period and 0.31 in the dust event. In the dust event, the sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR) was a factor of 1.33 greater than that in the non-dust period, and [SO42-]/[SO2] was 2.31 times of that in the non-dust period. The source apportionment using Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) suggested that fugitive dust (58.09%), secondary aerosols (33.98%), and biomass burning (7.93%) were the major sources in the non-dust period whereas dust (67.01%), salt lake (29.68%), biomass burning (0.8%), and motor vehicle (2.51%) were the primary sources in the dust event. Concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) model indicated that NO3-, Cl- and K+ could be regarded as local source species, the potential sources of Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrated in the two large areas with the one covered in the junction areas of Xinjiang, Qinghai and Gansu and another one covered the places around in Lanzhou, the potential sources of SO42- were mainly localized in the areas adjacent to Lanzhou.

River geochemistry, chemical weathering, and atmospheric CO2 consumption rates in the Virunga Volcanic Province (East Africa)	GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS												We report a water chemistry data set from 13 rivers of the Virunga Volcanic Province (VVP) (Democratic Republic of Congo), sampled between December 2010 and February 2013. Most parameters showed no pronounced seasonal variation, whereas their spatial variation suggests a strong control by lithology, soil type, slope, and vegetation. High total suspended matter (289-1467 mg L-1) was recorded in rivers in the Lake Kivu catchment, indicating high soil erodibility, partly as a consequence of deforestation and farming activities. Dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) were lower in rivers from lava fields, and higher in nonvolcanic subcatchments. Stable carbon isotope signatures (delta C-13) of POC and DOC mean delta C-13 of -22.5 parts per thousand and -23.5 parts per thousand, respectively, are the first data to be reported for the highland of the Congo River basin and showed a much higher C4 contribution than in lowland areas. Rivers of the VVP were net sources of CH4 to the atmosphere (4-5052 nmol L-1). Most rivers show N2O concentrations close to equilibrium, but some rivers showed high N2O concentrations related to denitrification in groundwaters. delta C-13 signatures of dissolved inorganic carbon suggested magmatic CO2 inputs to aquifers/soil, which could have contributed to increase basalt weathering rates. This magmatic CO2-mediated basalt weathering strongly contributed to the high major cation concentrations and total alkalinity. Thus, chemical weathering (39.0-2779.9 t km(-2) yr(-1)) and atmospheric CO2 consumption (0.4-37.0 x 10(6) mol km(-2) yr(-1)) rates were higher than previously reported in the literature for basaltic terrains.					; Borges, Alberto/C-4989-2008; Bouillon, Steven/C-5177-2011; Lambert, Thibault/M-7192-2017; Darchambeau, Francois/AAX-1206-2021	Borges, Alberto V./0000-0002-5434-2247; Balagizi, Charles/0000-0003-0313-2626; Bouillon, Steven/0000-0001-7669-2929; Lambert, Thibault/0000-0002-7666-5370; 														1525-2027				SEP	2015	16	8					2637	2660		10.1002/2015GC005999	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015GC005999													WOS:000362365600011

Approximately 8% of the similar to 1000 living cypridid species are identified as 'giant'. They occur in a range of subfamilies, in all zoogeographic regions, except Antarctica, and mainly in small standing-water ecosystems. Only those in the subfamily Mytilocypridinae are reasonably well studied. This subfamily is endemic to Australia and comprises a diverse range of giant species (similar to 29 species in 6 genera), mainly in temporary habitats, mostly salt lakes, including in extreme conditions. We evaluate the current taxonomy of the Mytilocypridinae, analyse patterns in the field distributions and abiotic tolerances of species, and review the general biology of these ostracods. We also identify those species most in need of consideration in conservation planning, highlight critical gaps in knowledge and show how these ostracods could serve as useful models for testing ecological and evolutionary theories. The results of this study can be used to inform conservation planning for giant ostracods and direct further study of these unique invertebrates, which are an important component of the biodiversity of small standing-water ecosystems.					; Rahman, Mohammad/KHY-3819-2024	Rahman, Mahabubur/0000-0001-6678-3747; 													1323-1650	1448-6059					2023	74	1					1	19		10.1071/MF22092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF22092		NOV 2022											WOS:000901742500001
J	Fu, CS; James, AL; Yao, HX				Fu, Congsheng; James, April L.; Yao, Huaxia			Investigations of uncertainty in SWAT hydrologic simulations: a case study of a Canadian Shield catchment	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Annual Meeting of Canadian-Geophysical-Union	MAY 04-07, 2014	Banff, CANADA					Uncertainty analysis is an integral part of hydrological modelling. We investigated uncertainty from model structure and parameters in the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) hydrologic simulations for a Canadian Shield catchment (5.4 km(2)) in south central Ontario. We investigated influences of model structure on parameter identifiability and prediction uncertainty by comparing model performance of SWAT (version 2009.10.1 Beta3) and SWAT-CS (a version representing hydrological processes in Canadian Shield catchments). Equifinality was found to exist for many parameters in process modules of snow water equivalent (SWE), streamflow and lake outflow. For SWAT, there are clearly identifiable parameters from process modules of snowmelt, overland flow, lateral flow and groundwater flow, while snowmelt parameters and lateral flow travel time are the only clearly identifiable parameters in SWAT-CS. Model structure also notably influenced the optimum parameter values. Only 50-55% of observed SWE and 27-43% of observed streamflow were bracketed by the corresponding 95% confidence interval. The prediction uncertainty for SWE was mainly caused by the inaccuracy in timing of simulated snowmelt. This, along with use of a daily time step that is not able to capture the subdaily rainfall on snow pack, the limited capability of simulating groundwater by SWAT and the close-to-zero streamflow during dry seasons at the study catchment, could all contribute to the prediction uncertainty in streamflow. Comparatively, more reasonable model structure (SWAT-CS) was shown to reduce prediction uncertainty.

However, the detailed knowledges of water vapor and energy fluxes in tea plantation ecosystem are still absent. In this study, we explored the temporal variation in water vapor and energy fluxes over a tea plantation through the analysis of 4-year (2014-2017) fluxes data obtained via the eddy covariance technique. The results showed that latent heat flux (LE) was the main consumer of net radiation (R-n). LE/R-n ranged from 0.50 to 0.67 at the pruning period (April-June) and dormant period (December-March). At the mid-growing season (July-September) and late growing season (October-November), LE accounted for more than 0.75 of R-n, except for the mid-growing season in 2016. Sensible heat flux (H) showed an almost opposite trend to LE, while seasonal variation of soil heat flux (G) was small. The interannual actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was stable in tea plantation ranging from 694-741 mm (CV = 2.9 %) despite a large interannual variation in precipitation (CV = 23.9 %). The average annual ETa accounted for 49 % of the corresponding annual precipitation. The highest measured daily ETa reached 5.2-6.9 mm in July for both years. The seasonal variations of daily ETa were strongly related to the R-n. At the mid-growing and late growing seasons, R-n was the limiting factor on ETa with high Priestley-Taylor coefficient (alpha, 1.05) and decoupling coefficient (Omega, 0.69). In addition, low temperature physiological dormancy and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) at the dormant period and pruning of canopy at the pruning period leading low leaf area index (LAI) also played secondary impacts on ETa through their eff;ects on canopy surface conductance (< 10 mm s(-1)). Moreover, ETa would be significantly affected by soil water availability at the mid-growing season due to the large water demand for growth, when the soil water was below 0.12 m(3) m(-3).

Macrophytes and periphyton carbon subsidies to bacterioplankton and zooplankton in a shallow eutrophic lake in tropical China	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The subsidy of carbon derived from macrophytes and associated periphyton to bacterioplankton and zooplankton in subtropical shallow eutrophic Huizhou West Lake in China was analyzed using carbon stable isotope signatures. A restored part of the lake dominated by macrophytes was compared with an unrestored phytoplankton-dominated part. Macrophytes, periphyton, seston, and zooplankton were sampled every two months to determine natural-abundance carbon isotope ratios (C-13). The C-13 of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton was determined from C-13 of fatty acid biomarkers. Macrophytes and associated periphyton had similar C-13 values and were the most enriched in C-13 of all measured organic carbon pools. A macrophyte-periphyton carbon isotopic signal was detected in particulate organic carbon, bacterioplankton, and zooplankton in the macrophyte-dominated lake part, which was demonstrated by a significant enrichment in C-13 compared with the unrestored part, while phytoplankton and dissolved organic carbon had similar C-13 values in both lake parts. A two-source (macrophytes-periphyton and phytoplankton) mixing model showed that macrophytes-periphyton potentially contributed 14-85% (average 55%) to bacterioplankton in the macrophyte-dominated lake part, depending on season. The macrophytes-periphyton contribution to zooplankton seasonally varied between 26% and 86%, with an average of 47%. The contribution of macrophytes-periphyton to bacterioplankton increased with increasing macrophyte biomass relative to phytoplankton biomass (indicated by chlorophyll a). Carbon from macrophytes with associated periphyton subsidizes bacterioplankton and zooplankton, likely enhancing the cascading effects of planktonic food webs, providing an additional explanation for the stability of a clear-water state in shallow lakes dominated by macrophytes.

A total of 29 surface sediment samples were collected in May and September in 2013. Results showed that levels of the two classes of compounds were higher in September than in May. The total concentration of PBDEs (Sigma 8PBDEs) ranged from 0.30 to 5.09 ng g(-1) in May and from 0.17 to 13.73 ng g(-1) in September, respectively, and BDE 209 was the dominant compound. The total concentration of PCBs (Sigma 33PCBs) was in the range of 4.92-76.86 and 11.69-179.61 ng g(-1) in May and September, respectively, with tri- and tetra-CBs dominated in the total PCBs in the sediments. According to the congener profiles and the principal component analysis, the major sources of PCBs and PBDEs in sediments of Liaohe River were from the usage of commercial products and industrial activities, and the degradation of high brominated BDEs also contributed to the current PBDEs in the sediments. The mass inventories of PBDEs and PCBs in the sediments of Liaohe River were 1.74 and 21.96 t, respectively, indicating that Liaohe River sediments may act as the potential sources of PBDEs and PCBs to the downstream coastal areas.

J	Chen, Y; Xu, J; Li, Y; Han, XD				Chen, Yu; Xu, Jun; Li, Yan; Han, Xiaodong			Decline of sperm quality and testicular function in male mice during chronic low-dose exposure to microcystin-LR	REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY												The effects of chronic low-dose exposure to microcystins were preliminarily studied on sperm quality and testicular function in male mice. Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) was orally administered to male mice at 0, 1, 3.2, and 10 mu g/L for 3 and 6 months. Our preliminary study found in three-month group, sperm quality declined at 3.2 and 10 mu g/L doses, testosterone dropped at 10 mu g/L, levels of LH and FSH increased, and Leydig cells exhibited apoptosis. Similar, but more pronounced, effects were observed in groups treated with MC-LR for 6 months. Compared to control (0 mu g/L), the rate of sperm abnormality was higher and testosterone levels were lower following administration of 3.2 and 10 mu g/L MC-LR and structural damage to the testis was observed with 10 mu g/L dose. Thus, chronic low-dose treatment with MC-LR results in substantial toxicity to male reproduction, causing declines in sperm quality, decreased levels of serum testosterone, and injury to the testis.

Herein, this study elucidated their spatio-temporal variations and underlying factors of a typical lake in front of hillocks with spatially variable topography and hydrogeology, and intense seasonal groundwater -lake exchange, within central Yangtze River basin. The 222 Rn mass balance model was used in conjunction with hydrochemistry, water isotope, and nutrient data. The results showed that the overall LGD rate and related N/P fluxes were clearly higher in the wet season than in the dry season, for which the stronger evaporation relative to precipitation, more groundwater recharge from agricultural irrigation or aquacultural pond infiltration, and more N/P input from anthropogenic or aquacultural activities could be responsible. In the wet season, the area with more recharge from irrigating water or fish pond water infiltration and associated extensive agricultural or aquacultural activities, had the significantly highest LGD rate and related N/P fluxes. In the dry season, the area with the deepest water depth and largest topographic slope, exhibited the significantly highest LGD rate and slightly higher LGD-related N/P fluxes due to relatively low groundwater N/P concentrations. This study enriched the understanding on LGD and related nutrient fluxes in the perspective of both spatial and temporal variations, taking a new type of lakes (i.e., lakes in the transitional zone of hills and plains in temperate climate) as a typical case.					邓, 娅敏/B-1275-2019; gan, yiqun/NPI-6826-2025; Du, Yao/HDN-4489-2022														0022-1694	1879-2707				MAY	2024	635								131166	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131166	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.131166		APR 2024											WOS:001227339300001
J	Gebremariam, SY; McCormick, P; Rochelle, P				Gebremariam, Seyoum Yami; McCormick, Paul; Rochelle, Paul			Evidence of a rapid phosphorus-induced regime shift in a large deep reservoir	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Ecological regime shift studies in freshwater systems are mainly limited to shallow lakes and reservoirs, while abrupt changes in deeper lakes are often attributed to climate change. Here, we demonstrate the application of regime shift theory to one of California's newest and deepest reservoirs, Diamond Valley Lake (DVL), which in recent years showed an unexpected rapid departure from its water quality conditions of the previous decade. The reservoir shifted from a well oxygenated condition with low phytoplankton growth to a hypoxic, phytoplankton-dominated turbid system. We statistically identified the critical stressor (phosphorus (P)), switch points, and its load threshold and characterized its transition to an alternative stable state and the stabilizing mechanisms contributing to hysteresis. We analyzed long-term environmental, chemical and flow data, conducted a hydrographic survey, and developed a hydrodynamic model to characterize the factors that contributed to regime shift and to evaluate different management strategies that might reverse this shift. Our findings indicate that large deep systems exhibit different transition dynamics in the presence of an acute stressor compared to regime shifts in shallow systems. A cumulative external TP load threshold of 4.6 mg m(-2) d(-1) added to the reservoir over nearly 11 months was identified as the critical stressor. For large deep systems, inherent morphometric features such as large relative depth combine with external stressors to drive regime shifts. Light winds, morphometric conditions impeding deep mixing, and a stable stratification that lasts up to 9 months makes DVL more susceptible to hypolimnetic hypoxia, an intrinsic factor accelerating regime shift. Results also suggest regime shift occurred in 2013, when new limnological processes were established to reinforce the new alternative stable state and existing ecosystem services were impaired. Interactions between hypoxia, internal P loading (similar to 2.1 mg m(-2) d(-1)), and seasonal cyanobacterial blooms were identified as mechanisms perpetuating the new alternative state.

J	Park, HS; Sohn, BJ				Park, Hye-Sook; Sohn, B. J.			Recent trends in changes of vegetation over East Asia coupled with temperature and rainfall variations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												In this study, we investigated whether long-term normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data show climate change signals after the mid-1990s which are inferred from other studies on changing trends in precipitation and dust frequencies. In doing so, mean NDVI data for the growing seasons (April-October) from 1982 to 2006 were used for examining the spatiotemporal variations in the vegetation over East Asia, in conjunction with precipitation and temperature data. Results indicate that there was a prominent change in the trend of NDVI around the mid-1990s: a pronounced positive trend over most of the East Asian domain before the mid-1990s (1982-1996) and a reverse (or weakened) trend after the mid-1990s (1997-2006). The reverse trend is evident over the higher-latitude regions north of 50 degrees N and the eastern Mongolian border area. The EOF and SVD analysis suggest that the dominant warming trend until the mid-1990s led to the increased NDVI over the high-latitude regions. However, after the mid-1990s, the reverse NDVI trend found primarily in the east of Lake Baikal and the arid and semiarid regions south of 50 degrees N seems to be closely linked to local precipitation changes occurred abruptly in the mid-1990s. However, precipitation influences on the reverse NDVI changes are not clear over the high-latitude regions north of 50 degrees N.					; Park, Harold/B-1525-2008	PARK, Hye Sook/0000-0003-3742-0247; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUL 17	2010	115								D14101	10.1029/2009JD012752	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JD012752													WOS:000280047300001
J	Lu, DS; Zheng, YC; Liu, XN; Chang, JB				Lu, Dongshuo; Zheng, Yichen; Liu, Xiaoning; Chang, Jianbo			Changes in wetland landscape and inundation patterns in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin from 1990 to 2020	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Wetlands are crucial to diverse societies and ecosystems but are threatened globally. Natural wetlands in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MLRYRB) have long been exploited to meet the increasing food and energy demands, especially in recent decades. However, how their landscapes and hydrological patterns changed over time was poorly qualified, which was crucial to conserving biodiversity and ecosystems. In this study, we proposed a new wetland classification procedure taking advantage of the shape, topography, landscape patterns, and phenology to map the distribution of six wetland types in the MLRYRB in 1990 and 2020 with Landsat images. The transitions among different wetland types and associated driving factors were examined. Artificial wetlands expanded by 3907.6 km2 while natural wetlands decreased by 423.2 km2, resulting in a net area increase of 3484.4 km2. Farmland reclamations, aquacultural activities, urban expansion, and dam constructions induced 70 % of the area's loss of natural wetlands. Meanwhile, spatiotemporal patterns in wetland inundation dynamics were determined with agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis. Widespread transitions from perennial water to seasonal wetlands were detected. Notably, 47.8 % of the natural wetlands experienced significant drying trends, and as a result, the mean yearly inundated periods for natural wetlands decreased from 303 days in 1990 to 272 days in 2020. Given the substantial structural alterations, wetland destruction was more severe than the area reflected. Our results suggested that category-based changes in wetland areas, inundation patterns, associated driving forces, and underlying ecological consequences should be comprehensively assessed to conduct scientific conservation and prevent "paper offsets."

It has not yet been addressed if biochar exerts synergy effects on crop production, GHG emission, and microbial activity in metal-polluted soils. In a field experiment, biochar was amended at sequential rates at 0, 10, 20, and 40 t ha(-1), respectively, in a cadmium- and lead-contaminated rice paddy from the Tai lake Plain, China, before rice cropping in 2010. Fluxes of soil carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were monitored using a static chamber method during the whole rice growing season (WRGS) of 2011. BSA significantly reduced soil CaCl2 extractable pool of Cd, and DTPA extractable pool of Cd and Pb. As compared to control, soil CO2 emission under BSA was observed to have no change at 10 t ha(-1) but decreased by 16-24 % at 20 and 40 t ha(-1). In a similar trend, BSA at 20 and 40 t ha(-1) increased rice yield by 25-26 % and thus enhanced ecosystem CO2 sequestration by 47-55 % over the control. Seasonal total N2O emission was reduced by 7.1, 30.7, and 48.6 % under BSA at 10, 20, and 40 t ha(-1), respectively. Overall, a net reduction in greenhouse gas balance (NGHGB) by 53.9-62.8 % and in greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) by 14.3-28.6 % was observed following BSA at 20 and 40 t ha(-1). The present study suggested a great potential of biochar to enhancing grain yield while reducing carbon emission in metal-polluted rice paddies.

Heavy metal assessment using geochemical and statistical tools in the surface sediments of Vembanad Lake, Southwest Coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The geochemical distribution and enrichment of ten heavy metals in the surface sediments of Vembanad Lake, southwest coast of India was evaluated. Sediment samples from 47 stations in the Lake were collected during dry and wet seasons in 2008 and examined for heavy metal content (Al, Fe, Mn, Cr, Zn, Ni, Pb, Cu, Co, Cd), organic carbon, and sediment texture. Statistically significant spatial variation was observed among all sediment variables, but negligible significant seasonal variation was observed. Correlation analysis showed that the metal content of sediments was mainly regulated by organic carbon, Fe oxy-hydroxides, and grain size. Principal component analysis was used to reduce the 14 sediment variables into three factors that reveal distinct origins or accumulation mechanisms controlling the chemical composition in the study area. Pollution intensity of the Vembanad Lake was measured using the enrichment factor and the pollution load index. Severe and moderately severe enrichment of Cd and Zn in the north estuary with minor enrichment of Pb and Cr were observed, which reflects the intensity of the anthropogenic inputs related to industrial discharge into this system. The results of pollution load index reveal that the sediment was heavily polluted in northern arm and moderately polluted in the extreme end and port region of the southern arm of the lake. A comparison with sediment quality guideline quotient was also made, indicating that there may be some ecotoxicological risk to benthic organisms in these sediments.

However, the occurrence of multiple species of alkenone-producing haptophyte algae in a single lake can complicate the translation of alkenone unsaturation to temperature if each species requires an individual temperature calibration. Here, we present the first systematic monitoring of two alkenone-producing haptophytes throughout the course of a seasonal cycle in Lake George, North Dakota, using a combined approach of DNA sequencing and alkenone lipid characterization. Field sampling revealed a nonoverlapping haptophyte succession, with both an early and late season haptophyte bloom event. Culturing experiments demonstrated that the two haptophyte species responsible for these blooms had statistically similar alkenone-temperature responses, although the culture-based calibrations were distinct from the in situ calibration. Bloom timing of each haptophyte species corresponded to surface-water temperatures that differed by more than 10 degrees C, revealing that changes in bloom intensities for each species will skew the sediment-inferred temperatures to a different stage of the growth season. These results highlight the importance of accounting for bloom timing when interpreting alkenone-derived temperatures in sediment cores, especially in lakes that experience large seasonal fluctuations in water column temperature and salinity.

CARBON FROM PERIPHYTON SUPPORTS FISH BIOMASS IN WATERHOLES OF A WET-DRY TROPICAL RIVER	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												The identification of the dominant sources of carbon supporting consumer biomass in aquatic food webs is often difficult but essential to understanding the limits to aquatic secondary production. Stable isotope analysis (SIA) is a powerful tool to estimate the contribution of different sources to consumers, but most food web studies using this approach limit analyses to a few key consumer taxa rather than measuring biomass-weighted contribution of sources to the entire community. Here we combined stable isotope analysis with standardized measurements of abundance and biomass of fishes and invertebrates in seven waterholes of a wet-dry tropical river sampled early and late in the dry season. We showed that periphyton (as opposed to phytoplankton and terrestrial C3 plant detritus) was responsible for most standing fish biomass (range 42%-97%), whereas benthic invertebrates were reliant on a mixture of the three sources (range 26%-100%). Furthermore, larger, older fishes at high trophic levels (catfish Neoarius spp., sleepy cod Oxyeleotris lineaolatus and barramundi Lates calcarifer) were supported almost exclusively by periphyton. Phytoplankton and detritus supported a considerable biomass of benthic and pelagic invertebrates, but only in taxa that occupied low trophic levels (e.g. snails). These measurements provide further evidence that although periphyton is relatively inconspicuous relative to other sources, it contributes disproportionately to metazoan biomass in wet-dry tropical rivers.

J	Leisenring, M; Moradkhani, H				Leisenring, Marc; Moradkhani, Hamid			Snow water equivalent prediction using Bayesian data assimilation methods	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												Using the U.S. National Weather Service's SNOW-17 model, this study compares common sequential data assimilation methods, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the ensemble square root filter (EnSRF), and four variants of the particle filter (PF), to predict seasonal snow water equivalent (SWE) within a small watershed near Lake Tahoe, California. In addition to SWE estimation, the various data assimilation methods are used to estimate five of the most sensitive parameters of SNOW-17 by allowing them to evolve with the dynamical system. Unlike Kalman filters, particle filters do not require Gaussian assumptions for the posterior distribution of the state variables. However, the likelihood function used to scale particle weights is often assumed to be Gaussian. This study evaluates the use of an empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) based on the Kaplan-Meier survival probability method to compute particle weights. These weights are then used in different particle filter resampling schemes. Detailed analyses are conducted for synthetic and real data assimilation and an assessment of the procedures is made. The results suggest that the particle filter, especially the empirical likelihood variant, is superior to the ensemble Kalman filter based methods for predicting model states, as well as model parameters.

How much influence does landscape-scale physiography have on air temperature in a mountain environment?	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Spatio-temporal patterns of temperature in mountain environments are complex due to both regional synoptic-scale and landscape-scale physiographic controls in these systems. Understanding the nature and magnitude of these physiographic effects has practical and theoretical implications for the development of temperature datasets used in ecosystem assessment and climate change impact studies in regions of complex terrain. This study attempts to quantify the absolute and relative influence of landscape-scale physiographic factors in mediating regional temperatures and assess how these influences vary in time. Our approach was to decompose the variance in in situ temperature measurements into components associated with regional free-air temperature estimates and local physiographic effects. Near-surface air temperature data, collected between 1995 and 2006 from 16 meteorological stations in the Lake Tahoe region of California, USA were regressed against free-air temperature (North American Regional Reanalysis dataset) for the same period. Residuals from this fit represent spatial deviations from the regional mean and were modeled as a function of physiographic position on the landscape using variables derived from terrain analysis techniques. Linear models relating temperature residuals to physiographic variables explained roughly 10-90% of the variance in temperature residuals and had root mean squared error of 1.2-2.0 degrees C, depending upon the type of measurement and time of year. Results demonstrate that: (I) regional temperature patterns were the principle driver of surface temperatures explaining roughly 70-80% of the variance in in situ measurements; (2) the remaining variance was largely explained by spatial variability in land-scapescale physiographic variables; (3) the influence of physiographic drivers varied seasonally and was influenced by regional conditions. Periods of well-mixed atmospheric conditions lend themselves to the use of simple elevation-based lapse rate models for temperature estimation whereas other physiographic effects become more prominent during periods of enhanced atmospheric stability; and lastly (4) small differences in temperature due to landscape position, when integrated over time, can have a prominent effect on water balance and thus hydrologic and ecologic processes.

We apply this approach for JASON-3 nadir altimeter. First, locations were identified in South and South East Asia region as potential candidates for this approach based on river extent. Information on river extent composed of river width and course (i.e., path) from visible (Landsat) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) platform (Sentinel-1). The extent-based approach was applied to filter out non-water radar returns in two methods: 1) River Mask (RM) based K-means (KM) clustering (hence, RM + KM) and 2) K-means clustering embedded with River Mask (RM) (hence, KMRM). Both methods were validated over 12 locations with long records of in-situ height observations and with distinct river characteristics. The maximum benefit observed in utilizing dynamic river mask is during low flow season when the probability of non water radar signal contamination is highest. For highly varying seasonal widths, satellite imagery on river conditions, as an ensemble of techniques, yields heights with higher accuracy. An average RMSE improvement of 40% in 8 out of 12 stations is observed. Overall, at least one of the two dynamic mask-based techniques studied consistently outperformed the conventional technique of altimeter height extraction based on a fixed river mask. Information on river mask or extent can play an important role in highly meandering rivers as the deviation between actual satellite altimeter passes and nominal passes can be considered during the extraction of heights. Compared to visible (Landsat) imagery, SAR was found to be much more effective at improving altimeter height extraction because of the all-weather capability during frequently cloudy conditions. The practicality of the river mask-based approach for altimeter height extraction needs to be carefully considered by the operational end user based on available computational resources and the latency that can be afforded. An ensemble of morphology based techniques using SAR imagery is likely the future of satellite altimeter-based river height extraction in South and South-East Asia where rivers are increasingly impacted by human regulation, encroachment and seasonality.

A limnological comparison of two neighboring major Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Abaya and Lake Chamo are the two largest Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes; they are located close to each other, but have a strikingly different water transparency. We explain key differences in the structure and the functioning of the food web with variation in limnological variables and major pelagic food web compartments within and across both lakes. Data from a detailed comparative investigation of physical and chemical variables and zooplankton community characteristics during the wet and dry season from two consecutive years revealed major differences in key limnological variables between Lake Abaya and Lake Chamo. The most pronounced differences were related to water transparency and the amount of suspended solids in the water column. Lake Abaya is much more turbid, has lower phyto- and zooplankton biomass, and has considerably lower primary production than Lake Chamo. Based on our results, we infer that the profound differences in food web structure between both lakes probably result from differences in sediment load. Finally, our results indicate that conservation programs should focus on reducing sediment inflow from the catchments into the lakes.					; De Meester, Luc/F-3832-2015	Brendonck, Luc/0000-0001-5383-1420; De Meester, Luc/0000-0001-5433-6843; Bauer, Hans/0000-0001-5031-5842; Lemmens, Pieter/0000-0002-3135-9724													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2019	829	1					113	124		10.1007/s10750-018-3707-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3707-8													WOS:000456178700009

Jake			Using eDNA, sediment subfossils, and zooplankton nets to detect invasive spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus)	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												In light of the ongoing spread and adverse impacts of invasive species, there is an urgent need to develop more effective monitoring and management strategies. Such efforts are constrained by our limited capacity to efficiently detect invasive species. Here, we present the case of Bythotrephes longimanus (spiny water flea) invasion into Wisconsin lakes. Detecting Bythotrephes has proven to be challenging due to its capacity to persist at low densities and its highly seasonal population dynamics. We use Bythotrephes to explore detection using three monitoring methods: zooplankton net tows, environmental DNA (eDNA), and sampling of Bythotrephes tail spine subfossils in sediments. Detection probabilities were highly seasonal for both the net tow and eDNA sampling methodsthough detections occurred one to two weeks earlier in net towsand seasonal targeting substantially improved detection by both methods. Conversely, Bythotrephes spine subfossils were found in all 10 lakes with confirmed Bythotrephes populations and in all five samples taken from each lake, except for a single lake where four of the five samples had subfossils. This method was insensitive to seasonally varying population densities as sediments integrate over variation in population densities. In this case, detection and abundance estimation were well covered by sediments and zooplankton nets, respectively, and eDNA provided little additional benefit to surveillance. Our work highlights the importance of choosing methods that address both species life history and monitoring objectives when designing surveillance programs.					; Spear, Michael/R-7188-2019	Vander Zanden, Jake/0000-0002-8122-1416; Spear, Michael/0000-0002-1365-3583; Shannon, Thomas/0000-0002-5446-093X													1387-3547	1573-1464				FEB	2019	21	2					377	389		10.1007/s10530-018-1862-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-018-1862-5													WOS:000459397200010
J	Xia, G; Draxl, C; Optis, M; Redfern, S				Xia, Geng; Draxl, Caroline; Optis, Michael; Redfern, Stephanie			Detecting and characterizing simulated sea breezes over the US northeastern coast with implications for offshore wind energy	WIND ENERGY SCIENCE												With the planned construction of vast offshore wind farms along the US East Coast, identifying and understanding key coastal processes, such as sea breezes, has become a critical need for the sustainability and development of US offshore wind energy. In this study, a new two-step identification method is proposed to detect and characterize three types of sea breezes (pure, corkscrew and backdoor) over the US northeastern coast from a year-long WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) simulation. The results suggest that the proposed detection method can identify the three different types of sea breezes in the model simulation. Key sea breeze features, such as the calm zone associated with pure sea breezes and coastal jets associated with corkscrew sea breezes, are evident in the sea breeze composite imagery. In addition, the simulated sea breeze events indicate a seasonal transition from pure to corkscrew sea breeze between March and August as the land-sea thermal contrast increases. Furthermore, the location and extension of the sea breeze front are different for each type of sea breeze, suggesting that the coastal impact of sea breeze varies with sea breeze type. From the wind energy perspective, the power production associated with a 10 MW offshore wind turbine would be approximately 3 to 4 times larger during a corkscrew sea breeze event than the other two types of sea breezes. This highlights the importance of identifying the correct type of sea breeze in numerical weather/wind energy forecasting.

The Sentinel-1A images of dry and wet seasons in the study area during 2016 and 2020 were initially synthesized based on the median value of the backscatter coefficient. Then, water extraction results were obtained from the combination of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, digital elevation model (DEM), and mathematical morphology model according to preferred textural features.New hydrological insights for the region: Verification regions were selected to evaluate the performance of proposed framework; the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (Kappa) of the proposed method was 94.13% and 0.89, respectively. Meanwhile, the proposed water extraction framework can provide a better performance when compared with state-of-the-art methods (Otsu threshold method, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms) regarding qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The mountain shadows could be eliminated and water continuity improved when the DEM and mathematical morphology model were introduced in the proposed framework. The results indicate that frequent floods and droughts occur in the study area. Additionally, this area is experiencing because of the increases in the water levels and a decline in the regulation and storage capacity of lakes.																				2214-5818				JUN	2022	41								101074	10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101074		APR 2022											WOS:000793577100002

Hydrodynamics and water quality assessment of a coastal lagoon using environmental fluid dynamics code explorer modeling system	GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM												Cienaga de Mallorquin is a coastal lagoon designated as a RAMSAR site due to its ecological regional and international importance. In this work, the environmental fluid dynamics code explorer modeling system was implemented to determine the spatio-temporal distribution of temperature, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand and nutrient levels, and assess the trophic status of Cienaga de Mallorquin. The model was set up with field measurement data taken during transition period and wet season, and secondary information obtained from local authorities and environmental agencies. The results of model simulations were calibrated and verified by the root mean square error method, achieving a consistent fit for all considered variables. Average velocities were between 0.006 m/s and 0.013 m/s during the analyzed periods. The temperature was higher in the wet season than in the transition period (29 degrees C and 31.5 degrees C, respectively). The dissolved oxygen was similar in both periods (6.6 and 6.7 mg/L). NO3 concentrations were higher during the transition period (3.28 mg/L), with a minimum of 1.76 mg/L and a maximum of 5.09 mg/L. The lowest NO3 concentrations were found in the area influenced by the connection with the Caribbean Sea. PO4 concentrations in the wet season were lower than in the transition period (0.20 mg/L). Finally, Cienaga de Mallorquin exhibits high productivity levels with Trophic State Index > 50 and temporal variations of mesotrophic to eutrophic. The use of Trophic State Index is useful for the management of water body eutrophication and productivity, making it particularly important in aquatic ecosystems. (c) 2020 GJESM.

J	Scoglio, GD; Jackson, HO; Purton, S				Scoglio, Gabriel D.; Jackson, Harry O.; Purton, Saul			The commercial potential of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, a nitrogen-fixing edible cyanobacterium	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY												Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (AFA) is a Gram-negative nitrogen-fixing freshwater filamentous cyanobacterium with a rich nutritional profile that is approved for human consumption by both the Food and Drug Administration and the European Food and Safety Authorities. It has a high protein content (60-70%) and contains numerous vitamins, minerals and trace elements together with several high-value compounds with nutraceutical properties, such as C-phycocyanin and beta-phenylethylamine. 500-1000 t of AFA dry biomass are currently wild harvested from natural blooms that occur seasonally in Klamath Lake, Oregon, USA, and distributed as a nutritional supplement worldwide. The requirements and unreliability of wild harvesting, owing to the dependence of AFA growth on environmental conditions and potential contamination by microcystin toxins, threaten the availability of biomass supply and restricts commercial expansion. In this review we propose AFA cultivation in open ponds or closed photobioreactors to obtain a reliable production of unialgal biomass to resolve the supply issue and enhance AFA as a feedstock for specific high-value by-products. Furthermore, we explore potential strategies for maximising overall yield and seasonal robustness by using a synergistic combination of cultivation and wild harvesting. Controlled AFA cultivation would also facilitate the use of genetic manipulation to generate bespoke strains with improved commercial applications, such as increasing the cyanobacterium's nitrogen-fixation rate to enhance its value as a biofertiliser. Ultimately, realising the untapped biotechnological potential of AFA requires a better understanding of its fundamental biology, robust methodologies for laboratory and large-scale cultivation, and the development of AFA-specific genetic engineering techniques.					; Jackson, Harry/AAG-4037-2020	Jackson, Harry/0000-0003-2743-8689; Scoglio, Gabriel Dylan/0009-0007-0879-8749; Purton, Saul/0000-0002-9342-1773													0921-8971	1573-5176				AUG	2024	36	4					1593	1617		10.1007/s10811-024-03214-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-024-03214-0		APR 2024											WOS:001194950700001

The modeling system is driven by realistic wave and current conditions at the open boundaries and high frequency1-D wind measured from a nearby meteorological station. Skill analysis demonstrates that the model reproduces the wave and salinity fields reasonably well. Waves over the Texas-Louisiana shelf are dominated by locally forced wind seas, and generally propagate in the same direction as the winds. Investigation into the spatial differences in the effect of waves reveals two distinct dynamical regions: the Chenier shelf, the shelf region extending roughly offshore from Sabine Lake to Vermilion Bay, and the Louisiana Bight, the region between the Mississippi Delta and Terrebonne Bay. A variety of model runs are performed, where specific wave processes are either included or excluded, in order to isolate the processes acting in different regions. The Chenier shelf is mainly affected by wave enhanced bottom stress, whereas the Louisiana Bight is mostly affected by the surface wave induced mixing and 3-D wave forces. The wave enhanced bottom stress suppresses cross-shore exchange, and acts to trap more freshwater in the nearshore regions shallower than 50 m over the Chenier shelf. Wave enhanced bottom stress plays only a minor role in the Louisiana Bight, where the surface-trapped Mississippi plume rarely feels the bottom. The surface intensified wave mixing and 3-D wave forces reduce the surface salinity and weaken the stratification in the region associated with the thin recirculating Mississippi plume in the Louisiana Bight. Model results indicate that the surface wave mixing, the 3-D wave forces, and the wave bottom stress exhibit little interaction over the Texas-Louisiana shelf. Finally, we have demonstrated that the one-way coupling is capable of resolving the majority of wave effects over the entire shelf if the seasonal scale is of interest. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Results showed that the difference of the average water level of Caizi Lake between the flood and dry seasons was 3.34 m, with a multi-year average water level of 10.42 m above sea level. The first and second main periods of the water level of Caizi Lake were 128 and 18 months, respectively, with 4 and 29 "up-down" cycles, respectively. From 2018, the next 3-4 years were likely to be the low water level period. The water level of Caizi Lake was significantly correlated with that of the Anqing hydrological station of the Yangtze River (r=0.824, P<0.01). In addition, the current hydrological staging of Caizi Lake was about 30 days behind than before the sluice was built. Under the dual influences of the river-lake isolation and the Yangtze-to-Huaihe Water Diversion Project (YHWD), the hydrological regime change of Caizi Lake and its eco-environmental effect needed long-term monitoring and research.																			1009-637X	1861-9568				APR	2021	31	4					551	564		10.1007/s11442-021-1858-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-021-1858-4													WOS:000639845600005

In this study, we examined changes in aquatic vegetation coverage area in two shallow sub-lakes of Poyang Lake (Bang Lake and Cuoji Lake) during the dry season from 1987 to 2017. The relationships between eight water regime components (annual average water level, annual maximum water level, annual minimum water level, and flooded days at five water levels [11, 13, 15, 17, and 19 m]) and aquatic vegetation coverage area were determined. The most critical water regimes were identified and results demonstrated that aquatic vegetation coverage area in Bang Lake and Cuoji Lake peaked in drier years (2005 and 2009, respectively) with no obvious up or down trend. Water regimes indicating high flow events such as annual maximum water level, flooded days at water level 19 m, and annual average water level were found to be more important for predicting aquatic vegetation. High-flow events appear to be essential for understanding aquatic vegetation dynamics in pit lakes, yet overall the influences of water level fluctuation on aquatic vegetation varied among wetland units of Poyang Lake. This study helps to understand the hydroecological dynamics in connected lakes further and provide a reference for the lake management and protection.					; Xu, Ligang/K-2584-2013; Wang, XiaoLong/AGP-5220-2022	Zheng, Lilin/0000-0002-6170-930X; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				MAY 30	2020	34	11					2645	2659		10.1002/hyp.13757	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13757													WOS:000533454500023

Human infection occurs when infected cyprinid fish are consumed raw or undercooked. Ov requires three hosts and presents two free-living parasitic stages. As a consequence Ov transmission and infection in intermediate and human hosts are strongly mediated by environmental factors and understanding how environmental variability influences intermediate host abundance is critical. The objectives of this study were 1) to document water parameters, intermediate hosts abundance and infection spatio-temporal variation, 2) to assess their causal relationships and identify windows of transmission risk. Methodology/Principal Findings Fish and snails were collected monthly for one year at 12 sites in Lawa Lake, an Ov-endemic region of Khon Kaen Province in Northeast Thailand. Physicochemical water parameters [ pH, temperature (Tp), dissolved oxygen (DO), Salinity, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solid (TDS), nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N), lead (Pb), total coliform bacteria (TCB) and fecal coliform bacteria (FCB)] were measured. Multivariate analyses, linear models and kri-ging were used to characterize water parameter variation and its influence on host abundance and infection prevalence. We found that sampling sites could be grouped in three clusters and discriminated along a nitrogen-salinity gradient where higher levels in the lake's southern region predicted higher Bithynia relative abundance (P<0.05) and lower snail and fish species diversity (P<0.05). Highest Bithynia abundance occurred during rainy season (P<0.001), independently of site influence. Cyprinids were the most abundant fish family and higher cyprinid relative abundance was found in areas with higher Bithynia relative abundance (P<0.05). Ov infection in snails was anecdotal while Ov infection in fish was higher in the southern region (P<0.001) at sites showing high FCB. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that water contamination and waterways configuration can influence freshwater communities' assemblages possibly creating ideal conditions for sustained transmission. Sustainable control may require a better appreciation of the system's ecology with wise governance and development planning particularly in the current context of SEA agricultural intensification and landscape modification.					; Echaubard, Pierre/H-3500-2019	Thinkhamrop Suwannatrai, Apiporn/0000-0002-3722-1427; Sripa, Banchob/0000-0001-8899-5919; 													1935-2735					NOV	2016	10	11							e0005121	10.1371/journal.pntd.0005121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005121								27880787					WOS:000392154400041

This study aimed to probe the effects of MC-LR on induction of autophagy in Sertoli cells, as well as the relationship between autophagy and apoptosis. After exposure to various concentrations of MC-LR for 24 or 48 h, cell viability and membrane integrity were significantly decreased under high MC-LR conditions (50-500 nM). The autophagosome marker protein LC3 was increased at mild MC-LR concentrations (0.5-5 nM). However, autophagosomes accumulated to their peak level under high MC-LR conditions in parallel with significantly up-regulated apoptosis. Treatment with an autophagy inhibitor (3-MA) abrogated autophagosome accumulation and apoptosis. This study demonstrated that MC-LR had toxic effects on Sertoli cells by inducing autophagy and apoptosis. The autophagosome accumulation may be involved in the apoptosis induced by MC-LR.

Earlier research from sub-tropical mangrove estuaries, however, has primarily relied on conventional taxonomic methods to determine the pattern of macro-benthos diversity. Therefore, this study aimed to describe the pattern of both taxonomic and functional groups of macro-benthos with respect to ecological variables in three separate seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon) from a mangrove-dominated Pasur River estuary, Bangladesh. The findings revealed significant seasonal variations in the water and sediment parameters (p < 0.05). During the study period, 47 species belonging to 35 families of macro-benthos were identified. The pollution indicator species, Capitella capitata complex was found to be dominant. The highest density of macro-benthos was recorded in post-monsoon (545 & PLUSMN; 13.76 ind./m(2)) followed by pre-monsoon (214 & PLUSMN; 5.57 ind./m(2)) and monsoon (63 & PLUSMN; 2.27 ind./m(2)). Diversity indices, Shannon, and evenness also displayed a similar seasonal trend. This pattern may be explained by the more stable bottom and higher food availability during post-monsoon, and on the other side, by erosion and higher turbidity during monsoon. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) detected a significant difference in community assemblage among the seasons (R = 0.7222, p = 0.0005), whereas similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) identified Dendronereis aestuarina as the most contributory species for the overall average dissimilarity. Six functional feeding groups (FFGs) were identified where gathering collectors (GC) had the highest total density (221.83 ind./m(2)) and relative abundance (26.97%). The community was shown to be shaped by the amount of sedimentary silt and dissolved oxygen in the water main, according to a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) study, they were positively correlated with the abundance of Pristinella acuminata, Lumbrineris sp., Cossura coasta, C. capitata complex, Neritina violacea, Laccotrephes griseus, Hydrometra butleri, Gomphus sp. and Libellula sp. CCA analysis also revealed a significant positive influence of pH, NO3-N, PO4-P, and organic matter, whereas, sand particles of sediments were found to have a negative effect on FFGs. Overall, the study suggests that the estuary is moderately diverse with macro-benthos and their functional feeding groups and influenced by monsoon strongly. The present study on FFGs of macro-benthos in an estuarine river of Bangladesh will provide baseline information for further investigation of other estuaries.

Investigating CO2 fluxes in paddy fields under different management practices is essential for understanding regional carbon cycles affected by human activities. Two-year CO2 fluxes were collected from paired eddy covariance (EC) towers at two paddy fields in southern China. One site is under the traditional farmers' management (direct-seeded early rice and transplanted late rice with continuous flooding (CF) irrigation, FM site), while the other site is under the promotion of milk vetch rotation and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation (PM site). The results showed both sites were CO2 sink with annual cumulative net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) of -744 +/- 21 and -645 +/- 22 g C m(-2) in 2017, and -794 +/- 22 and -766 +/- 20 g C m(-2) in 2018 at the PM and FM site, respectively. After considering the grain carbon, the CO2 budgets were -142 +/- 21 and -59 +/- 22 g C m(-2) in 2017, and -170 +/- 22 and -173 +/- 20 g C m(-2) in 2018 at the PM and FM site, respectively. The partitioning of NEE into gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R-eco) showed that the PM site had higher GPP and Reco, which was mainly caused by the milk vetch growth. The AWD irrigation did not affect the field water conditions of the early rice season, but resulted in 16 more drying days and 5.6% more Reco for the late rice season compared to the FM site. Overall, our results imply that the field with milk vetch rotation and AWD irrigation was able to fix more CO2 in 2017, while it had similar CO2 budgets to the traditional farmers' field when the light and heat conditions during the direct seeded early rice were affluent in 2018.					xiang, zhao/HGB-8063-2022	Liu, Bo/0009-0004-0993-7657													0168-1923	1873-2240				NOV 15	2021	310								108650	10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108650	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108650		SEP 2021											WOS:000698753900026
J	Gunkel, G; Michels, U; Scheideler, M				Gunkel, Guenter; Michels, Ute; Scheideler, Michael			Climate Change: Water Temperature and Invertebrate Propagation in Drinking-Water Distribution Systems, Effects, and Risk Assessment	WATER												This paper provides a summary of the knowledge of drinking-water temperature increases and present daily, seasonal, and yearly temperature data of drinking-water distribution systems (DWDS). The increasing water temperatures lead to challenges in DWDS management, and we must assume a promotion of invertebrates as pipe inhabitants. Macro-, meio-, and microinvertebrates were found in nearly all DWDS. Data in relation to diversity and abundance clearly point out a high probability of mass development, and invertebrate monitoring must be the focus of any DWDS management. The water temperature of DWDS is increasing due to climate change effects, and as a consequence, the growth and reproduction of invertebrates is increasing. The seasonal development of a chironomid (Paratanytarus grimmii) and longtime development of water lice (Asellus aquaticus) are given. Due to increased water temperatures, a third generation of water lice per year has been observed, which is one reason for the observed mass development. This leads to an impact on drinking-water quality and an increased health risk, as invertebrates can serve as a host or vehicle for potential harmful microbes. More research is needed especially on (i) water temperature monitoring in drinking-water distribution systems, (ii) invertebrate development, and (iii) health risks.																				2073-4441				APR	2022	14	8							1246	10.3390/w14081246	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14081246													WOS:000786861200001

To determine the turbidity in large areas, remote sensing technologies have the potential to provide a cost-effective alternative to experimental methods that require extensive time for field data collection and laboratory analysis. This research focuses on the development of an accurate model to estimate and monitor low water turbidity using Sentinel-2 images and field measurements in the Sidi Moussa lagoon of the Moroccan Atlantic coast. Also, the effect of various factors was mentioned and compared qualitatively to the water turbidity variations, including spatiotemporal variation, wind, depth, geomorphology, and vegetation. Among all the regressions analyzed, the Red band was the most successful remote sensing information for water turbidity with a good validation accuracy of R2 = 0.87. ANOVA analysis showed that measured turbidity values vary differently from upstream to downstream of the lagoon. The analysis of the seasonal effect on the water turbidity using one-year multitemporal Sentinel-2 images showed that in the dry season, the mean turbidity is lower than in the rainy season. The water turbidity map derived using the developed algorithm can be used to support wetland management, the conservation of natural resources, and the selection of aquaculture areas. These results highlight the potential contribution of Sentinel-2 to map and monitor the low water turbidity.					; Moumen, Aniss/I-6858-2015; Lhissou, Rachid/AAG-3261-2020	Soufiane, MAIMOUNI/0000-0001-8902-3580; fekri, ahmed/0000-0003-1447-4541; Moumen, Aniss/0000-0001-5330-0136; DAGHOR, Lamia/0009-0003-0196-3140; 													2352-9385					APR	2022	26								100772	10.1016/j.rsase.2022.100772	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.100772													WOS:000803608800001

The results showed that the lake water was well mixed, resulting in no significant thermal stratification. The DO content was decreased in the northwest part of the lake during September and October, resulting in a hypoxic condition. It also varied at different locations of the lake and showed a high heterogeneity and seasonal variability. The Chl-a concentration in Lake Yilong demonstrated seasonal and spatial changes. It was maximum at the center and southwest area of the lake in January. However, in the northwest part of the lake, the maximum value appeared in September and October. The content of TN in the rainy season increased by 75% compared with that in dry season and TP content show a downward trend (from 0.11 mg/L to 0.05 mg/L). The comprehensive nutrition index evaluation shows that the water quality of Lake Yilong in 2016 was middle eutrophic (TLI = 60.56), and that in 2017 (TLI = 56.05) and 2018 (TLI = 56.38) was weak eutrophic, showing that the nutritional status has improved. TN remained at a high level (2.15 +/- 0.48 mg/L), water quality needs further improvement. Based on our monitoring and analysis, it is recommended that human activities in the watershed of the lake should be constrained and managed carefully to maintain the water quality of the lake and adopt effective water quality protection and ecological restoration strategies and measures to promote continuous improvement of water quality, for a sustainable social development.					zhang, xiaonan/D-8565-2015	zhang, xiaonan/0000-0001-6947-945X														2073-4441				NOV	2022	14	21							3385	10.3390/w14213385	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14213385													WOS:000881568600001

In-lake transformations of dissolved organic matter composition in a subalpine lake do not change its biodegradability	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In freshwater ecosystems, dissolved organic matter (DOM) originates from terrestrial and aquatic primary production, and its microbial biodegradability is expected to vary due to differences in its biogeochemical composition. However, the interaction of various DOM sources with the aquatic microbial population remains widely debated. Here, we performed laboratory bioassays, conducted in the dark for 20 d, to examine how changes in DOM composition influence its microbial biodegradability along a hydrological continuum (i.e., lake inlet, lake layers, and lake outlet) of a subalpine lake over four seasons. Despite a predominance of terrestrial DOM and lowest initial abundance of microorganisms, the highest microbial growth rates were observed at the lake inlet (0.0076 +/- 0.0011 cells mL(-1) h(-1)) across all seasons. DOM reactivity differed more with time (seasons) than with space (sampling sites) and DOM compositional differences showed higher degradability in upper lake layers, but not at the lake outlet. Additionally, gradual humification over incubation time was observed in almost all seasons and sites. Overall, an enhanced biodegradability of DOM was not detected even though lake sites were characterized by an autochthonous, presumably labile DOM signature. However, our results highlight the potential of thriving bacteria in terrestrial-dominated DOM environments. This observation challenges a previous hypothesis that DOM of terrestrial origin is less accessible and more recalcitrant, while emphasizing the flexible response of aquatic systems to seasonal fluctuations.

Swan Lake is an exception, where we found extensive areas of Z. japonica beds. The growth of Z. japonica in the lagoon exhibited strong seasonal variation. The maximum shoot density of 9880 +/- 2786 shoots m(-2) occurred in August. The maximum specific growth rate (SGR) of 4.99 +/- 1.99%.d(-1) was recorded in June 2012. SGR might be a good parameter for assessing the growth status of Z. japonica population. N and P contents in the rhizome were significantly lower than those in the leaf and leaf sheath. Lower Cl P ratios suggested P enrichment of the seagrass. The occurrence of Z. japonica in Swan Lake was featured by adapting to the intertidal harsh environments. The transplantation method using sectioned rhizomes would be a potential way for restoration of degraded Z. japonica beds. The establishment of the Rongcheng Swan National Nature Reserve in China has contributed to the survival and expansion of Z japonica in Swan Lake. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Invasive mussels modify the cycling, storage and distribution of nutrients and carbon in a large lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												This study examined the effect of invasive dreissenid mussels on nutrient and carbon dynamics in a large lake (Lake Simcoe, Ontario). We measured rates of nutrient (phosphorus and nitrogen) and carbon excretion and biodeposition by zebra and quagga mussels and the P, N and C content of their soft tissues and shells at different depths throughout the open-water season. Measurements were combined with detailed information about dreissenid biomass and lakewide distribution to examine the impacts of dreissenids on whole-lake dynamics of P, N and C. Mussel tissue P, N and C content and rates of excretion and biodepositon varied among species, seasons and depths, apparently driven by metabolic and stoichiometric factors. Dreissenid mussels excreted, deposited and stored large quantities of P, N and C when compared to lake standing stocks and loadings, and represent an important driver of nutrient cycling in the lake. Living and discarded mussel shell material is shown to represent a potentially important, and hitherto largely overlooked, long-term sink for P, N and C. The concentration of dreissenid biomass in the well-mixed and illuminated littoral portion of L. Simcoe results in redirection of nutrients and carbon from offshore areas to the nearshore zone of the lake. Changes in nutrient and carbon distribution and cycling patterns caused by dreissenid establishment in L. Simcoe and other ecosystems can have implications for the distribution of primary and secondary production and should be considered in the context of water quality and nutrient input management.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				APR	2015	60	4					827	843		10.1111/fwb.12537	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12537													WOS:000351213000019

The upside-down river: Reservoirs, algal blooms, and tributaries affect temporal and spatial patterns in nitrogen and phosphorus in the Klamath River, USA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The Klamath River, located in Oregon/California of the Northwestern U.S., is highly impounded and also experiences large seasonal algal blooms and impaired water quality. We investigated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) constituents for one year (2010-2011) across 193 km of the Klamath River at sites above and below reservoirs and major tributaries to determine the influence of these features on longitudinal and temporal trends in concentrations, loads, and N:P ratios. In general, the headwater lake (Upper Klamath Lake) and reservoirs appeared to be the dominant influence on water quality and nutrient dynamics in the upper river, whereas tributaries appeared to exert stronger influence in the lower river. Overall, high nutrients and poor water quality at upstream sites were ameliorated downstream, however the downstream reductions in N were much greater relative to P. Seasonality appeared to play a major role in the overall appearance and magnitude of longitudinal trends. The greatest upstream-downstream differences occurred during periods of time following large algal blooms in the upper portion of the river. Overall, the amount and composition of N appeared to be strongly driven by algal blooms and biogeochemical conditions such as low oxygen, high pH and warm temperatures in the upper portion of the river, whereas P was more strongly driven by seasonal hydrology. The spatiotemporal influence of reservoirs and tributaries on nutrient flux and nutrient ratios may have significant implications for aquatic communities and ecosystem health. Nutrient objectives should be considered when designing restoration, management, and monitoring objectives for projects involving habitat suitability for anadromous fish and potential dam removal.

We developed a sensitive and automated method to simultaneously analyze eight T&O compounds (boiling points ranging from 38 degrees C to 239 degrees C) by using Purge-and-Trap (P&T) coupled with GC/MS. Maximum particulate dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS, 69.6 ng/L) exceeded its odor threshold concentrations (OTC, 10 ng/L) and maximum dissolved DMTS was 6.1 ng/L, but still far below concentration in the drinking water pollution incident of Wuxi City in 2007 when DMTS reached 1768-11,399 ng/L Geosmin (CEO), 2-methylisoborneol (MIB), beta-cyclocitral, beta-ionone and 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IBMP) occasionally or frequently exceeded their OTCs, whereas 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IPMP) and dimethyl sulfide (DMS) did not. We found for the first time significant correlations between particulate beta-cyclocitral and beta-ionon concentrations and intracellular and extracellular microcystin concentrations. Spatially, Nanquan Waterworks faced more risk by T&O contamination than Xidong Waterworks. High concentrations of NO3-N, TDN and TN could be risky signs of taste and odor events by DMS, DMTS, IPMP, IBMP and GEO. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Active methane processing microbes and the disproportionate role of NC10 phylum in methane mitigation in Amazonian floodplains	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Here we use a top-down and bottom-up approach in landscape ecology to analyze the active microbes processing methane fluxes (FCH4) in seasonally flooded-forest (FOR) and -traditional farming systems (TFS) in Amazonian floodplains flooded with black, white, and clear water. Our results revealed higher CH4 emissions from water-atmosphere interface in clear water floodplain, followed by black and white water floodplain, respectively. Active methanogenic and methanotrophic taxa were ubiquitous at 0-15 and 15-30 cm soil layer in FOR and TFS, with differences among the water types with respect to the richness, evenness and diversity of the methanogenic communities. These ecological results were not generalizable regarding to FOR and TFS sites, soil layers, and non-flooded and flooded periods. Despite the predominant oxidation of CH4 in the non-flooded period, higher richness and diversity of methanotrophs were revealed for FOR and TFS in the flooded period. In turn, the structure of the methanogenic and methanotrophic communities and their variation were influenced mainly by soil physicochemical factors, water type, soil depth and the presence of nitrifiers, as Nitrososphaera and Nitrospira. Our study reveals a signature across methanotrophic communities in soils from Amazon floodplain with different water types, with a putative disproportionate role of NC10 phylum in CH4 mitigation in natural and agricultural Amazonian floodplains. These findings open the possibilities to explore the role of NC10 phylum in the carbon cycling in Amazon.					; forsberg, bruce/AAE-4092-2020; Braga do Carmo, Janaina/D-5648-2013; Bodelier, Paul/A-9591-2011; do carmo, janaina/D-5648-2013; Toppa, Rogério/JAC-8333-2023; Navarrete, Acacio/K-5257-2014; Navarrete, Acacio Aparecido/K-5257-2014; Tsai, Siu/C-2793-2012; Araújo, Maria/ACG-5919-2022; BARROS, DAYANE/AAP-8693-2020; Neu, vania/AAD-9375-2021	Araujo, Maria Gabriella da Silva/0000-0003-1366-9929; altrao carvalho, glauber/0000-0001-5234-6562; Braga do Carmo, Janaina/0000-0002-2871-9880; Juliate Barros, Dayane/0000-0002-5872-4904; Navarrete, Acacio Aparecido/0000-0001-6204-8702; Tsai, Siu/0000-0002-3733-6312; 													0168-2563	1573-515X				NOV	2021	156	2					293	317		10.1007/s10533-021-00846-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-021-00846-z		SEP 2021											WOS:000696776700001

Although microbial community structures and bioprocesses in polluted environments have been fully investigated, they are rarely uncovered in abandoned and highly polluted aquatic environment, especially in a seasonally frozen area. East Lake had been polluted by surrounding paper mills and dairy plants from the 1960s to the early 2000s. Under low biodegradability (BOD5/COD ratio 0.2) and alkalic (pH 9) conditions, a unique microbiome was discovered in East lake. Proteobacteria was the largest taxonomic group in the microbial community, covering almost half of the top-100 genera. Among them, seven genera are sulfate-reducing bacteria, including Desulfuromusa, Desulfuromonas, Desulfobulbus, Desulfocapsa, Desulfurivibrio, Desulfatiglans, and Desulfomicrobium. Functional analysis revealed abundant predicted functional genes for the respiration of sulfur compounds and sulfate respiration. Great vertical variations were found to both microbial community structures and predicted functions. This work provides unique evidence for future microbiome studies of nutrient-rich, alkalic, and seasonally frozen water habitats.					; Tao, Yu/B-9282-2013; Song, lan/OMM-9905-2025; Haoyu, Wang/ABA-7508-2021	Ren, Binqiao/0000-0002-1158-6495; Tao, Yu/0000-0002-5688-0073; Xu, Tiefu/0000-0002-6443-8234; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				MAR	2022	204		B						112056	10.1016/j.envres.2021.112056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.112056		SEP 2021						34534523					WOS:000704721000010

Given the permanence of the introduced economic strategies, which are still practiced today, and their apparently momentous outcome, this process has generally been explained as a success. The introduction of livestock must have played a fundamental role, but we know little about how these newly arrived domestic animals were managed. In this sense, the management of food habits of domestic animals could be a key factor to understand the success of different herding systems during the introduction and adaptation of domesticates in the Iberian Peninsula. Sequential analyses of delta C-13 and delta O-18 values in tooth enamel crowns are here used to provide detailed information about dietary inputs of early caprine and bovine herds introduced into the Iberian Peninsula. Our study was carried out at La Draga (5314-5209 cal BC), a site on the eastern side of Lake Banyoles (Girona, NE Iberian Peninsula). Data show that caprine and bovine herds were fed with variable foddering strategies. Sheep reflect feeding in the swamps or on forest resources with reduced seasonal dietary changes. Goat and cattle herds display food habits that could involve foddering on stored agricultural by-products during specific season times, probably linked to reproductive and productive strategies. This information helps to reconstruct how these early Neolithic communities found the way to success in the new territories of the western Mediterranean.					; Navarrete, Vanessa/K-8847-2017; SAÑA, MARIA/L-9965-2014; SANA, MARIA/L-9965-2014	Navarrete, Vanessa/0000-0001-9377-298X; SANA, MARIA/0000-0002-8344-0639; Balasse, Marie/0000-0003-1925-5110													1047-482X	1099-1212				NOV	2019	29	6					986	998		10.1002/oa.2812	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/oa.2812		SEP 2019											WOS:000485684700001

Grazing intensity affects the environmental impact of dairy systems	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE												Dairy products are major components of the human diet but are also important contributors to global environmental impacts. This study evaluated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, net energy intensity (NEI), and land use of confined dairy systems with increasing levels of pasture in the diet. A Wisconsin farm was modeled to represent practices adopted by dairy operations in a humid continental climate typical in the Great Lakes region and other climates that have large differences in seasonal temperatures. Five grazing scenarios (all of which contained some portion of confinement) were modeled based on different concentrations of dry matter intake from pasture and feed supplementation from corn grain, corn silage, and soybean meal. Scenarios that incorporate grazing consisted of 5 mo of pasture feeding from May to September and 7 mo of confined feeding from October to April. Environmental impacts were compared within the 5 scenarios that incorporate grazing and across 2 entirely confined scenarios with and without on-farm electricity production through anaerobic digestion (AD). To conduct a fair comparison, all scenarios were evaluated based on the same total amount of milk produced per day where resource inputs were adjusted according to the characteristics of each scenario. A cradle-to-farm gate life cycle assessment evaluated the environmental burdens that were partitioned by allocation between milk and meat and by system expansion when biogas-based electricity was produced. Overall, results for all scenarios were comparable. Enteric methane was the greatest contributor to GHG emissions, and the production of crops was the most energy-intense process. For the confined scenario without AD, GHG emissions were 0.87 kg of CO2 equivalents, NEI was 1.59 MJ, and land use was 1.59 m(2)/kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk (FPCM). Anaerobic digestion significantly reduced emissions to 0.28 kg of CO2 equivalents/kg of FPCM, and reduced NEI to -1.26 MJ/kg of FPCM, indicating a net energy producing system and highlighting the potential of AD to improve the sustainability of confined systems. For scenarios that combined confinement and grazing, GHG emissions ranged from 0.84 to 0.92 kg of CO2 equivalents, NEI ranged from 1.42 to 1.59 MJ, and land use ranged from 1.19 to 1.26 m(2)/kg of FPCM. All environmental impacts were minimized in scenarios that supplemented enough feed to increase milk yield but maintained dry matter intake from pasture at a level high enough to reduce material and energy use.

The ecological risk assessment of the contaminants was carried out. The results showed that the sediment samples were heavily polluted with iron and moderately polluted with Cd while other metals posed no pollution problem when compared with USEPA sediment quality guidelines. Only six out of the 16 priority PAHs were detected in the samples, and source apportionment of the PAHs indicated that they are of pyrogenic origin. The Sigma PAHs in the samples were lower than many of similar studies and were of no pollution risk. The ecological risk assessment result of the heavy metals showed that the sediments were of considerable risk due majorly to Cd levels. The HM concentration results statistically showed significant difference between seasons at probability value (P < .05). Data analysis by PCA classified the metals into three different components according to sources. The levels of HMS and PAHs detected in the sediments were correlated for source identification, and the correlation showed that the majority of the pollutants were mainly from anthropogenic sources. There is increasing level of anthropogenic activities at the vicinity of the confluence due to urbanization which may call for periodic monitoring of the sediment quality.					; Yakubu, Monday/ADV-0300-2022	Yakubu, Monday Newman/0000-0002-1251-4709; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				AUG	2017	24	23					18966	18978		10.1007/s11356-017-9511-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9511-6								28656577					WOS:000407723100020

Acoustic monitoring of nocturnally migrating birds accurately assesses the timing and magnitude of migration through the Great Lakes	CONDOR												Tracking the movements of migratory songbirds poses many challenges because much of their journey takes place at night. One promising technique for studying migratory birds relies on microphones to record the nocturnal flight calls produced by birds on the wing. We compared recordings of night flight calls with bird-banding data in a southern Great Lakes ecosystem. We collected >6,200 hr of nocturnal recordings at 7 locations around Lake Erie. We detected >60,000 flight calls from migratory birds and classified 45,775 calls to species level or to a bioacoustic category comprising several species with similar calls. We compared these acoustic data with records of 5,624 birds captured in mist nets. We found that acoustic recordings accurately quantified the magnitude of migration; comparison with mist-net data revealed significant positive correlations between the number of acoustic detections and the number of mist-net detections across species. We also found that acoustic recordings accurately quantified the timing of migration; we found significant positive correlations between the date of passage of the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the populations of up to 25 groups of passage migrant species in the acoustic data and mist-net data. A careful examination of 6 species with distinctive flight calls revealed only subtle seasonal differences between peak detections via acoustic monitoring and mist netting, at both daily and weekly timescales. This research enhances our understanding of the role that acoustic sampling can play in monitoring migratory birds, providing important empirical support for the validity of night-flight-call monitoring.

In this study, we collected social data in four communities in the central Ethiopian Highlands on farmers' climate perceptions and adaptations using group discussions and PRA tools. We related these to climate data spanning 30 years (1981 to 2010), consisting of daily minimum temperature, maximum temperature and precipitation, modelled for the four communities using global databases and regional meteorological data. We found that farmers' climate perceptions showed considerable spatial and gender differences. Perceptions matched well with records describing climate variability, particularly in terms of the shortening and the increased variability of the rainy season, as well as the occurrence of extreme drought in recent years. Climate change, described by long-term average increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation, was perceived, but with subordinate priority. Perceived climate impacts included reduced crop yield, increased occurrence of pests and diseases and increased crop damage by extreme events and poverty. Adaptations were mainly land based and included agronomic measures, land management and ecosystem restoration. Furthermore, important gender differences in adaptation could be traced back to typical gender roles. Results highlight the risk of broadcast adaptation programs, such as the government-propagated combination of mineral fertilizers and early maturing crop varieties. Most importantly, they point to the need to consider climate variability, site- and gender-specific perceptions and priorities.					; Altasub, Yonas W./KCK-1782-2024; Habermann, Birgit/AAP-4083-2021; Abiyu, Abrham/W-2207-2018	Darabant, Andras/0000-0002-2247-6064; Altasub, Yonas W./0000-0001-5292-3147; Habermann, Birgit/0000-0001-7130-670X; 													0165-0009	1573-1480				NOV	2020	163	1			SI		481	497		10.1007/s10584-020-02889-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-020-02889-x		OCT 2020											WOS:000579592000001

Environmental factors influencing phytoplankton communities in Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan, Canada	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Diefenbaker (LD) is a large reservoir located in the Canadian Prairies. Approximately 98% of the inflow is from the South Saskatchewan River (SSR). The composition and ecology of the phytoplankton community along the length of LD has not been reported since the 1980s. This is a potential problem for a reservoir that serves as an important source of water for indirect domestic consumption, irrigation, and recreation. Therefore, we examined epilimnetic whole water samples along the length of LD during the open-water season (June to October) in 2011 and 2012. We estimated the trophic status from chlorophyll a (TSIchl a) and examined the phytoplankton community in relation to environmental factors. We observed high flow events that carried large nutrient loads and associated turbidity into LD from the SSR. Despite the high flow events, mean TSIchi (a) placed LD as a mesotrophic system with a highly diverse phytoplankton community (72 genera). The increased nutrient and non-algal turbidity associated with high flow events may be related to the dominance of the cryptophytes and the bacillariophytes (both constituted similar to 89% of the total phytoplankton biomass). Inflow and water temperature explained 41% of the variation in cryptophyte biomass, whereas mixing depth and particulate nitrogen to particulate phosphorus molar ratios explained 38% of the variation in bacillariophyte biomass. Despite the low cyanobacterial biomass (<5%), we observed some potential toxin and bloom-forming genera that may threaten the water quality of LD if conditions become favorable during low flow.

K.; Drikas, Mary; Eikebrokk, Bjornar			Comparison of NOM character in selected Australian and Norwegian drinking waters	WATER RESEARCH												Observations from many countries around the world during the past 10-20 years indicate increasing natural organic matter (NOM) concentration levels in water sources, due to issues such as global warming, changes in soil acidification, increased drought severity and more intensive rain events. In addition to the trend towards increasing NOM concentration, the character of NOM can vary with source and time (season). The great seasonal variability and the trend towards elevated NOM concentration levels impose challenges to the water industry and the water treatment facilities in terms of operational optimisation and proper process control. The aim of this investigation was to compare selected raw and conventionally treated drinking water sources from different hemispheres with regard to NOM character which may lead to better understanding of the impact of source water on water treatment. Results from the analyses of selected Norwegian and Australian water samples showed that Norwegian NOM exhibited greater humic nature, indicating a stronger bias of allochthonous versus autochthonous organic origin. Similarly, Norwegian source waters had higher average molecular weights than Australian waters. Following coagulation treatment, the organic character of the recalcitrant NOM in both countries was similar. Differences in organic character of these source waters after treatment were found to be related to treatment practice rather than origin of the source water. The characterisation techniques employed also enabled identification of the coagulation processes which were not necessarily optimised for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal. The reactivity with chlorine as well as trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) of the treated waters showed differences in behaviour between Norwegian and Australian sources that appeared to be related to residual higher molecular weight organic material. By evaluation of changes in specific molecular weight regions and disinfection parameters before and after treatment, correlations were found that relate treatment strategy to chlorine demand and DBP formation.

Aragonite laminae, first found from Eocene to Miocene strata in the western Qaidam Basin, northern Tibet Plateau, contain much information on paleolake signatures. Mineralogical and geochemical analyses were conducted on alternating yellowish and grayish aragonite layers. The yellowish layers are mainly composed of aragonite crystals, while the grayish layers contain less aragonite and fewer organic remnants that accumulate among debris with sporadic framboidal pyrite. The delta C-13 values of yellowish layers are remarkably positive by approximately 4.01%. (VPDB), and the delta O-18 values are slightly negative compared with base data of the Qaidam Basin. Considering the (CO2)-C-12 absorption of algal blooms, positive excursions of delta C-13 shown in aragonite indicate high C-13 values in depositional water. Therefore, a seasonal algal-influenced inorganic origin is proposed to explain the formation of aragonite laminae. During warm seasons, Mg/Ca ratios are elevated because of evaporation effects. The algal blooms decrease the CO2 content, leading to high pH values. These conditions promote the rapid crystal growth of aragonite instead of other carbonate minerals. Slightly negative delta O-18 values in yellowish layers are interpreted as the result of intense inflow during warm seasons, which leads to less precipitation of organic matter and debris. The grayish layers in cold seasons are the opposite. From the Eocene to Oligocene, the progressively decreasing delta O-18 values of aragonite reflect global cooling during this time. A conspicuously positive step in delta O-18 values indicates an arid environment coinciding with the uplift of the Himalaya, from the Oligocene to Lower Miocene. The results from this study show that understanding of aragonite in the Qaidam Basin is essential to reconstruct the high-resolution paleoenvironment and to reveal the Tertiary evolution of paleoclimates in the northern Tibet Plateau.

Application of a 3D hydrodynamic-biological model for seasonal and spatial dynamics of water quality and phytoplankton in Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In large lakes, temporal variability is compounded by strong spatial variability associated with mesoscale physical processes such as upwelling and basin-scale circulation. Here we explore the ability of a three dimensional model (ELCOM-CAEDYM) to capture temporal and spatial variability of phytoplankton and nutrients in lake Erie. We emphasized the east basin of the lake, where an invasion by dreissenid mussels has given special importance to the question of spatial (particularly nearshore-offshore) variability and many comparative observations were available. We found that the model, which did not include any simulation of the mussels or of smaller diffuse nutrient sources, could capture the major features of the temperature, nutrient and phytoplankton variations. Within basin variability was large compared to among-basin variability, especially but not exclusively in the western regions. Consistent with observations in years prior to, but not after, the mussel invasion the model predicted generally higher phytoplankton concentrations in the nearshore than the offshore zones. The results suggest that the elevated phytoplankton abundance commonly observed in the nearshore of large lakes in the absence of dreissenid mussels does not have to depend on localized nutrient inputs but can be explained by the favourable light, temperature and nutrient environment in the shallower and energetic nearshore zone. The model is currently being extended to allow simulation of the effects of dreissenid mussels. (C) 2010 International Association for Great Lakes Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Use of in vivo phycocyanin fluorescence to monitor potential microcystin-producing cyanobacterial biovolume in a drinking water source	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING												The source water of a drinking water treatment plant prone to blooms, dominated by potential microcystin-producing cyanobacteria, was monitored for two seasons in 2007-2008. In the 2008 season, the median value for potential microcystin-producing cyanobacterial biovolume was 87% of the total phytoplankton biovolume in the untreated water of the plant. Depth profiles taken above the plant's intake identified three sampling days at high risk for the contamination of the plant's raw water with potentially toxic cyanobacteria. Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae caused false positive values to be generated by the phycocyanin probe when cyanobacteria represented a small fraction of the total phytoplanktonic biovolume present. However, there was little interference with the phycocyanin probe readings by other algal species when potential microcystin-producing cyanobacteria dominated the phytoplankton of the plant's untreated water. A two-tiered method for source water monitoring, using in vivo phycocyanin fluorescence, is proposed based on (1) a significant relationship between in vivo phycocyanin fluorescence and cyanobacterial biovolume and (2) the calculated maximum potential microcystin concentration produced by dominant Microcystis sp. biovolume. This method monitors locally-generated threshold values for cyanobacterial biovolume and microcystin concentrations using in vivo phycocyanin fluorescence.					prevost, michele/HOC-8215-2023														1464-0325	1464-0333				FEB	2011	13	2					455	463		10.1039/c0em00163e	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0em00163e								21157617					WOS:000287152200045

An asymmetric distribution of lakes on Titan as a possible consequence of orbital forcing	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												A set of lakes filled or partially filled with liquid hydrocarbon and empty lake basins have been discovered in the high latitudes of Saturn's moon Titan(1). These features were mapped by the radar instrument on the Cassini orbiter(1-4). Here we quantify the distribution of the lakes and basins, and show a pronounced hemispheric asymmetry in their occurrence. Whereas significant fractions of the northern high latitudes are covered by filled and empty lakes(5), the same latitudes in the southern hemisphere are largely devoid of such features. We propose that in addition to known seasonal changes, the observed difference in lake distribution may be caused by an asymmetry in the seasons on Titan that results from the eccentricity of Saturn's orbit around the Sun. We suggest that the consequent hemispheric difference in the balance between evaporation and precipitation could lead to an accumulation of lakes in one of Titan's hemispheres. This effect would be modulated by, and reverse with, dynamical variations in the orbit. We propose that much like in the Earth's glacial cycles, the resulting vigorous hydrologic cycle(6) has a period of tens of thousands of years and leads to active geologic surface modification in the polar latitudes.

In this study, the temporal and spatial variations of Poyang Lake's water level and the river-lake interactions were investigated using mathematical statistics and regression models. New hydrological insights for the region: Extreme drought occurrences in Poyang Lake have increased over fourfold compared to previous periods since the 21st century. The 2022 extreme drought represents the most intense, severe, and prolonged drought event in Poyang Lake since 1956. It is characterized by unprecedented low water levels during both the flood and dry seasons. The study further emphasizes the changes in river-lake interactions during the extreme drought, indicating a reduced blocking effect of the Yangtze River on Poyang Lake during the flood season and a diminished emptying effect during the retreating and dry seasons. Compared to multi-year averages, reduced upstream discharge, Yangtze River flow, and the Three Gorges Dam operations during this drought contributed 23.68 %, 38.10 %, and 38.22 % respectively to the water level decline. During the drought period, both natural precipitation-driven flow increase in upstream rivers and water released from the dam provided short-term relief, though insufficient to fully mitigate the drought conditions.

J	Scheller, EL; Ingalls, M; Eiler, JM; Grotzinger, JP; Ryb, U				Scheller, Eva L.; Ingalls, Miquela; Eiler, John M.; Grotzinger, John P.; Ryb, Uri			The mechanisms and stable isotope effects of transforming hydrated carbonate into calcite pseudomorphs	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Ikaite (CaCO3 center dot 6H(2)O) and monohydrocalcite (CaCO3 center dot H2O; MHC) are hydrated carbonates that form at frigid (<9 degrees C) temperatures. During gradual heating and dehydration, the more thermodynamically stable anhydrous calcite replaces and pseudomorphs ikaite and MHC. Previously, ikaite pseudomorphs have been identified in the sedimentary record by characteristic replacive macro- and microtextures and interpreted as evidence for near-freezing marine paleotemperatures. Prior to this study, we lacked an understanding of isotopic exchange during mineral dehydration necessary to interpret isotopic compositions of such fabrics. Specifically, do the stable isotopic compositions of ikaite pseudomorphs preserve the primary environmental signal, or are they altered during mineral transformation? Through heating experiments of MHC from Ikka Fjord, we find that delta O-18(CARB) and Delta(47) decreased, while delta C-13(CARB) remained nearly unchanged during progressive dehydration. An oxygen isotopic exchange model fitted to experimental data suggests that the isotopic changes reflected partial re-equilibration of delta O-18(CARB) and.47 towards the new diagenetic conditions due to oxygen equilibrium exchange between CO32- and H2O within the MHC lattice. However, this process never reaches full equilibrium, an effect we argue reflects the fact that structural H2O escapes the solid carbonate structure faster than isotopic exchange can reach equilibrium. In addition, labelled water experiments demonstrated that oxygen isotopic exchange also occurs with secondary external waters during dehydration. We apply this new framework to interpret the isotopic compositions of Pleistocene ikaite pseudomorphs from Mono Lake (CA, USA) high-stand deposits, which have undergone subaerial dehydration. Specifically, dehydration diagenetic overprinting of Delta(47) similar to the results of our controlled heating experiments can explain the warm temperatures, 6-26 degrees C, recorded by ikaite pseudomorphs and the higher delta O-18(CARB) recorded by ikaite pseudomorph compared to other Pleistocene Mono Lake calcite tufas. We show that Mono Lake ikaite pseudomorph tufa isotopic data can be explained in a model scenario where approximately coeval precursor ikaite and other calcite tufas in Pleistocene Mono Lake formed from similar fluid compositions but at different water temperatures, likely related to changing seasons. In summary, we show that the isotopic composition of ikaite and MHC pseudomorphs can be used for paleoclimate reconstruction of water temperature, delta O-18(CARB), delta O-18(fluid), and delta C-13(CARB) when considering dehydration diagenetic effects.

Our study investigated the occurrence and distribution of five antibiotics, i.e., metronidazole (MET), sulfamethoxazole (SMZ), ciprofloxacin (CFX), norfloxacin (NFX), and enrofloxacin (EFX), in the surface water from Erlong Lake, China. With the seasonal and spatial variations of antibiotics, this study developed an interdisciplinary approach for the ecological risk of antibiotics considering the natural, human, and socioeconomic elements of watershed based on the risk theory of natural disaster. This approach integrates the geographic information system (GIS) spatial analysis tool, natural disaster theory, "driving force"-"pressure"-"state"-"impact"-"response" (DPSIR) model, and ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operators in terms of various environmental factors, representing a new ecological risk paradigm for environmental managers or decision-makers to identify environmental change. A total of 69 samples were collected in wet, dry, and normal seasons from 2017 to 2018, and laboratory analyses revealed that four antibiotics (MET, SMZ, CFX, and NFX) were widely detected in the lake. The mean concentrations decreased in the order of MET (1041.7 ng L-1) > SMZ (771.4 ng L-1) > CFX (646.4 ng L-1) > NFX (179.0 ng L-1) > EFX (15.3 ng L-1), with their levels in natural surface waters higher than those in other studies. Antibiotic concentrations were higher in dry seasons than in other seasons, and the concentrations were strongly correlated with EC (electrical conductivity), pH, DOC (dissolved organic carbon), and TP (total phosphorus) according to redundancy analysis (RDA). Significant seasonal variations were found in CFX and EFX (ANOVA, p < 0.001). For the whole watershed, the ecological extremely and heavily vulnerable levels were concentrated in the central and northwest regions of the watershed, i.e., Changling county and Lishu county. Hence, the ecological distributions of extreme risk and heavy risk posed by the five selected antibiotics were assessed by using the mixture hazard quotient methods and DPSIR model which were also located in these counties in different seasons. The antibiotic results of ecosystem risk assessment can support decision-makers in identifying and prioritizing the necessary taking of specific measures and different risk attitudes to preserve the quality of ecological health for a city or multiple counties.

Biosedimentary and geochemical constraints on the precipitation of mineral crusts in shallow sulphate lakes	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Seasonal desiccation of Mg2+-(Na+)-(Ca2+)-SO42--(Cl-) saline lakes in La Mancha (Central Spain) that host microbial mats led to the precipitation of hydrated Na-Mg sulphates and gypsum. Sulphates precipitated in the submerged conditions form extensive biolaminites, whilst in marginal areas they produce thin crusts. Sedimentological, mineralogical, petrographic and high resolution textural studies reveal that the crusts were formed within the benthic microbial mats that thrive at salinities ranging from 160 to 340 g.L-1. The minerals of the crusts are primary bloedite (Na2Mg(SO4)(2)center dot 4H(2)O), epsomite (MgSO(4 center dot)7H(2)O), gypsum (CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O) and mirabilite (Na2SO4 center dot 10H(2)O), as well as secondary hexahydrite (MgSO4 center dot 6H(2)O) and thenardite (Na2SO4). Primary bloedite crystals, which form the framework of surficial and submerged crusts are seen to nucleate subaqueously and grow incorporatively within the matgrounds. Displacive and incorporative epsomite grows on previous bloedite crystals and also on the ground. Mirabilite is precipitated rapidly at the brine-air interface over bloedite and epsomite. Hexahydrite and thenardite are formed due to dehydration of epsomite and mirabilite, respectively. Hydrochemical modeling with PHREEQC indicated that evaporitic biolaminites are forming from brines under saturated with respect to bloedite, epsomite and mirabilite, which suggests that the microorganisms contribute to the heterogeneous nucleation of the sulphates in the microbial mats. Unlike carbonates, the influence of microbes on the growth and morphology of complicated double salts such as bloedite has not been documented previously and provides a new perspective on the formation of hydrated sulphate minerals that are common on Earth as well as other planets.

J	Yang, SH; Xiao, YN; Xu, JZ				Yang, Shihong; Xiao, Ya'nan; Xu, Junzeng			Organic fertilizer application increases the soil respiration and net ecosystem carbon dioxide absorption of paddy fields under water-saving irrigation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Quantifying carbon sequestration in paddy soil is necessary to understand the effect of agricultural practices on carbon cycles. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of organic fertilizer addition (MF) on the soil respiration and net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption of paddy fields under water-saving irrigation (CI) in the Taihu Lake Region of China during the 2014 and 2015 rice-growing seasons. Compared with the traditional fertilizer and water management (FC), the joint regulation of CI and MF (CM) significantly increased the rice yields and irrigation water use efficiencies of paddy fields by 4.02 similar to 5.08 and 83.54 similar to 109.97% (p < 0.05). The effects of organic fertilizer addition on soil respiration and net ecosystem CO2 absorption rates showed inter-annual differences. CM paddy fields showed a higher soil respiration and net CO2 absorption rates during some periods of the rice growth stage in the first year and during most periods of the rice growth stage in the second year. These fields also had significantly higher total CO2 emission through soil respiration (total Rsoil) and total net CO2 absorption compared with FC paddy fields (p < 0.05). The total Rsoil and net ecosystem CO2 absorption of CM paddy fields were 67.39 similar to 91.55 and 129.41 similar to 113.75 mol m(-2), which were 27.66 similar to 135.52 and 12.96 similar to 31.66% higher than those of FC paddy fields. The interaction between water and fertilizer management had significant effects on total net ecosystem CO2 absorption. The frequent alternate wet-dry cycles of CI paddy fields increased the soil respiration and reduced the net CO2 absorption. Organic fertilizer promoted the soil respiration of paddy soil but also increased its net CO2 absorption and organic carbon content. Therefore, the joint regulation of water-saving irrigation and organic fertilizer is an effective measure for maintaining yield, increasing irrigation water use efficiency, mitigating CO2 emission, and promoting paddy soil fertility.

The potential of the zooplankton resting-stage bank to restore communities in permanent and temporary waterbodies	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												We assessed how the viability and diversity of the zooplankton resting-stage bank can be affected by predictable and unpredictable hydroperiods using permanent and temporary lakes. We hypothesized that the zooplankton resting-stage bank in temporary waterbodies would be affected by the length of the dry period (seasonal, intermittent and episodic). We also tested the role of dried macrophyte mats in preserving resting-stage banks in temporary lakes. Laboratory experiments were conducted with sediment samples from two permanent waterbodies and three temporary shallow lakes that undergo dry periods of different lengths (seasonal, intermittent and > 10 years dry). The results of the experiments suggested that the dry period length significantly affected the viability and diversity of the resting-stage bank, affecting its potential role in zooplankton community recovery. Longer dry periods also affected the temporal hatching response of resting stages from temporary lakes: species from unpredictably drying waterbodies experienced delayed hatching. Resting-stage viability and richness were largely and positively influenced by dried macrophyte mats, which surpassed the efficiency of the sediment as a substrate for conserving resting stages. Our results provide new insight on the functional role of macrophytes indicating that these beds are pivotal in conserving resting stages and increasing zooplankton community resilience.

For the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), floods from the Peace and Athabasca rivers are critical for sustaining abundant shallow water habitat, but their frequency has been in decline for decades over much of its area. Here, we assess current hydrological and limnological status in the PAD by integrating spatial and temporal data. Analysis of water isotope compositions and water chemistry measured at numerous lakes across the delta shows that hydro-limnological effects of the large-scale ice-jam flood event of 2014 failed to persist beyond the early ice-free season of 2015. Isotope-inferred paleohydrological records from five hydrologically representative lakes in the PAD indicate that periodic desiccation during the Little Ice Age occurred at the most elevated basin in response to locally arid climatic conditions, yet other lower elevation sites were influenced by high water level on Lake Athabasca owing to increased snowmelt- and glacier-derived river discharge. In contrast, water isotope data during the past 15 yr at all five lakes consistently document the strong role of evaporation, a trend which began in the early to mid-20th century according to sediment records and is indicative of widespread aridity unprecedented during the past 400 yr. We suggest that integration of hydrological and limnological approaches over space and time is needed to inform assessment of contemporary lake conditions in large, complex floodplain landscapes.					; Remmer, Casey/LZI-3542-2025; Hall, Roland/K-3165-2019	Hall, Roland/0000-0002-0314-6449; Klemt, Wynona/0000-0002-7529-6155; Remmer, Casey/0000-0003-2626-3012; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2018	63	4					1502	1518		10.1002/lno.10787	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10787													WOS:000440928800004

Validation of high-resolution TRMM-3B43 precipitation product using rain gauge measurements over Kyrgyzstan	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												This paper presents the validation of monthly precipitation using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA)-3B43 product with conventional rain gauge observations for the period 1998-2007 over Kyrgyzstan. This study is carried out to quantify the accuracy of TMPA-3B43 product over the high latitude and complex orographic region. The present work is quite important because it is highly desirable to compare the TMPA precipitation product with the ground truth data at a regional scale, so that the satellite product can be fine-tuned at that scale. For the validation, four different types of spatial collocation have been used: station wise, climatic zone wise, topographically and seasonal. The analysis has been done at the same spatial and temporal scales in order to eliminate the sampling biases in the comparisons. The results show that TMPA-3B43 product has statistically significant correlation (r = 0.36-0.88) with rain gauge data over the most parts of the country. The minimum linear correlation is observed around the large continental water bodies (e.g., Issyk-Kul lake; r = 0.17-0.19). The overall result suggests that the precipitation estimated using TMPA-3B43 product performs reasonably well over the plain regions and even over the orographic regions except near the big lake regions. Also, the negative bias suggests the systematic underestimation of high precipitation by TMPA-3B43 product. The analyses suggest the need of a better algorithm for precipitation estimation over this region separately to capture the different types of rain events more reliably.

This poses a significant challenge to the community as synoptic and frequent Chla "measurements" from satellites are in high demand by various government agencies and environmental groups to help make management decisions. Here, using 10 years of in situ and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements from a moderately sized, turbid estuary, Tampa Bay (Florida, USA), we developed and validated a new algorithm specifically designed for retrieving Chla from MODIS data. The algorithm takes the red-to-green remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs(lambda)) band ratio of [Rrs(667) + Rrs(678)]/[Rrs(531) + Rrs(547)] as the independent variable, and estimates Chla through the non-linear regression function: Ln(Chla) = 1.91Ln(x) + 3.40 (R-2 = 0.87, N = 97, p < 0.01, 1.5 < Chla < 80 mg m(-3)) where 'x' is the band ratio. Validation of the algorithm using two independent datasets collected by different groups and near-concurrent MODIS measurements showed robust algorithm performance for Chla within this range, with mean relative errors of 25.8% and 41.7% for the two datasets. Time-series analyses at representative stations using both in situ and MODIS Chla also showed general agreement, with instances of noticeable discrepancy attributed to different measurement frequencies. The algorithm was implemented to establish a 10-year Chla data record for Tampa Bay in order to serve as a baseline for monitoring future phytoplankton bloom events. The 10-year Chla data record showed substantial variability in both space and time, with generally higher Chla observed during the wet season and in upper bay segments, and Chla minima observed in all bay segments during May and June. These spatial and temporal distributions appear to be regulated primarily by wind and river discharge, which also explain the significant declining trend in Chla since 2005. The established 10-year MODIS-based Chla data record provides complementary information to existing field-based monitoring programs, helping to make nutrient reduction management decisions. Furthermore, preliminary tests of the algorithm for the Chesapeake Bay and for Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) measurements suggest possible applicability of the proposed approach to other estuaries and satellite ocean color sensors.

J	Oplustil, S; Simunek, Z; Zajíc, J; Mencl, V				Oplustil, Stanislav; Simunek, Zbynek; Zajic, Jaroslav; Mencl, Vaclav			Climatic and biotic changes around the Carboniferous/Permian boundary recorded in the continental basins of the Czech Republic	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY												The paper provides an overview of a several decades-long study of transitional Carboniferous-Permian (Stephanian C-Autunian) sedimentary successions in continental basins of the Czech part of the Bohemian Massif. These predominantly monotonous fluvial red beds intercalate with laterally widespread grey to variegated sediments of dominantly lacustrine origin. Both, fossil and climatic records show that apart from a generally known long-term climatic shift to drier conditions in Early Permian, the climate oscillated on several time scales throughout the study interval. Climatic indicators in the red beds part of the succession include palaeosols ranging between red vertisols and vertic calcisols suggesting strongly seasonal dry sub-humid climate. This is in agreement with the rarity of plant remains, which were mostly completely oxidised and only rarely preserved as plant impression in red mudstones or as silicified mostly gymnosperm woods in sandy channel fills. Silicification instead of coalification was the dominant fossilisation process during red-beds deposition. Even drier, possibly semi-arid climate may be indicated by spatially and temporarily restricted bimodal sandstones, dominated by well-rounded quartz grains and interpreted as eolian in origin. Periods of moist sub-humid (or even humid) climate were accompanied by formation of perennial lakes containing grey laminated mudstones, dark grey bituminous mudstones or limestones, muddy limestones, chert layers or even spatially restricted coals, some of them, however, of economic importance. Shorter climatic oscillations operating on a scale of tens to possibly hundreds of thousands of years are represented by transgressive-regressive lacustrine cycles followed by significant changes in lake water salinity reflected by boron content. The fossil record indicates the presence of dryland and wetland biomes in basinal lowlands although their proportions varied significantly as the climate changed. During deposition of red beds, the alluvial plain was vegetated dominantly by dryland biome assemblages. The composition of these assemblages is indicated by fairly common silicified gymnosperm (cordaitalean and coniferous) woods in sandstone-conglomerate fluvial channel bedforms and by poorly preserved impressions of walchian conifer shoots and cordaitalean leaves in associated mudstone intercalations. This is in agreement with sub-vertical root rhizolites and haloes in calcic vertisols. Occurrence of "wet spots" colonised by wetland assemblages is indicated by rather exceptional findings of silicified calamite stems in fluvial red beds associated with gymnospermous woods. During the humid intervals parts of the basinal lowlands were occupied by lakes surrounded by broad belts of wetland biome floras. During the "Stephanian C" most of these floras were dominated by tree ferns, calamites and sub-dominant pteridosperms. Local peat swamps were colonised by lycopsids including Sigillaria brardii, Asolanus camptotaenia and even some lepidodendrid lycopsids. In contrast, the fossil record of "Stephanian C" dryland floras is rarely preserved in lacustrine sediments. The fossil record of "Autunian" lakes, however, suggests increasing proportions of chyland elements, including conifers and peltasperms. The response of lacustrine faunas to climatic oscillations around the Carboniferous-Permian transition is less prominent than that of plants. The origin of the transition between the local Elonichthys-Sphaerolepis and Acanthodes gracilis bio/ecozones around the Carboniferous/Permian boundary is impossible to deduce from the existing fossil record.

Seasonal thaw settlement at drained thermokarst lake basins, Arctic Alaska	CRYOSPHERE												Drained thermokarst lake basins (DTLBs) are ubiquitous landforms on Arctic tundra lowland. Their dynamic states are seldom investigated, despite their importance for landscape stability, hydrology, nutrient fluxes, and carbon cycling. Here we report results based on high-resolution Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements using space-borne data for a study area located on the North Slope of Alaska near Prudhoe Bay, where we focus on the seasonal thaw settlement within DTLBs, averaged between 2006 and 2010. The majority (14) of the 18 DTLBs in the study area exhibited seasonal thaw settlement of 3-4 cm. However, four of the DTLBs examined exceeded 4 cm of thaw settlement, with one basin experiencing up to 12 cm. Combining the InSAR observations with the in situ active layer thickness measured using ground penetrating radar and mechanical probing, we calculated thaw strain, an index of thaw settlement strength along a transect across the basin that underwent large thaw settlement. We found thaw strains of 10-35% at the basin center, suggesting the seasonal melting of ground ice as a possible mechanism for the large settlement. These findings emphasize the dynamic nature of permafrost landforms, demonstrate the capability of the InSAR technique to remotely monitor surface deformation of individual DTLBs, and illustrate the combination of ground-based and remote sensing observations to estimate thaw strain. Our study highlights the need for better description of the spatial heterogeneity of landscape-scale processes for regional assessment of surface dynamics on Arctic coastal lowlands.

Impact of Climate Variability on Runoff in the North-Central United States	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												Large changes in runoff in the north-central United States have occurred during the past century, with larger floods and increases in runoff tending to occur from the 1970s to the present. The attribution of these changes is a subject of much interest. Long-term precipitation, temperature, and streamflow records were used to compare changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) to changes in runoff within 25 stream basins. The basins studied were organized into four groups, each one representing basins similar in topography, climate, and historic patterns of runoff. Precipitation, PET, and runoff data were adjusted for near-decadal scale variability to examine longer-term changes. A nonlinear water-balance analysis shows that changes in precipitation and PET explain the majority of multidecadal spatial/temporal variability of runoff and flood magnitudes, with precipitation being the dominant driver. Historical changes in climate and runoff in the region appear to be more consistent with complex transient shifts in seasonal climatic conditions than with gradual climate change. A portion of the unexplained variability likely stems from land-use change.

A 10-Year Warm-Season Climatology of Horizontal Convective Rolls and Cellular Convection in Central Oklahoma	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Horizontal convective rolls (HCRs) and cellular convection (cells) are frequently observed within the planetary boundary layer. Yet understanding of the evolution, seasonal variation, and characteristics of such boundary layer phenomena is limited as previous studies used observations from field experiments or satellites. As a result, little is known about the mean climatology and monthly variation of HCRs and cells. Polarimetric WSR-88D radar observations are used to develop a 10-yr April-September climatology in central Oklahoma including HCR and cell occurrence, duration, and aspect ratios as well as HCR orientation angles and wavelengths. Results indicate that HCRs or cells occur on over 92% of days without precipitation during the warm season. HCRs or cells typically form in midmorning and may persist throughout the day or transition between modes before dissipating around sunset. HCRs generally persist for 1-6 h with typical wavelengths of 2-10 km and most aspect ratios between 1 and 7. Rolls are often oriented within 10 degrees of the mean boundary layer wind but can be as much as 30 degrees off this direction. Mean HCR aspect ratios in this study remain constant during the afternoon, but decrease early in the day and increase late in the day, diverging from previous overland HCR studies. Cells generally persist for 2-6 h with aspect ratios of 1-6. These results should facilitate future studies on convection initiation, formation mechanisms of boundary layer organization, and model parameterization.																			0027-0644	1520-0493				JAN	2020	148	1					21	42		10.1175/MWR-D-19-0136.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-19-0136.1													WOS:000502381200002
J	Zhang, RY; Wu, BS				Zhang, Ruoyin; Wu, Baosheng			Environmental Impacts of High Water Turbidity of the Niulan River to Dianchi Lake Water Diversion Project	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												The water quality of Dianchi Lake has deteriorated in the last 50 years due to excessive human activities. The Niulan River to Dianchi Lake Water Diversion Project (NRDLWDP) was implemented in 2013 to improve the water environment by enhancing the water exchange and transport in the lake. Since the start of its operation, the water quality of the lake has been improved except in flood seasons, when the turbidity of the water pumped from the water source of the project, the Deze Reservoir, exceeded the regulatory standards. The characteristics of flow and sediment transport near the intake and its upper reaches along the Niulan River and its tributary were first analyzed based on field observations in the Deze Reservoir. The effectiveness of the check dams and multi-water-level intake on reducing the sediment concentration of the intake was evaluated by using a three-dimensional model SCHISM (semi-implicit cross-scale hydroscience integrated system model). The results revealed that the original design of placing the intake near the riverbed in order to be able to take in water at low water levels overlooked the possibility that the very fine incoming sediments and the frequently occurring density currents tended to occur near the bottom where the intake is located. The construction of check dams can encourage the deposition processes upstream and thus decrease the sediment concentration or water turbidity at the intake. However, the reduced turbidity is still too high to meet the standard of 17.1 NTU. Therefore, a multi-water-level intake should be adopted to solve the sediment problems of the NRDLWDP because it can be fully adapted to the stratified characteristics of the sediment concentration at the intake of the Deze Reservoir. With the multi-water-level intake, the turbidity of the pumped water can be substantially reduced when compared with the current approach of a single-water-level intake and the construction of check dams.					; wu, baosheng/IUM-6377-2023	ZHANG, RUOYIN/0000-0001-6992-5798; 													0733-9372	1943-7870				JAN 1	2020	146	1							05019006	10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0001623	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0001623													WOS:000497673400009

Carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment sources and retention in a small eutrophic tropical reservoir	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Rapid urbanization and the absence of efficient water management policies are increasingly degrading the water quality of tropical reservoirs in developing countries. The small tropical reservoir of Cointzio, located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, is a warm monomictic water body (surface area = 6 km(2) with short water residence time < 1 year) that is strategic to the drinking water supply of the city of Morelia and to downstream irrigation during the dry season (6 months of the year). The reservoir faces two threats: (a) reduced water storage capacity due to sediment accumulation and (b) eutrophication caused by excess nutrients that likely come from untreated wastewaters in the upstream watershed. Intensive field measurements of water and sediment were conducted in 2009 to characterize the trophic status of the reservoir and to estimate nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) sources, total suspended sediment (TSS) (N), (P), and carbon (C) loads, and their accumulation or removal in the reservoir. We found that point sources represent the majority of N and P inputs to the reservoir. The trophic status is clearly eutrophic given the high chlorophyll a peaks (up to 70 A mu g L-1) and a long period of anoxia (from May to October). Most of the TSS, C, N, and P were conveyed to the reservoir between June and October during the wet season. The TSS yield from the watershed was estimated at 35 +/- A 19 t km(-2) year(-1), of which more than 90 % was trapped in the reservoir (sediment accumulation rate = 7800 +/- A 2100 g m(-2) of reservoir year(-1)). The export load of C, N, and P downstream at the reservoir outlet was reduced by 31, 46 and 30 % respectively in comparison to the load at the reservoir inlet. This study reveals the effect of climatic seasonality on inputs to tropical reservoirs and accumulation; it also highlights the need to both reduce nutrient input to combat eutrophication and mitigate erosion to maintain the water storage capacity of the reservoir over the long term.					gratiot, nicolas/G-8071-2016; Duwig, Celine/E-4704-2015; Duvert, Clem/GSE-1360-2022	Duwig, Celine/0000-0003-1505-8996; gratiot, nicolas/0000-0002-9053-1694; Duvert, Clement/0000-0002-9873-6846; Nemery, Julien/0000-0001-9826-7739													1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2016	78	1					171	189		10.1007/s00027-015-0416-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-015-0416-5													WOS:000367916700013
J	Roy, ED; White, JR; Smith, EA; Bargu, S; Li, CY				Roy, Eric D.; White, John R.; Smith, Emily A.; Bargu, Sibel; Li, Chunyan			Estuarine ecosystem response to three large-scale Mississippi River flood diversion events	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Large inflows of nitrogen (N)-rich freshwater to estuaries can lead to expressions of eutrophication including harmful algal blooms of cyanobacteria (CyanoHABs). Lake Pontchartrain is a large, oligohaline estuary that occasionally receives episodic diversions of N-rich Mississippi River water via the Bonnet Carre Spillway to alleviate flood threats to New Orleans, LA. The extreme flood stage of the Lower Mississippi River in May 2011 prompted the tenth opening of the spillway since 1937. The 2011 opening occurred later in the season than the previous two lower discharge events (1997 and 2008) and was characterized by dissolved inorganic N loads 1.7 and 2.6 times greater than the 1997 and 2008 events, respectively. Rapid depletion of riverine nitrate (21 days) occurred post-spillway closure in 2011 with no associated CyanoHAB and was followed by an internal pulse of phosphorus (P) from sediments to restore N-limitation. Our analysis of recent spillway openings indicates that there is not a simple stimulus-response relationship between N loading and CyanoHAB formation. We investigate the systemic causal relationships that determine ecosystem response to these nutrient-rich freshwater inflows and highlight several important parameters including: external N loading, timing, magnitude, plume hydrodynamics, nutrient molar ratios, internal P loading, weather, and northern tributary discharge. Our results suggest that the turbulent, fluctuating environment and nutrient composition during diversions does not favor CyanoHAB formation and that the immense size and timing of the 2011 diversion may have resulted in near complete post-diversion CyanoHAB suppression by hydraulic flushing.

To compare the forms characteristics of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) in rivers flowing through rural and urban areas, water samples were collected seasonally from five urban rivers and six rural rivers flowing to Lake Chaohu, China. Higher total phosphorus (TP), particulate phosphorus (PP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and dissolved nonreactive phosphorus (DNP) concentrations and SRP/TP percentages were observed in urban rivers than in rural rivers, and PP/TP and DNP/TP ratios were lower in urban rivers than in rural rivers. The concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and all N forms other than dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) were significantly higher in urban rivers than in rural rivers. NH4+/TN levels were higher in urban rivers, whereas PN/TN and DON/TN ratios were significantly lower in urban rivers compared with rural rivers. NO3-/TN and NO2-/TN levels were similar between the two groups of rivers. TP, BD-P, and NaOH-P levels in urban river surface sediments were significantly higher than those in rural rivers. NaOH-P/TP ratios were significantly elevated in urban rivers, whereas HCl-P/TP and Res-P/TP ratios were significantly lower compared with rural rivers. Urban rivers have transferred large quantities of NH4+ and SRP into Lake Chaohu, resulting in higher TP and TN levels and NH4+/TN and SRP/TP ratios. Decreasing the input of NH4+ and SRP into urban rivers is a high priority for mitigating eutrophication and algal blooms in Lake Chaohu.

Global prediction of δA and δ2H-δ18O evaporation slopes for lakes and soil water accounting for seasonality	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Global trends in the delta H-2-delta O-18 enrichment slope of continental lakes and shallow soil water undergoing natural evaporation are predicted on the basis of a steady state isotope balance model using basic monthly climate data ( i.e., temperature and humidity), isotopes in precipitation data, and a simple equilibrium liquid-vapor model to estimate isotopes in atmospheric moisture. The approach, which demonstrates the extension of well-known conceptual models in stable isotope hydrology to the global scale, is intended to serve as a baseline reference for evaluating field-based isotope measurements of vapor, surface water, and soil water and as a diagnostic tool for more complex ecosystem models, including isotope-equipped climate models. Our simulations reproduce the observed local evaporation line slopes ( 4-5 range for lakes and 2-3 range for soil water) for South America, Africa, Australia, and Europe. A systematic increase in slopes ( 5-8 range for lakes) toward the high latitudes is also predicted for lakes and soil water in northern North America, Asia, and Antarctica illustrating a latitudinal ( mainly seasonality-related) control on the evaporation signals that has not been widely reported. The over-riding control on the poleward steepening of the local evaporation lines is found to be the isotopic separation between evaporation-flux-weighted atmospheric moisture and annual precipitation, and to lesser extents temperature and humidity, all of which are influenced by enhanced seasonality in cold regions.

Denitrification and Biodiversity of Denitrifiers in a High-Mountain Mediterranean Lake	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Wet deposition of reactive nitrogen (Nr) species is considered a main factor contributing to N inputs, of which nitrate (NO3-) is usually the major component in high-mountain lakes. The microbial group of denitrifiers are largely responsible for reduction of nitrate to molecular dinitrogen (N-2) in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, but the role of denitrification in removal of contaminant nitrates in high-mountain lakes is not well understood. We have used the oligotrophic, high-altitude La Caldera lake in the Sierra Nevada range (Spain) as a model to study the role of denitrification in nitrate removal. Dissolved inorganic Nr concentration in the water column of la Caldera, mainly nitrate, decreased over the ice-free season which was not associated with growth of microbial plankton or variations in the ultraviolet radiation. Denitrification activity, estimated as nitrous oxide (N2O) production, was measured in the water column and in sediments of the lake, and had maximal values in the month of August. Relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria in sediments was studied by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of the 16S rRNA and the two phylogenetically distinct clades nosZI and nosZII genes encoding nitrous oxide reductases. Diversity of denitrifiers in sediments was assessed using a culture-dependent approach and after the construction of clone libraries employing the nosZI gene as a molecular marker. In addition to genera Polymorphum, Paracoccus, Azospirillum, Pseudomonas, Hyphomicrobium, Thauera, and Methylophaga, which were present in the clone libraries, Arthrobacter, Burkholderia, and Rhizobium were also detected in culture media that were not found in the clone libraries. Analysis of biological activities involved in the C, N, P, and S cycles from sediments revealed that nitrate was not a limiting nutrient in the lake, allowed N2O production and determined denitrifiers' community structure. All these results indicate that denitrification could be a major biochemical process responsible for the N losses that occur in La Caldera lake.

Variations in Streamflow Response to Large Hurricane-Season Storms in a Southeastern U.S. Watershed	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												Floods caused by hurricane storms are responsible for tremendous economic and property losses in the United States. To minimize flood damages associated with large hurricane-season storms, it is important to be able to predict streamflow amount in response to storms for a range of hydroclimatological conditions. However, this is challenging considering that streamflow response exhibits appreciable variability even for hurricane-season storms that deliver similar precipitation amounts. As such, better estimates of event responses require refined understanding of the causes of flood response variability. Here, a physically based, distributed hydrologic model and supporting hydrologic datasets are used to identify and evaluate dominant hydrologic controls on streamflow amount variability. The analysis indicates that variability in flood response in the Lake Michie watershed is primarily driven by antecedent soil moisture conditions near the land surface and evapotranspiration during postevent streamflow recession periods, which in turn is a function of precipitation history and prevailing vegetation and meteorological conditions. Presented results and ensuing analyses could help prioritize measurements during observation campaigns and could aid in risk management by providing look-up diagrams to quickly evaluate flood responses given prior information about hurricane storm size.

Airborne observations of arctic-boreal water surface elevations from AirSWOT Ka-Band InSAR and LVIS LiDAR	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												AirSWOT is an experimental airborne Ka-band radar interferometer developed by NASA-JPL as a validation instrument for the forthcoming NASA Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission. In 2017, AirSWOT was deployed as part of the NASA Arctic Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) to map surface water elevations across Alaska and western Canada. The result is the most extensive known collection of near-nadir airborne Ka-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data and derivative high-resolution (3.6 m pixel) digital elevation models to produce water surface elevation (WSE) maps. This research provides a synoptic assessment of the 2017 AirSWOT ABoVE dataset to quantify regional WSE errors relative to coincidentin situfield surveys and LiDAR data acquired from the NASA Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS) airborne platform. Results show that AirSWOT WSE data can penetrate cloud cover and have nearly twice the swath-width of LVIS as flown for ABoVE (3.2 km vs. 1.8 km nominal swath-width). Despite noise and biases, spatially averaged AirSWOT WSEs can be used to estimate sub-seasonal hydrologic variability, as confirmed with field GPS surveys andin situpressure transducers. This analysis informs AirSWOT ABoVE data users of known sources of measurement error in the WSEs as influenced by radar parameters including incidence angle, magnitude, coherence, and elevation uncertainty. The analysis also provides recommended best practices for extracting information from the dataset by using filters for these four parameters. Improvements to data handing would significantly increase the accuracy and spatial coverage of future AirSWOT WSE data collections, aiding scientific surface water studies, and improving the platform's capability as an airborne validation instrument for SWOT.					; Cooper, Matthew/ADV-3111-2022; Fayne, Jessica/HPG-2782-2023; Smith, Laurence/E-7785-2012; Kyzivat, Ethan/HDO-0105-2022; Fayne, Jessica V./B-4735-2017	Cooper, Matthew/0000-0002-0165-209X; Denbina, Michael/0000-0003-4298-4127; Smith, Laurence/0000-0001-6866-5904; Cooley, Sarah/0000-0001-8953-6730; Fayne, Jessica V./0000-0003-2352-546X; Kyzivat, Ethan/0000-0002-4748-2938; Chen, Albert/0000-0002-2555-4646													1748-9326					OCT	2020	15	10							105005	10.1088/1748-9326/abadcc	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abadcc													WOS:000575682400001

The formation of large supraglacial lakes poses risks for glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Therefore, it is important to monitor the movement of glaciers and to analyze their spatiotemporal characteristics. In this study we take Cuolangma glaciers in the central Himalayas as study targets, where glacier No.1 is a lake-terminating debris-covered glacier and glacier No.2 is a land-terminating debris-covered glacier. The 3D deformation time series is firstly estimated by using the Pixel Offset-Small Baseline Subsets (PO-SBAS) based on the ascending and descending Sentinel-1 datasets spanning from January to December 2018. Then the horizontal and vertical time series displacements are obtained to show their spatiotemporal features. The velocities of glacier No.1 in horizontal and vertical direction were up to 16.0 +/- 0.04 m/year and 3.4 +/- 0.42 m/year, respectively, and the ones of the glacier No.2 were 12.0 +/- 0.07 m/year and 2.0 +/- 0.27 m/year, respectively. Next, the correlation between the precipitation and the surface velocity suggests that the glacier velocity does not show a clear association with daily precipitation alone. Finally, the debris-covered glaciers evolution is evaluated which shows that the tongue of the glacier No.1 is wasting away and the transition of glacier No.2 from land-terminating to lake-terminating is a probable scenario in the later period of glacier wastage. This research can significantly serve for glacier multidimensional monitoring and the mitigation of hazardous disaster caused by debris-covered glaciers in the central Himalayas.					; Zhao, Chaoying/AGB-1612-2022; Lu, Zhong/MZQ-2483-2025	Zhao, Chaoying/0000-0002-5730-9602; Lu, Zhong/0000-0001-9181-1818; 														2072-4292				OCT	2020	12	20							3466	10.3390/rs12203466	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12203466													WOS:000585555400001

Relative lake level fluctuations and their influence on productivity and resilience in tropical lakes and reservoirs	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Lakes and reservoirs are traditionally characterised from static morphological or chemical parameters such as depth and dissolved solids, while the dynamic impact of shifting water supplies has received little attention. There is increasing evidence, however, that the hydrodynamic regime in tropical water bodies plays a significant role in the injection and re-suspension of nutrients, and consequently has a strong influence on the biological communities and productivity. Lake level fluctuations can therefore be used as a proxy for bottom up driven processes. The application of a relative fluctuation index (RLLF) and its relationship with fish yields in a range of tropical lakes and reservoirs in Asia and Africa is reviewed. The RLLF is a simple empirical indicator defined as the mean amplitude of the annual or seasonal lake level fluctuations divided by the mean depth of the lake or reservoir, times 100. It builds on the classic morpho-edaphic index (MEI) for lakes and the more recent dynamic flood pulse concept (FPC), originally developed for rivers and floodplains. The RLLF index can be used as a predictive indicator for classifying lakes and reservoirs from stable to pulsed systems, and thereby their potential resilience to external disturbances. The index also has a strong log-linear relationship with the fish productivity. Shallow lakes and man-made reservoirs in general have the highest lake level changes, but also the highest fish yield per unit area, and even extreme fluctuations (amplitude higher than mean depth) seem only to accelerate the biological processes. The influence of water level changes on aquatic productivity should be taken into account when assessing environmental impacts within and outside man-made reservoirs. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The seven processors, based on a neural network and band height, were assessed over an optically complex water body with Chla concentrations of 8.10-187.40 mg.m(-3) using 10-year MERIS archival data. These processors were adopted for the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) sensor. Results indicated that the four processors of band height (i.e., the Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI_L1); and Fluorescence Line Height (FLH_L1)); neural network (i.e., Eutrophic Lake (EUL); and Case 2 Regional (C2R)) possessed reasonable retrieval accuracy with root mean square error (R-2) in the range of 0.42-0.65. However, these processors underestimated the retrieved Chla > 100 mg.m(-3), reflecting the limitation of the band height processors to eliminate the influence of non-phytoplankton matter and highlighting the need to train the neural network for highly turbid waters. MCI_L1 outperformed other processors during the calibration and validation stages (R-2 = 0.65, Root mean square error (RMSE) = 22.18 mg.m(-3), the mean absolute relative error (MARE) = 36.88%). In contrast, the results from the Boreal Lake (BOL) and Free University of Berlin (FUB) processors demonstrated their inadequacy to accurately retrieve Chla concentration > 50 mg.m(-3), mainly due to the limitation of the training datasets that resulted in a high MARE for BOL (56.20%) and FUB (57.00%). Mapping the spatial distribution of Chla concentrations across Lake Kasumigaura using the seven processors showed that all processors-except for the BOL and FUB-were able to accurately capture the Chla distribution for moderate and high Chla concentrations. In addition, MCI_L1 and C2R processors were evaluated over 10-years of monthly measured Chla as they demonstrated the best retrieval accuracy from both groups (i.e., band height and neural network, respectively). The retrieved Chla of MCI_L1 was more accurate at tracking seasonal and annual variation in Chla than C2R, with only slight overestimation occurring during the springtime.

The origin of the salinity, mechanisms of reaching and concentrating in the dam remain unclear. These were assessed using hydrogeochemical facies, water type evolutions and mapping. The source ofHDsalinity was identified to be shallow groundwater (SG) and runoff from a seasonal floodplain with NaCl-rich lithological materails, alongLittle Kinyasungwe River that feeds the dam. The NaCl-rich lithological units, about 5-7 km upstream of the dam, were highly concentrated withNaCl to the extent that the local community was commercially separating table salt from them. The physicochemical parameters from these NaCl-rich lithological materials were well represented inHDand nearby groundwater sources, which suggests active water interactions. Water type evolution and surface hydrology assessments clearly showed that SG in the salty-floodplain was influenced by evaporation (ET) and was periodically carried to the HD. Clearly; HD water had high chemical similarity with the nearby SG. This agreeswith previous studies thatHD is partly fed by the local aquifer. However, this is the first attempt at mapping its physical origin. The origin of HD salinity was further supported by the spatial distribution of electrical conductivity (EC), where very high EC (up to 21,230 mu Scm(-1)) was recorded in SG within the NaCl-rich lithological unit while water sources far away from the NaClrich materials had much lower EC values. Thus, the study disagrees with previous conclusions that HD salinity was sorely due to high dam surface ET but is primarily due to geological reasons. Comparisons of HD with a nearby Matumbulu dam (MD), another earthen dam in climatologically similar settings, reveals that MD water was less saline/ mineralised. This further shows that HD high salinity is most likely a geologic phenomenon, but local climatic factors, namely high ET, decreasing rainfall and warming trends are likely to have concentrated the salts further. Although HD is widely/ideally used for grape vine irrigation, it was clearly revealed that its prolonged usage would potentially affect the soil and grape productivity due to high salinity.

The internal loading of P was quantified by a mass balance approach that considered the gross sedimentation of P as a component. The gross sedimentation of P was measured with sediment traps during May-October 2011. Additionally, we followed the monthly dynamics of diffusive fluxes and resuspension of P within this time period. The gross sedimentation of P dominated the mass balance calculations in Lake Peipsi. The resuspension of P constituted 62-68% of the gross sedimentation of P, and thereby accounted for the bulk of the total internal P load. Until late July, the release of P by diffusion was similar in magnitude to that of resuspension. Since August, resuspension was of governing importance for P cycling: the release of P by resuspension at that time was about 40-fold higher than that of the diffusion. Therefore, diffusion and resuspension provided a continuous supply of P to the water column during the growing season.

Diversity patterns of plankton in wetlands and factors structuring its community composition are poorly understood, albeit important for identifying areas for restoration and conservation. Here we investigate patterns in local and regional plankton richness and taxonomic and functional community composition in riverine papyrus swamps, river mouth wetlands, and lacustrine wetlands in the Lake Tana sub-basin, Ethiopia. Data on phytoplankton, zooplankton, and environmental variables were collected from 12 wetlands during the dry and wet seasons of 2018. Redundancy analysis, and linear mixed effect models, were used to investigate differences in local environmental conditions and variation in plankton community richness and composition between wetland types. We also assessed the ecological uniqueness of the plankton community by calculating the contribution of a single wetland: local contributions to overall beta diversity (LCBD) and contributions of individual species (SCBD) to overall beta diversity (BDTotal). Beta regression models were used to investigate the relationships of LCBD and SCBD to environmental variables, wetland, and taxa characteristics. A total of 85 phytoplankton taxa, distributed among 18 Reynolds functional groups, and 57 zooplankton taxa were observed over the entire set of samples. Local plankton taxon richness was significantly higher in riverine papyrus swamps (mean taxa of 30 phytoplankton and 21 zooplankton) compared to river mouth wetlands (mean taxa of 27 phytoplankton and 13 zooplankton). Several local environmental variables and the composition of the plankton community differed significantly between the three wetland types. The highest phytoplankton ecological uniqueness (LCBD) was detected in lacustrine wetlands, whereas the riverine papyrus swamps had the highest zooplankton ecological uniqueness. Based on our analyses, we recommend protecting the wetlands with high LCBD values and stress the importance of various wetland types for preserving the diverse plankton communities of Lake Tana wetlands.					; Stiers, Iris/JYQ-1075-2024; De Meester, Luc/F-3832-2015; Kibret, Mulugeta/LYO-7349-2024	Triest, Ludwig/0000-0002-4946-9614; Lemmens, Pieter/0000-0002-3135-9724; Stiers, Iris/0000-0002-0367-1315; De Meester, Luc/0000-0001-5433-6843; 														2296-665X				MAR 9	2022	10								816892	10.3389/fenvs.2022.816892	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.816892													WOS:000777932300001

Yet polyP metabolisms in aquatic systems and their roles in P biogeochemical cycle remain elusive. Previously reported polyP enrichment in low-phosphorus oligotrophic marine waters contradicts the common view of polyP as a luxury P-storage molecule. Here, we show that in a P-rich eutrophic bay of Lake Ontario, planktonic polyP is controlled by multiple mechanisms and responds strongly to seasonal variations. Plankton accumulate polyP as P storage under high-P conditions via luxury uptake and use it under acute P stress. Low phosphorus also triggers enrichment of polyP that can be preferentially recycled to attenuate P lost. We discover that picoplankton, despite their low production rates, are responsible for the dynamic polyP metabolisms. Picoplankton store and liberate polyP to support the high primary productivity of blooming algae. PolyP mechanisms enable efficient P recycling on ecosystem and even larger scales.

Arsenic in freshwater systems: Influence of eutrophication on occurrence, distribution, speciation, and bioaccumulation	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Arsenic exists in a variety of chemical forms, and microbial metabolism results in the occurrence of thermodynamically unstable arsenite (As-III) and methylarsenic compounds in freshwaters (rivers and lakes). The inorganic forms (As-V and AsIII) and the methylated forms (methylarsonic acid; MMAA(V) and dimethylarsinic acid; DMAA(V)) are the main species of As in freshwaters while the bulk of the total dissolved As is inorganic species. Although the predominant forms of methylarsenic compounds are consistently DMAA(V) followed by MMAA(V), the DMAA(III) and MMAA(III) species have also been found in freshwaters. Several observations have revealed that phytoplankton activities are responsible for the seasonal variations of methylarsenic compounds in freshwaters. Although it was unclear if the occurrences of methylarsenic compounds were from the breakdown of larger molecules or the end-products of phytoplankton biosynthesis, recent studies have revealed that less toxic As-glutathione complexes are intermediates in the biosynthesis of organoarsenic compounds by phytoplankton. Recent studies have also revealed that eutrophication plays an important role in the production, distribution, and cycling of methylarsenic compounds in freshwaters. In this review, the recent reports on the influence of eutrophication on distribution, speciation, and bioaccumulation in freshwaters are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Deep lakes have a strong in-lake processing, which highly affects the sources, composition and cycle of CDOM. Here, the second deepest lake (Lake Fuxian) in China was selected to investigate the effects of allochthonous input and in-lake processing on lacustrine CDOM in deep lakes. Firstly, a detailed survey on CDOM composition across Lake Fuxian in the top water layer and inflowing rivers was car-ried out in the wet season representing the allochthonous input. In addition, CDOM in Lake Fuxian was compared with those in other lakes with distinct catchment characteristics and lake morphology. The results showed that compared to lacustrine CDOM in Lake Fuxian, the riverine CDOM contained much more humic-like substances, resulting in the humic-like fluorescence intensity peaked at the confluence of rivers into Lake Fuxian. In contrast, CDOM in Lake Fuxian was dominated by the protein-like substance. Comparison of CDOM composition among Lake Fuxian (well-vegetated catchment, deep lakes) with other diverse lakes in China (shallow/deep lakes with poor-vegetated catchment, and shal-low lakes with well-vegetated catchment) showed similar CDOM quality in all type lakes, which were dominated by non-humified and autochthonous CDOM. Yet, CDOM quantity increased as the orders of deep lakes within poor -vegetated (Tibetan deep lakes) < the deep lake within well-vegetated catchment (Lake Fuxian) < shallow lakes within poorly-vegetated catchment (Tibetan shallow lakes) < shallow lakes within well-vegetated catchment (lakes along the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River). Our results evidenced that the effect of allochthonous input on CDOM composition could be counteracted by in-lake processing in deep lakes. For deep lakes, a comprehensive understanding of in-lake processing of CDOM is critical for predicting lacustrine DOM composition and cycle.

MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS FOR EVALUATION THE WATER QUALITY OF TIGRIS RIVER WITHIN BAGHDAD CITY IN IRAQ	IRAQI JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												The aim of this study is to evaluate the water quality of Tigris river by measuring the physicochemical parameters of the river within Baghdad city in Iraq from the period of February 2017 to February 2018. Four sites were selected from upreach, reach and downreach. Temperature of air and water, pH, electrical conductivity, salinity and water flow were measured in the field, While, the laboratory measurements included total dissolved substances (TDS), total suspended substances (TSS), turbidity, nutrients (nitrite, nitrate and phosphate), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), organic matter and total organic carbon (TOC), these parameters were used to indicate the pollution of Tigris River ecosystem. The results show that all parameters variation in both seasons (wet and dry), which has led to a deterioration in water quality. A higher level of contamination was recorded at reach sites (Al-Sarrafia Bridge and Al-Shuhada Bridge) in contrast to other sites (Al-Muthanna Bridge and Al-Dora Bridge). This indicates that the Tigris river in the middle of Baghdad city is more polluted due to the anthropogenic impacts.

All proxies varied significantly across the range of sites examined, providing a robust envelope of values that can reliably be employed to identify a savanna signature in the sedimentary record. While the results indicate it is possible to identify a savanna, we found only three statistically significant relationships between any proxy measured in surface sediments and the major climate driver of savanna vegetation composition (rainfall amount). This is because edaphic factors play a dominant role in determining vegetation composition and also potentially because of the impact of land use change. Measures of fire determined by charcoal counting were positively correlated with geochemical measures of pyrogenic carbon abundance, suggesting both record a similar signal. While measures of fire incidence were not correlated with rainfall, there was a significant positive correlation between charcoal abundance and number of fires early in the dry season, suggesting that charcoal abundance is controlled more by the number/timing of fires than climate. There was also a significant correlation between the delta C-13-value of pyrogenic carbon and tree:grass ratio derived from palynological indicators, indicating that the delta C-13-value of PyC is a reliable indicator of savanna 'woodiness'. Comparison of the carbon isotope composition of total organic carbon, PyC and n-alkanes between modern and Holocene sediments suggest that the savannas of the region have remained either similar in 'woodiness' or have thickened over the last millennia.

J	Huang, T; Xu, LG; Fan, HX				Huang, Tao; Xu, Ligang; Fan, Hongxiang			Drought Characteristics and Its Response to the Global Climate Variability in the Yangtze River Basin, China	WATER												The frequent occurrence of drought events in humid and semi-humid regions is closely related to the global climate variability (GCV). In this study, the Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was taken as an index to investigate the drought in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), a typical humid and semi-humid region in China. Furthermore, nine GCV indices, such as North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) were taken to characterize the GCV. Correlation analysis and a joint probability distribution model were used to explore the relationship between the drought events and the GCV. The results demonstrated that there were six significant spatiotemporal modes revealed by SPEI3 (i.e., seasonal drought), which were consistent with the distribution of the main sub basins in the YRB, indicating a heterogeneity of drought regime. However, the SPEI12 (i.e., annual drought) can only reveal five modes. Precipitation Indices and El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Indices were more closely related to the drought events. A causal relationship existed between ENSO precipitation index (ESPI), NAO, East Central Tropical Pacific Sea Surface Temperature (Nino3.4) and Northern Oscillation Index (NOI) and drought in the YRB, respectively. Drought events were most sensitive to the low NAO and high NOI events. This study shows a great significance for the understanding of spatiotemporal characteristics of meteorological drought and will provide a reference for the further formulation of water resources policy and the prevention of drought disasters.

Review: Reducing residual soil nitrogen losses from agroecosystems for surface water protection in Quebec and Ontario, Canada: Best management practices, policies and perspectives	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Eutrophication and cyanobacteria blooms, a growing problem in many of Quebec and Ontario's lakes and rivers, are largely attributed to the phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) emanating from intensively cropped agricultural fields. In fact, 49% of N loading in surface waters comes from runoff and leaching from fertilized soils and livestock operations. The residual soil nitrogen (RSN), which remains in soil at the end of the growing season, contains soluble and particulate forms of N that are prone to being transported from agricultural fields to waterways. Policies and best management practices (BMPs) to regulate manure storage and restrict fertilizer and manure spreading can help in reducing N losses from agroecosystems. However, reduction of RSN also requires an understanding of the complex interactions between climate, soil type, topography, hydrology and cropping systems. Reducing N losses from agroecosystems can be achieved through careful accounting for all N inputs (e. g., N credits for legumes and manure inputs) in nutrient management plans, including those applied in previous years, as well as the strategic implementation of multiple BMPs and calibrated soil N testing for crops with high N requirements. We conclude that increasing farmer awareness and motivation to implement BMPs will be important in reducing RSN. Programs to promote communication between farmers and researchers, crop advisors and provincial ministries of agriculture and the environment are recommended.					; Whalen, Joann/F-7419-2013	Rasouli, Sogol/0000-0001-5279-3514; Whalen, Joann/0000-0001-8774-0594; 													0008-4271	1918-1841				MAY	2014	94	2					109	127		10.4141/CJSS2013-015	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/CJSS2013-015													WOS:000349146900001

The new species Agathoxylon cozzoi and Agathoxylon lamaibandianus Crisafulli and Herbst, 2011 described in this study were found in proximal volcaniclastic facies deposited in alluvial fans and proximal braided river plains of the Chihuido Formation, which is the basal unit of the Group. The species A. lamaibandianus Crisafulli and Herbst, Protojuniperoxylon ischigualastense (Bonetti, 1966) Bodnar and Artabe, 2007, and the new species Cupressinoxylon llantenesense also described in this study were collected from the upper fluvio-deltaic plain and delta-plain deposits that prograded into a large, meromictic and wedge-shaped lake of the overlying Llantenes Formation. The Tronquimalal Group yields abundant and well-known Triassic plant remains of the Southern Gondwana "Dicroidium Flora," although it also contains typical early Jurassic taxa displaying age affinities with other Argentinean "Florian Stage" communities of Late Triassic (Norian-?Rhaetian). The lignotaxa described from both units of the Tronquimalal Group may all together represent coniferous forests of the extratropical area of the Southwestern Province of Gondwana. Deciduous conifer forests associated with herbaceous and shrub communities dominated by ferns and smaller corystosperms, and other taxa including the Linguifolium leaves within the Llantenes Depocenter environments, were developed on the western margin of the continent under seasonal temperate-warm and humid to sub-humid climate with a marine influence from the west.

Surface runoff in Beasley Lake watershed: Effect of land management practices in a Lower Mississippi River Basin watershed	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												Several United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) conservation programs are promoting conversion of cropland to nonagricultural use, e.g., buffer establishment for wildlife habitat and Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). These areas set aside for nonagricultural use may serve as barriers to mitigate runoff within a watershed where agricultural activities are conducted. CRP and wildlife buffer areas were established in Beasley Lake watershed (BLW), Sunflower County, Mississippi, United States, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.The objectives of this study were to assess catchment runoff and runoff water quality through both measured data and model simulations from three scenarios of land management in BLW from 2011 to 2017: row crop with no edge-of-field buffer (Crop), row crop fields adjacent to wildlife buffers (CropBuff), and CRP. Measured data were collected at the field-scale from nine subcatchments. Median runoff from Crop sites was greater than that from CRP catchments (123 m(3) ha(-1) versus 39 m(3) ha(-1) across seasons and years). Median loads of suspended solid loads in runoff averaged 108 kg ha(-1) for Crop compared to 42 kg ha(-1) in CropBuff areas (across seasons and years). Similar trends were observed for median total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and total phosphorus (TP) loads in runoff:TKN 0.26, 0.18, and 0.07 kg ha(-1); and TP 0.06, 0.06, and 0.02 kg ha(-1) for Crop, CropBuff, and CRP, respectively. For both CRP and CropBuff, the proportion of soluble/fine particle (<0.45 mu m) TKN and TP lost in runoff was greater than that of particulate-boundTKN and TP front Crop. Overall, efficacy in mitigating runoff losses were generally in the order of CRP, CropBuff, and Crop. In addition to field measurements, watershed simulations were conducted with and without the practices using Annualized Agricultural Non-Point Source (AnnAGNPS) pollution model. AnnAGNPS simulations independently confirm the measured results and account for differences in soil types among the different land use practices that could influence measured results. These results demonstrated that wildlife buffers and CRP conservation practices helped to improve and maintain environmental quality of soil and water resources in BLW.

K.; Panda, Biranchi Narayan			Prediction of Water Quality Using Principal Component Analysis	WATER QUALITY EXPOSURE AND HEALTH												The groundwater is contaminated heavily with acidity, alkalinity, toxicity, heavy minerals, and microbes throughout the world due to population growth, urbanization and industrialization. Hence, evaluation of water quality of groundwater is extremely important to prepare for remedial measures. This paper presents application of an empirical approach for classification of water samples based on 10 quality parameters of water. In this research work, water samples from 10 sources in three different years and seasons have been collected to assess the quality of water. Q-mode principal component analysis has been applied to classify the water samples into four different categories considering parameters such as pH, DO, turbidity, TDS, hardness, calcium ion (Ca++), chloride ion (Cl-), BOD, iron (Fe++), sulfate (SO4--). This classification will be useful for the planners and field engineers for taking ameliorative measures in advance for preventing the contamination of groundwater. The non-parametric method proposed here efficiently assesses water quality index for classification of water quality. The model can also be used for estimating water quality on-line but the accuracy of the model depends upon the judicious selection of parameters.

J	Mahony, J; Dyer, E; Washington, R				Mahony, Josephine; Dyer, Ellen; Washington, Richard			The precipitation patterns and atmospheric dynamics of the Serengeti National Park	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The unique precipitation patterns over the Serengeti National Park in East Africa form the foundation of an internationally important ecosystem. Quantifying these precipitation patterns, and identifying the causal atmospheric processes, can improve understanding of past and future changes to regional rainfall. Precipitation and reanalysis datasets (CHIRPS v2.0, TRMM 3B42, ERA5) were used to quantify the regional climatic conditions on annual, monthly and hourly timescales. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified regions with distinct annual cycles of precipitation. Annual and monthly precipitation over the wider Serengeti domain (1 degrees-4 degrees S, 33 degrees-37 degrees E) was spatially heterogeneous. Cluster analysis identified five sub-regions with distinct annual cycles, with differing rainfall totals during January-February and June-September, wet season peak rainfall months, and rainfall peak symmetry. Seasonality was broadly controlled by the biannual passage of the tropical rainfall belt. Low-level wind, humidity and convergence patterns were impacted by the topography and Lake Victoria. An afternoon convergence zone between tropical easterlies and lake breeze winds always ran through the park and was associated with ascending motion and convection. The spatial progression of diurnal rainfall over the Serengeti followed the direction of 750 hPa tropical easterlies. The majority of the park received a late-afternoon rainfall peak, but from October to March an early afternoon peak was present between the wind convergence line over the central Serengeti and the rift topography. We propose that interactions between tropical easterlies, lake breeze westerlies and the topography control the spatial distribution of Serengeti precipitation, and that the seasonally changing rainfall gradient over the Serengeti may be generated by storms forming at the lake front and propagating in the direction of tropospheric easterlies. We suggest the early precipitation peak in the eastern Serengeti may be due to variability in the position of the lake front, or small storms generated by localized solar heating.

Satellite remote sensing reveals impacts from dam-associated hydrological changes on chlorophyll-a in the world's largest desert lake	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												We present an approach that uses satellite products to derive models for predicting lake chlorophyll from environmental variables, and for investigating impacts of changing environmental flows. Lake Turkana, Kenya, is the world's largest desert lake, and environmental flows from the Omo River have been modified since 2015 by the Gibe III dam in Ethiopia. Using satellite remote sensing, we have evaluated the influence of these altered hydrological patterns on large-scale lake phytoplankton concentrations for the first time. Prior to dam completion, strong seasonal cycles and large spatial gradients in chlorophyll have been observed, related to natural fluctuations in the Omo River's seasonal discharge. During this period, mean lake chlorophyll showed a strong relationship with both river inflows and lake levels. Empirical models were derived which considered multiple hydro-climatic drivers, but the best model for predicting chlorophyll-a was a simple model based on Omo River discharge. Application of this model to data for 2015-2016 estimated that during the filling of Gibe III annual mean Lake Turkana chlorophyll declined by 30%. Future water management scenarios based on Gibe III operations predict reduced seasonal chlorophyll-a variability, while irrigation scenarios showed marked declines in chlorophyll-a depending on the level of abstraction. These changes demonstrate how infrastructure developments such as dams can significantly alter lake primary production. Our remote sensing approach is easy to adapt to other lakes to understand how their phytoplankton dynamics may be affected by water management scenarios.

Annual down-glacier drainage of lakes and water-filled crevasses at Helheim Glacier, southeast Greenland	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Supraglacial lake drainage events are common on the Greenland ice sheet. Observations on the west coast typically show an up-glacier progression of drainage as the annual melt extent spreads inland. We use a suite of remote sensing and modeling techniques in order to study a series of lakes and water-filled crevasses within 20 km of the terminus of Helheim Glacier, southeast Greenland. Automatic classification of surface water areas shows a down-glacier progression of drainage, which occurs in the majority of years between 2007 and 2014. We demonstrate that a linear elastic fracture mechanics model can reliably predict the drainage of the uppermost supraglacial lake in the system but cannot explain the pattern of filling and draining observed in areas of surface water downstream. We propose that the water levels in crevasses downstream of the supraglacial lake can be explained by a transient high-pressure wave passing through the subglacial system following the lake drainage. We support this hypothesis with analysis of the subglacial hydrological conditions, which can explain both the position and interannual variation in filling order of these crevasses. Similar behavior has been observed in association with jokulhaups, surging glaciers, and Antarctic subglacial lakes but has not previously been observed on major outlets of the Greenland ice sheet. Our results suggest that the behavior of near-terminus surface water may differ considerably from that of inland supraglacial lakes, with the potential for basal water pressures to influence the presence of surface water in crevasses close to the terminus of tidewater glaciers.

However, there is a need for continued research on the sustainability and potential ecological effects of cage aquaculture in African lakes and reservoirs. Even with an adequate amount of water, lakes and reservoirs cannot provide ecosystem services if their water quality is not properly managed. The current study on Lake Kivu, DRC focuses on understanding the effects of tilapia cage aquaculture on selected water quality physico-chemical parameters in the Bukavu sub-basin, DRC. The research was conducted in both caged and uncaged sampling stations, on the spatial and temporal scale from April to September 2023 at three bays serving as sampling stations: two caged (Ndendere, Honga) and one non-caged (Nyofu). Some physico-chemical parameters were measured in situ, whereas chlorophyll a and nutrients analysis were performed at the Institut Superieur Pedagogique (I.S.P) laboratory in Bukavu. The parameters were used to calculate three indices water quality indices: the water quality index (WQI) to classify the water quality at the stations, the organic pollution index (OPI) to determine the level of organic pollution, the Carlson's Trophic Status Index (CTSI) to classify the trophic state of the stations. Chlorophyll a concentration was a measure of algal biomass. All physico-chemical parameters, apart from DO, ammonium and temperature showed no significant differences among stations and depths. Interaction between stations and between seasons was only observed on turbidity. The WQI for all the sampling stations ranged from medium to good quality (51-90). The OPI for all stations showed minimal level of pollution (4.6-5.0) hence lake's water still organically unpolluted. CTSI results indicated the sampling stations are in a eutrophic state (50 to 70). Fish cage aquaculture does not yet pose harm to the water quality of the two Lake Kivu stations under consideration, according to the study's findings. However with the anticipated growth of cage fish farming activities to meet the rising fish demand, continuous monitoring of water quality in the Lake should be done to inform management decisions and for sustainable aquaculture.

J	Bidleman, TF; Helm, PA; Braune, BM; Gabrielsen, GW				Bidleman, Terry F.; Helm, Paul A.; Braune, Birgit M.; Gabrielsen, Geir Wing			Polychlorinated naphthalenes in polar environments - A review	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) consist of naphthalene substituted with 1-8 chlorines, yielding 75 possible congeners. They were formerly used in industry, occur at trace levels in commercial PCB mixtures, and have current sources in combustion processes. PCNs are widespread in arctic air with higher levels in the European Arctic. Concentrations were higher during the cold months in arctic Canada and Russia, but no seasonality was noted in subarctic Canada and Greenland. "Marker" congeners indicative of combustion were evident at some sites. Total toxic equivalents (TEQ) in air due to PCNs + dioxin-like PCBs were dominated by PCNs in arctic Canada and Russia, but not in subarctic Canada. Deposition of PCNs in snow was measured in northern Norway and Svalbard. Surveys of PCNs in the lower food web are limited to the northern Baltic Sea and lakes/rivers of northern Scandinavia. PCNs showed little or no biomagnification in lower food webs of the northern Baltic and discrimination among congeners suggested preferential metabolism. There are no reports of PCNs in fish and invertebrates from the Arctic Ocean, and only one from Antarctica. Total PCNs in marine mammals followed the order: harbour seal similar to pilot whale >= polar bear> beluga>ringed seal similar to Weddell seal. Total PCNs in seabirds varied over 100-fold, with higher concentrations in glaucous gull eggs and plasma from Bear Island, and livers of northern fulmar from the eastern Canadian Arctic. Lower concentrations occurred in eggs of glaucous gull from Svalbard and black-backed gull from the Faroe Islands. PCNs accounted for <1% of total TEQ in ringed seal, Weddell seal, seabirds and polar bear, but up to 6-15% in beluga and pilot whale. TEQ due to PCNs were generally low in harbour seal, but up to 9% of total TEQ in some animals. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The concentrations of total OPEs varied from 28.60 ng/g to 158.72 ng/g (median: 54.25 ng/g) in river surface sediment and from 62.57 ng/g to 326.84 ng/g (median: 86.37 ng/g) in lake sediment. Tributyl phosphate (TnBP) was the predominant compound in river surface sediment, and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate was predominant in lake sediment. High contamination occurred in the north-west region, which was related to the high level of urbanization and high usage of OPEs. The sediment-water partition coefficients of OPEs (logK(oc)) were calculated, showing a significant correlation with logK(ow) (p < 0.05). The concentration and composition of OPEs in two sediment cores varied due to the different sampling locations, with more OPE species found in the northern region than in the southern one. Principal component analysis and positive matrix factorization indicated that sewage discharges, vehicle emissions, and atmospheric deposition were the possible sources of OPEs in Taihu Lake sediments. Tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate, tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, and TnBP were the main OPEs causing ecological risks.

However, a complete picture of the bacterial diversity, and in particular of effects of seasonality and compartmentalization is missing. To characterize bacterial communities and elucidate relationships between them and their surrounding environment high-throughput 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing was conducted. Proteobacteria, Chlorobi, Verrucomicrobia, and Actinobacteria were the dominant groups in Lake Cadagno water column. Moreover, bacterial interaction within the chemocline and between oxic and anoxic lake compartments were investigated through fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and flow cytometry (FCM). The different populations of purple sulfur bacteria (PSB) and green sulfur bacteria (GSB) in the chemocline indicate seasonal dynamics of phototrophic sulfur bacteria composition. Interestingly, an exceptional bloom of a cyanobacteria population in the oxic-anoxic transition zone affected the common spatial distribution of phototrophic sulfur bacteria with consequence on chemocline location and water column stability. Our study suggests that both bacterial interactions between different lake compartments and within the chemocline can be a dynamic process influencing the stratification structure of Lake Cadagno water column.					; Storelli, Nicola/AAP-5061-2021	Ludin, Samuel/0000-0002-2803-2536; Storelli, Nicola/0000-0002-1318-115X; Tonolla, Mauro/0000-0002-8861-7763; 													1932-6203					DEC 26	2018	13	12							e0209743	10.1371/journal.pone.0209743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209743								30586464					WOS:000454416400090
J	Song, CQ; Huang, B; Ke, LH				Song, Chunqiao; Huang, Bo; Ke, Linghong			Inter-annual changes of alpine inland lake water storage on the Tibetan Plateau: Detection and analysis by integrating satellite altimetry and optical imagery	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The effects of climate change have a substantial influence on the extremely vulnerable hydrologic environment of the Tibetan Plateau. The estimation of alpine inland lake water storage variations is essential to modeling the alpine hydrologic process and evaluating water resources. Due to a lack of historical hydrologic observations in this remote and inaccessible region, such estimations also fill a gap in studies on the continuous inter-annual and seasonal changes in the inland lake water budget. Using Lake Siling Co as a case study, we derived a time-series of lake surface extents from MODIS imagery, and scarce lake water level data from the satellite altimetry of two sensors (ICESat/GLAS and ENVISAT RA-2) between 2001 and 2011. Then, based on the fact that the rise in lake water levels is tightly dependent on the expansion of the lake extent, we established an empirical model to simulate a continuous lake water level dataset corresponding to the lake area data during the lake's unfreezing period. Consequently, from three dimensions, the lake surface area, water level and water storage variations consistently revealed that Lake Siling Co exhibited a dramatic trend to expand, particularly from 2001to2006. Based on the statistical model and lake area measurements from Landsat images since 1972, the extrapolated lake water level and water storage indicate that the lake has maintained a continual expansion process and that the cumulative water storage variations during 1999-2011 account for 66.84% of the total lake water budget (26.87 km(3)) from 1972 to 2011.

Significant differences were observed in the DOC concentrations and delta C-13(Doc) values at the sampling sites. On average, the proportion of DOC in the total organic carbon (TOC) pool ranged from 30%+/- 10% to 81%+/- 7%. POC was positively associated with both Chl a concentration and cyanobacteria biomass, suggesting that cyanobacteria blooms contribute to the POC pool in Lake Taihu. Depleted C-13 in DOC relative to POC was observed in August, indicating that DOC was partially derived from POC in August. However, Chl a explained only 40% of the variation in DOC in the entirety of Lake Taihu, and at two sites far from the estuary, the contribution of allochthonous carbon was less than 50% in August. These results suggested a greater influence of allochthonous sources on the DOC pool. Moreover, the biodegradability of DOC was further determined by the total dissolved carbohydrates to DOC ratio (TCHO/DOC), specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)), and the concentrations of bioavailable DOC (BDOC). On average, 17% of the variation in DOC was attributable to the BDOC pool, and the BDOC concentration correlated positively with Chl a, cyanobacteria biomass, and total bacterial abundance, suggesting that cyanobacteria-derived DOC is biodegradable and is preferentially utilized by bacteria.

Spatio-temporal variations in water quality of Nullah Aik-tributary of the river Chenab, Pakistan	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												This study reports the spatio-temporal changes in water quality of Nullah Aik, tributary of the Chenab River, Pakistan. Stream water samples were collected at seven sampling sites on seasonal basis from September 2004 to April 2006 and were analyzed for 24 water quality parameters. Most significant parameters which contributed in spatio-temporal variations were assessed by statistical techniques such as Hierarchical Agglomerative Cluster Analysis (HACA), Factor Analysis/Principal Components Analysis (FA/PCA), and Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA). HACA identified three different classes of sites: Relatively Unimpaired, Impaired and Less Impaired Regions on the basis of similarity among different physicochemical characteristics and pollutant level between the sampling sites. DFA produced the best results for identification of main variables for temporal and spatial analysis and separated eight parameters (DO, hardness, sulphides, K, Fe, Pb, Cr and Zn) that accounted 89.7% of total variations of spatial analysis. Temporal analysis using DFA separated six parameters (E.C., TDS, salinity, hardness, chlorides and Pb) that showed more than 84.6% of total temporal variation. FA/PCA identified six significant factors (sources) which were responsible for major variations in water quality dataset of Nullah Aik. The results signify that parameters identified by statistical analyses were responsible for water quality change and suggest the possibility of industrial, municipal and agricultural runoff, parent rock material contamination. The results suggest dire need for proper management measures to restore the water quality of this tributary for a healthy and promising aquatic ecosystem and also highlights its importance for objective ecological policy and decision making process.					; Malik, Riffat/ABF-4886-2020	Malik, Riffat Naseem/0000-0003-4345-6000; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2008	140	1-3					43	59		10.1007/s10661-007-9846-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-007-9846-4								17665141					WOS:000254434400004

Based on previous tephrochronological constraints and a new 40Ar/39Ar dating of a tephra matching the widespread X-6 tephra, the record spans the ca. 129-92 ka period and documents at sub-orbital scale the climatic and environmental changes over the Last Interglacial and its transition to the Last Glacial period. The 6180 composition is interpreted as a proxy for the amount and seasonality of local precipitation, whereas variations in elemental and mineralogical composition are inferred to reflect climatic-driven changes in clastic sediment input. The observed variations are consistent among the different proxies, and indicate that periods of reduced precipitation were marked by enhanced catchment erosion, probably due to a reduction in vegetation cover. The first part of the Last Interglacial shows the most negative delta O-18 values. Comparison with pollen records from the Mediterranean suggests a greater seasonality of the precipitation at this time. At millennial-to-centennial time scales, comparison of the Sulmona record with speleothem delta O-18 records from central Italy highlights a highly coherent pattern of hydrological evolution, with enhanced variability and similar events of reduced precipitation consistently recorded by each isotope record. The observed intra-interglacial variability can potentially be linked, within the uncertainties associated with each age model, to similar variations observed in sea-surface temperature records from the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic, suggesting a link between Mediterranean hydrology and North Atlantic temperature and circulation patterns that persists during periods of low ice volume.

Assessment of climate change impacts on the hydrology of Gilgel Abay catchment in Lake Tana basin, Ethiopia	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												In this study, large-scale atmospheric variables are downscaled to meteorological variables at local scale for the daily time step to assess hydrological impacts by climate changes. Large-scale atmospheric modelling was by the HadCM3 General Circulation Model (GCM) while downscaling and water balance modelling was through the Statistical DownScaling Model and the HBV semi-distributed rainfall-runoff model, respectively. The area of study was the Gilgel Abay catchment that drains in Lake Tana. A selection of large-scale atmospheric variables by the HadCM3 GCM are downscaled by a multiple linear regression model, were minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation for future time horizons are calculated. Climate scenarios as developed for the A2 (medium-high emission) and B2 (medium-low emission) scenarios for a 100-year period based on the mean of 20 ensembles have been selected for this study. In addition, a synthetic incremental scenario was tested for a wide range of changes in climatic variables. Stream flow simulations by the HBV model were carried out for the 2020s (2011-2040), 2050s (2041-2070) and 2080s (2071-2099) to define hydrologic impacts. The result of downscaled precipitation reveals that precipitation does not manifest a systematic increase or decrease in all future time horizons for both A2 and B2 scenarios unlike that of minimum and maximum temperature and related evaporation. For the future horizons significant changes and variations in the seasonal and monthly flows are to be expected and for the 2080s the runoff volume in the rainy season will reduce by approximately 11.6 and 10.1% for the A2 and B2 scenarios. Results from synthetic incremental scenarios also indicate sensitivities to climate change. As much as 33% of the seasonal and annual runoff is expected to reduce when temperature increases by 2 degrees C and when rainfall decreases by approximately 20%.

Per-fluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) was the predominant PFASs in all coral samples, representing 43% of the total PFAS. Long-chain PFASs, as well as PFAS alternatives, were frequently detected above the MQL (> 88%) but showed relatively low concentrations compared to short-chain PFASs in most species and seasons. Seasonal variation of PFAS concentrations were observed in branching corals, indicating that the accumulation of PFASs may be associated with coral morphological structures. Interspecies differences in PFAS levels agree well with different bioaccumulation potentials among coral species. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that seasonal factor and coral genus could partly influence PFAS concentrations in coral tissues. In summary, our study firstly reported the occurrence of PFASs in coral communities from the SCS and highlights the necessity for future investigations on more toxicity data for coral communities.

We used 24 mesocosms mimicking shallow lakes in which two nutrient levels (unenriched and enriched by adding nitrogen and phosphorus) and three different temperature scenarios (ambient, IPCC A2 scenario and A2+%50) are simulated (4 replicates of each). Experiments using the mesocosms have been running un-interrupted since 2003. A 1-month heat wave was imitated by an extra 5 degrees C increase in the previously heated mesocosms (from 1st July to 1st August 2014). Changes in water temperature induced within a few days a strong effect on the microbial food web functioning, demonstrating a quick response of microbial communities to the changes in environment, due to their short generation times. Warming and nutrients showed synergistic effects. Microbial assemblages of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates responded positively to the heating, the increase being largest in the enriched mesocosms. The results indicate that warming and nutrients in combination can set off complex interactions in the microbial food web functioning. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

During periods of high chironomid densities, chironomid larvae comprise over 90% of aquatic secondary production. Here, we show that chironomid larvae substantially stimulate benthic gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP), despite consuming benthic algae. Benthic GPP in experimental mesocosms with 140,000 larvae/m(2) was 71% higher than in mesocosms with no larvae. Similarly, chlorophyll a concentrations in mesocosms increased significantly over the range of larval densities. Furthermore, larvae showed increased growth rates at higher densities, possibly due to greater benthic algal availability in these treatments. We investigated the hypothesis that larvae promote benthic algal growth by alleviating nutrient limitation, and found that (1) larvae have the potential to cycle the entire yearly external loadings of nitrogen and phosphorus during the growing season, and (2) chlorophyll a concentrations were significantly greater in close proximity to larvae (on larval tubes). The positive feedback between chironomid larvae and benthic algae generated a net mutualism between the primary consumer and primary producer trophic levels in the benthic ecosystem. Thus, our results give an example in which unexpected positive feedbacks can lead to both high primary and high secondary production.					, Claudio/KRP-6122-2024; Ives, Anthony/A-5698-2008	Gratton, Claudio/0000-0001-6262-9670; Drake, Michael/0000-0003-0774-2034; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				FEB	2017	98	2					447	455		10.1002/ecy.1654	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.1654								27861769					WOS:000393375700016

There is an urgent need to enhance regional-/watershed-scale models, such as Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), to credibly simulate N2O emissions to improve assessment of environmental impacts of cropping practices. Here, we integrated the DayCent model's N2O emission algorithms with the existing widely tested crop growth, hydrology, and nitrogen cycling algorithms in SWAT and evaluated this new tool for simulating N2O emissions in three agricultural systems (i.e., a continuous corn site, a switchgrass site, and a smooth brome grass site which was used as a reference site) located at the Great Lakes Bioenergy Research Center (GLBRC) scale-up fields in southwestern Michigan. These three systems represent different levels of management intensity, with corn, switchgrass, and smooth brome grass (reference site) receiving high, medium, and zero fertilizer application, respectively. Results indicate that the enhanced SWAT model with default parameterization reproduced well the relative magnitudes of N2O emissions across the three sites, indicating the usefulness of the new tool (SWAT-N2O) to estimate long-term N2O emissions of diverse cropping systems. Notably, parameter calibration can significantly improve model simulations of seasonality of N2O fluxes, and explained up to 22.5%-49.7% of the variability in field observations. Further sensitivity analysis indicates that climate change (e.g., changes in precipitation and temperature) influences N2O emissions, highlighting the importance of optimizing crop management under a changing climate in order to achieve agricultural sustainability goals.

For the last 140 years, micro-facies analyses and mu-XRF element scanning at seasonal resolution, as well as bulk elemental analyses (organic matter, carbonate) at sub-decadal to decadal resolution, were conducted for all three lakes records. All lakes are located in a region with low population density, and therefore, anthropogenic influences are negligible or only minor. The varve chronologies have been established independently for each record and were synchronized with the Askja AD 1875 cryptotephra. Comparison with monthly temperature data since 1870 and daily temperature data since 1951 revealed different responses of lake deposition to recent climate change. Varves are well preserved over the entire 140 years only at JG, while in the JC record two faintly varved intervals are intercalated and in the JEL record two non-varved intervals occur at the base and top of the profiles. These differences likely are due to variations in lake characteristics and their influence on lake-internal responses. JG is the smallest and best wind-sheltered lake, which favours varve preservation. JC's attenuated sediment responses can likely be linked to lake productivity changes with respect to climate warming. JEL is lacking a direct sedimentological response to the observed temperature increase, which can be linked to lake size and water depth superimposing regional climate changes. Climate changes at the demise of the Little Ice Age' around 1900 and the recent warming since the 1980s are expressed in sediment proxies in the lakes with different response times and amplitudes. This detailed comparison study on three nearby lakes demonstrates the influence of local parameters such as lake and catchment size and water depth superimposed on more regional climate-driven changes.

MERIS satellite chlorophyll mapping of oligotrophic and eutrophic waters in the Laurentian Great Lakes	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentrations and 'water-leaving' reflectance were assessed along transects in Keweenaw Bay (Lake Superior) and in Green Bay (Lake Michigan) (two of the Laurentian Great Lakes, USA), featuring oligotrophic (0.4-0.8 mg Chla m(-3)) and eutrophic to hyper-eutrophic waters (11-131 mg Chla m(-3)), respectively. A red-to-NIR band Chla retrieval algorithm proved to be applicable to Green Bay, but gave mostly negative values for Keweenaw Bay. An alternative algorithm could be based on Chla fluorescence, which in Keweenaw Bay was indicated by enhanced reflectance near 680 rum. Bands 7, 8 and 9 of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) have been specifically designed to detect phytoplankton fluorescence in coastal waters. A quite strong linear relationship was found between Chla concentration and fluorescence line height (FLH) computed with these MERIS bands. The same relationship held for observations on oligotrophic waters elsewhere, but not for Green Bay, where the FLH diminished to become negative as Chla increased. The remote sensing application of the algorithms could be tested because a MERIS scene was acquired coinciding with the day of the field observations in Keweenaw Bay and one day after those in Green Bay. For Green Bay the pixel values from the red-to-NIR band algorithm compared well to the steep Chla gradient in situ. This result is very positive from the perspective of satellite use in monitoring eutrophic inland and coastal waters in many parts of the world. Implementation of the FLH relationship in the scene of Keweenaw Bay produced highly variable pixel values. The FLH in oligotrophic inland waters like Lake Superior appears to be very close to or below the MERIS detection limit. An empirical algorithm incorporating three MERIS bands in the blue-to-green spectral region might be used as an alternative, but its applicability to other regions and seasons remains to be verified. Moreover, none of the algorithms will be Suitable for mesotrophic water bodies. The results indicate that Chla mapping in oligotrophic and mesotrophic areas of the Great Lakes remains problematic for the current generation of satellite sensors. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, it is particularly important to study the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of water quality in large lakes. We analysed the data from six sampling sites in Lake Chaohu from 2001 to 2017 and eight sampling sites of the inflow rivers in 2001, 2009 and 2017. The six sampling sites were divided into SG I and SG II through cluster analysis, and the spatio-temporal changes of the water quality in the Lake Chaohu Basin were studied. The results indicated the following: All nutrient variables had relatively high concentrations in SG II except DO, while SG I had relatively high concentrations of only TN. Besides, the value of Chl a in each group is generally high. On the temporal scale, the changes in the water quality of the lake showed strong seasonality; the nutrient variable (TN, TP, NH4-N and CODMn) except DO in the inflow rivers is generally higher than that of the lake; the water quality of Lake Chaohu has improved during the study period, and it has also improved to a certain extent compared with that of the late 1980s. Fortunately, parts water quality parameters of Lake Chaohu have improved faster than that of the other four largest freshwater lakes in China. This research result has a certain guiding significance for the prevention and control of large lake water pollution.					fang, yong/JFA-6024-2023														1936-0584	1936-0592				OCT	2021	14	7							e2333	10.1002/eco.2333	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2333		AUG 2021											WOS:000683395700001

Carbon dioxide balance of subarctic tundra from plot to regional scales	BIOGEOSCIENCES												We report here the carbon dioxide (CO2) budget of a 98.6 km(2) subarctic tundra area in northeast European Russia based on measurements at two different scales and two independent upscaling approaches. Plot-scale measurements (chambers on terrestrial surfaces, gas gradient method and bubble collectors on lakes) were carried out from July 2007 to October 2008. The landscape-scale eddy covariance (EC) measurements covered the snow-free period of 2008. The annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of different land cover types ranged from -251 to 84 g C m(-2). Leaf area index (LAI) was an excellent predictor of the spatial variability in gross photosynthesis (GP), NEE and ecosystem respiration (ER). The plot-scale CO2 fluxes were first scaled up to the EC source area and then to the whole study area using two data sets: a land cover classification and a LAI map, both based on field data and a 2.4 m pixel-sized Quick-Bird satellite image. The good agreement of the CO2 balances for the EC footprint based on the different measuring techniques (-105 to -81 g C m(-2) vs. -79 g C m(-2); growing season 2008) justified the integration of the plot-scale measurements over the larger area. The regional CO2 balance based on area-integrated plot-scale measurements was -41 or -79 g C m(-2) yr(-1) according to the two upscaling methods, the land cover classification and the LAI map, respectively. Due to the heterogeneity of tundra, the effect of climate change on CO2 uptake will vary strongly according to the land cover type and, moreover, likely changes in their relative coverage in the future will have great impact on the regional CO2 balance.					; Marushchak, Maija/G-1444-2011; Elsakov, Vladimir/P-9630-2015; Biasi, Christina/E-1130-2013; Friborg, Thomas/E-5433-2015	Marushchak, Maija E./0000-0002-2308-5049; Virtanen, Tarmo/0000-0001-8660-2464; Elsakov, Vladimir/0000-0001-7111-5161; Biasi, Christina/0000-0002-7413-3354; Friborg, Thomas/0000-0001-5633-6097													1726-4170	1726-4189					2013	10	1					437	452		10.5194/bg-10-437-2013	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-10-437-2013													WOS:000314173700028

The resulting surfaces can be resolved as grids (i.e., maps) or as point estimates at locations of interest. Recent efforts, detailed here include: updated models for the most recent 30-year normal period (i.e., 1981-2010), moisture balance models, future climate projections using the latest round of general circulation model (GCM) outputs and emissions scenarios, lake ice freeze/thaw models, and growing season models. These models are available to the Canadian forest community and beyond via the internet (http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/projects/3) or by contacting the senior author.

Microtopographic controls on ecosystem functioning in the Arctic Coastal Plain	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The investigation of the microtopographic controls on thermal and hydrologic conditions of the soil and consequently the carbon dynamics from Arctic regions is of major importance. Ecosystem respiration (ER) between microsites of the same tundra type could differ more than ER in different tundra types even at different latitudes. In this study we investigated the microtopographic effect on soil temperature, thaw depth, pH, oxidation reduction potential (ORP), electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved CO2, vegetation types, and ER rates from different features forming the low-center polygon structure. Most of these environmental variables significantly differ particularly between areas with higher elevation (polygon rims) and with lower elevation (low-center polygons). Polygon rims presented the lowest water table and showed the lowest thaw depth and the highest ER (a seasonal average of 1 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)), almost double than the ER in the low-center polygons (a seasonal average of 0.6 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). The microtopographic gradient from polygon rims to low-centers led to a very consistent pattern in pH, EC, ORP and dissolved CO2, with low-centers presenting the highest pH, the highest EC, the highest dissolved CO2, and the lowest ORP. Based on vegetation measurements, we also showed that microtopography controls the lateral flow of organic matter, and that vascular plant material accumulates as litter in the lower elevation areas, possibly contributing to the higher dissolved CO2 in the low-center polygons. Microtopography, and the ramifications discussed here, should be considered when evaluating landscape scale environmental controls on carbon dynamics in the Arctic.					; Zona, Donatella/G-4039-2010; Oberbauer, Steven/JNE-2672-2023; Oechel, Walter/F-9361-2010	Zulueta, Rommel/0000-0002-2441-8845; Zona, Donatella/0000-0002-0003-4839; Oechel, Walter/0000-0002-3504-026X													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUL 27	2011	116								G00I08	10.1029/2009JG001241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JG001241													WOS:000293375700001

However, few studies have quantified the role of diffusion and ebullition pathways in total CH4 emission from agricultural ditches. This study measured the spatiotemporal variations of diffusive and ebullitive CH4 fluxes from a multi -level ditch system in a typical temperate agriculture area, and assessed their contributions to the total CH4 emission. Results illustrated that the mean annual CH4 flux in the ditch system reached 1475.1 mg m- 2 d-1, among which 1376.7 mg m- 2 d-1 was emitted via diffusion and 98.5 mg m- 2 d-1 via ebullition. Both diffusive and ebullitive fluxes varied significantly across different types of ditches and seasons, with diffusion dominating CH4 emission in middle -size ditches and ebullition dominating in large -size ditches. Diffusion was primarily driven by large nutrient inputs from adjacent farmlands, while hydrological factors like water temperature and depth controlled ebullition. Overall, CH4 emission accounted for 86 % of the global warming potential across the ditch system, with 81 % attributed to diffusion and 5 % to ebullition. This study highlights the importance of agricultural ditches as hotspots for CH4 emissions, particularly the dominant role of the diffusion pathway.

Assessment of benthic macroinvertebrate response to anthropogenic and natural disturbances in the Kodungallur-Azhikode estuary, southwest coast of India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Benthic biotic indices are important ecological tools extensively used to understand the ecological quality of coastal wetlands. The present study aimed to assess the ecological status of Kodungallur-Azhikode estuary for the first time by using widely used benthic indices such as species richness (S), Shannon diversity index (H ' log(2)), BENTIX, benthic opportunistic polychaetes amphipods (BOPA), AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) and multivariate AMBI (M-AMBI). In the canonical correspondence analysis, salinity, dissolved oxygen, organic matter, sediment Eh, sediment pH and sand were identified as important variance descriptors. A single species of an opportunist,Americorophium triaeonyx, an amphipod belonging to the ecological group (EG) III, significantly contributed to the total macrofaunal density. Other dominant opportunistic species includedObelia bidentata(EGII),Arcuatula senhousia(EGIII),Cirolana fluviatilis(EGII),Prionospio cirrifera(EGIV) andCapitellasp. (EGV). The overall assessment indicated a 'good to moderate' condition in AMBI, 'good to poor' condition in M-AMBI, 'high to moderate' condition in BENTIX, 'high to poor' condition in BOPA and 'moderate to poor' condition in univariate Shannon diversity index. All the multivariate indices tested in the study were correlated with each other except BOPA and M-AMBI. The group of stations dominated with a sandy substrate and a moderate level of organic content indicated high to good conditions while other stations demonstrated moderate to poor conditions. However, no significant variation in indices tested between seasons was observed. The present study recommends long-term monitoring of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages with proper taxonomic identification and functional trait analysis for better calibration of indices, which is the key factor for getting better results.					; Paravanparambil Rajakumar, Jayachandran/A-6956-2019; Joseph, Philomina/HLG-7077-2023; Jayachandran, Paravanparambil Rajakumar/A-6956-2019	Joseph, Philomina/0000-0003-2139-5593; Jima, Mantodi/0000-0002-9515-7726; Jayachandran, Paravanparambil Rajakumar/0000-0002-4710-2130; Bijoy Nandan, Sivasankaran/0000-0003-2476-6935													0167-6369	1573-2959				SEP 8	2020	192	10							626	10.1007/s10661-020-08582-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08582-x								32897415					WOS:000571787000002

Due to its hypersalinity, temperature and humidity fluctuations, high exposure to UV radiation, and its elevated concentration of chaotropic agents like MgCl2, LiCl and NaBr, SdU is considered a polyextreme environment. Here, we report the prokaryotic abundance and diversity of 46 samples obtained in different seasons and geographical areas. The identified bacterial community was found to be more heterogeneous than the archaeal community, with both communities varying geographically. A seasonal difference has been detected for archaea. Salinibacter, Halonotius and Halorubrum were the most abundant genera in Salar de Uyuni. Different unclassified archaea were also detected. In addition, the diversity of two subsurface samples obtained at 20 and 80 m depth was evaluated and compared with the surface data, generating an evolutionary record of a multilayer hypersaline ecosystem.					; Escudero, Cristina/S-2175-2019; Amils, Ricardo/X-2706-2019; Rodriguez, Nuria/AAM-9878-2020; Martinez, Jose M./S-2992-2019; Rubin, Sergio/AAR-1445-2021	Amils Pibernat, Ricardo/0000-0002-7560-1033; Martinez, Jose M./0000-0003-3954-2985; RODRIGUEZ, NURIA/0000-0003-4109-4851; Escudero, Cristina/0000-0003-1240-4144; Rubin, Sergio/0000-0002-3387-7760													1462-2912	1462-2920				JUL	2021	23	7					3987	4001		10.1111/1462-2920.15411	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.15411		FEB 2021						33511754					WOS:000617480300001

Zooarchaeological analysis revealed the presence of modified and unmodified bones and teeth from numerous imported mammal species. Local geographic and environmental conditions preclude permanent establishment of terrestrial mammal populations and as such, there are no native mammalian taxa on the island itself or the surrounding oceanic archipelago. The presence of these faunal remains on Dos Mosquises can be attributed to the intentional movement of animal resources from the mainland to Los Roques by indigenous groups in the Late Ceramic Age (similar to AD 1200-1500). Despite attributions to a mainland source region, little else is known about the origins of these unique specimens. Here, we apply strontium (Sr-87/Sr-86), oxygen (delta O-18), and carbon (delta C-13) isotope analyses of tooth enamel from various archeologically recovered taxa including deer, peccary, tapir, ocelot, margay, opossum, fox, and weasel to investigate their geographic origins via comparisons with macro-regional models of precipitation delta O-18 and bioavailable Sr-87/Sr-86. The Sr-87/Sr-86 results are highly variable both for the overall assemblage and between specimens within the same taxa, indicating origins from different geochemical environments of mainland South America. The combined archeological and isotopic evidence are consistent with origins within the late pre-colonial Valencioid Sphere of Interaction which encompassed the Lake Valencia Basin, surrounding regions, and several offshore island groups including Los Roques archipelago.

J	Alsdorf, D; Han, SC; Bates, P; Melack, J				Alsdorf, Douglas; Han, Shin-Chan; Bates, Paul; Melack, John			Seasonal water storage on the Amazon floodplain measured from satellites	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The amount of water stored and moving through the Amazon floodplain is not known, yet is necessary for understanding the role of the wetland in the regional carbon balance and the sediment and nutrient exchanged with the main river channel. Here, we separate the Amazon floodplain into six 330 km x 330 km areas and use gravimetric and imaging satellite methods (i.e., GRACE, SRTM, GPCP and JERS-1) to estimate the amounts of water filling and draining from the mainstem Amazon floodplain. We show that the amount of water stored on and subsequently drained from the mainstem Amazon floodplain each year represents about 5% of the total volume of water discharged from the Amazon River into the Atlantic Ocean. Despite a five-fold increase in mainstem discharge from upstream to downstream, the floodplain water volume exchanged with the river only doubles (based on all six 330 km reach lengths). Rates of exchange along the 330 km reach lengths vary from 5500 m(3)/s during floodplain infilling to -7500 m(3)/s during drainage. The contribution to the floodplain from local upland runoff represents less than 20% of the floodplain water volume for any given time. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is an overflow lake which absorbs and releases water seasonally. To evaluate the geochemical cycling of nitrogen (N) in Poyang Lake, the spatial distributions of ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) and total nitrogen (TN) in sediments and overlying water were measured. The experimental results showed that the average concentrations of TN in the sediment samples, surface water, and bottom water samples from Poyang Lake were 1,107.375 mg kg(-1), 1.998 and 2.237 mg L-1, respectively. The highest concentrations of TN were measured in the water and sediment obtained from the river tail region south of Poyang Lake, with decreasing pattern from south to north affected by the river input. The contribution of TN to the internal load played an important role on N distribution in the overlying water. The vertical distribution of TN in sediment cores of Poyang Lake showed a decreasing trend with depth. The NH4+-N content in sediment cores initially decreased with depth and then increased slowly. The NO3--N content in sediment cores exhibited an inverse trend compared with that of NH4+-N due to the influence of nitrification and denitrification processes. Release kinetic experiments of NH4+-N demonstrated that the maximum NH4+-N release rate occurred within first 5 min and reached 90-94 % of the maximum value within 0-10 min.					; Wang, Lingqing/AAF-7692-2020	Wang, Lingqing/0000-0001-5123-9423; Liang, Tao/0000-0002-4218-7278; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				JUL	2015	74	1					771	778		10.1007/s12665-015-4081-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4081-8													WOS:000356347800061

This role has often been neglected in routine monitoring of water quality since the main focus has been addressed on macronutrients such phosphorus and nitrogen. To elucidate the potential regulation exerted by iron availability on phytoplankton, a limnological investigation was carried out in two neighboring eutrophic reservoirs in tropical China. Traditional physical and chemical variables were measured along with total and dissolved iron concentrations to explore how they could influence phytoplankton structure. Statistical analyses showed that dissolved iron (DFe) as well as dissolved nitrogen (DIN) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) significantly explained the variance of phytoplankton assemblages in both reservoirs. We could also find that diazotrophic cyanobacteria blooms generally developed when DFe concentrations were above 0.025 mg/L. Moreover, the DFe availability in the water columns was modulated by the effects exerted by the stratification/ circulation patterns on redox conditions and pH values. Anaerobic conditions favored the release of iron and phosphorus from sediments, and likely favored an enhanced nitrogen assimilation and a decrease of DIN in the epilimnion. Our results highlighted that iron functions as an important factor promoting diazotrophic cyanobacteria and driving seasonal phytoplankton succession in tropical eutrophic reservoirs, not only with a direct effect on phytoplankton growth but also indirect effect by modifying the availability of nitrogen and phosphorus.					; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/A-3824-2008	Lin, Qiuqi/0000-0002-9643-3665; Naselli-Flores, Luigi/0000-0003-3748-3862													1470-160X	1872-7034				JUN	2021	125								107446	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107446	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107446		FEB 2021											WOS:000639292000005

We describe for the first time some life-history traits of a red swamp crayfish population in the Nature Reserve of the Lago di Candia (Italy). We investigated (1) preferences of this species for specific environmental features on the banks of the lake, and (2) differences in size, sex ratio, and condition index between individuals caught in lake and marsh. Moreover, we compared sampling effort and the features of individuals caught in the lake, for two sampling seasons in 2014 and 2015. Findings indicated that the population was well established, and the marsh seemed to have better conditions for growth of individuals than the lake. Accordingly, continuity of riparian vegetation, opportunity to dig burrows, and trophic resource availability seems to facilitate the proliferation of the crayfish in the lake. Our study demonstrated that massive removal efforts over the whole active period of the species and more than one year of trapping are necessary to increase the controlling activities' success. This study could have important implications for further population management projects directed at biodiversity conservation in the area.

Multivariate analyses showed significant differences in trace element accumulation between seasons, sites and species thus highlighting the importance of a multi-species and seasonal approach to monitor trace metals in coastal areas. Biotasediment accumulation factors (BSAF) showed limited transfer from sediments to marine organisms suggesting that the bioaccumulation of trace elements by marine organisms should be assessed by considering multiple sources of contaminants. Lead (Pb) levels (0.07-4.44 mg.kg(-1)) measured in algae and Cd (0.54-7.74 mg.kg(-1)) and Zn (42.88-972 mg.kg(-1)) levels found in the oyster, were similar and sometimes higher than those found in other polluted areas indicating that the Lebanese coast is subject to environmental pollution.

The study adapts the mesoscale Hydrological Model (mHM) which is applied separately in the Upper Lake Malawi and Shire River basins. A particular Lake Malawi model, which focuses on reservoir routing and lake water balance, has been developed and is interlinked between the two basins. Climate change projections from 20 Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) models for Africa based on two scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for the periods 2021-2050 and 2071-2100 are used. An annual temperature increase of 1 degrees C decreases mean lake level and outflow by 0.3 m and 17%, respectively, signifying the importance of intensified evaporation for Lake Malawi's water budget. Meanwhile, a +5% (-5%) deviation in annual rainfall changes mean lake level by +0.7 m (-0.6 m). The combined effects of temperature increase and rainfall decrease result in significantly lower flows in the Shire River. The hydrological river regime may change from perennial to seasonal with the combination of annual temperature increase and precipitation decrease beyond 1.5 degrees C (3.5 degrees C) and -20% (-15%). The study further projects a reduction in annual hydropower production between 1% (RCP8.5) and 2.5% (RCP4.5) during 2021-2050 and between 5% (RCP4.5) and 24% (RCP8.5) during 2071-2100. The results show that it is of great importance that a further development of hydro energy on the Shire River should take into account the effects of climate change, e.g., longer low flow periods and/or higher discharge fluctuations, and thus uncertainty in the amount of electricity produced.

This study presents global and regional comparisons between two multisatellite surface water extent datasets, the Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) and the Surface Water Microwave Product Series (SWAMPS), for the 1993-2007 period, along with two widely used static inundation datasets, the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database (GLWD) and the Matthews and Fung wetland estimates. Maximum surface water extents derived from these datasets are largely different: similar to 13 x 10(6) km(2) from GLWD, 5.3 x 10(6) km(2) from Matthews and Fung, similar to 6.2 x 10(6) km(2) from GIEMS, and similar to 10.3 x 10(6) km(2) from SWAMPS. SWAMPS global maximum surface extent reduces by nearly 51% (to similar to 5 x 10(6) km(2)) when applying a coastal filter, showing a strong contamination in this retrieval over the coastal regions. Anomalous surface waters are also detected with SWAMPS over desert areas. The seasonal amplitude of the GIEMS surface waters is much larger than the SWAMPS estimates, and GIEMS dynamics is more consistent with other hydrological variables such as the river discharge. Over the Amazon basin, GIEMS and SWAMPS show a very high time series correlation (95%), but with SWAMPS maximum extent half the size of that from GIEMS and from previous synthetic aperture radar estimates. Over the Niger basin, SWAMPS seasonal cycle is out of phase with both GIEMS and MODIS-derived water extent estimates, as well as with river discharge data.

In this study, soil water regime and water balance in a transplanted rice field with reduced irrigation (multiple shallow depth irrigations) in the Taihu Lake Basin of East China were observed and then evaluated using Hydrus-1D model during two consecutive growing seasons. During the 2008 season, irrigation water accounted for 48% of the total water input (TWI, 94.6 cm), but only 20% of TWI (120.4 cm) during the 2009 season. Due to heavy rainfalls during the wet 2009 season, surface runoff accounted for about 6.4% of the TWI, whereas during the much drier 2008 season with higher controlled irrigation inputs, no surface runoff occurred. Simulated evapotranspiration during the 2008 and 2009 seasons accounted for 67.4% and 54.9% of TWIs, respectively. Measured and simulated results indicate that water percolation (approximately 32.5% and 37.6% of TWIs during the 2008 and 2009 seasons, respectively) was the main path of water losses from the transplanted rice fields, suggesting that long and high standing water during the 2009 season increased water percolation. Water productivities evaluated from total irrigations and TWIs were 2.08 and 0.99 kg.m(-3) during the 2008 season and 3.85 and 0.77 kg.m(-3) during the 2009 season, respectively, and were 1.47 and 1.40 kg . m(-3), respectively, when evaluated from modeled evapotranspiration fluxes. The cultivation method with multiple shallow depth irrigation efficiently used rainfall water and reduced the losses due to water percolation and surface runoff by stabilizing rice yields.

Global change aggravates drought, with consequences for plant reproduction	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background The frequency and intensity of droughts are expected to increase under global change, driven by anthropogenic climate change and water diversion. Precipitation is expected to become more episodic under climate change, with longer and warmer dry spells, although some areas might become wetter. Diversion of freshwater from lakes and rivers and groundwater pumping for irrigation of agricultural fields are lowering water availability to wild plant populations, increasing the frequency and intensity of drought. Given the importance of seasonal changes and extremes in soil moisture to influence plant reproduction, and because the majority of plants are flowering plants and most of them depend on pollinators for seed production, this review focuses on the consequences of drought on different aspects of reproduction in animal-pollinated angiosperms, emphasizing interactions among drought, flowering and pollination.Scope Visual and olfactory traits play crucial roles in attracting pollinators. Drought-induced floral changes can influence pollinator attraction and visitation, together with pollinator networks and flowering phenology, with subsequent effects on plant reproduction. Here, we review how drought influences these different aspects of plant reproduction. We identify knowledge gaps and highlight areas that would benefit from additional research.Conclusions Visual and olfactory traits are affected by drought, but their phenotypic responses can vary with floral sex, plant sex, population and species. Ample phenotypic plasticity to drought exists for these traits, providing an ability for a rapid response to a change in drought frequency and intensity engendered by global change. The impact of these drought-induced changes in floral traits on pollinator attraction, pollen deposition and plant reproductive success does not show a clear pattern. Drought affects the structure of plant-pollinator networks and can modify plant phenology. The impact of drought on plant reproduction is not always negative, and we need to identify plant characteristics associated with these more positive responses.

Therefore, a high-throughput dilution-to-extinction culturing (HTC) approach was implemented herein to enable the culture of these bacterioplankton lineages using water samples collected at various seasons and depths from Lake Soyang, an oligotrophic reservoir located in South Korea. Some predominant freshwater bacteria have been isolated from Lake Soyang via HTC (e.g., the acI lineage); however, large-scale HTC studies encompassing different seasons and water depths have not been documented yet. In this HTC approach, bacterial growth was detected in 14% of 5,376 inoculated wells. Further, phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA genes from a total of 605 putatively axenic bacterial cultures indicated that the HTC isolates were largely composed of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. Importantly, the isolates were distributed across diverse taxa including phylogenetic lineages that are widely known cosmopolitan and representative freshwater bacterial groups such as the acI, acIV, LD28, FukuN57, MNG9, and TRA3-20 lineages. However, some abundant bacterial groups including the LD12 lineage, Chloroflexi, and Acidobacteria could not be domesticated. Among the 71 taxonomic groups in the HTC isolates, representative strains of 47 groups could either form colonies on agar plates or be revived from frozen glycerol stocks. Additionally, season and water depth significantly affected bacterial community structure, as demonstrated by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing analyses. Therefore, our study successfully implemented a dilution-to-extinction cultivation strategy to cultivate previously uncultured or underrepresented freshwater bacterial groups, thus expanding the basis for future multi-omic studies.

Lake Shaman record indicates that the upper Rio Cisnes valley was free of ice at around 19 cal ka BP. From this date and until 14.8 cal ka BP, a grass steppe with high proportions of shrubs associated to colder and drier conditions than present developed in this area. A continuous increase of Nothofagus accompanied by a decline in the steppe shrubs and sudden dominance of paludal over aquatic plants from 11 cal ka BP was associated to effective moisture increase but still under modern values. The replacement of the cold-dry grass-shrub steppe by a similar-than-present forest-steppe ecotone suggests an increase in temperature indicating the onset of the Holocene. At the same time, moderate fire activity suggested by the charcoal record could be related to major fuel availability as consequence of Nothofagus forest expansion. Between 8 and 3 cal ka BP, the record indicates the easternmost position of the forest-steppe ecotone suggesting the highest effective moisture with the establishment of seasonality between 5 and 3 cal ka BP. From 3 cal ka BP, the record indicates a retraction of the forest-steppe ecotone accompanied by a high pollen record variability and an increased fire activity. These late changes suggest decreased effective moisture associated with a high climatic variability. At regional and extra-regional scale, climatic changes at Lake Shaman's record are mostly associated to changes (latitudinal shifts and/or strengthening/weakening) of past Southern Westerlies that were previously recorded along Patagonia from the Lateglacial to the mid-Holocene. During the Late Holocene, a regional pattern characterized by high record variability emerges throughout Central Chilean Patagonia. This variability would be related to (1) low magnitude Southern Westerlies changes probably associated to ENSO and/or SAM or (2) the complex relationships between vegetation. fire and human occupations during the last 3 cal ka.

Southern China is a traditional region for rice multi-cropping, yet less is known about its spatial-temporal changes under the background of rapid urbanization in recent decades. Based on images from Landsat and MODIS and multiple land cover products, the gap-filling and Savitzky-Golay filter method (GF-SG), the enhanced pixel-based phenological features composite approach (Eppf-CM), random forest (RF), and the difference in NDVI approach (DNDVI) were combined to map the rice cropping pattern with a spatial resolution of 30 x 30 m over Southern China in 2000 and 2020 through Google Earth Engine (GEE). Subsequently, the spatial-temporal changes in rice cropping intensity and their driving factors were examined by Getis-Ord Gi* and geographical detector. The results showed that the produced rice cropping pattern maps exhibited high accuracy, with kappa coefficients and overall accuracies exceeding 0.81 and 90%, respectively. Over the past two decades, the planting areas of double-season rice in Southern China decreased by 54.49%, and a reduction was observed across eight provinces, while only half of the provinces exhibited an increase in the planting areas of single-season rice. Compared to the year 2000, the planting area of the conversion from double- to single-season rice cropping systems in 2020 was 2.71 times larger than that of the conversion from single- to double-season rice cropping systems. The hotspots of the change in rice cropping intensity were mainly located in the central part of Southern China (excluding the Poyang Lake Plain). The decline in the rural labor force, coupled with >= 10 degrees C accumulated temperature and topographical factors, plays a crucial role in the decreased intensity of rice cropping. Our findings can be beneficial for realizing regional agricultural sustainability and food security.

Here we use multivariate statistical analysis to explore the relationship between the Pediastrum composition of lake surface sediments and environmental variables. The findings highlight the mean growing season air temperature between March and October (TMar-Oct) as the most important factor determining the Pediastrum composition. We then establish the first transfer function between the Pediastrum taxa and TMar-Oct, which enables us to provide a quantitative temperature reconstruction for the past similar to 8.2 kyr based on sedimentary subfossil Pediastrum records from Bosten Lake in Xinjiang, China. Our findings reveal an exceptionally warm climate during similar to 4.8-3.6 kyr, with temperatures similar to 4 degrees C higher compared to those during similar to 8.2-4.8 kyr. This unusually warm climate is verified by the carbonate clumped isotopes record of the same core and other paleoclimate records. These findings contribute to our understanding of past temperature changes in Central Asia and provide a basis for future research on long-term lake ecosystem dynamics under past climatic warming.					; Wang, Wenjia/NYS-6033-2025; Xiang, Lixiong/JWP-9016-2024; Zhang, Jiawu/C-8633-2011; Zhang, Jun/AAF-6673-2019; Rudaya, Natalia/B-1622-2012; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011; xiuxiu, ren/JWO-0977-2024	Huang, Xiaozhong/0000-0002-2127-0451; /0000-0002-4471-8511; Rudaya, Natalia/0000-0003-1536-6470; Schwalb, Antje/0000-0002-4628-1958; Xiang, Lixiong/0000-0002-7064-4384; 													0277-3791	1873-457X				MAR 1	2024	327								108516	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108516	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108516		JAN 2024											WOS:001176200700001

Changes in phytoplankton community composition, biomass, primary productivity, nitrogenase activity and the abundance of toxic and non-toxic Microcystis aeruginosa subpopulations were investigated during 13 days of exposure. We aimed to test whether the known allelopathic activity of M. spicatum towards certain algae and cyanobacteria could be proven under field-like conditions with potential interference of resource competition and zooplankton grazing. The presence of M. spicatum had only short-term inhibitory patterns on total phytoplankton and green algae, whereas consistent negative effects were observed on cyanobacteria biomass. Quantitative PCR analyses revealed that toxic and non-toxic M. aeruginosa were equally inhibited. Total phytoplankton gross primary production was significantly suppressed by the presence of M. spicatum. Despite the partial interference by nutrient limitation, there are indications for a significant impact of macrophyte-excreted allelo-chemicals on phytoplankton. We argue that more mesocosm experiments with complex natural phytoplankton communities are needed to unravel the ecological relevance of macrophyte allelopathy.					; Hilt, Sabine/IUQ-1586-2023	Paskauskas, Ricardas/0000-0003-1531-1971; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT	2014	737	1					57	66		10.1007/s10750-013-1782-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1782-4													WOS:000340479300005

A band-ratio algorithm for retrieving open-lake chlorophyll values from satellite observations of the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO) has collected water quality data from the five Great Lakes annually since 1993. We used the GLNPO observations made since 2002 along with coincident measurements made by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) and the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to develop a new band-ratio algorithm for estimating chlorophyll concentrations in the Great Lakes from satellite observations. The new algorithm is based on a third-order polynomial model using the same maximum band ratios employed in the standard NASA algorithms (OC4 for SeaWiFS and OC3M for MODIS). The sensor-specific coefficients for the new algorithm were obtained by fitting the relationship to several hundred matched field and satellite observations. Although there are some seasonal variations in some lakes, the relationship between the observed chlorophyll values and those modeled using the new coefficients is fairly stable from lake to lake and across years. The accuracy of the satellite chlorophyll estimates derived from the new algorithm was improved substantially relative both to the standard NASA retrievals and to previously published algorithms tuned to individual lakes. Monte-Carlo fits to randomly selected subsets of the observations allowed us to estimate the uncertainty associated with the retrievals purely as a function of the satellite data. Our results provide, for the first time, a single simple band ratio method for retrieving chlorophyll concentrations in the offshore "open" waters of the Great Lakes from satellite observations.

In the Pampas region, Argentina, an intensification of rainfall is expected during the periods of maximum agrochemical application. This study assesses the main factors determining the zooplankton community attributes in three streams belonging to the agricultural Pampas region, Argentina, and the effect of rainfall and seasonal crop practices on the zooplankton community composition. Sampling campaigns were performed before and after three rainfall events during two seasonal crop practices: (1) soybean chemical fallow-sowing and corn vegetative growth-flowering, (2) soybean vegetative growth-grain filling and corn sowing. The runoff in agricultural areas affected the zooplankton community attributes and composition. The biological oxygen demand, turbidity, and conductivity were the main water quality variables affecting the zooplankton community attributes. The increase of these variables after rainfall or during pre-emergence crop practices favoured the zooplankton groups most tolerant to eutrophication such as Bdelloidea, Chydoridae, Moinidae, and Sididae. Factors such as rainfall and seasonal crop practices must be considered in environmental monitoring design.					; Gutierrez, María Florencia/AFG-1766-2022; Andrade, Victoria/D-4170-2015	Andrade, Victoria Soledad/0000-0002-1860-9792; Gutierrez, Maria Florencia/0000-0003-2644-3339; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2022	29	27					41713	41724		10.1007/s11356-021-18417-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-18417-y		JAN 2022						35098456					WOS:000750403700010

Impact of the Linked Surface Water-Soil Water-Groundwater System on Transport of E. coli in the Subsurface	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Escherichia coli (E. coli) contamination of groundwater (GW) and surface water (SW) occurs significantly through the subsurface from onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTSs). However, E. coli transport in the subsurface remains inadequately characterized at the field scale, especially within the vadose zone. Therefore, the aim of this research is to investigate the impact of groundwater fluctuations (e.g., recharging, discharging conditions) and variable conditions in the vadose zone (e.g., pulses of E. coli flux) by characterizing E. coli fate and transport in a linked surface watersoil water-groundwater system (SW-SoW-GW). In particular, this study characterizes the impact of flow regimes on E. coli transport in the subsurface and evaluates the sensitivity of parameters that control the transport of E. coli in the SW-SoW-GW system. This study was conducted in Lake Granbury, which is an important water supply in north-central Texas providing water for over 250,000 people. Results showed that there was less removal of E. coli during groundwater recharge events as compared to GW discharge events. Also, groundwater and surface water systems largely control E. coli transport in the subsurface; however, temporal variability of E. coli can be explained by linking the SW-SoW-GW system. Moreover, sensitivity analysis revealed that saturated water content of the soil, total retention rate coefficient, and hydraulic conductivity are important parameters for E. coli transport in the subsurface.

Concurrent meteorological data were measured from the fieldwork boat at the location of the turbulence measurements. During the fieldwork campaign (March 2017-June 2018), four different sites were sampled on a monthly basis, following a standardized protocol in terms of time-of-day and locations of the measurements. Additional monitoring activity included a 24-h campaign and sampling at other sites. Turbulence quantities were estimated, quality-checked, and merged with water quality and meteorological data to produce a unique turbulence atlas for a lake. The dataset is open to a wide range of possible applications, including research on the variability of turbulent mixing across seasons and sites (demersal vs pelagic zones) and driven by different factors (lake-valley breezes vs buoyancy-driven convection), validation of hydrodynamic lake models, as well as technical studies on the use of shear and temperature microstructure sensors.

M.			Habitat suitability of the invasive water hyacinth and its relation to water quality and macroinvertebrate diversity in a tropical reservoir	LIMNOLOGICA												In this study, we assessed the relationship between the occurrence of the invasive water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and water quality properties as well as macroinvertebrate diversity in a tropical reservoir, situated in western Ecuador. Macroinvertebrates and physico-chemical water quality variables were sampled at 32 locations (during the dry season of 2013) in both sites covered and non-covered by water hyacinth in the Daule-Peripa reservoir. The results indicated that, in terms of water quality, only turbidity was significantly different between sampling sites with and without water hyacinth (Mann Whitney U-test, p <0.01). The habitat suitability model showed that water hyacinth was present at sites with a low turbidity. The percentage water hyacinth cover increased with decreasing turbidity. The Biological Monitoring Working Party-Colombia score and the Margalef diversity index were significantly higher (Mann Whitney U-test, p <0.01) at sampling sites where water hyacinth was present compared to water hyacinth absent sites. However, there were no significant differences in the Shannon Wiener index, Evenness index and Simpson index between the sampling sites with and without water hyacinth. Our results suggest that water hyacinth cover was an important variable affecting the diversity of macroinvertebrates in the Daule-Peripa reservoir, with intermediate levels of water hyacinth cover having a positive effect on the diversity of macroinvertebrates. Information on the habitat suitability of water hyacinth and its effect on the physico-chemical water quality and the macroinvertebrate community are essential to develop conservation and management programs for large tropical reservoirs such as the Daule-Peripa reservoir and the Guayas river basin, where water resources are being at high risk due to expansion of agricultural and industrial development activities.

Refractory dissolved organic nitrogen accumulation in high-elevation lakes	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												The role of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as either a sink for inorganic nutrients or an additional nutrient source is an often-neglected component of nutrient budgets in aquatic environments. Here, we examined the role of DOM in reactive nitrogen (N) storage in Sierra Nevada (California, USA) lakes where atmospheric deposition of N has shifted the lakes toward seasonal phosphorus (P)-limitation. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and isotope analyses performed on DOM isolated from Lake Tahoe reveal the accumulation of refractory proteinaceous material with a 100-200-year residence time. In contrast, smaller lakes in the same watershed contain DOM with typical terrestrial characteristics, indicating that proteins in Lake Tahoe are autochthonously produced. These data support the role of DOM as a possible sink for reactive N in these lake ecosystems and identify a potential role for DOM in affecting the inorganic nutrient stoichiometry of these environments.

These lake models have already demonstrated their capability of reproducing the temperature distribution in smaller lakes and include one eddy-diffusive lake model, the Hostetler model; a Lagrangian model, the one-dimensional Dynamic Reservoir Simulation Model "DYRESM"; a kappa-epsilon turbulence model, "SIMSTRAT"; and one based on the concept of self-similarity (assumed shape) of the temperature-depth curve, the Freshwater Lake model "FLake." Only DYRESM and SIMSTRAT reproduce the variability of the water temperature profiles and seasonal thermocline satisfactorily. In layers in which thermocline variability is greatest, the temperature root mean square error is <2 degrees C and 3 degrees C (at the time of highest stratification) for these models, respectively. It is possible to apply certain one-dimensional lake models that simulate the behavior of temperature to investigate the potential future warming of the water column in Lake Geneva. Importantly, the metalimnion boundary is successfully modeled, which represents an encouraging step toward demonstrating the feasibility of coupling biogeochemical modules, such as, for example, a phytoplanktonic model, to assess the possible biological responses within lakes to climate change.

However, there is a lack of knowledges for the rainfed wheat systems in abundant rainfall areas, where the erratic rainfall may constrain the wheat yield and increases N losses from wheat fields with excessive fertilizer inputs. In the present study, a 6 consecutive years field experiments were conducted to investigate the wheat yield and N losses responses to different N fertilizer rates in the Taihu Lake region. Despite the fluctuations in the wheat yield, a 10-30% reduction of the district average N input sustained the current-level of wheat yield for the 6 consecutive years. The N rate of 168 kg ha-1 might be the threshold N application rate, because if it was exceeded, it was no longer the predominant factor determining the wheat yield, but significantly increased the N losses fluxes. The seasonal total N losses fluxes were 69.2 kg N ha-1, which accounted for 28.8% of district averaged N input. Runoff was the predominant pathway of N loss from the wheat field, followed by ammonia volatilization and leaching. Nitrate was the predominant form in the runoff and leakage water. Seasonal cumulative nitrate losses via runoff and ammonia volatilization averaged 25.2 and 20.1 kg ha- 1 per wheat season, respectively, corresponding to 10.5% and 8.38% of the regional N application rates. However, the seasonal nitrate loss via leakage was the lowest, less than 8.98 kg ha- 1. Reducing the fertilizer N rates significantly decreased the N losses via runoff and ammonia volatilization, but not by leaching. Our findings indicated that reducing N fertilizer was impressive for the sustainable development of agriculture in Eastern China and 168 kg N ha-1 was recommended for the rainfed wheat.					; Zhu, Ningyuan/HPG-8673-2023; Schwenke, Graeme/HGF-2096-2022; Tang, Jun/G-5820-2017	Schwenke, Graeme/0000-0002-2206-4350; 													0959-6526	1879-1786				SEP 1	2022	364								132475	10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132475	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132475													WOS:000821942100007

Variable fecal source prioritization in recreational waters routinely monitored with viral and bacterial general indicators	WATER RESEARCH												Somatic and F+ coliphage methods are under consideration as potential routine surface water quality monitoring tools to identify unsafe levels of fecal pollution in recreational waters. However, little is known about the cooccurrence of these virus-based fecal indicators and host-associated genetic markers used to prioritize key pollution sources for remediation. In this study, paired measurements of cultivated coliphage (somatic and F+) and bacterial (E. coli and enterococci) general fecal indicators and genetic markers indicative of human (HF183/BacR287 and HumM2), ruminant (Rum2Bac), canine (DG3), and avian (GFD) fecal pollution sources were assessed in 365 water samples collected from six Great Lakes Basin beach and river sites over a 15-week recreational season. Water samples were organized into groups based on defined viral and bacterial fecal indicator water quality thresholds and average log(10) host-associated genetic marker fecal score ratios were estimated to compare pollutant source inferences based on variable routine water quality monitoring practices. Eligible log(10) fecal score ratios ranged from -0.051 (F+ coliphage, GFD) to 2.08 (enterococci, Rum2Bac). Using a fecal score ratio approach, findings suggest that general fecal indicator selection for routine water quality monitoring can influence the interpretation of host-associated genetic marker measurements, in some cases, prioritizing different pollutant sources for remediation. Variable trends were also observed between Great Lake beach and river sites suggesting disparate management practices may be useful for each water type. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Quantifying lake evaporation in hyper-arid regions by measurement and estimation can both provide reliable potential evaporation (ET0) reference and promote a deeper understanding of the regional hydrological process and its response towards changing climate. We placed a floating E601 evaporation pan on East Juyan Lake, which is representative of arid regions' terminal lakes, to measure daily evaporation and conducted simultaneous bankside synoptic observation during the growing season of 2013-2015. A semi-empirical evaporation model derived from Dalton model was parameterized and validated with measured data. The model was then used to estimate lake evaporation during 2002-2015. According to in situ measurements, maximum, minimum and mean lake evaporation were 8.1, 3.7 and 6.5 mm/day, and growing season evaporation was 1183.3 mm (similar to 80% of the annual amount). Adding up non-growing season evaporation that we converted from phi 20 pan evaporation at Ejina weather station, the annual mean lake evaporation, 1471.3 mm, was representative of lower Heihe River's ET0. Model inter-comparison implied our model performed well both in simplicity and accuracy and has potential utilization in a data-sparse area. In 2002-2015, estimated mean daily evaporation was 6.5 mm/day and growing season evaporation was 1233.7 mm. Trend analysis of estimated evaporation proved the evaporation paradox's existence in this hyper-arid region and validated complementary relationship theory's adaptability.

J	Pérez-Fuentetaja, A; Goodberry, F				Perez-Fuentetaja, Alicia; Goodberry, Fawn			Daphnia's challenge: survival and reproduction when calcium and food are limiting	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Calcium levels have declined in boreal lakes in North America and Europe due to soil mineral leaching, logging and climate change. Crustacean zooplankton species with high-calcium demand such as Daphnia, are particularly vulnerable to calcium-related stress. In a factorial design, we tested the effects of three calcium concentrations (2.5, 1.0 and 0.5 mg/L Ca) and two food levels (high = 1.67 mg/L C and low = 0.16 mg/L C) on second-generation calcium-stressed Daphnia pulex x pulicaria. Calcium limitation affected reproduction, molting and population growth, but food quantity was also relevant to how Daphnia dealt with the lack of calcium. When adequate levels of calcium were available (2.5 mg/L Ca), population growth was similar at high and low food, however, individual Daphnia produced fewer neonates at low food. Under high food and low calcium, Daphnia's life-history strategy focused on reproduction, with a negative effect on survivorship due to calcium limitation. Alternatively, under low food and low calcium, their strategy was survival and somatic maintenance, minimizing reproduction. Boreal lakes with modest levels of calcium may support Daphnia populations during periods with sufficient food, but if food quantity or quality is too low to mitigate the effects of calcium limitation, Daphnia populations could disappear due to low reproductive output.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				NOV-DEC	2016	38	6					1379	1388		10.1093/plankt/fbw077	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbw077													WOS:000393031000003

Changes in sediments and their microbial communities can greatly affect river health. Based on the collection of runoff and sediment samples from the Wuding River basin, the attribution of sediment changes and factors influencing the microbial community were analyzed. The results showed that the runoff and sediment load of Wuding River from 1956 to 2021 decrease significantly (p < 0.01). The transition years of annual runoff and sediment load generally coincided with periods of vegetation restoration, and terrace and check dam construction. Human activities contributed 71.09 % and 123.3 % to the decrease in runoff during the periods 1974 similar to 1995 and 1996 similar to 2021, respectively. Regarding sediment load, human activities contributed 74.3 %, 110.96 % and 117.3 % of the sediment load during the periods 1971 similar to 1997, 1998 similar to 2006, and 2007 similar to 2021, respectively. Runoff affects sediment microbial communities mainly through EC and pH. Sediment alters the microbial structure mainly through nitrogen and phosphorus concentration and particle composition in sediments. The refinement of sediment particles reduced the fungal abundance. Proteobacteria were the dominant phylum found in sediment bacterial communities during both non-flood (55.95 %) and flood seasons (84.39 %). Ascomycota were the dominant phylum in fungal communities during both non-flood (38.72 %) and flood seasons (19.47 %). The main influencing factors of microbial structure were electrical conductivity and sand content in the non-flood season, and the total phosphorus concentration and the total nitrogen concentration in sediment in the flood season. In summary, soil and water conservation measures not only alter sediment characteristics, but are also likely to cause profound changes in microbial diversity in rivers. The research can deepen the understanding of the sediment changes on the aquatic ecology and provide guidance for the overall ecological integrity protection of the rivers.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				FEB	2025	249								108626	10.1016/j.catena.2024.108626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2024.108626		DEC 2024											WOS:001378413500001

For the analysis of Cu, Cr, Ni, Zn, Pb and Cd in sediments, acid digestion and subsequent quantification by microwave plasma atomic emission spectroscopy was performed, whereas for Hg determination, cold vapour atomic absorption spectrophotometry was used. The general trend of the heavy metal concentration was observed as Cr > Cu > Zn > Ni > Pb > Cd > Hg, regardless of any seasonal alteration. The estuarine region was considerably contaminated by Cu and Cr (C.F. > 2) irrespective of any seasonal difference, and by Cd in 2017 non-monsoon (CF > 3). Heavy metal contamination was most pronounced during the monsoon (2018). Estuarine and marine zone together considered as deteriorated zone especially during monsoon seasons (PLI > 1, 2018 monsoon) while riverine zone remained poorly contaminated (PLI < 1). Clay Loam/Clay/Heavy Clay textures preferred polychaetes and bivalves in the estuarine and marine zone as compared to other macrobenthic communities (OMC). Among the hydrochemical parameters, total dissolved solids in general and euryhaline and slightly alkaline pH preferred domination of bivalves followed by polychaetes in non-monsoon seasons. The trace metal contamination in estuarine sediments increases the concern of bioaccumulation tendency of dominant bivalves of the estuarine and coastal sediments.

Predicting spread of aquatic invasive species by lake currents	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Knowledge of aquatic invasive species (AIS) dispersal is important to inform surveillance and management efforts to slow the spread of established invaders. We studied potential dispersal of invasive Eurasian ruffe Gymnocephalus cernua and golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei larvae in Lakes Michigan and Erie using a three-dimensional particle transport model. Ruffe is currently in Lake Superior and northern Lake Michigan, while Limnoperna has not yet invaded the Great Lakes. We predicted larval transport during several spawning seasons (individual years) from several major tributaries and ports that are most prone to invasion because of their significant recreational and commercial usage. Depending on release location, larvae traveled distances ranging from <1 km to tens of kilometers (in some cases over 100-200 km, depending on species) during 2-3 weeks of drift time. Dispersal distances from nearshore locations (i.e. rivers and ports) were smaller than from offshore deballasting locations near ports. Limnoperna dispersal distances were larger than ruffe due to stronger seasonal currents and longer drift period. Settlement areas resulting from offshore releases were larger than for nearshore releases, and larger for Limnoperna than for ruffe. Model results compared favorably to observed spread of ruffe and Dreissena spp. mussels in Lake Michigan. Our modeling effort suggests that larval advection by lake currents is an important AIS dispersal mechanism in the Great Lakes. It also emphasizes the importance of effective surveillance programs that maximize early detection of new introductions before lake current dispersal obviates containment and prevention of spread and impacts.

The results showed that the mean CO2 emission rate from the 3 ponds was 97.8 mg m(-2) h(-1) (range 50.6 to 151.0 mg m(-2) h(-1)). Apparent seasonal and diurnal variations in CO2 fluxes were observed; the lowest (1.73 mg m(-2) h(-1)) occurred in April and the highest occurred in July and August (212.9 and 181.9 mg m(-2) h(-1), respectively). The night-time to daytime CO2 emission ratio was <1 (range 0.44 to 0.83) in May during the early part of the farming season. Night-time CO2 emissions in early August were higher than those during the daytime (range 1.06 to 1.37). The night-time to daytime CO2 emission ratios were 0.84 to 1.36 during late September. The CO2 fluxes from the freshwater aquaculture ponds were higher than those of lakes and reservoirs, whereas they were lower than those of marshes in previous studies. The increases in nutrient load and pelagic respiration from feeding the fish were significantly associated with CO2 emissions from the freshwater aquaculture ponds. Freshwater aquaculture ponds in temperate monsoon climate regions contribute an estimated 2.98 million t yr(-1) CO2 based on the mean investigated CO2 emission rate, contributing 0.0088% of the current annual global CO2 emissions, and represent a small but previously unquantified CO2 emission source.					; wang, zhuonan/HNC-5335-2023; Wang, Fang/HPC-5174-2023	Dong, Shuanglin/0000-0003-0320-9136; Wang, Zhuonan/0000-0002-8945-7247; 													1869-215X	1869-7534					2016	8						31	40		10.3354/aei00149	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/aei00149													WOS:000377605600003

An average of 51 game cameras were set up at shoreline haul-out sites in central Lake Saimaa during the moulting seasons in each of the years from 2010 to 2014. Individuals were identified from their lifelong unique lateral fur patterns. A total of 220 000 digital images of seals were obtained from these game cameras and from digital cameras during this period, allowing 164 individuals to be identified, 43% of which were re-sighted in successive years. In the majority of game camera images, both sides of the seal were shown, and it was possible to determine the sex of the seal. The average distance between sightings of individual seals in different years was 1.6 km, suggesting that Saimaa ringed seals exhibit a high degree of moulting site fidelity. In addition, the results support suggestions of natal site fidelity. We propose that photo-ID sampling based on camera traps, and larger-scale photographic survey of the seals, should be implemented as a population monitoring tool of the Saimaa ringed seal. Further application of the photo-ID technique may facilitate mark-recapture population and survival rate estimates for this threatened seal species and provide significant insights into its life history and social behaviour.																			1863-5407	1613-4796					2016	30						29	36		10.3354/esr00723	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/esr00723													WOS:000379263100004

Series of monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation and air temperature for 9 meteorological stations were also studied. The trend analysis for all of the studied series of water levels in lakes showed high spatial and temporal variability. Series of annual water levels in the case of 6 lakes showed statistically significant increasing tendencies, and in 7 lakes, significant decreasing trends. Series of annual amplitudes in the majority of lakes (22) showed a decreasing trend, but they were statistically significant only in three cases. The tendencies for air temperature fluctuations are more statistically significant than precipitation. The key role in determining water level changes is played by local factors, particularly including human economic activity, obscuring the effect of natural factors on water level changes. The paper describes cases of changes in water levels in lakes under anthro-popressure related to among others: agricultural irrigations, hydropower infrastructure, water transfers, navigation, or mining.

J	Dong, SY; Peng, F; You, QG; Guo, J; Xue, X				Dong, Siyang; Peng, Fei; You, Quangang; Guo, Jian; Xue, Xian			Lake dynamics and its relationship to climate change on the Tibetan Plateau over the last four decades	REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE												The high sensitivity of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) to global warming is ascribed not only to its high altitude and low temperature but also to the change in the components of water cycling, such as glaciers' retreat, permafrost degradation, and lakes' shrinkage or expansion. Among the components, change in lakes attracts more attention as lakes are crucial for local water management and are easier to monitor. But, how water cycling components respond to global change remains unclear, although they are crucial in understanding the regional environmental change. Lakes, glaciers, and permafrost data derived from meteorological records and remote sensing images were used to detect the change of the water environment on the TP from 1971 to 2013. The climate on TP changed toward a warm-humid condition in the last four decades. Three-quarters of the lakes were significantly expanded over the TP, and the summed area of all the lakes increased by 6061 km(2) from 1975 to 2010. Panel regression showed that annual average air temperature (T), annual precipitation (P), and reference crop evapotranspiration (ET (o) ) regulate the change in lake surface area (LSA) on the entire TP. The change in LSA is more related to the change in P than in the other two factors, even in the catchment where lakes are recharged by water from glacier melting and permafrost degradation, especially in extremely arid and arid climate zones. Elevation and size affected the sensitivity of lakes to climate change with lakes in a high-elevation area more sensitive to T and small lakes more sensitive to T, P, and ET (o) . Warming-induced glacier's retreat led to the significant lake expansion, while permafrost degradation might be responsible for the lake shrinkage in the seasonally frozen ground area due to the related cryogenic waterproof layer downward. Our results about the responses of lakes to climate change in different catchments were in accordance with the findings of previous studies about several typical lakes, which implied that overall response of all the lakes to climate change could be obtained by examining several typical lakes in the catchment level.

The Lake is characterized by floating meadows of various thickness which support severely depleted endangered Eld's deer (Rucervus eldii) and sympatric hog deer (Axis porcinus). The southern part of the Lake is protected as Keibul Lamjao National Park as the last remaining habitat of the Eld's deer in India. The Loktak Lake has been included in the Montreux record as it is changing its ecological character due to anthropogenic pressures especially due to water pollution. We examined the seasonal pattern of water quality of Loktak Lake and compared it with the Keibul Lamjao National Park with a view to suggest measures for removal of this wetland from the Montreux record and for improved conservation. The evaluation of spatio-temporal variations in the water quality parameters over two years was carried out using multivariate statistical analysis. Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped the 11 sampling sites into four groups, less polluted, medium polluted, highly polluted and most polluted and the 12 months into three time periods. Principal Component Analysis identified three factors in the data structure which explained 92.9% of the total variance of the data set which was used to group the selected parameters according to common features and to evaluate the influence of each group on the overall variation in water quality. Significant difference in terms of water quality parameters were observed across different parts of the lake and seasons (ANOVA, p < 0.05). Our study revealed that the Loktak Lake is hypereutrophic leading to decreased water quality that has adverse impacts on ecosystem level processes. Restoration of the Lake requires an integrated approach in reduction of nutrient inputs, enhanced flushing mechanism and restoration of environmental flow which has been disrupted due to damming.

Modeling supraglacial water routing and lake filling on the Greenland Ice Sheet	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												During more intense melt years, supraglacial lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet are found to fill more rapidly and to drain earlier in the melt season. They also develop at higher latitudes and elevations. Since the rapid drainage of lakes has been shown to enhance basal sliding and since the lake volume can play an important role in determining if and when it drains, understanding and modeling the processes which control lake filling rates forms a key development in successfully modeling the possible impacts of lake drainage events on ice motion. We have developed a surface water routing and lake filling model and applied it to a 100 km(2) area of the Paakitsoq region, west Greenland. The model takes the time series of calculated runoff ( melt minus refreezing) over the area and calculates flow paths and water velocities over the snow-/ice-covered surface, routing the water into topographic depressions which can fill to form lakes. Runoff is calculated from a distributed, surface energy-balance model coupled to a subsurface model, which calculates changes in temperature, density and water content in the snow, firn and upper ice layers, and hence refreezing and therefore net runoff. The model is calibrated against field measurements of a filling lake in our study area during June 2011 and can be used to calculate the filling rate of the instrumented lake with a high degree of accuracy. The filling rate of the instrumented/modeled lake depends on melt and routing from the immediate lake catchment and from overflowing lakes in upstream catchments.

Here, we evaluate the environmental behavior of three cVMS compounds (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5) and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D6)) in a high latitude lake (Storvannet, 70 degrees N 23 degrees E), experiencing intermittent wastewater emissions and high latitude environmental conditions (low temperatures and seasonal ice cover). Measured cVMS concentrations in lake water were below detection limits in both March and June 2014. However, mean concentrations in sediments were 207 +/- 30, 3775 +/- 973 and 848 +/- 211 ng g(-1) organic carbon for D4, D5 and D6, respectively. To rationalize measurements, a fugacity-based model for lakes (QWASI) was parametrized for Storvannet. The key removal process for cVMS from the lake was predicted to be advection due to the low hydraulic retention time of the lake, followed by volatilization. Predicted cVMS behavior was highly sensitive to the partition coefficient between organic carbon and water (K-OC) and its:temperature dependence. Predictions indicated lower overall persistence with decreasing temperature due to enhanced partitioning from sediments to water. Inverse modeling to predict steady-state emissions from cVMS concentrations in sediment provided unrealistically high emissions, when evaluated against measured concentrations in sewage. However, high concentrations of cVMS in sediment and low concentrations in water could be explained via a hypothetical dynamic emission scenario consistent with combined sewer overflows. The study illustrates the importance of considering compound-specific behavior of emerging contaminants that may differ from legacy organic contaminants.					; Evenset, Anita/F-1547-2013; Breivik, Knut/D-2311-2011	Warner, Nicholas/0000-0003-0327-2514; Breivik, Knut/0000-0003-1112-1900; Krogseth, Ingjerd Sunde/0000-0002-6063-6655													0013-936X	1520-5851				JAN 3	2017	51	1					401	409		10.1021/acs.est.6b04828	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.6b04828								27997187					WOS:000391346900044

Impacts of ocean-atmosphere teleconnection patterns on the south-central United States	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Recent research has linked the climate variability associated with ocean-atmosphere teleconnections to impacts rippling throughout environmental, economic, and social systems. This research reviews recent literature through 2021 in which we identify linkages among the major modes of climate variability, in the form of ocean-atmosphere teleconnections, and the impacts to temperature and precipitation of the South-Central United States (SCUSA), consisting of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. The SCUSA is an important areal focus for this analysis because it straddles the ecotone between humid and arid climates in the United States and has a growing population, diverse ecosystems, robust agricultural and other economic sectors including the potential for substantial wind and solar energy generation. Whereas a need exists to understand atmospheric variability due to the cascading impacts through ecological and social systems, our understanding is complicated by the positioning of the SCUSA between subtropical and extratropical circulation features and the influence of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and the adjacent Gulf of Mexico. The Southern Oscillation (SO), Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the related Arctic Oscillation (AO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation/Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMO/AMV), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation/Pacific Decadal Variability (PDO/PDV) have been shown to be important modulators of temperature and precipitation variables at the monthly, seasonal, and interannual scales, and the intraseasonal Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) in the SCUSA. By reviewing these teleconnection impacts in the region alongside updated seasonal correlation maps, this research provides more accessible and comparable results for interdisciplinary use on climate impacts beyond the atmospheric-environmental sciences.					; DeLong, Kristine/B-7500-2008; Martin, Elinor/H-5781-2012	Rohli, Robert/0000-0003-2198-5606; DeLong, Kristine/0000-0001-6320-421X; Snedden, Gregg/0000-0001-7821-3709														2296-6463				AUG 23	2022	10								934654	10.3389/feart.2022.934654	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.934654													WOS:000874014800001

However, the reconstruction of a groundwater recharged lake in a desert hinterland is challenging. In this study, 23 samples of lake bottom sediments were obtained from eight groundwater recharged lakes in the hinterland of the Badian Jaran Desert in northwest China to establish models between the grain size component and lake level. Our results showed that the four grain size components of the sediments could be separated using the Weibull function. The first two fine grain components (W1 and W2) were deposited in the atmospheric dust. The two coarser components (W3 and W4) could be interpreted as sediments transported by wind from the surrounding sand dunes, while W3 was subsequently redistributed by lake waves. Changes in the lake water depth could be expressed by the W1 and W2 component contents, as well as the modal size of W3. Using the above models, unmixing grain size components of the lake sediment obtained from the ZZH section located in a seasonal lake (Zhunzhahan Jaran Lake) in the desert hinterland were used to quantitatively reconstruct the lake-level fluctuations during the Holocene. The lake level frequently fluctuated between 3.82 and 9.21 m during 10.6-8.6 cal kyr BP, slightly fluctuated between 3.41 and 5.26 m during 8.6-4.7 cal kyr BP, and markedly declined from 6.09 m to 4.46 m during 4.7-3.5 cal kyr BP. Lake-level changes in the hinterland of the Badian Jaran Desert did not correspond to the effective moisture changes during the early Holocene. Instead, the rise in lake level during the early Holocene would have resulted from the input of groundwater from the meltwater in the mountains of the recharge area. The data reveal new methods for quantitatively reconstructing consecutive paleolake-level fluctuations by groundwater recharged lakes in the desert hinterland.					li, fei/HJO-9520-2023; Li, Zhuolun/GYE-1649-2022	Li, Zhuolun/0000-0003-4164-8551; Lu, Chenao/0000-0002-3112-9494													0341-8162	1872-6887				MAY	2022	212								106051	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106051		JAN 2022											WOS:000788512600001
J	Taylor, G; Eggleton, RA				Taylor, G.; Eggleton, R. A.			Silcrete: an Australian perspective	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												We know how most rocks are formed. Silcrete is something of an enigma, for although there are many interpretations of the origins of individual silcrete bodies, such as those in the Paris Basin, England, Botswana and central Australia, an overarching hypothesis capable of explaining all occurrences is still to be found. This paper reviews the literature of research on predominantly Australian silcretes as well as reviewing their occurrence, mineralogy, geochemistry and petrology. Silcrete ages and paleoclimatic significance are also reviewed. Most silcretes are formed low in landscapes along fluvial tracts or lakes but, some may form at breakaway margins as a result of lateral groundwater movement. Following silicification and landscape inversion, many silcretes are left high in the landscape. Most silcretes must form in climates where there is an abundance of water, perhaps seasonally, and of organic acids. The age of a silcrete can be constrained by the fossils it may contain; ages of Australian silcretes so established range through most of the Cenozoic. Lacking fossil evidence, sediments of known stratigraphic age that have been silcreted can only provide a maximum age for the silcrete. Many silcretes in eastern Australia are overlain by basalt, but the age of the basalt can only give the minimum age of the silcreted host below it, not of the silcrete. Silcretes commonly exhibit a number of fabrics; externally glerp structures (also called cockade, ropy or botryoidal), and internally pedogenic and geopetal titaniferous grain-cap fabrics. We conclude that silcretes are formed by the precipitation of silica in various forms, almost always along with titania as anatase, at the time of cementation. Anatase occurs either where it is precipitated or by illuviation, commonly becoming concentrated as geopetal caps or coatings on larger detrital framework grains. This implies that the fluids moving the cementing components largely move downward through the silcreted host. Alternating Ti-rich and Ti-poor laminae in the caps show this process can be repetitious.																			0812-0099	1440-0952					2017	64	8					987	1016		10.1080/08120099.2017.1318167	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08120099.2017.1318167													WOS:000419945100002

However, there is currently little evidence of the impact of added N on soil N losses through NH3 volatilization using N-15 methodologies. In the present study, a three-year rice/wheat rotated experiment with 30% N-15-labeled urea applied in the first rice season and unlabeled urea added in the following five crop seasons was performed to investigate volatilization of NH3 from fertilizer and soil N. We found 9.28% of NH3 loss from N-15 urea and 2.88-7.70% declines in N-15-NH3 abundance occurred during the first rice season, whereas 0.11% of NH3 loss from N-15 urea and 0.02-0.21% enrichments in N-15-NH3 abundance happened in the subsequent seasons. The contributions of fertilizer- and soil-derived N to NH3 volatilization from a rice/wheat rotation were 75.8-88.4 and 11.6-24.2%, respectively. These distinct variations in N-15-NH3 and substantial soil-derived NH3 suggest that added N clearly interacts with the soil source contributing to NH3 volatilization.

J.; Varpe, Oystein			Visual predation risk and spatial distributions of large Arctic copepods along gradients of sea ice and bottom depth	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Changes in the community size structure of Arctic copepods toward smaller and less fat individuals or species have been linked to environmental changes. The underpinning mechanisms are, however, poorly understood. We use a two-step hurdle regression model to analyze spatially resolved, long-term survey data of the Barents Sea mesozooplankton community along gradients of water mass properties, sea ice, and bottom depth. We test the hypothesis that reduced visual predation, and hence increased survival in dim habitats, explains the distribution of large copepods. We expect the presence and biomass of large copepods to increase with increasing bottom depth and the occurrence of seasonal ice-cover. The patterns and drivers that emerge from our analysis support our hypothesis: in the Barents Sea large copepods were predominantly found in deep troughs that intersect the shelf south of the polar front, or at shallower depths in seasonally ice-covered waters northeast of Svalbard. On the banks, large copepods are largely absent whereas smaller copepods appear to survive. Top-down control provides one plausible explanation for these distributions. Large copepods survive where sea-ice shades the water or deep habitats permit escape from visual predators through vertical migrations. However, when upwelled onto shallow banks or flushed out from below the ice they are decimated by visual foragers. Therefore, advection and topographic blockage of vertical zooplankton distributions are key mechanisms for the efficient energy transfer and productivity in subarctic and Arctic shelf seas. New prolific foraging grounds may open up for planktivores where the ice-edge recedes under a changing climate.					; Varpe, Oystein/B-9693-2008; Langbehn, Tom/S-8987-2019; Aarflot, Johanna/OIU-5607-2025; Varpe, Øystein/B-9693-2008; Langbehn, Tom Jasper/S-8987-2019	Myrseth Aarflot, Johanna/0000-0003-2481-0190; Varpe, Oystein/0000-0002-5895-6983; Freer, Jennifer/0000-0002-3947-9261; Langbehn, Tom Jasper/0000-0003-1208-4793													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUN	2023	68	6					1388	1405		10.1002/lno.12354	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12354		APR 2023											WOS:000972696600001

Understanding of spatial and temporal variation of OM sources is critical to urban river management. Compared to previous studies, this study mainly focused on the spatial-temporal variations of OM sources in North Canal, an urban river in Beijing. Carbon stable isotopic (delta C-13), nitrogen stable isotopic (delta N-15), and isotopic multivariate mixture models were used to assess OM sources and their relative contribution. The result showed that autochthonous OM (macrophytes 68%, phytoplankton 16%) was dominant for suspended particulates, while allochthonous OM (C4 plants: 61%-76%; terrestrial soil: 36%-16%) was predominant in benthic fine particulates sediment. The composition of OM sources in suspended particulates and sediment showed a similar spatial pattern. Aquatic macrophytes were the main OM sources in upstream reaches, while terrestrial soil and sewage were the primary OM sources in midstream and downstream. Moreover, aquatic macrophytes and phytoplankton OM were the primary OM sources of main stream, whereas terrestrial soil and sewage were the main OM sources of tributaries. In addition, OM sources composition showed seasonal variations, and the terrestrial erosion caused by rainfall was the crucial factor for various OM sources in different seasons. In wet season, terrestrial soil erosion (24%-56%) and C4 plants (2%-28%) were primary sources of sedimentary OM, while macrophytes (32%-58%) and sewage (10%-42%) were the dominant OM sources in dry season. This study illuminated the effect of the human activities and rainfall on the sources of organic matter in North Canal. The control of sewage effluents and terrestrial soil erosion may be the best way to manage OM in North Canal.					; wang, xiaoyan/ABE-3431-2021	Liu, Yang/0000-0001-8959-1529; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				JUL	2019	102						783	790		10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.03.023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.03.023													WOS:000470964500078

In this study, we examined the diversity and abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), denitrifying bacteria (DNB), and anammox bacteria (AAOB) in different trophic status regions of Lake Taihu using the amoA, Arch-amoA, nirS, and hzo genes as functional markers. Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) results indicated that the abundance of the nirS gene was the highest, while the amoA gene had the lowest abundance in all regions. Except for the primary inflow area of Lake Taihu, Arch-amoA gene abundance was higher than the hzo gene in three lake bays, and the abundance of the nirS gene increased with decreasing trophic status. The opposite pattern was observed for the amoA, Arch-amoA, and hzo genes. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the predominant AOB and AOA were Nitrosomonas and Nitrosopumilus maritimus, respectively, and the proportion of Nitrosomonas in the eutrophic region (87.9%) was higher than that in the mesotrophic region (71.1%). Brocadia and Anammoxoglobus were the two predominant AAOB in Lake Taihu. Five novel unknown phylotypes of AAOB were observed, and Cluster AAOB-B was only observed in the inflow area with a proportion of 32%. In the DNB community, Flavobacterium occurred at a higher proportion (22.6-38.2%) in all regions, the proportion of Arthrobacter in the mesotrophic region (3.6%) was significantly lower than that in the eutrophic region (15.6%), and the proportions of Cluster DNB-E in the inflow area (24.5%) was significantly higher than that in the lake bay (7.3%). The canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated that the substrate concentration in sedimentary environments, such as NOx--N in the sediment, NH4+-N in the pore water, and the total organic matter, were the key factors that determined the nitrogen-transforming microbial community. However, the temperature was also a predominant factor affecting the AOA and AAOB communities.																			1661-7827	1660-4601				JUL 1	2019	16	13							2298	10.3390/ijerph16132298	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16132298								31261730					WOS:000477037900047
J	Yu, B; Lin, H				Yu, Bin; Lin, Hai			Modification of the wintertime Pacific-North American pattern related North American climate anomalies by the Asian-Bering-North American teleconnection	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												The Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern is closely related to North American climate. In this study, we demonstrate that the PNA associated anomalies of North American surface temperatures and temperature extremes are modified by the extratropical Asian-Bering-North American (ABNA) teleconnection. The temperature and temperature extreme anomalies in association with the combination of the PNA and ABNA patterns are most prominent over the Canadian Prairies, and can be approximated by a linear superposition of the circulation and temperature responses to the two patterns. The various temperature responses result from the corresponding atmospheric circulation anomalies, which are associated with sea surface temperature and precipitation anomalies in the tropical eastern-central Pacific and snow cover anomalies in the Siberian region. In particular, pronounced circulation anomalies are apparent over the Great Lakes/Hudson Bay, and around the Aleutian Islands with opposite sign for the in-phase PNA and ABNA combination. This induces anomalous temperature advection and precipitation, as well as the heating associated variations of vertical motion and clouds, leading to prominent surface temperature anomalies over the Canadian Prairies directly through the variation of the surface energy budget. For the out-of-phase PNA and ABNA combination, the anomalous circulation center tends to be situated along the west coast of North America. This induces weak circulation anomalies over north-central North America and brings weak thermal advection and precipitation anomalies there, leading to insignificant temperature anomalies over the Canadian Prairies. Both the ABNA and PNA can be skillfully predicted on the seasonal time scale, as well as their pattern related North American temperature anomalies. Hence it is important to consider both tropical and extratropical sources of predictability in improving North American climate prediction skill on seasonal to interannual time scales.

Bones of freshwater fish from several Early Mesolithic lake-side sites have delta C-13 values surprisingly similar to those seen in marine fish. We propose a model, based on delta C-13 and delta N-15, for the correction for both marine and hard water reservoir effect in radiocarbon dates. A strong reliance on aquatic protein is demonstrated for the Mesolithic inhabitants of the region from the middle of the Early Mesolithic onwards. A significant part of the protein in the diets of the dogs and humans from the Middle and Late Mesolithic was of marine origin, even at inland sites.

Methylmercury-total mercury ratios in predator and primary consumer insects from Adirondack streams (New York, USA)	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant that affects biota in remote settings due to atmospheric deposition of inorganic Hg, and its conversion to methylmercury (MeHg), the bioaccumulating and toxic form. Characterizing biotic MeHg is important for evaluating aquatic ecosystem responses to changes in Hg inputs. Aquatic insects possess many qualities desired for MeHg biomonitoring, but are not widely used, largely because of limited information regarding percentages of total mercury (THg) composed of MeHg (i.e., MeHg%) in various taxa. Here, we examine taxonomic, spatial, and seasonal variation in MeHg% of stream-dwelling predator and primary-consumer insects from nine streams in the Adirondack region (NY, USA). Predator MeHg% was high (median 94%) and did not differ significantly among five taxa. MeHg% in selected dragonflies (the most abundant predators, Odonata: Aeshnidae and Libellulidae) exhibited little seasonal and spatial variation, and THg concentration was strongly correlated with aqueous (filtered) MeHg (FMeHg; r(s) = 0.76). In contrast, MeHg% in primary consumers-shredders (northern caddisflies [Trichoptera: Limnephilidae]) and scrapers (flathead mayflies [Ephemeroptera: Heptageniidae]), were lower (medians 52% and 35%, respectively), and differed significantly between taxa, among sites, and seasonally. Correlations of THg with FMeHg were weak (shredders, r(s) = 0.45, p = 0.09) or not significant (scrapers, p = 0.89). The higher MeHg% of predators corresponded with their higher trophic positions (indicated by nitrogen stable isotopes). Results suggest obligate predators hold the most promise for the use of THg as a surrogate for MeHg biomonitoring with aquatic insects within the Adirondack region.					; Bradley, Paul/AAC-2451-2020	Brigham, Mark/0000-0001-7412-6800; Murray, Karen/0000-0001-6683-2238; Bradley, Paul/0000-0001-7522-8606; 													0963-9292	1573-3017				DEC	2020	29	10			SI		1644	1658		10.1007/s10646-020-02191-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-020-02191-7		MAR 2020						32180092					WOS:000520618900001

The expansion and increasing global distribution of such environments also means that information about them serves to understand future phenomena. In this study, a long-term chemical dataset (1996-2015) was explored together with seasonal (in 2015) information on the diversity and abundance of bacterial and archaeal communities residing in the chemocline, monimolimnion and surface sediment of the marine meromictic Rogoznica Lake. The results of quantitative PCR assays, and high-throughput sequencing, targeting 16S rRNA genes and transcripts, revealed a clear vertical structure of the microbial community with Gammaproteobacteria (Halochromatium) and cyanobacteria (Synechococcus spp.) dominating the chemocline, Deltaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes dominating the monimolimnion, and significantly more abundant archaeal populations in the surface sediment, most of which affiliated to Nanoarchaeota. Seasonal changes in the community structure and abundance were not pronounced. Diversity in Rogoznica Lake was found to be high, presumably as a consequence of stable environmental conditions accompanied by high dissolved carbon and nutrient concentrations. Long-term data indicated that Rogoznica Lake exhibited climate changes that could alter its physico-chemical features and, consequently, induce structural and physiological changes within its microbial community.

J	Huang, L; Liu, JY; Shao, QQ; Liu, RG				Huang, Lin; Liu, Jiyuan; Shao, Quanqin; Liu, Ronggao			Changing inland lakes responding to climate warming in Northeastern Tibetan Plateau	CLIMATIC CHANGE												The main portion of Tibetan Plateau has experienced statistically significant warming over the past 50 years, especially in cold seasons. This paper aims to identify and characterize the dynamics of inland lakes that located in the hinterland of Tibetan Plateau responding to climate change. We compared satellite imageries in late 1970s and early 1990s with recent to inventory and track changes in lakes after three decades of rising temperatures in the region. It showed warm and dry trend in climate with significant accelerated increasing annual mean temperature over the last 30 years, however, decreasing periodically annual precipitation and no obvious trend in potential evapotranspiration during the same period. Our analysis indicated widespread declines in inland lake's abundance and area in the whole origin of the Yellow River and southeastern origin of the Yangtze River. In contrast, the western and northern origin of the Yangtze River revealed completely reverse change. The regional lake surface area decreased by 11,499 ha or 1.72% from the late 1970s to the early 1990s, and increased by 6,866 ha or 1.04% from the early 1990s to 2004. Shrinking inland lakes may become a common feature in the discontinuous permafrost regions as a consequence of warming climate and thawing permafrost. Furthermore, obvious expanding were found in continuous permafrost regions due to climate warming and glacier retreating. The results may provide information for the scientific recognition of the responding events to the climate change recorded by the inland lakes.

Lunar Cycle Influences Reproductive Performance of Crossbred Brahman Cows Under Tropical Conditions	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS												Evidence has accumulated over the years indicating that the moon influences some aspects of the reproductive activity in animals and humans. However, little is known about the influence of the lunar cycle on the reproductive performance of cows under tropical conditions, where the environment strongly affects reproduction. This retrospective study was conducted with the aim of assessing the influence of the lunar cycle on some reproductive traits of tropical crossbred cows managed in a pasture-based system. Data from 5869 reproductive records from two commercial farms localized in the Maracaibo Lake Basin of Zulia State, Venezuela, were analyzed. Variables studied were first service conception rate, calving frequency, first postpartum estrous frequency, and pregnancy frequency. In addition to the lunar cycle, the effects of farm, season, and predominant breed were also considered. Data were analyzed using logistic regression and general linear model from SAS. First service conception was affected by lunar phases and predominant breed, but not by farm or season. For frequencies of calving, first postpartum estrus, and pregnancy, there was no main effect of farm, season, and predominant breed, whereas the effect of lunar phases was highly significant. First service conception was significantly greater in waning than in crescent phase of the lunar cycle. Frequencies of calving, first estrus, and pregnancy were highly correlated and showed greater figures around full moon and new moon. In conclusion, lunar cycle influenced first service conception, attaining greater values in the waning phase of the moon cycle. Frequencies of calving, first postpartum estrus, and pregnancy in crossbred cows showed a clear bimodal rhythm, whose greatest values coincided with new moon and full moon.					; Perea, Fernando/AFM-8711-2022	Perea, Fernando P./0000-0001-8301-6339; 													0748-7304	1552-4531				APR	2021	36	2					160	168	0748730420983638	10.1177/0748730420983638	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0748730420983638		JAN 2021						33446001					WOS:000610306700001

Moreover, exposure to herbicides is a well-known stressor of periphytic communities in anthropized aquatic environments. We tested these two environmental factors on periphytic communities that had been sampled from the littoral zone of Lake Geneva and acclimatized in the lab for 3 weeks at 18, 21, 24 and 28 degrees C. After this acclimation period, differences in the composition of the diatom community and decreases in cell density were observed corresponding to the temperature gradient. These acclimated communities were then exposed to 23 and 140 nM of a mixture composed of equitoxic quantities of atrazine, terbutryn, diuron and isoproturon. The periphytic community was more sensitive to the herbicide mixture at 18 degrees C than at higher temperatures, suggesting that higher temperature reduced its toxicity. Small and pioneer diatom species known to be promoted by contamination also appeared to benefit from higher temperatures. Temperature therefore appears to condition the herbicide sensitivity of periphytic communities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

IMPORTANCE OF FLOODPLAIN CONNECTIVITY TO FISH POPULATIONS IN THE APALACHICOLA RIVER, FLORIDA	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Floodplain habitats provide critical spawning and rearing habitats for many large-river fishes. The paradigm that floodplains are essential habitats is often a key reason for restoring altered rivers to natural flow regimes. However, few studies have documented spatial and temporal utilization of floodplain habitats by adult fish of sport or commercial management interest or assessed obligatory access to floodplain habitats for species' persistence. In this study, we applied telemetry techniques to examine adult fish movements between floodplain and mainstem habitats, paired with intensive light trap sampling of larval fish in these same habitats, to assess the relationships between riverine flows and fish movement and spawning patterns in restored and unmodified floodplain distributaries of the Apalachicola River, Florida. Our intent is to inform resource managers on the relationships between the timing, magnitude and duration of flow events and fish spawning as part of river management actions. Our results demonstrate spawning by all study species in floodplain and mainstem river habitat types, apparent migratory movements of some species between these habitats, and distinct spawning events for each study species on the basis of fish movement patterns and light trap catches. Additionally, Micropterus spp., Lepomis spp. and, to a lesser degree, Minytrema melanops used floodplain channel habitat that was experimentally reconnected to the mainstem within a few weeks of completing the restoration. This result is of interest to managers assessing restoration activities to reconnect these habitats as part of riverine restoration programmes globally. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Convective Boundary Layer Depth Estimation from S-Band Dual-Polarization Radar	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												This study investigates Bragg scatter signatures in dual-polarization radar observations, which are defined by low differential reflectivity (ZDR) values, as a proxy for convective boundary layer (CBL) depth. Using data from the WSR-88D in Twin Lakes, Oklahoma (KTLX), local minima in quasi-vertical profiles of ZDR are found to provide a reasonable estimate of CBL depth when compared with depth estimates from upper-air soundings from Norman, Oklahoma (KOUN), during 2014. The 243 ZDR Bragg scatter and upper-air sounding CBL depth estimates have a correlation of 0.90 and an RMSE of 254 m. Using Bragg scatter as a proxy for CBL depth was expanded to other seasons and locations-performing well in Wilmington, Ohio; Fairbanks, Alaska; Tucson, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Albany, New York; Portland, Oregon; and Tampa, Florida-showing its potential usefulness in monitoring CBL depth throughout the year in a variety of geographic locations and meteorological conditions.																			0739-0572	1520-0426				AUG	2018	35	8					1723	1733		10.1175/JTECH-D-17-0210.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JTECH-D-17-0210.1													WOS:000442563400002

Biogeochemical changes at the sediment-water interface during redox transitions in an acidic reservoir: exchange of protons, acidity and electron donors and acceptors	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Redox transitions induced by seasonal changes in water column O-2 concentration can have important effects on solutes exchange across the sediment-water interface in systems polluted with acid mine drainage (AMD), thus influencing natural attenuation and bioremediation processes. The effect of such transitions was studied in a mesocosm experiment with water and sediment cores from an acidic reservoir (El Sancho, SW Spain). Rates of aerobic organic matter mineralization and oxidation of reduced inorganic compounds increased under oxic conditions (OX). Anaerobic process, like Fe(III) and sulfate reduction, also increased due to higher O-2 availability and penetration depth in the sediment, resulting in higher regeneration rates of their corresponding anaerobic e(-) acceptors. The contribution of the different processes to oxygen uptake changed considerably over time. pH decreased due to the precipitation of schwertmannite and the release of H+ from the sediment, favouring the dissolution of Al-hydroxides and hydroxysulfates at the sediment surface. The increase in dissolved Al was the main contributor to water column acidity during OX. Changes in organic matter degradation rates and coprecipitation and dissolution of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen with redox-sensitive Fe(III) compounds affected considerably C and N cycling at the sediment-water interface during redox transitions. The release of NO2- and NO3- during the hypoxic period could be attributed to ammonium oxidation coupled to ferric iron reduction (Feammox). Considering the multiple effects of redox transitions at the sediment-water interface is critical for the successful outcome of natural attenuation and bioremediation of AMD impacted aquatic environments.					; Corzo Rodriguez, Alfonso/L-9669-2015; Garcia-Robledo, Emilio/B-3781-2017; Papaspyrou, Sokratis/H-5022-2011; Corzo, Alfonso/L-9669-2015; Lara, Miguel/K-7421-2017	Lara Rallo, Francisco Miguel/0000-0003-4932-1289; Corzo Rodriguez, Alfonso/0000-0003-3718-941X; Jimenez Arias, Juan Luis/0000-0003-0693-371X; Garcia-Robledo, Emilio/0000-0002-4337-6433; Papaspyrou, Sokratis/0000-0003-4406-0702; 													0168-2563	1573-515X				AUG	2018	139	3					241	260		10.1007/s10533-018-0465-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-018-0465-7													WOS:000440421100002

However, knowledge on the linkages between floodgates operation and nitrogen transformation during the flood season is limited. In this study, water samples from six sampling sites along Lake Xingkai watershed were collected before and after floodgates operation. The causal relationships between environmental factors, bacterioplankton community composition and nitrogen fractions were determined during flood season. We found that concentrations of nitrogen fractions decreased significantly when the floodgates were opened, while the concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) and NO3- increased when the floodgates had been shut for a period. Further, we proposed a possible mechanism that the influence of floodgates operation on nitrogen transformation was largely mediated through changes in dissolved organic matter, dissolved oxygen and bacterioplankton community composition as revealed by structural equation modeling (SEM). We conclude that floodgates operation has a high risk for future eutrophication of downstream watershed, although it can reduce nitrogen content temporarily. Therefore, the environmental impacts of floodgates operation should be carefully evaluated before the floodwaters were discharged into downstream watershed. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The nutritional status of the lake was evaluated by trophic level index, and the spatial heterogeneity and aggregation status of the eutrophication level were studied by spatial autocorrelation analysis. Moreover, the pollution-discharge-coefficient method was carried out to clarify the potential pollutant sources. Results showed that the lake was in the light eutropher state with the water quality of V and poor V. Nitrogen pollutants were the primary driving factor of water quality, and water depth was the main environmental factor affecting the spatial distribution of nitrogen pollutants. The eutrophication level of the entire lake showed significant positive spatial autocorrelation. Due to the influence of regional eutrophication levels, the spatial heterogeneity of eutrophication level was low. Two hotspots (High -High concentration) of eutrophication were present in the southeast (P < 0.01) and the north (P < 0.05) of the lake. However, causes for the formation of these two hotspots were different, which mainly resulted from the non-point source discharge of surrounding towns along the southeastern lake and the weak hydrodynamic conditions in the northern lake, respectively. Therefore, it is necessary to pay more attention to control the non -point source discharge into Dongping Lake, especially for regions around the southeast of the lake, in the future management.

J	Peng, J; Bai, X; Chen, X				Peng, Jia; Bai, Xue; Chen, Xu			Climate-driven soil erosion processes in alpine environments over the last century: Evidence from the Taibai Mountain (central China)	CATENA												Over the last century, climate warming has increased vegetation coverage in alpine regions, having major implications for associated terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Due to the remoteness of mountainous regions, there is a paucity of monitoring data regarding the response of catchment processes to climate change. Particle size distribution, magnetic properties, and elemental contents were investigated in Pb-210-dated sediment cores (34 cm in length) collected from two hydrologically-connected cirque lakes in the Taibai Mountain (the highest mountain in east mainland China). Both lakes have experienced directional environment changes since the 1980s, suggested by concurrent increases in magnetic susceptibility and organic matter. Prolonged growth season under a scenario of warmer climate has promoted vegetation development and soil conservation, subsequently increasing the contribution of terrestrial detritus derived from top soils that are rich in magnetic minerals and organic matter. Contents of clay and silt remained high throughout the two sediment cores, suggesting that depositional environment was relatively stable in both lakes. However, few peaks in coarse particles probably resulted from the cold and wet climate between the 1940s and the 1970s. During the relatively cold and wet episodes, prolonged snow-packs and enhanced melt-water discharge would strengthen bedrock weathering and erosion intensity, subsequently increasing the influxes of coarse particles. This is the first study to reveal decadal-scale changes in catchment processes of the Taibai Mountain, and the results highlight positive effects of climate warming on environmental protection of our study site and other similar alpine mountains through promoting water and soil conservation.

Challenges and Opportunities on Urban Water Quality in Mexico City	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Mexico City has a population of 9 million inhabitants and was settled on a lakebed with high seismic potential. It is currently embedded in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area, which encompasses 22 million inhabitants and which was self-sufficient in water in the past, but currently extracts 70% from the regional aquifers and imports about 30% of the water required by this megacity. Groundwater represents its main water source but its water quality is increasingly threatened. The purpose of this study was to determine the water quality in areas related to seismic fractures, which may increase the vulnerability of water provision, and to identify specific zones that could be affected. Official water quality data from the period 2002 to 2017 was analyzed and compared to recent data taken in wells in the city after the September 2017 earthquake. Physicochemical parameters were determined and compared to the existing data. Statistical and temporal analyses were performed in order to understand the evolution and spatial distribution of water quality. The results show that free chlorine was below the limits according to the Mexican regulatory framework, while the presence of fecal coliforms, aluminum, ammonia, iron, and manganese exceeded the standards. The presence of arsenic, boron, and chrome was detected in some areas. Clusters show specific parameters that increase with time: turbidity, sulfates, nitrates, arsenic, manganese, lead, and iron. These tendencies could imply the deterioration of groundwater quality and a potential effect on the health of the exposed population. Spatially, vulnerability was observed in lztapalapa, Tlahuac, Xochimilco, and Coyoacan. Wells coincide spatially with some of the geological damaged areas from the earthquakes in lztapalapa and Xochimilco. In addition to water quantity, water quality represents a challenge for the urban future, since water disinfection systems are limited to treating the diversity of compounds detected. The water quality-monitoring program must be changed to improve its capacities within a framework of sustainable water management in different regions of the city, and based on the season, considering the potential exposure to the city's population. This represents an opportunity to propose a strategic plan for the groundwater system in order to improve conditions toward a more equitable and sustainable pathway for Mexico City.																				2296-665X				OCT 29	2019	7								169	10.3389/fenvs.2019.00169	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2019.00169													WOS:000496943800001

All systems were consistently supersaturated in CO2 (range 450 to 5000 mu atm) streams having both higher (mean 1850 mu atm) and more variable pCO(2) than that of rivers (range 550 to 800 matm). Stream pCO(2) was positively related to DOC concentration and stream segment length, both suggesting a direct influence of the surrounding landscape. Calculated stream water-air CO2 fluxes ranged from 700 to over 3000 mg C m(-2) d(-1), up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those measured in large rivers and lakes of the same region. Small streams, despite their extremely reduced areal coverage (1% of the aquatic surface), accounted for 25% of the total aquatic C emissions, and the resulting areal stream fluxes were comparable to those measured in different soils or wetlands in the region.					del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019; Teodoru, Cristian R./AAS-2743-2021; Prairie, Yves/B-9108-2008; Teodoru, Cristian/AAS-2743-2021	del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; Teodoru, Cristian R./0000-0001-6740-8578; Prairie, Yves/0000-0003-1210-992X; 													0886-6236	1944-9224				MAY 9	2009	23								GB2012	10.1029/2008GB003404	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008GB003404													WOS:000265929500002

Agricultural Freshwater Pond Supports Diverse and Dynamic Bacterial and Viral Populations	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Agricultural ponds have a great potential as a means of capture and storage of water for irrigation. However, pond topography (small size, shallow depth) leaves them susceptible to environmental, agricultural, and anthropogenic exposures that may influence microbial dynamics. Therefore, the aim of this project was to characterize the bacterial and viral communities of pond water in the Mid-Atlantic United States with a focus on the late season (October-December), where decreasing temperature and nutrient levels can affect the composition of microbial communities. Ten liters of freshwater from an agricultural pond were sampled monthly, and filtered sequentially through 1 and 0.2 mu m filter membranes. Total DNA was then extracted from each filter, and the bacterial communities were characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The remaining filtrate was chemically concentrated for viruses, DNA-extracted, and shotgun sequenced. Bacterial community profiling showed significant fluctuations over the sampling period, corresponding to changes in the condition of the pond freshwater (e.g., pH, nutrient load). In addition, there were significant differences in the alpha-diversity and core bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between water fractions filtered through different pore sizes. The viral fraction was dominated by tailed bacteriophage of the order Caudovirales, largely those of the Siphoviridae family. Moreover, while present, genes involved in virulence/antimicrobial resistance were not enriched within the viral fraction during the study period. Instead, the viral functional profile was dominated by phage associated proteins, as well as those related to nucleotide production. Overall, these data suggest that agricultural pond water harbors a diverse core of bacterial and bacteriophage species whose abundance and composition are influenced by environmental variables characteristic of pond topology and the late season.

Towards a morphogenetic classification of eskers: Implications for modelling ice sheet hydrology	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Validations of paleo-ice sheet hydrological models have used esker spacing as a proxy for ice tunnel density. Changes in crest type (cross-sectional shape) along esker ridges have typically been attributed to the effect of changing subglacial topography on hydro- and ice-dynamics and hence subglacial ice-tunnel shape. These claims assume that all eskers formed in subglacial ice tunnels and that all major subglacial ice tunnels produced a remnant esker. We identify differences in geomorphic context, sinuosity, crosssectional shape, and sedimentary architecture by analysing eskers formed at or near the margins of the last Cordilleran Ice Sheet on British Columbia's southern Fraser Plateau, and propose a morphogenetic esker classification. Three morphogenetic types and 2 subtypes of eskers are classified based on differences in geomorphic context, ridge length, sinuosity, cross-sectional shape and sedimentary architecture using geophysical techniques and sedimentary exposures; they largely record seasonal meltwater flows and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) through sub-, en- and supraglacial meltwater channels and ice-walled canyons. General principles extracted from these interpretations are: 1) esker ridge crest type and sinuosity strongly reflect meltwater channel type. Eskers formed in subglacial conduits are likely to be round crested with low sinuosity (except where controlled by ice structure or modified by surging) and contain faults associated with flank collapse. Eskers formed near or at the ice surface are more likely to be sharp-crested, highly sinuous, and contain numerous faults both under ridge crest-lines and in areas of flank collapse. 2) Esker ridges containing numerous flat-crested reaches formed directly on the land surface in ice-walled canyons (unroofed ice tunnels) or in ice tunnels at atmospheric pressure, and therefore likely record thin or dead ice. 3) Eskers containing macroforms exhibiting headward and downflow growth likely record flood-scale flows (possibly GLOFs where a lake can be inferred). These conclusions suggest that esker crest type, sinuosity and geomorphic context, when understood along with sedimentary architecture, largely reflect formational position with respect to the ice-surface. Reconstructions of ice sheet hydrology need to account for Variation in esker morphology because basing hydrodynamic inferences on the presence or absence of an esker alone ignores encoded differences in water source, supply, flow magnitude and frequency, and conduit position.

J	Mohanty, LK; Maiti, S				Mohanty, Litan Kumar; Maiti, Sabyasachi			Regional morphodynamics of supraglacial lakes in the Everest Himalaya	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Reduction of ice masses concerning globalwarming is significantly changing geomorphology in highmountains. Formation of supraglacial lakes is one of such essential indications. Therefore, in the present study, we attempted to understand regional morphodynamics of supraglacial lakes, distributed in 17 glaciers within the Everest Himalaya. An average of 0.08 km(2)/yr lake expansion rate was noticed during the studied year. Decadal (2010-2019) lake morphodynamic study using high resolution satellite images revealed that only 161 out of total 2424 lakes were static, and mostly concentrated at the lower part of the ablation area with an alarming rate of surface area increase. We also found appearance of newcluster of lakes at higher elevations. We collected here statistical evidences of regional morphodynamics and key controlling factors to stabilize lakes. The parameters, viz., spatio-temporal distribution of lakes, their domain wise variation, multi-temporal (Seasonal to longterm) changes, lake density, and stability index were estimated and mapped. Finally, we concluded that new lake formations at higher elevationwere triggered by gradual increase in temperature, decrease in glacier surface velocity, slope and ice thickness. The feature selection techniques indicated ice thickness as prior controlling factor followed by the surface velocity and slope to stabilize lakes at the lower part of ablation.

The aim of this study is to investigate the spatial-temporal patterns of abrupt changes and detect their potential drivers in Poyang Lake, using time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 16-day maximum value composite vegetation indices between 2000 and 2012. The breaks for additive seasonal and trend (BFAST) method was applied to the smoothed time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), to detect the timing and magnitude of abrupt changes in the trend component. Large part of Poyang Lake (98.9% for trend component) has experienced abrupt changes in the past 13 years, and the change patterns, including the distributions in timing and magnitudes of major abrupt trend changes between water bodies and land areas were clearly differentiated. Most water bodies had abrupt increasing NDVI changes between 2010 and 2011, caused by the sequential severe flooding and drought in the two years. In contrast, large parts of the surrounding land areas had abrupt decreasing NDVI changes. Large decreasing changes occurred around 2003 at the city of Nanchang, which were driven by urbanization. These results revealed spatial-temporal land cover changing patterns and potential drivers in the wetland ecosystem of Poyang Lake.

Nitrogen management to reduce yield-scaled global warming potential in rice	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												Fertilizer N is usually required to achieve optimal yields but when applied in excess there is increased risk of pollution, including higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Thus, optimal N management must consider both yields and environmental effects. Yield-scaled GWP (Global Warming Potential), which is the GWP (in CO2 equivalents) per Mg of grain yield, is a useful metric for evaluating management options where the goal is to achieve both high yields with minimal environmental burden. A 6-year field study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the lowest yield-scaled GHG emissions for rice occur when N is applied at optimal N rates for maximum yields, independent of the source of N applied. We tested this hypothesis for organic (manure) and inorganic (urea) N sources. The N rates and sources in each growing season were: 0, 90, 180 and 270 kg N ha(-1) applied as either urea alone or pig manure combined with urea (where N was added as manure and supplied 60% of the total N rate). The N rates to achieve maximum yields (90 to 180 kg N ha(-1) depending on year) were similar for both N sources. Seasonal CH4 and N2O emissions varied significantly between years but the magnitude of emissions was determined largely by N source. Across N rates, application of manure increased GWP by almost 60% relative to the urea treatments due to higher CH4 and N2O emissions. When urea was used as the sole N source, yield-scaled GWP (87 kg CO2 (eq). Mg-1 grain) was lowest at optimal N rates for maximum yields. In contrast, when manure was used, yield-scaled GWP was higher than for urea and increased with increasing manure-N rates (from 104 to 171 kg CO2 (eq). Mg-1 grain). The lowest yield-scaled GWP for manure was when no manure was applied - despite the low yields. Thus, when manure is used as an N source in flooded rice systems, over application should be avoided.

Lauraceae from rainforest surrounding an early Miocene maar lake, Otago, southern New Zealand	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												Examination of over 700 fossil leaves from an early Miocene finely laminated lacustrine diatomite at Foulden Maar, near Middlemarch, Otago, New Zealand, provides evidence that a diverse subtropical Lauraceae-dominated evergreen forest once surrounded this small maar lake. Twenty-three million years ago, four leaf taxa with apparent affinities to Beilschmiedia, five with apparent affinities to Cryptocarya and one with apparent affinities to Litsea comprised 44% of the leaves preserved in a lacustrine rainforest growing on basalt- or schist-derived substrates, contributing leaves, flowers and fruits to the fossil deposit. Angiosperm and conifer pollen and macrofossils from numerous families present in the diatomite indicate a diverse rainforest flora (more or less equivalent to a modem simple notophyll vine forest from eastern Australia) growing under an apparently seasonally dry, mesothermal palaeoclimate on relatively nutrient-rich soils.

Here we examine the evolution of glaciers along similar to 500 km of the Tanggula Shan, CentralEastern Tibetan Plateau. Using remotely sensed datasets, we quantified changes in glacier mass, area and surface velocity, and compared these results to time series of meteorological observations, in order to disentangle drivers of glacier mass loss since the 1960s. Glacier mass loss has increased ( from -0.21 +/- 0.12m w.e. a(-1) in 1960s-2000s, to -0.52 +/- 0.18m w.e. a(-1) in 2000s2015/18) in association with pervasive positive temperature anomalies (up to 1.85 degrees C), which are pronounced at the end of the now lengthened ablation season. However, glacier mass budget perturbations do not mirror the magnitude of temperature anomalies in sub-regions, thus additional factors have heightened glacier recession. We show how proglacial lake expansion and glacier surging have compounded glacier recession over decadal/multi-decadal time periods, and exert similar influence on glacier mass budgets as temperature changes. Our results demonstrate the importance of ice loss mechanisms not often incorporated into broad-scale glacier projections, which need to be better considered to refine future glacier runoff estimates.					; Bolch, Tobias/ABE-6635-2020; Bolch, Tobias/A-1935-2008; Bhattacharya, Atanu/AAU-9787-2021; Ghuffar, Sajid/JYQ-2935-2024	Ghuffar, Sajid/0000-0002-5618-8247; Bhattacharya, Atanu/0000-0001-7449-3897; Bolch, Tobias/0000-0002-8201-5059; 													0022-1430	1727-5652				OCT	2023	69	277					1149	1166	PII S0022143023000059	10.1017/jog.2023.5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2023.5		APR 2023											WOS:000969168800001

This gas pressure is the appropriate physical quantity for judging the possibility of bubble formation and hence it is central for understanding exchange of climate-relevant gases between (limnic) water and the atmosphere. The contribution of ebullition has widely been neglected in numerical simulations. We present measurements from six lacustrine waterbodies in Central Germany: including a natural lake, a drinking water reservoir, a mine pit lake, a sand excavation lake, a flooded quarry, and a small flooded lignite opencast, which has been heavily polluted. Seasonal changes of oxygen and temperature are complemented by numerical simulations of nitrogen and calculations of vapor pressure to quantify the contributions and their dynamics in lacustrine waters. In addition, accumulation of gases in monimolimnetic waters is demonstrated. We sum the partial pressures of the gases to yield a quantitative value for total gas pressure to reason which processes can force ebullition at which locations. In conclusion, only a small number of gases contribute decisively to gas pressure and hence can be crucial for bubble formation.

Tributary oscillations generated by diurnal discharge regulation in Three Gorges Reservoir	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Among the major consequences of dam construction and operation are the deterioration of water quality and the increasing frequency of occurrence of harmful algae blooms in reservoirs and their tributaries. Former studies at Three Gorges Reservoir demonstrated that the Yangtze River main stream is the main source of nutrients and pollutants to connected tributary bays. Eutrophication and other water quality problems reported for the tributaries along Three Gorges Reservoir are likely a consequence of density-driven exchange flows. Past work has focused mainly on the influence of seasonal and daily flow regulation on exchange flows, less attention has been paid to hydrodynamic processes resulting from sub-daily discharge dynamics. High-frequency measurements of flow velocity and water level in a eutrophic tributary (Xiangxi River) of Three Gorges Reservoir revealed the persistent nature of bidirectional density currents within the bay. Superimposed on this mean flow, we observed ubiquitous flow oscillations with a period of approximately 2 h. The flow variations were associated with periodic water level fluctuations with increasing amplitude for increasing distance from the river mouth (up to +/- 0.1 m at a distance of 27.4 km from the river mouth). They were caused by a standing wave in the tributary bay, which was generated by rapid increase or decrease in discharge following peak-shaving operation modes at Three Gorges Dam. The high-frequency wave made up the largest contribution to the temporal variance of flow velocity in the tributary bay and represents a so far overlooked hydrodynamic feature of tributaries bays in large reservoirs.

J	McGregor, G				McGregor, Glenn			Hydroclimatology, modes of climatic variability and stream flow, lake and groundwater level variability: A progress report	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT												Hydroclimatology is an expansive discipline largely concerned with understanding the workings of the hydrological cycle in a climate context. Acknowledging this, and given the burgeoning interest in the relation between climate and water in the context of working towards an improved understanding of the impacts of climatic variability on water resources, this progress report turns its attention to the connection between large-scale modes of climatic variability and hydrological variability in streams, lakes and groundwater. A survey of the recent literature finds that a plethora of teleconnection indices have been employed in the analysis of hydrological variability. Indices representing modes of climatic variability such as El Nino Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Pacific North America pattern, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Atlantic Meridional Oscillation dominate the literature on climatic and hydrological variability. While examples of discernible signals of modes of climatic variability in stream flow and lake and groundwater level time series abound, the associations between periodic to quasi-period oscillations in atmospheric/ocean circulation patterns and variability within the terrestrial branch of the hydrological are far from simple, being both monotonic (linear and non-linear) and non-monotonic and also conditional on period of analysis, season and geographic region. While there has been considerable progress over the last five years in revealing the climate mechanisms that underlie the links between climatic and hydrological variability, a bothering feature of the literature is how climatic and hydrological variability is often viewed through a purely statistical lens with little attention given to diagnosing the relationship in terms of atmosphere and ocean physics and dynamics. Consequently, significant progress remains to be made in obtaining a satisfactory hydroclimatological understanding of stream flow, lake and groundwater variability, especially if hydroclimatological knowledge is to be fully integrated into water resource management and planning.

Photo-oxidation processes, properties of DOC, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and their potential impacts on native biota and carbon cycling in the Rio Negro (Amazonia, Brazil)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Given the reported degraded nature of DOC in the Rio Negro, and low oxygen, pH, and bacterial riverine levels, we hypothesized: (1) DOC would have strong humic and fulvic acid fluorescence signals with high aromaticity and large mean molecular weight; and (2) photo-oxidation rates would be slow, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations low, producing no oxidative stress in biota. We surveyed the environment and properties of DOC and explored DOC photo-oxidation and fish sensitivity to DOC products. DOC properties were investigated using absorption and fluorescence indices and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of excitation-emission matrices. ROS concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically. A native fish, Hemigrammus levis, was exposed to photo-oxidizing DOC and its tissues (brain, gill, liver) assayed for changes in antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes. With respect to our hypotheses, (1) DOC was highly terrigenous, with high SAC(340) values (aromaticity), high capacity to produce ROS, and high tryptophan-like fluorescence (bacterial, autochthonous signal); (2) photo-oxidation rates were appreciable, while products were related to mean UV-radiation levels (total radiation was constant). ROS levels were often higher than freshwater averages, yet fish experienced no oxidative stress. Results suggest photo-oxidation influences patterns in C-cycling, bacterial production and community dynamics between wet and dry seasons.

The selected model included the zander (Sander lucioperca L.) and crustacean species known as amphipods (Gammarus sp.) which belong to the food chain of this ray-finned fish. A total of 172 samples (70 fish and 102 amphipods) were collected randomly and analyzed for heavy metals using atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The results showed that the accumulation of heavy metals in both taxa are in the order of As > Pb > Cd > Cu, and concentrations of heavy metals in fish muscle are higher than Gammarus sp. in all stations in different seasons. Specimens of station (1) displayed the highest heavy metal content due to local industrial activities. The recorded concentrations of As, Pb, and Cd exceed the permissible limits. There is a close correlation between the concentrations of heavy metals in the amphipods and zanders. Target hazard quotient (THQ), total target hazard quotient (TTHQ), and carcinogenic risk (CR) were calculated to assess risks to human health. The average of THQ for As (1.43) exceeded the international standards and presenting health risks to the consumers of this fish species. The TTHQ for heavy metals was estimated higher than 1. At all stations, the value of CRCd > 1 x 10(-3) indicating the degree of carcinogenicity of this metal in all parts of the Aras River.

J	Sarkar, A; Tiwari, PK; Pal, S				Sarkar, Abhijit; Tiwari, Pankaj Kumar; Pal, Samares			A delay nonautonomous model for the effects of fear and refuge on predator-prey interactions with water-level fluctuations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODELING SIMULATION AND SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING												The interaction of prey (small fish) and predator (large fish) in lakes/ponds at temperate and tropical regions varies when water level fluctuates naturally during seasonal time. We relate the perceptible effect of fear and anti-predator behavior of prey with the water-level fluctuations and describe how these are influenced by the seasonal changing of water level. So, we consider these as time-dependent functions to make the system more realistic. Also, we incorporate the time-dependent delay in the negative growth rate of prey in predator-prey model with Crowley-Martin-type functional response. We clearly provide the basic dynamics of the system such as positiveness, permanence and nonpersistence. The existence of positive periodic solution is studied using Continuation theorem, and suffiecient conditions for globally attractivity of positive periodic solution are also derived. To make the system more comprehensive, we establish numerical simulations, and compare the dynamics of autonomous and nonautonomous systems in the absence as well as the presence of time delay. Our results show that seasonality and time delay create the occurrence of complex behavior such as prevalence of chaotic disorder which can be potentially suppressed by the cost of fear and prey refuge. Also, if time delay increases, then system leads a boundary periodic solution. Our findings assert that the predation, fear of predator and prey refuge are correlated with water-level variations, and give some reasonable biological interpretations for persistence as well as extinction of species due to water-level variations.					; Pal, Samares/AAO-1297-2020; Sarkar, Abhijit/HTN-7966-2023	PAL, SAMARES/0000-0002-8792-0031; Sarkar, Abhijit/0000-0001-9285-801X; 													1793-9623	1793-9615				AUG	2022	13	04							2250033	10.1142/S1793962322500337	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S1793962322500337		JAN 2022											WOS:000849399400003

Near-inertial waves in Lake Erie	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Near-inertial (Poincare) waves with a period T-p similar to 17 h are the dominant wind-induced internal wave motions in central Lake Erie and consequently have a substantial influence on lake circulation, mixing and biogeochemistry. However, due to the complex three-basin bathymetry in Lake Erie, the vertical and horizontal modal structure of these waves remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyze field data to show wind events energize frequent vertical mode-one Poincare waves. The horizontal modal structure was also investigated, in a sensitivity analysis, using a calibrated three-dimensional hydrodynamic transport model forced with observed and idealized spatially uniform wind events. Strong horizontal mode-one Poincare wave cells form in both the Central and Eastern Basins when wind events have a duration of 0.25 T-p to 0.5 T-p, are impulsive and periodic at T-p, or have anticyclonic rotation with a duration of T-p. Momentum transfer from longer wind events (> 0.5 Tp) will oppose the Coriolis-force rotated currents and damp Poincare wave generation. In agreement with theory, the most efficient wind events are observed and computationally modeled to have a duration of 0.25 T-p; causing an excitation peak at similar to 0.4 T-p and converting similar to 0.8% of the wind energy input to Poincare waves. The efficiency of wind work in generating Poincare wave kinetic energy is given by (1-cos (2 pi f t)) t(-1), where f is the inertial frequency and t is the wind duration. Therefore, the efficiency peaks during each nT(p) period, where n is a non-negative integer, and decreases significantly for longer wind events.

Variation in water contact behaviour and risk of Schistosoma mansoni (re)infection among Ugandan school-aged children in an area with persistent high endemicity	PARASITES & VECTORS												Background: Annual mass drug administration with praziquantel has reduced schistosomiasis transmission in some highly endemic areas, but areas with persistent high endemicity have been identified across sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda. In these areas many children are rapidly reinfected post treatment, while some children remain uninfected or have low-intensity infections. The aim of this mixed-methods study was to better understand variation in water contact locations, behaviours and infection risk in school-aged children within an area with persistent high endemicity to inform additional control efforts. Methods: Data were collected in Bugoto, Mayuge District, Uganda. Two risk groups were identified from a longitudinal cohort, and eight children with no/low-intensity infections and eight children with reinfections were recruited. Individual structured day-long observations with a focus on water contact were conducted over two periods in 2018. In all identified water contact sites, four snail surveys were conducted quarterly over 1 year. All observed Biomphalaria snails were collected, counted and monitored in the laboratory for Schistosoma mansoni cercarial shedding for 3 weeks. Results: Children came into contact with water for a range of purposes, either directly at the water sources or by coming into contact with water collected previously. Although some water contact practices were similar between the risk groups, only children with reinfection were observed fetching water for commercial purposes and swimming in water sources; this latter group of children also came into contact with water at a larger variety and number of sites compared to children with no/low-intensity infection. Households with children with no/low-intensity infections collected rainwater more often. Water contact was observed at 10 sites throughout the study, and a total of 9457 Biomphalaria snails were collected from these sites over four sampling periods. Four lake sites had a significantly higher Biomphalaria choanomphala abundance, and reinfected children came into contact with water at these sites more often than children with no/low-intensity infections. While only six snails shed cercariae, four were from sites only contacted by reinfected children. Conclusions: Children with reinfection have more high-risk water contact behaviours and accessed water sites with higher B. choanomphala abundance, demonstrating that specific water contact behaviours interact with environmental features to explain variation in risk within areas with persistent high endemicity. Targeted behaviour change, vector control and safe water supplies could reduce reinfection in school-aged children in these settings.

J	Wang, QL; Li, ZJ; Xu, Y; Li, RR; Zhang, MS				Wang, Qiaoli; Li, Zijun; Xu, Yu; Li, Rongrong; Zhang, Mengsheng			Analysis of spatio-temporal variations of river water quality and construction of a novel cost-effective assessment model: a case study in Hong Kong	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Assessment of river water quality has been attracting a great deal of attention because of its important implications for the living environment of human beings and aquatic organisms. River water quality is commonly assessed using dozens of different water quality parameters. However, different parameters may contain redundant information, which could lead to the waste of monitoring efforts. Thus, this study constructed a novel cost-effective assessment model of river water quality using the 1-year monitoring data collected from 23 sampling stations in the water control zone of Tolo Harbour and Channel in Hong Kong. First, the spatio-temporal variations of water quality parameters and the overall status of river water quality were analyzed based on all 19 parameters using Kruskal-Wallis test, hierarchical cluster analysis, and the water quality index (WQI). The results indicated that most water quality parameters and overall water quality status varied significantly over space, but did not exhibit obvious seasonal differences; and 99.27% of water samples were identified to be in good or excellent status of overall WQI. Then, using principal component analysis (PCA)/factor analysis (FA) and Pearson's correlation analysis, eight parameters, including 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), fluoride (F-), total suspended solids (TSS), and arsenic (As), were verified to be responsible for the greatest contributions to water quality, the assessment of overall water quality status. These eight crucial parameters were further employed to establish six cost-effective water quality assessment models. Using the overall WQI as the benchmark, the results of linear regression analysis demonstrated that the cost-effective model constructed based on BOD5, COD, NH3-N, NO3-N, F-, TSS, and As were the optimal water quality assessment model, which can achieve the most reliable results with reduced parameters.

The values from the littoral zone and lake-floor sediments were determined, besides those in the water column of the pelagic zone. Furthermore, we conducted incubation experiments to measure microbial oxidation rates and alterations in the isotopic signatures of methane. We found significant vertical and seasonal variations in both in situ concentrations and stable isotopic compositions of methane measured in the pelagic zone. We concluded that active microbial oxidation was primarily responsible for the variation in delta C-13 and delta H-2 values of methane in the pelagic water column. As a result, we defined a new indicator Delta(2,13) to characterize the sources of dissolved methane, in which variations in both delta C-13 and delta H-2 during methane oxidation had been corrected. The excess methane in oxic, surface-water columns exhibited Delta(2,13) values similar to those in the littoral zone. We concluded that excess methane at the surface of the pelagic zone originated from the littoral zone via lateral transport. Anoxic near sediments and inflowing rivers were responsible for methane enrichment in water of the littoral zone and in the surface water columns of the pelagic zone.

J	Arndt, PS; Fricker, HA				Arndt, Philipp Sebastian; Fricker, Helen Amanda			A framework for automated supraglacial lake detection and depth retrieval in ICESat-2 photon data across the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets	CRYOSPHERE												Water depths of supraglacial lakes on the ice sheets are difficult to monitor continuously due the lakes' ephemeral nature and inaccessible locations. Supraglacial lakes have been linked to ice shelf collapse in Antarctica and accelerated flow of grounded ice in Greenland. However, the impact of supraglacial lakes on ice dynamics has not been quantified accurately enough to predict their contribution to future mass loss and sea level rise. This is largely because ice-sheet-wide assessments of meltwater volumes rely on models that are poorly constrained due to a lack of accurate depth measurements. Various recent case studies have demonstrated that accurate supraglacial lake depths can be obtained from NASA's Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2) ATL03 photon-level data product. ATL03 comprises hundreds of terabytes of unstructured point cloud data, which has made it challenging to use this bathymetric capability at scale. Here, we present two new algorithms - Flat Lake and Underlying Ice Detection (FLUID) and Surface Removal and Robust Fit (SuRRF) - which together provide a fully automated and scalable method for lake detection and along-track depth determination from ATL03 data and establish a framework for its large-scale implementation using distributed high-throughput computing. We report FLUID-SuRRF algorithm performance over two regions known to have significant surface melt - central West Greenland and the Amery Ice Shelf catchment in East Antarctica - during two melt seasons. FLUID-SuRRF reveals a total of 1249 ICESat-2 lake segments up to 25 m deep, with more water during higher-melt years. In the absence of ground-truth data, manual annotation of test data suggests that our method reliably detects melt lakes along ICESat-2's ground tracks whenever the lake bed is visible or partially visible and estimates water depths with a mean absolute error <0.27 m. These results imply that our proposed framework has the potential to generate a comprehensive data product of accurate meltwater depths across both ice sheets.

In drained lowland areas with intensive agriculture, a reduction in the fertilizer applications may be insufficient to improve the water quality in the short term as the P accumulated in the soil during decades of high fertilization may continue leaching for many years. A complementary approach to reduce P exports from agriculture is to implement edge-of-field mitigation measures at the farm scale. The selection of effective measures requires a detailed insight into the chemical and hydrological transport mechanisms. Here, we determined the main P sources, processes, and transport routes at the farm scale to support the selection of appropriate mitigation measures. We quantified the legacy P, the different P pools stored in the upper soil, and related it to the yearly P export downstream. To do this, we combined high-resolution monitoring data from the soil, groundwater, surface water, and ditch sediments. The legacy P in the topsoil was high, about 2500 kg ha(-1). The predominant subsurface flow and the subsoils' P sorption capacity retained the P mobilized from the topsoil and explained the relative moderate flux of P to surface waters (0.04 kg ha(-1) during the 2018-2019 drainage season). The dissolved P entering the drainage ditch via groundwater discharge was bound to iron-containing particles formed due to the oxidation of dissolved ferrous iron. Once leached from the soil to the drainage ditch, resuspension of P-rich sediment particles during flow peaks were the most important P transport mechanism (78%). Therefore, we expect that hydraulic constructions that reduce flow velocities and promote sedimentation of P-containing particles could reduce the export of P further downstream.

Countries around the world have implemented various types of blockades to stop this infection. These health measures have led to a significant reduction in air pollution. However, the impact of these measures on aquatic environments has been little analyzed. In this context, the water quality of rivers in the Mantaro River basin was evaluated using multivariate statistical methods and heavy metal contamination indices during the health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. Surface water samples were collected in triplicate from 15 sampling sectors at the end of the rainy season, between March and April. Concentrations of Cu, Fe, Pb, Zn and As were determined by the method of atomic absorption flame spectrophotometry. The average concentrations of heavy metals and arsenic in the rivers evaluated did not exceed the environmental quality standards for drinking water of the Peruvian, WHO and US EPA regulations, except for Pb, Fe and As in the Mantaro River and As in the Chia River. PCA presented a total variation percentage of 83.8%. The results showed a clear positive relationship between the five heavy metals and metalloids. The hierarchical cluster analysis according to Spearman's correlation generated a dendrogram where the five chemical elements were grouped in two statistically significant groups, one group conglomerating to Cu, Pb, Zn and Fe and the other group to As. PERMANOVA partition shows that the spatial effects of the sectors are strong and significant. The HPI revealed that 13.33% of the sampling sectors exceeded the critical contamination value (150). The C-d revealed low degree of contamination (<1) in 86.67% of the sampling sectors					; Custodio, Maria/E-3906-2019; Peñaloza-Fernandez, Richard/AAZ-5988-2021; Alvarado-Ibáñez, Juan/AAS-9042-2021; Custodio, María/E-3906-2019	Maldonado Ore, Edith Mercedes/0000-0002-3472-1346; Alvarado Ibanez, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-6413-3457; Penaloza, Richard/0000-0003-3160-9268; Penaloza, Richard/0000-0001-9848-1815; Custodio, Maria/0000-0003-1994-010X; CHANAME ZAPATA, FERNAN COSME/0000-0002-2059-8308; 													1230-1485	2083-5906					2021	30	4					3005	3018		10.15244/pjoes/130988	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/130988													WOS:000660546600005

The water ecosystem of Manchar Lake situated in the arid region of Pakistan has also been degraded and posing a severe health risk to the dependent communities. This study aims to investigate the seasonal variability in the influx of trace elements (As, Cd, Cr(III), Cr(VI), Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) into the lake during pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons and its consequential health risks. The highest mean concentrations (mu g/l) of As (43.2), Cr(III) (101.4), Zn (41), Cu (43.12), Fe (318), Cd (18.5), Mn (27.2), Ni (99.7), Pb (65.91) and Hg (6.8) have been observed in pre-monsoon and Cr(VI) (0.2) in monsoon seasons. The elements exceeding safe limits in pre-monsoon season are As, Cd, Cr(III), Hg, Ni, and Pb, while in monsoon season As, Cd, Ni, and Pb exceed the limit. Evaluation of the degree of contamination depicted high levels of pollution in pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons and the Heavy Metal Evaluation Index indicated a high level of pollution in pre-monsoon, medium in monsoon, and low in the post-monsoon season. The study revealed that oral consumption of lake water potentially causes carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health risks. However, potential dermal related health risks associated with these metals concentrations in water are within the tolerable ranges. The findings of this study suggest prompt actions to control these pollutants influx into the lake.

Effects of Seasonal Anoxia on the Microbial Community Structure in Demosponges in a Marine Lake in Lough Hyne, Ireland	MSPHERE												Climate change is expanding marine oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), while anthropogenic nutrient input depletes oxygen concentrations locally. The effects of deoxygenation on animals are generally detrimental; however, some sponges (Porifera) exhibit hypoxic and anoxic tolerance through currently unknown mechanisms. Sponges harbor highly specific microbiomes, which can include microbes with anaerobic capabilities. Sponge-microbe symbioses must also have persisted through multiple anoxic/hypoxic periods throughout Earth's history. Since sponges lack key components of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway responsible for hypoxic responses in other animals, it was hypothesized that sponge tolerance to deoxygenation may be facilitated by its microbiome. To test this hypothesis, we determined the microbial composition of sponge species tolerating seasonal anoxia and hypoxia in situ in a semienclosed marine lake, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We discovered a high degree of cryptic diversity among sponge species tolerating seasonal deoxygenation, including at least nine encrusting species of the orders Axinellida and Poecilosclerida. Despite significant changes in microbial community structure in the water, sponge microbiomes were species specific and remarkably stable under varied oxygen conditions, which was further explored for Eurypon spp. 2 and Hymeraphia stellifera. However, some symbiont sharing occurred under anoxia. At least three symbiont combinations, all including large populations of Thaumarchaeota, corresponded with deoxygenation tolerance, and some combinations were shared between some distantly related hosts. We propose hypothetical host-symbiont interactions following deoxygenation that could confer deoxygenation tolerance. IMPORTANCE The oceans have an uncertain future due to anthropogenic stressors and an uncertain past that is becoming clearer with advances in biogeochemistry. Both past and future oceans were, or will be, deoxygenated in comparison to present conditions. Studying how sponges and their associated microbes tolerate deoxygenation provides insights into future marine ecosystems. Moreover, sponges form the earliest branch of the animal evolutionary tree, and they likely resemble some of the first animals. We determined the effects of variable environmental oxygen concentrations on the microbial communities of several demosponge species during seasonal anoxia in the field. Our results indicate that anoxic tolerance in some sponges may depend on their symbionts, but anoxic tolerance was not universal in sponges. Therefore, some sponge species could likely outcompete benthic organisms like corals in future, reduced-oxygen ecosystems. Our results support the molecular evidence that sponges and other animals have a Neoproterozoic origin and that animal evolution was not limited by low-oxygen conditions.

Water samples were collected from ponds of three cultivated species. After the samples were filtered and total DNA was extracted, Illumina high-throughput sequencing was used to profile the spatiotemporal distributions in bacterioplankton communities, the belt diversity, and the influencing factors during this period of time. The results showed that Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla. Biological differences in cultivated species were the main influencing factors that shaped bacterioplankton communities. Monthly variations and thermal stratification provided little and no contribution to bacterioplankton communities, respectively. CODmn, Chla, and TN were the most appropriate parameters to describe the environmental interpretation of bacterial ordinations, and CODmn was the predominant factor. In addition, the higher similarity between CODmn and Chla, shown by clustering analysis, indicated that the algae-bacteria symbiotic system may have an important role in material circulation in freshwater aquaculture pond water during the peak period of culture. The present study has helped to elucidate the biological characteristics of aquaculture tail water, and enriched the basic data provided by bacterioplankton studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Supraglacial lakes (SGLs), which are representative and identifiable hydrologic features of surface meltwater on GrIS, are a means of assessing surface ablation temporally and spatially. In this study, we have developed a robust method to automatically extract SGLs by testing the widely distributed SGLs area-in southwest Greenland (68 degrees 00 ' N-70 degrees 00 ' N, 48 degrees 00 ' W-51 degrees 30 ' W), and documented their dynamics from 2014 to 2018 using Landsat 8 OLI images. This method identifies water using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and then extracts SGLs with morphological and geometrical algorithms. CNN combines spectral and spatial features and shows better water identification results than the widely used adaptive thresholding method (Otsu), and two machine learning methods (Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)). Our results show that the total SGLs area varied between 158 and 393 km(2) during 2014 to 2018; the area increased from 2014 to 2015, then decreased and reached the lowest point (158.73 km(2)) in 2018, when the most limited surface melting was observed. SGLs were most active during the melt season in 2015 with a quantity of 700 and a total area of 393.36 km(2). The largest individual lake developed in 2016, with an area of 9.30 km(2). As for the elevation, SGLs were most active in the area, with the elevation ranging from 1000 to 1500 m above sea level, and SGLs in 2016 were distributed at higher elevations than in other years.

Southern Africa Int Ctr Excellence	Habitat Partitioning of Malaria Vectors in Nchelenge District, Zambia	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE												Nchelenge District in Luapula Province, northern Zambia, experiences holoendemic malaria despite implementation of vector control programs. The major Anopheles vectors that contribute to Plasmodium falciparum transmission in this area had not previously been well defined. Three collections performed during the 2012 wet and dry seasons and the 2013 wet season revealed Anopheles funestus sensu stricto and Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto as the main vectors, where 80-85% of each collection was composed of An. funestus. Both vectors were found to be highly anthropophilic, and An. funestus has higher sporozoite infection rates (SIRs) and entomological inoculation rates (EIRs) year-round compared with An. gambiae: SIRs of 1.8-3.0% and 0-2.5%, respectively, and EIRs of 3.7-41.5 infectious bites per 6-month period (ib/p/6mo) and 0-5.9 ib/p/6mo, respectively. Spatial and temporal changes in each vector's dynamics and bionomics were also observed. Anopheles funestus was the predominant vector in the villages near Kenani Stream in both wet and dry seasons, whereas An. gambiae was found to be the main vector in areas near Lake Mweru during the wet season. The vector data illustrate the need for broader temporal and spatial sampling in Nchelenge and present unique opportunities to further our understanding of malarial transmission and implications for malarial control in high-risk areas.					; Norris, Doug/GXV-3397-2022	Norris, Douglas/0000-0002-4631-2777; 													0002-9637	1476-1645				JUN	2016	94	6					1234	1244		10.4269/ajtmh.15-0735	http://dx.doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.15-0735								27001755					WOS:000400205900010

Floating Aquatic Macrophytes Can Substantially Offset Open Water CO2 Emissions from Tropical Floodplain Lake Ecosystems	ECOSYSTEMS												Tropical floodplain lake ecosystems are recognized as important sources of carbon (C) from the water to the atmosphere. They receive large amounts of organic matter and nutrients from the watershed, leading to intense net heterotrophy and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from open waters. However, the role of extensive stands of floating macrophytes colonizing floodplains areas is still neglected in assessments of net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE). We assessed rates of air-lake CO2 flux using static chambers in both open waters and waters covered by the widespread floating aquatic macrophyte (water hyacinth; Eichornia sp.) in two tropical floodplain lakes in Pantanal, Brazil during different hydrological seasons. In both lakes, areas colonized by floating macrophytes were a net CO2 sink during all seasons. In contrast, open waters emitted CO2, with higher emissions during the rising and high water periods. Our results indicate that the lake NEE can be substantially overestimated (fivefold or more in the studied lakes) if the carbon fixation by macrophytes is not considered. The contribution of these plants can lead to neutral or negative NEE (that is, net uptake of CO2) on a yearly basis. This highlights the importance of floating aquatic macrophytes for the C balance in shallow lakes and extensive floodplain areas.

J	Luo, X; Hu, ZW; Liu, L				Luo, Xin; Hu, Zhongwen; Liu, Lin			Investigating the seasonal dynamics of surface water over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using Sentinel-1 imagery and a novel gated multiscale ConvNet	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH												The surface water in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) region has undergone dramatic changes in recent decades. To capture dynamic surface water information, many satellite imagery-based methods have been proposed. However, these methods are still limited in terms of automation and accuracy and thus prevent surface water dynamic studies in large-scale QTP regions. In this study, we developed a new fully automatic method for accurate surface water mapping by using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and convolutional networks (ConvNets). Specifically, we built a new multiscale ConvNet structure to improve the model capability in surface water body extraction. Moreover, a gating mechanism is introduced to promote the efficient use of multiscale information. According to the accuracy assessment, the proposed gated multiscale ConvNet (GMNet) achieved the highest overall accuracy of 98.07%. We applied our GMNet for monthly surface water mapping on the QTP; accordingly, we found that the QTP region experienced significant surface water fluctuations over one year. The surface water also showed distinct spatial heterogeneity on the QTP; that is, the surface water fraction of the Inner Tibetan Basin was significantly higher than that of the Mekong Basin in both the wet and dry seasons.

Long-term data show effects of atmospheric temperature anomaly and reservoir size on water temperature, thermal structure, and dissolved oxygen	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Predicting changes in reservoir conditions from climatic warming is hindered by the paucity of long-term data on temperature and thermal and oxygen structure replicated across a range of reservoir sizes. The present study characterizes seasonal patterns in temperature, thermal structure, and dissolved oxygen availability in reservoirs, and evaluates how critical periods for aquatic organisms (i.e., periods of maximum temperature and minimum oxygen) for these features are affected by atmospheric temperature anomalies at different time lags. Temperature and dissolved oxygen were measured from May through October at 1 m intervals from surface to bottom for 10 reservoirs sampled between 14 and 21 years during 1995-2016. For most temperature and oxygen metrics July was the period of thermal maxima and oxygen minima across reservoirs, exceptions were thermocline depth, which was static from May through October, and bottom water temperature which peaked in August. Surface water temperature of reservoirs increased 0.6 degrees C for every 1.0 degrees C increase in atmospheric temperature in July independent of reservoir area. Although the percentage of water that was oxic in July decreased with increasing July air temperatures, it increased with warming air temperatures from February to April. These long-term data derived patterns highlight the importance of reservoir size and lag periods in building a framework for predicting climate-induced changes in the thermal and oxygen environments of reservoirs, which have important implications for water quality and ecosystem processes and the associated dynamics of reservoir flora and fauna.																			1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2022	84	1							3	10.1007/s00027-021-00835-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-021-00835-2													WOS:000721879600001

Despite recent decreases in the national malaria burden in Kenya due to vector control interventions, malaria transmission continues to be high in western regions of the country bordering Lake Victoria. The objective of this study was to advance knowledge of the topographical, demographic and behavioral risk factors associated with submicroscopic malaria infection in the Lake Victoria basin in Kisumu County. MethodsCross-sectional community surveys for malaria infection were undertaken in three eco-epidemiologically distinct zones in Nyakach sub-County, Kisumu. Adjacent regions were topologically characterized as lakeshore, hillside and highland plateau. Surveys were conducted during the 2019 and 2020 wet and dry seasons. Finger prick blood smears and dry blood spots (DBS) on filter paper were collected from 1,777 healthy volunteers for microscopic inspection and real time-PCR (RT-PCR) diagnosis of Plasmodium infection. Persons who were PCR positive but blood smear negative were considered to harbor submicroscopic infections. Topographical, demographic and behavioral risk factors were correlated with community prevalence of submicroscopic infections. ResultsOut of a total of 1,777 blood samples collected, 14.2% (253/1,777) were diagnosed as submicroscopic infections. Blood smear microscopy and RT-PCR, respectively, detected 3.7% (66/1,777) and 18% (319/1,777) infections. Blood smears results were exclusively positive for P. falciparum, whereas RT-PCR also detected P. malariae and P. ovale mono- and co-infections. Submicroscopic infection prevalence was associated with topographical variation (chi(2) = 39.344, df = 2, p<0.0001). The highest prevalence was observed in the lakeshore zone (20.6%, n = 622) followed by the hillside (13.6%, n = 595) and highland plateau zones (7.9%, n = 560). Infection prevalence varied significantly according to season (chi(2) = 17.374, df = 3, p<0.0001). The highest prevalence was observed in residents of the lakeshore zone in the 2019 dry season (29.9%, n = 167) and 2020 and 2019 rainy seasons (21.5%, n = 144 and 18.1%, n = 155, respectively). In both the rainy and dry seasons the likelihood of submicroscopic infection was higher in the lakeshore (AOR: 2.71, 95% CI = 1.85-3.95; p<0.0001) and hillside (AOR: 1.74, 95% CI = 1.17-2.61, p = 0.007) than in the highland plateau zones. Residence in the lakeshore zone (p<0.0001), male sex (p = 0.025), school age (p = 0.002), and living in mud houses (p = 0.044) increased the risk of submicroscopic malaria infection. Bed net use (p = 0.112) and occupation (p = 0.116) were not associated with submicroscopic infection prevalence. ConclusionTopographic features of the local landscape and seasonality are major correlates of submicroscopic malaria infection in the Lake Victoria area of western Kenya. Diagnostic tests more sensitive than blood smear microscopy will allow for monitoring and targeting geographic sites where additional vector interventions are needed to reduce malaria transmission.

Experimental research on the thermal method of drilling by melting the well in ice mass with simultaneous controlled expansion of its diameter	JOURNAL OF MINING INSTITUTE												During the seasonal work of the 64th Russian Antarctic Expedition in 2018-2019 at the "Vostok" drilling facility named after B. B.Kudryashov (" Vostok" station, Antarctic) specialists of Saint Petersburg Mining University conducted experimental investigations on the process of drilling by melting with simultaneous expansion of wells in the ice mass. A test bench and a full-scale model of a thermohydraulic reamer-drilling tool were developed, manufactured and tested for the research. The first bench tests of the full-scale model proved its efficiency and suitability for experimental drilling with simultaneous expansion of wells in ice mass; its operational capabilities were determined and the drawbacks that will be taken into account in future were found out. The article substantiates the choice of constructive elements for thermohydraulic reamer-drilling tool. It is determined that the technology of full diameter drilling with simultaneous expansion of the well in ice mass can be implemented by combining contact drilling by melting and convective expansion with creation of forced near-bottomhole annular circulation of the heated heat carrier. Dependencies of expansion rate on main technological parameters were determined: active heat power of heating elements in penetrator and circulation system, mechanical drilling rate, pump flow rate. According to the results of investigations, the experimental model of thermohydraulic reamer- drilling tool will be designed and manufactured for testing in conditions of well 5G.

Previous research has highlighted that IRSPs have periods of low dissolved oxygen concentrations which may have a critical effect on shrimp survival. To understand the causes of low dissolved oxygen, this study examined oxygen fluxes at two IRSPs in Ca Mau Province, Vietnam during a two-year period (two wet seasons and two dry seasons). Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) incubations and whole-system oxygen flux measurements were conducted and compared with a range of water and sediment parameters to explain drivers for low oxygen concentrations. A high percentage of oxygen demand at a whole pond scale was from the sediment; hence SOD drove low oxygen concentrations in the water column. SOD rates were significantly positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations in the water column. These findings suggested that algal production in the water column, rather than benthic algal production, or other organic loading, provided an organic carbon source driving SOD. Oxygen demand was much higher than oxygen production within the IRSPs, indicating high bacterial activity and low algal production. This study has shed new light on the importance of SOD in driving oxygen drawdown in IRSPs and improving shrimp survival requires new management approaches to reduce the negative effect of SOD.

Precipitation changes in the western tropical Pacific over the past millennium	GEOLOGY												Modern seasonal and inter-annual precipitation variability in Palau is linked to both meridional movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and changes in the Pacific Walker Circulation (PWC) associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Thus, Palau's hydroclimate should be sensitive to mean shifts in the ITCZ and PWC on decadal to centennial time scales. Using compound-specific hydrogen isotope ratios (delta H-2) of dinosterol in lake sediments, we generated a decadal-resolution proxy record of hydroclimatic variability in Palau spanning the past 800 yr. Results indicate a drying trend during the Little Ice Age in Palau, consistent with a southward displacement of the ITCZ. In addition to the secular drying trend, there are persistent large (similar to 20%) multi-decadal to centennial oscillations in the delta H-2 record, the most recent of which indicates an abrupt shift to drier conditions in the mid-1970s that coincides with a decadal-scale negative shift in the Southern Oscillation Index.																			0091-7613	1943-2682				AUG	2016	44	8					671	674		10.1130/G37822.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G37822.1													WOS:000380121500020

Climate-Change Effects on Soils: Accelerated Weathering, Soil Carbon, and Elemental Cycling	ADVANCES IN AGRONOMY, VOL 131	Advances in Agronomy											Climate change (i.e., high atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations (>= 400 ppm); increasing air temperatures (2-4 degrees C or greater); significant and/or abrupt changes in daily, seasonal, and interannual temperature; changes in the wet/dry cycles; intensive rainfall and/or heavy storms; extended periods of drought; extreme frost; heat waves and increased fire frequency) is and will significantly affect soil properties and fertility, water resources, food quantity and quality, and environmental quality. Biotic processes that consume atmospheric CO2 and create organic carbon (C) that is either reprocessed to CO2 or stored in soils, are the subject of active current investigations with great concern over the influence of climate change. In addition, abiotic C cycling and its influence on the inorganic C pool in soils is a fundamental global process in which acidic atmospheric CO2 participates in the weathering of carbonate and silicate minerals, ultimately delivering bicarbonate and Ca2+ or other cations that precipitate in the form of carbonates in soils or are transported to the rivers, lakes, and oceans. Soil responses to climate change will be complex, and there are many uncertainties and unresolved issues. The objective of the review is to initiate and further stimulate a discussion about some important and challenging aspects of climate-change effects on soils, such as accelerated weathering of soil minerals and resulting C and elemental fluxes in and out of soils, soil/geo-engineering methods used to increase C sequestration in soils, soil organic matter (SOM) protection, transformation and mineralization, and SOM temperature sensitivity. This review reports recent discoveries and identifies key research needs required to understand the effects of climate change on soils.					; Qafoku, Nik/L-7147-2016	Qafoku, Nikolla P./0000-0002-3258-5379; 													0065-2113	2213-6789	978-0-12-802136-1				2015	131						111	172		10.1016/bs.agron.2014.12.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/bs.agron.2014.12.002													WOS:000393108900003

However, little is known about the change in algal community structure and its interactions with nutrient dynamics in gravel-bed urban rivers. In present study, water samples were collected from a gravel-bed River Xin' an, China for five months over four seasons and a rainy month to measure algal community structure, dissolved nitrogen gas (N-2) and Argon (Ar) concentrations, and other water quality parameters. The results showed that the harmful Cyanophyta accounted for 31.6 +/- 24.1% of the total community in the hot season while Bacillariophyta contributed more than 60% to the community in the other three seasons. The N-2 was supersaturated in the moderate and cold seasons but it was unsaturated in the hot season, along with high concentrations of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria (Anabaena), indicating that the nitrogen fixation capacity was strong and even stronger than denitrification and anammox in the hot season. However, nitrogen fixation was not the main source of nitrogen in the water column. The concentrations of nutrients and Chla in the downstream river were significantly higher than those in the upstream river (p < 0.001 for nutrients and p = 0.029 for Chla), suggesting that human activities along the river greatly affected nutrient concentrations, as well as algal growth. Our study provides new insights into the algal community succession in a gravel-bed urban river and puts forward effective measures such as controlling exogenous nutrient input and dredging organic sediment for mitigating the harmful algal blooms in urban rivers.					; xu, hai/JEP-5422-2023	Zhao, Feng/0000-0002-7031-6604; 													0304-3894	1873-3336				MAR 5	2022	425								127775	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127775	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127775		DEC 2021						34844802					WOS:000752464100001

Fuzzy logic approach for the assessment of trophic state of water bodies	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Eutrophication has emerged as one of the main threats to surface water bodies. The parameters for assessing eutrophication are not generally measured regularly from the lakes of India as part of monitoring programmes and it is necessary to express the trophic status in terms of secondary indicator variables that are included in the routine analysis by the State/Central government. In this paper, the trophic status of Ashtamudi Lake has been studied, considering its international importance and socio-economic relevance. The cause and response variables such as total phosphorus, Secchi disc depth, chlorophyll-a and the secondary indicator variables such as pH, turbidity, DO, EC, Salinity, TDS and BOD were analysed during the pre-monsoon season. The lake was predominantly classified as eutrophic, with some areas coming under a hypereutrophic state. A comparison was made among the five methods of water quality index by the use of secondary indicator variables to identify the appropriate method for simulating trophic status and the WQI based on the logarithmic method considering pH, turbidity, DO and BOD was identified to predict the trophic state very well. Further, the application of numerical strategy such as fuzzy logic was used to determine water quality indexes and trophic status, which can define the quality of a water body as a consequence of the variation of environmental parameters. The developed approach was further validated by using historical data for the years 2013-2015, which were regularly monitored by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. The trophic state predicted by the approach was found to be in agreement with that estimated using Carlson's method. Thus the developed model, based on secondary indicator parameters that are readily available from government agencies, can be used to assess the trophic state of lakes, thereby assisting policy makers to frame regulations to minimize eutrophication.

The basal Ngira paleosol is a 7.6 m thick, oxisolic Vertisol that formed during a prolonged period of pedogenesis; it began as a smectite-dominated Vertisol that was later overprinted through polypedogenesis to become a kaolinitic paleosol highly depleted of all base cations, with abundant Fe concentrations and depletions, and complexly variegated color mottle patterns that reflect extensive ferruginization. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions using bulk geochemistry indicate warm and wet conditions during development of the Ngira paleosol that probably supported a tropical seasonal forest on a stable upland surface for 10s to 100s of thousands of years. Following this long-lived stable landscape, rapid subsidence, perhaps associated with slip on a high-angle fault associated with the onset or progression of the Nyanza Rift and/or the development and eruptive history of the nearby Kisingiri volcano, buried the paleosol and formed a nascent lake basin that experienced multiple transgressions and regressions. During one interval of regression, fluvial sandstones and conglomerates were deposited along with fluvio-lacustrine sandstones and claystones that include weakly developed paleosols. These weakly-developed paleosols indicate a relatively dry paleoenvironment with seasonal precipitation, and probably a shrubland/bushland or riparian forest habitat. Important terrestrial and aquatic vertebrate fossils are primarily preserved within fluvial and fluvio-lacustrine deposits, indicating that the terrestrial Karungu fauna lived in a relatively dry and open habitat. This study demonstrates polypedogenesis and inferences regarding onset of abrupt tectonic activity in the early Miocene in equatorial eastern Africa, and emphasizes the contrasts between landscape stability of the Ngira paleosol and the poorly developed soils in the fluvio-lacustrine facies.

Appraisal of urban lake water quality through numerical index, multivariate statistics and earth observation data sets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The earth observation data sets were employed to study the land use/land cover change in study area from year 2000-2010. Vegetation, built-up area and agriculture classes had shown maximum changes. The lake water samples were analyzed, and further, Water Quality Index (WQI) was computed to categorize the lake water. The average value of WQI is 64.52, 52.23 and 42.45 in pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. Generally, pre-monsoon samples have higher number of polluted samples. Moreover, we applied the multivariate statistical techniques for handling large and complex data sets in order to get better information about the lake water quality. Factor analysis and principal component analysis are applied to understand the latent structure of the data sets, and we have identified a total of four factors in pre-monsoon, three factors in monsoon and three factors in post-monsoon season, which are responsible for the whole data structure. These factors have explained that 90.908, 89.078 and 85.456 % of the cumulative percentage variance of the pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon data sets. Overall analysis reveals that the agricultural runoff, waste disposal, leaching and irrigation with wastewater, land transformation in the surrounding areas are the main causes of lake water pollution followed by some degree of pollution from geogenic sources such as rock weathering. Hence, there is an urgent need of proper attention and management of resources.					; Gautam, Sandeep/AAJ-4115-2020; singh, sudhir/HNS-9950-2023; Singh, Prafull/AFP-0691-2022	Singh, Sudhir Kumar/0000-0001-8465-0649; Gautam, Sandeep K/0000-0002-3914-9887; 													1735-1472	1735-2630				FEB	2016	13	2					445	456		10.1007/s13762-015-0850-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-015-0850-x													WOS:000368163100005

An efficient semi-distributed hillslope erosion model for the subhumid Ethiopian Highlands	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Erosion modeling has been generally scaling up from plot scale but not based on landscape topographic position, which is a main variable in saturation excess runoff. In addition, predicting sediment loss in Africa has been hampered by using models developed in western countries and do not perform as well in the monsoon climate prevailing in most of the continent. The objective of this paper is to develop a simple erosion model that can be used in the Ethiopian Highlands in Africa. We base our sediment prediction on a simple distributed saturated excess hydrology model that predicts surface runoff from severely degraded lands and from bottom lands that become saturated during the rainy season and estimates interflow and baseflow from the remaining portions of the landscape. By developing an equation that relates surface runoff to sediment concentration generated from runoff source areas, assuming that baseflow and interflow are sediment-free, we were able to predict daily sediment concentrations from the Anjeni watershed with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ranging from 0.64 to 0.78 using only two calibrated sediment parameters. Anjeni is a 113 ha watershed in the 17.4 million ha Blue Nile Basin in the Ethiopian Highlands. The discharge of the two watersheds was predicted with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values ranging from 0.80 to 0.93. The calibrated values in Anjeni for degraded (14 %) and saturated (2 %) runoff source area were in agreement with field evidence. The analysis suggests that identifying the runoff source areas and predicting the surface runoff correctly is an important step in predicting the sediment concentration.

Hydrocarbon lakes on Titan: Distribution and interaction with a porous regolith	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of Titan's north polar region reveal quasi-circular to complex features which are interpreted to be liquid hydrocarbon lakes. We investigate methane transport in Titan's hydrologic cycle using the global distribution of lake features. As of May 2007, the SAR data set covers similar to 22% of the surface and indicates multiple lake morphologies which are correlated across the polar region. Lakes are limited to latitudes above 55 degrees N and vary from < 10 to more than 100,000 km(2). The size and location of lakes provide constraints on parameters associated with subsurface transport. Using porous media properties inferred from Huygens probe observations, timescales for flow into and out of observed lakes are shown to be in the tens of years, similar to seasonal cycles. Derived timescales are compared to the time between collocated SAR observations in order to consider the role of subsurface transport in Titan's hydrologic cycle.					; Lewis, Kevin/E-5557-2012; Lorenz, Ralph/B-8759-2016; Mitri, Giuseppe/Q-7422-2016; Hayes, Alexander/P-2024-2014; Lopes, Rosaly/D-1608-2016; Mitchell, Karl Leon/AAG-3821-2020; Mitchell, Karl/AAG-3821-2020	Lewis, Kevin/0000-0003-3412-803X; Lunine, Jonathan/0000-0003-2279-4131; Lorenz, Ralph/0000-0001-8528-4644; Mitri, Giuseppe/0000-0001-8390-458X; Lopes, Rosaly/0000-0002-7928-3167; Mitchell, Karl Leon/0000-0003-1093-8441; Aharonson, Oded/0000-0001-9930-2495; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAY 14	2008	35	9							L09204	10.1029/2008GL033409	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008GL033409													WOS:000256060200001
J	Kummu, M; Sarkkula, J				Kummu, Matti; Sarkkula, Juha			Impact of the Mekong River flow alteration on the Tonle Sap flood pulse	AMBIO												Rapid development in the upper reaches of the Mekong River, in the form of construction of large hydropower dams and reservoirs, large irrigation schemes, and rapid urban development, is putting water resources under stress. Recent studies have concluded that these developments will lead to flow alterations in the Mekong River. These flow alterations would threaten the sensitive ecosystems downstream, particularly Tonle Sap River, Tonle Sap Lake, its floodplain, and its gallery forest and protected areas, by changing the flood-pulse system of the lake. This article estimates the changes in parameters of the Tonle Sap flood pulse due to the aforementioned flow alterations. The impacts on the flooded area and loss of gallery forest and protected areas were analyzed using geographic information system-based methods. Relatively small rises in the dry-season lake water level would permanently inundate disproportionately large areas of floodplain, rendering it inaccessible to floodplain vegetation and eroding the productivity basis of the ecosystem. It is highly important to maintain the natural hydrological pattern of the Mekong River, particularly the dry-season water levels, to preserve Tonle Sap Lake's ecosystem productivity.

There are two models in QAA for clear and turbid waters (referred to as QAA_clear and QAA_turbid). QAA_v6 switches between the two models by setting a threshold value for the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs, sr(-1)) at the selected reference band of 656 nm. However, some researchers found that this reference band or the threshold value does not apply to many turbid inland lakes. In Honghu Lake, the R-rs (656) (R-rs at 656 nm) in the whole lake is less than 0.0015 sr(-1); therefore, only QAA_turbid can be applied. Moreover, we found that QAA_clear resulted in overestimation while QAA_turbid resulted in significant underestimations. The waters of inland lakes usually continuously vary between clear and turbid water. We proposed a hypothesis that QAA_turbid and QAA_clear transition evenly, rather than being distinguished by one threshold value, and we developed a model that combined QAA_clear and QAA_turbid according to our assumption. This model simulated the process of continuous change in water clarity. The results showed that our model had a better performance with an RMSE that reduced from 0.5 to 0.28, an MAE that reduced from 0.43 to 0.21, and bias that reduced from -0.4 to -0.05 m compared with QAA_v6. We applied QAA_Honghu to Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI data and obtained 205 Z(SD) maps with high spatial resolution in Honghu Lake. The results were consistent with the existing in situ measurements. From 1987-2020, the Z(SD) results of Honghu Lake showed an overall downward trend and a distinct seasonal pattern.

Despite many reports on freshwater ecosystems, relatively little attention has been given so far to those located in the southern hemisphere and our current knowledge is particularly poor regarding the methane cycle in non-perennially glaciated lakes of the maritime Antarctica. We conducted a high-resolution study of the methane and carbon dioxide cycle in a lake of the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island (Lat. 62 degrees S), and a succinct characterization of 10 additional lakes and ponds of the region. The study, done during the ice-free and the ice-seasons, included methane and carbon dioxide exchanges with the atmosphere (both from water and surrounding soils) and the dissolved concentration of these two gases throughout the water column. This characterization was complemented with an ex-situ analysis of the microbial activities involved in the methane cycle, including methanotrophic and methanogenic activities as well as the methane-related marker gene abundance, in water, sediments and surrounding soils. The results showed that, over an annual cycle, the freshwater ecosystems of the region arc dominantly autotrophic and that, despite low but omnipresent atmospheric methane emissions, they act as greenhouse gas sinks.

Development and validation of a macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity (IBI) for assessing urban impacts to Northern California freshwater wetlands	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Despite California policies requiring assessment of ambient wetland condition and compensatory wetland mitigations, no intensive monitoring tools have been developed to evaluate freshwater wetlands within the state. Therefore, we developed standardized, wadeable field methods to sample macroinvertebrate communities and evaluated 40 wetlands across Northern California to develop a macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity (IBI). A priori reference sites were selected with minimal urban impacts, representing a best-attainable condition. We screened 56 macroinvertebrate metrics for inclusion in the IBI based on responsiveness to percent urbanization. Eight final metrics were selected for inclusion in the IBI: percent three dominant taxa; scraper richness; percent Ephemeroptera, Odonata, and Trichoptera (EOT); EOT richness; percent Tanypodinae/Chironomidae; Oligochaeta richness; percent Coleoptera; and predator richness. The IBI (potential range 0-100) demonstrated significant discriminatory power between the reference (mean = 69) and impacted wetlands (mean = 28). It also declined with increasing percent urbanization (R (2) = 0.53, p < 0.005) among wetlands in an independent validation dataset (n = 14). The IBI was robust in showing no significant bias with environmental gradients. This IBI is a functional tool to determine the ecological condition at urban (stormwater and flood control ponds), as well as rural freshwater wetlands (stockponds, seasonal wetlands, and natural ponds). Biological differences between perennial and non-perennial wetlands suggest that developing separate indicators for these wetland types may improve applicability, although the existing data set was not sufficient for exploring this option.

Modelling groundwater/surface water interaction in a managed riparian chalk valley wetland	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Understanding hydrological processes in wetlands may be complicated by management practices and complex groundwater/surface water interactions. This is especially true for wetlands underlain by permeable geology, such as chalk. In this study, the physically based, distributed model MIKE SHE is used to simulate hydrological processes at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology River Lambourn Observatory, Boxford, Berkshire, UK. This comprises a 10-ha lowland, chalk valley bottom, riparian wetland designated for its conservation value and scientific interest. Channel management and a compound geology exert important, but to date not completely understood, influences upon hydrological conditions. Model calibration and validation were based upon comparisons of observed and simulated groundwater heads and channel stages over an equally split 20-month period. Model results are generally consistent with field observations and include short-term responses to events as well as longer-term seasonal trends. An intrinsic difficulty in representing compressible, anisotropic soils limited otherwise excellent performance in some areas. Hydrological processes in the wetland are dominated by the interaction between groundwater and surface water. Channel stage provides head boundaries for broad water levels across the wetland, whilst areas of groundwater upwelling control discrete head elevations. A relic surface drainage network confines flooding extents and routes seepage to the main channels. In-channel macrophyte growth and its management have an acute effect on water levels and the proportional contribution of groundwater and surface water. The implications of model results for management of conservation species and their associated habitats are discussed.

Predictors of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed net ownership and utilization: evidence from community-based cross-sectional comparative study, Southwest Ethiopia	MALARIA JOURNAL												Background: Malaria is the notorious impediment of public health and economic development. Long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets/insecticide-treated bed nets (LLINs/ITNs) are among major intervention strategies to avert the impact the disease. However, effectiveness of LLINs/ITNs depends on, inter alia, possessing sufficient number, proper utilization and timely replacement of nets. Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends surveys to evaluate possession and proper use of LLINs/ITNs by households. Methods: A cross-sectional comparative household survey was conducted during peak malaria transmission season using interviewer-introduced questionnaires in southwest Ethiopia. A study site was selected from villages around a man-made lake, Gilgel-Gibe (GG) and a control site, with similar geographic and socio-economic features but far away from the lake, was identified. A total of 2,373 households from randomly selected cluster of households were included into the study and heads/spouses of the households responded to interviews. Binary and multinomial logistic regressions were used to identify predictors of LLIN ownership and utilization. Results: LLIN/ITN ownership among the study populations was 56.6%, while 43.4% of households did not own a net. A higher proportion of households in GG reported owning at least one LLITN/ITN compared to control village (OR = 2. 2, P < 0.001) and more households in GG reported having only one LLITN/ITN in contrast to households in the control village (OR = 2.1, P < 0.001). The mean number of LLINs/ITNs owned was 1.6 for GG residents and 1.8 for control village with a mean difference of -0.26 (95% CI = -0.34, -0.19). The age of household heads, household relative wealth index (RWI), distance to nearest health service and accessibility to transportation showed a significant association with ownership of LLINs/ITNs. The probability of owning two or more LLINs/ITNs was positively associated with age of household head. Marital status of household heads, RWI, distance to nearest health service, accessibility to transport, residence and household size showed a significant association with utilization of LLINs/ITNs. Conclusion: Attention needs to be given to the poor, distant and inaccessible households in the efforts of malaria intervention programmes, such as free distribution of LLINs/ITNs. Well-tailored information, education and communication is needed to address the problem of non-users.

J	Ivory, SJ; Russell, J				Ivory, Sarah J.; Russell, James			Lowland forest collapse and early human impacts at the end of the African Humid Period at Lake Edward, equatorial East Africa	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												In Africa, the early Holocene was characterized by wetter, warmer conditions than today, followed by rapid aridification at similar to 5.2 ka. However, a lack of lowland vegetation records has prevented a detailed evaluation of forest response to Holocene climate change. Additionally, although modern vegetation communities are linked to human disturbance, few studies have addressed how prehistoric human activities helped engineer the character of modern African ecosystems. Understanding the architecture of lowland and highland forests is important to prevent further degradation from climate/land-use change. We present an 11,000 yr fossil pollen record from Lake Edward, Uganda. We show that Guineo-Congolian forests dominated the highlands and lowlands in equatorial East Africa in the early Holocene, highlighting the importance of rainfall and temperature in controlling forest communities. These forests remained until similar to 5.2 ka, when the climate became drier. The lacustrine ecosystem response to aridification was abrupt; however, forest decreased gradually, replaced by deciduous woodlands. Woodlands dominated until after an arid period at 2 ka; however, forest did not recover. Increased disturbance indicators and grasses suggest that the arrival of Iron Age people resulted in the modern fire-tolerant vegetation. Although late Holocene climate played a role in vegetation opening, the modern ecosystem architecture in East Africa is linked to early human activities.

Monogenean parasites of sardines in Lake Tanganyika: diversity, origin and intra-specific variability	CONTRIBUTIONS TO ZOOLOGY												Whereas Lake Tanganyika's littoral and benthic zones are famous for their diverse fish communities, its pelagic zone is dominated by few species, of which two representatives of Clupeidae (Limnothrissa miodon and Stolothrissa tanganicae) take a pivotal role. We investigated the monogenean fauna infecting these freshwater clupeids to explore the link between parasite morphology and host species identity, or seasonal and geographical origin, which may reveal host population structure. Furthermore, we conducted phylogenetic analyses to test whether these parasitic flatworms mirror their host species' marine origin. Based on 406 parasite specimens infecting 385 host specimens, two monogenean species of Kapentagyrus Kmentova., Gelnar and Vanhove, gen. nov. were morphologically identified and placed in the phylogeny of Dactylogyridae using three molecular markers. One of the species, Kapentagyrus limnotrissae comb. nov., is host-specific to L. miodon while its congener, which is new to science and described as Kapentagyrus tanganicanus Kmentova, Gelnar and Vanhove, sp. nov., is infecting both clupeid species. Morphometrics of the parasites' hard parts showed intra-specific variability, related to host species identity and seasonality in K. tanganicanus. Significant intra-specific differences in haptor morphometrics between the northern and southern end of Lake Tanganyika were found, and support the potential use of monogeneans as tags for host population structure. Based on phylogenetic inference, we suggest a freshwater origin of the currently known monogenean species infecting clupeids in Africa, with the two species from Lake Tanganyika representing a quite distinct lineage.

Watershed modeling for reducing future non-point source sediment and phosphorus load in the Lake Tana Basin, Ethiopia	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												Agricultural intensification to meet the food needs of the rapidly growing population in developing countries affects water quality. In regions such as the Lake Tana basin, knowledge is lacking on measures to reduce non-point source pollutants in humid tropical monsoon climates. The aim of this paper was, therefore, to develop a non-point model that can predict the placement of practices to reduce the transport of sediment and phosphorus (P) in a (sub) humid watershed. In order to achieve the objective, hydrometeorological, sediment, and P data were collected in the watershed since 2014. The parameter efficient semi-distributed watershed model (PED-WM) was calibrated and validated in the Ethiopian highlands to simulate runoff and associated sediments generated through saturation excess. The P module added to PED-WM was used to predict dissolved (DP) and particulate P (PP) loads aside from discharge and sediment loads of the 700 ha of the Awramba watershed of Lake Tana basin. The PED-WM modules were evaluated using the statistical model performance measuring techniques. The model parameter based prediction of source areas for the non-point source sediment and P was also evaluated spatially and compared with the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) of the watershed. The water balance component of the non-point source model performed well in predicting discharge, sediment, DP, and PP with NSE of 0.7, 0.65, 0.65, and 0.63, respectively. In addition, the predicted discharge followed the hydrograph with insignificant deviation from its pattern due to seasonality. The model predicted a sediment yield of 28.2 t ha(-1) year(-1) and P yield of 9.2 kg ha(-1) year(-1) from Awrmaba. Furthermore, non-point source areas contributed to 2.7 kg ha(-1) year(-1) (29%) of DP at the outlet. The main runoff and sediment source areas identified using PED-WM were the periodically saturated runoff areas. These saturated areas were also the main source for DP and PP transport in the catchment.

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) presents the major carbon pool in lakes, and although the effect of DOM composition on the pelagic microbial community composition is widely accepted, little is known about its effect on BMCs, particularly aquatic fungi. Therefore, we investigated the composition of benthic littoral microbial communities in twenty highly diverse lakes in northeast Germany. DOM quality was analyzed via size exclusion chromatography (SEC), fluorescence parallel factor analyses (PRAFACs) and UV-Vis spectroscopy. We determined the BMC composition and biomass using phospholipid-derived fatty acids (PLFA) and extended the interpretation to the analysis of fungi by applying a Bayesian mixed model. We present evidence that the quality of DOM structures the BMCs, which are dominated by heterotrophic bacteria and show low fungal biomass. The fungal biomass increases when the DOM pool is processed by microorganisms of allochthonous origin, whereas the opposite is true for bacteria. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recent invader or indicator of environmental change? A phylogenetic and ecological study of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in New Zealand	HARMFUL ALGAE												Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii is a diazotrophic and potentially toxic cyanobacterium that was initially thought to be confined to tropical freshwaters. Recently it appears to have expanded its range to more temperate regions of the globe. There are contrasting hypotheses to explain this spread including; dispersal of highly adapted strains or localised spread from warm refuges as climatic or environmental conditions change. C raciborskii was first detected in the isolated island nation of New Zealand in 2003, providing a unique opportunity to explore whether this recent identification is due to a new incursion or resultant from climatic or environmental change. Phylogenetic analysis (nifH, ITS1-L, ITS1-S, and rpoC1) of six strains isolated from two New Zealand lakes showed they were most closely related to those from South America, and suggest that the recent detection of this species was not due to a new incursion. Ten years of environmental data from three lakes (Waaki, Waikare and Whangape) experiencing blooms were analysed to identify potential reasons for recent C raciborskii blooms. This analysis showed that the relatively recent (within the last 20-30 years) collapses of extensive macrophyte stands in lakes Waaki, Waikare and Whangape have resulted in increased turbidity', low water column dissolved reactive phosphorus and seasonal shifts in the dissolved inorganic nitrogen availability, all conditions known to facilitate C raciborskii dominance. Collectively these data indicate that C. raciborskii has always been present in New Zealand, and that recent changes in environmental conditions in these lakes are now facilitating bloom events.

On-farm storage loss estimates of maize in Kenya using community survey methods	JOURNAL OF STORED PRODUCTS RESEARCH												Maize is the most important staple in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), with highly seasonal production. High storage losses affect food security, but good estimations are lacking. A new method using focus group discussions (FGDs) was tested with 121 communities (1439 farmers, 52% women) in Kenya's six maize-growing zones, to estimate the maize losses to storage pests and analyze farmer practices. As control strategies, half of the farmers used chemical pesticides (49%), while hermetic bags (16%) and botanicals (15%) were also popular. Relative loss from weevils in the long rains was estimated at 23%, in the short rains 18%, and annually 21%. Fewer farmers were affected by the larger grain borer (LGB) than by maize weevils: 42% in the long rainy season and 32% in the short rainy season; losses from LGB were also smaller: 19% in the long season, 17% in the short season, and 18% over the year. Total storage loss, from both species combined, was estimated at 36%, or 671,000 tonnes per year. The greatest losses occur in the humid areas, especially the moist mid-altitudes (56%), and with smaller loss in the drylands (20-23%). Extrapolating the point data and overlaying with the maize production map shows the geographic distribution of the losses, with the most important area found around Lake Victoria. FGDs provide convenient and cheap tools to estimate storage losses in representative communities, but a total loss estimate of 36% is higher than is found in other studies, so its accuracy and framing effects need to be assessed. We conclude that storage pests remain a major problem, especially in western Kenya, and that the use of environmentally friendly technologies such as hermetic storage and botanicals needs more attention, both by the public extension service and private agrodealers.					; De Groote, Hugo/C-7525-2009	Muteti, Francisca/0000-0002-4246-3674; De Groote, Hugo/0000-0002-5081-0189													0022-474X	1879-1212				MAY	2023	102								102107	10.1016/j.jspr.2023.102107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2023.102107		MAR 2023						37361490					WOS:000960438900001

Soil erosion by water during the rainy season is a serious problem in the region, leading to declining agricultural production, decreased food security, and a sedimentation risk for water bodies. However, there has been no systematic study of this problem or of possible management solutions. To meet this need, we analyzed soil erosion rates from 1973 to 2006, identified erosion hotspots, and proposed possible soil conservation scenarios. We assessed the soil loss dynamicity using the universal soil-loss equation and geographical information system software, considering the land use change at the following three periods: 1973, 1985 and 2006. We characterized the watershed in terms of the erosion severity, topography, and land use to identify hotspots and proposed, modeled, and evaluated various watershed management scenarios to mitigate the problem. Soil erosion increased markedly from 1973 to 2006, with annual rates of 31, 38, and 56 t ha(-1) in 1973, 1985, and 2006, respectively, as a result of vegetation degradation and particularly the conversion of thousands of hectares of forest or woodland into cropland. The observed soil erosion rates are far from the tolerable rate of soil loss of the country and hence require urgent soil conservation interventions, especially in the hotspot areas. We proposed eight scenarios for reducing soil losses and evaluated their effectiveness. Rehabilitating degraded land (using exclosures and planted vegetation) and installing stone erosion-control structures (stone bund) in cropland reduced the total soil loss by 12.6% and 63.8%, respectively. Treating hotspot areas with annual soil loss of more than 20 t ha(-1) by integrated management (erosion-control structures and exclosures) was the most effective approach, reducing soil loss by 87.8%.

Seasonal dietary shift to zooplankton influences stable isotope ratios and total mercury concentrations in Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.))	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Seasonal dietary shifts by Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)) are common in subarctic lakes, but less is known about how the shift to pelagic zooplankton feeding during the growing season affects stable isotope ratios and mercury concentrations. We sampled Arctic charr, zooplankton and benthic macroinvertebrates from oligotrophic Lake Galggojavri, northern Norway, in June, August and September. Stomach content, age, total length, weight, condition and sex were recorded for all individuals, and liver and muscle tissues were sampled for stable isotope (delta C-13, delta N-15) and total mercury analyses. We predicted that a dietary shift to zooplankton would lead to depleted C-13 and increased mercury levels in charr. Arctic charr consumed benthic prey in June, but shifted to zooplankton feeding in August-September. Stable isotope mixing models revealed increased pelagic reliance towards September. Mercury content in liver increased from June to September, whereas muscle showed opposite trend. In stepwise multiple regression analyses, mercury content in muscle was explained by fish length, month and delta C-13 (R (2) = 0.46), whereas in liver month, delta C-13 and delta N-15 were the main explaining factors (R (2) = 0.69). Seasonal dietary shifts appeared to have an effect on total mercury content in charr, and thus sampling month should be considered when designing future monitoring programmes.

The lake's hydrological regime is complicated by a complex hydraulic connection and strong river-lake interaction, especially for the extreme hydrological regime. This study analyzes the relationships between the lake level changes and the flow regimes of Yangtze River and local catchment during the flood season and employs a physically based hydrodynamic model to quantify their relative contributions to the development of floods. The study found that the large catchment runoff and Yangtze River discharge were both significant contributors to flood development but that their contributions were unevenly distributed in time and space. The local catchment imposed more influence during the period of April-May and at the middle parts of the lake, and its influence decreased toward the north and south; in contrast, the most remarkable lake level changes were observed in July-August and at the northern lake for the Yangtze River cases, and these changes reduced from north to south. Moreover, Yangtze River imposed far stronger influences on the lake level changes than the catchment runoff and dominated the duration of floods to a great extent.

Changes in fire behavior caused by fire exclusion and fuel build-up vary with topography in California montane forests, USA	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Wildfire sizes and proportions burned with high severity effects are increasing in seasonally dry forests, especially in the western USA. A critical need in efforts to restore or maintain these forest ecosystems is to determine where fuel build-up caused by fire exclusion reaches thresholds that compromise resilience to fire. Empirical studies identifying drivers of fire severity patterns in actual wildfires can be confounded by co-variation of vegetation and topography and the stochastic effects of weather and rarely consider long-term changes in fuel caused by fire exclusion. To overcome these limitations, we used a spatially explicit fire model (FlamMap) to compare potential fire behavior by topographic position in Lassen Volcanic National Park (LAVO), California, a large (43,000 ha), mountainous, unlogged landscape with extensive historical and contemporary fuels data. Fuel loads were uniformly distributed and incrementally increased across the landscape, meaning variation in fire behavior within each simulation was due to topography and among simulations, to fuels. We analyzed changes in fire line intensity (FLI) and crown fire potential as surface and canopy fuels increased from historical to contemporary levels and with percentile and actual wildfire weather conditions. Sensitivity to the influence of fuel build-up on fire behavior varied by topographic position. Steep slopes and ridges were most sensitive. At lower surface fuel loads, under pre-exclusion and contemporary canopy conditions, fire behavior was comparable and remained surface-type. As fuels increased, FLI and passive crown fire increased on steep slopes and ridgetops but remained largely unchanged on gentle slopes. Topographic variability in fire behavior was greatest with intermediate fuels. At higher surface fuel loads, under contemporary canopy fuels, passive crown fire dominated all topographic positions. With LAVO's current surface fuels, the area with potential for passive crown fire during actual fire weather increased from 6% pre-exclusion to 34% due to canopy fuel build-up. For topographically diverse landscapes, the results highlight where contemporary fire characteristics are most likely to deviate from historical patterns and may help managers prioritize locations for prescribed burning and managed wildfire to increase fire resilience in fuel rich landscapes.

In this contribution, spatial distributions of dissolved rhenium concentrations along the salinity gradient of a large tropical lagoon (Chilika lagoon (India), an estuary-like feature in the Mahanadi river delta) and their possible source waters have been investigated for three different seasons (pre-monsoon (April-May 2017); monsoon (July-August 2017) and post-monsoon (January 2018)) to quantify sources and internal cycling of Re in coastal settings. Additionally, Re concentrations of macrophytes, and bed and suspended sediments have also been analysed. Biweekly analyses of dissolved Re concentrations of one of the Mahanadi distributaries (Paika river) show significant seasonal variations (1.7 to 12.0 pmol/kg), with an average Re value of 4.5 +/- 2.5 pmol/kg (n = 30). Average salinities of the lagoon were different for the pre-monsoon (11 +/- 6; n = 17), monsoon (8 +/- 7; n = 17) and post-monsoon (4 +/- 3; n = 10) seasons. The salinity-weighted Re concentrations of the Chilika also show variation during the pre-monsoon (similar to 15.5 pmol/kg), monsoon (similar to 14.1 pmol/kg) and post-monsoon (similar to 6.4 pmol/kg) seasons. Co-variation between water salinity and rhenium concentrations show non-conservative Re behaviour in the lagoon. Water samples from all three seasons show the removal of Re from the high-saline regions of the lagoon. Significant correlations of sedimentary Re with Mg and Al concentrations point to adsorptive rhenium removal onto Mg-Al rich clay (montmorillonite and chlorite) surfaces. This proposition also draws support from higher exchangeable-Re content in bulk (similar to 141 pg/g) and clay (similar to 303 pg/g) fractions of Chilika sediments than that of the riverine sediments (similar to 33 pg/g). Further, huge occurrence of biomass in the lagoon, appreciable Re concentrations in macrophytes (428 +/- 259 pg/g, n = 11) and a significant Re-TN (total nitrogen) correlation indicate possible biological uptake of Re by amino acids during cellular membrane formation. Mass balance calculations show about 60% of sedimentary Re are accumulated through clay adsorption, whereas the remaining 40% is scavenged through biological activities. This authigenic Re removal from the Chilika accounts for a burial rate of 5.95 x 10(-3) ng/cm(2)/yr, which is about four times higher than its accumulation onto oxic marine sediments (1.6 x 10(-3) ng/cm(2)/yr) globally. Outcomes of this study identify this new and significant coastal sink for rhenium and hence, warrant the need to revisit the oceanic Re budget to incorporate these removal pathways.

Despite the 2-4 weight percent organic carbon content, oxygen penetrated into the sediment by 3.5 to > 12 cm at all locations. Such deep penetration is explained by low sedimentation rates (0.01-0.04 cm yr(-1)), high solubility of oxygen in freshwater, and a shallow (similar to 2 cm) bioturbation zone. In response mainly to oxygen variations in the bottom waters, the sediment oxygen penetration varied seasonally by as much as several centimeters, suggesting that temporal variability in deeply oxygenated sediments may be greater than previously acknowledged. The oxygen uptake rates (4.4-7.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1), average 6.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and carbon mineralization efficiency (similar to 90% of deposited carbon) were similar to those in marine hemipelagic and pelagic sediments of comparable sedimentation rates. The reactivity of organic carbon was found to decrease with age similarly to the power-law documented in marine environments. The burial flux of carbon into the deep sediment (0.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) was 2.5% of the previously estimated primary production. Maximum volume-specific carbon degradation rates were 0.3-1.5 mmol cm(-3) d(-1); bioturbation coefficient near the sediment surface was 3-8 cm(2) yr(-1). These results indicate that carbon cycling in large freshwater systems conforms to many of the same trends as in marine systems.

Insecticide resistance in Drosophila melanogaster in vineyards and evaluation of alternative insecticides	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												BACKGROUND Cultivation of grapes is a major crop globally, particularly in support of the wine production industry which has significant economic impact in numerous countries. Sour rot is an economically important disease of grapes. It is caused by an interaction of yeast + acetic acid bacteria, and vectored by Drosophila spp. Substantial control of sour rot in wine grape vineyards has been achieved by control of Drosophila using insecticides such as zeta-cypermethrin. An outbreak of sour rot and high populations of Drosophila melanogaster were observed in 2018 in a vineyard in New York (Finger Lakes region), USA. Flies from this population were found to be resistant to zeta-cypermethrin (the active ingredient in Mustang Maxx (R)), but whether or not this was a widespread problem was not known. To determine if resistance was geographically limited, we surveyed populations of D. melanogaster collected from 11 vineyards across New York State and one in Missouri (USA). We also evaluated 19 alternative insecticides for their potential use for control of D. melanogaster, by determining their toxicity to a susceptible strain and by examining cross-resistance using a field-collected population. RESULTS There were high levels of resistance to zeta-cypermethrin, malathion, and acetamiprid found in all populations sampled. Resistance to zeta-cypermethrin and malathion was stable over 33 months. Results from two vineyards also suggested that resistance to spinetoram was starting to evolve. The alternative insecticides we evaluated had LC50 values to the susceptible strain ranging from 0.65 to 15 000 ng center dot cm(-2). CONCLUSION Resistance to zeta-cypermethrin, malathion, and acetamiprid is geographically widespread and the levels of resistance are similar between early season and late season collections. Cross-resistance was detected against all the insecticides tested, with the lowest levels seen for broflanilide, fipronil, and flumethrin. These patterns of resistance/cross-resistance/multiple resistance are discussed in terms of selection within and outside of vineyards. The implications of these results to insecticide resistance monitoring and management are discussed.

The importance of functional responses among competing predators for avian nesting success	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												The relationship between the rate of predation and prey abundance is an important component of predator-prey dynamics. However, functional responses are less straightforward when multiple predators compete for shared prey. Interactions among competing predators can reduce or enhance effects of predation on prey populations. Because many avian populations experience high rates of nest predation, understanding the role of specific predators on nest mortality will lead to more informed conservation and management strategies which attempt to increase productivity by removing certain predators or managing habitat to limit their impact. Our goal was to evaluate effects of specific predators and the influence of nest abundance on nest mortality. We monitored snowy plover Charadrius nivosus nests across 7 years at two study areas in Utah, USA, with remote cameras. We modelled predator-specific hazard rates for nest mortality in a Bayesian framework to assess relationships between competing predators and the role of nest abundance on predator-specific hazard rates. We found that hazard rates for nest mortality by gulls Larus spp. decreased with increasing nest abundance, whereas nest mortality by foxes Vulpes spp. and ravens Corvus corax initially increased, indicating that dietary switching may occur when nests become more abundant. Nest mortalities of specific predators were often not independent and ranged between compensatory (e.g. mammalian mesopredators) and superadditive (e.g. avian predators) across the breeding season. The non-independence between nest mortalities suggests that reductions in some predators may not translate to additive increases in overall nest success. Analyses of cause-specific mortality are rarely applied to avian nests, but examination of interacting impacts among competing predators on nest survival may provide insight into specific drivers of avian population dynamics.

The lake has been facing a serious environmental crisis, due to water mismanagement in the basin. To address this problem, an analysis of the hydrodynamic behavior and of salinity distribution is important. The three-dimensional numerical model MIKE 3 Flow Model FM was employed in this study. Model sensitivity analyses revealed that wind speed, friction coefficient, and vertical eddy viscosity are effective parameters on both flow velocities and salinity distribution, while bottom roughness height has minor effects on surface velocities. Reduced value for vertical eddy viscosity improves the simulation of the velocity field and has an adverse effect on salinity distribution. The UNESCO density function leads to an overestimation of density. Yet, final model results are accurate enough to reproduce the salinity distribution over the lake, revealing that the salinity difference between North and South basins of Lake Urmia increases significantly in the wet season, due to southern rivers inflows by snowmelt. For the simulated periods of 1986-1987 and 2004-2005, natural and man-induced drought hydrological conditions, the direction of flows was from south to north, with a much lower net flow in the latter period. This decrease in the exchanged flows causes higher salinity difference among basins. Results indicate that the present model could be run for any time period in both normal and drought conditions and can satisfactorily simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics and salinity distribution of Lake Urmia for management purposes.

However, there is relatively less understanding of their responses to anthropogenic disturbances such as constructions of dams/tunnels/roads that may significantly affect the aquatic ecosystem. To fill such gap, this study focused on the bacterioplankton communities' diversity and turnover during a tunnel construction across an urban lake (Lake Donghu, Wuhan, China), and five batches of samples were collected within 2months according to the tunnel construction progress. Results indicated that both resources and predator factors contributed significant to the variations of bacterioplankton communities, but the closed area and open areas showed different diversity patterns due to the impacts of tunnel construction. Briefly, the phytoplankton, TN, and TP in water were still significantly correlated with the bacterioplankton composition and diversity like that in normal conditions. Additionally, the organic matter, TN, and NH4-N in sediments also showed clear effects on the bacterioplankton. However, the predator effects on the bacterioplankton in the closed-off construction area mainly derived from large zooplankton (i.e., cladocerans), while small zooplankton such as protozoa and rotifers are only responsible for weak predator effects on the bacterioplankton in the open areas. Further analysis about the ecological driving forces indicated that the bacterioplankton communities' turnover during the tunnel construction was mainly governed by the homogeneous selection due to similar environments within the closed area or the open areas at two different stages. This finding suggests that bacterioplankton communities can quickly adapt to the environmental modifications resulting from tunnel construction activities. This study can also give references to enhance our understanding on bacterioplankton communities' response to ecological and environmental changes due to intensification of construction and urbanization in and around lake ecosystems.

In most inland waterbodies, phycocyanin (PC) concentrations are the best indicator of cyanobacteria distribution. PC has a characteristic absorption peak near 620 nm; however, reflectance at this wavelength is only available from MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) sensors. MERIS stopped providing data after 2012 and OLCI was only recently launched (February 2016). TheModerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra and Aqua is currently the only satellite instrument that can provide well-calibrated top-of-atmosphere radiance data over an extended number of years to the present. In this study, we develop and validate a new approach based on empirical orthogonal function (EOF) to quantify PC concentrations in a turbid inland lake (Lake Chaohu, China). Based on Rayleigh-corrected reflectance data (Rrc) at 469, 555, 645, and 859 nm, the concentrations of PC were estimated by regression of 87 concurrent MODIS-field measurements for bloom and nonbloom conditions. The validation (N = 93) showed R-2 = 0.40 and unbiased RMS = 60.86%. Application of the algorithm from 2000 and 2014 showed spatial distribution patterns and seasonal changes that confirmed in situ and MERIS-based studies of floating algae mats. The spatial information on PC concentrations in Lake Chaohu had a reduced sensitivity to perturbations from thin aerosols and high sediments. This EOF approach allows us for new insights in the long-term dynamics of shallow lakes and reservoirs where having a better understanding of cyanobacterial blooms is important.					ma, rong/GVU-3096-2022; Cao, Zhigang/L-5337-2017; Duan, Hongtao/B-7210-2011; Loiselle, Steven/ABA-3324-2020; Cao, Zhigang/L-5336-2017	Duan, Hongtao/0000-0002-1985-2292; Loiselle, Steven/0000-0001-7414-0389; Cao, Zhigang/0000-0001-5329-2906													1939-1404	2151-1535				OCT	2017	10	10			SI		4430	4444		10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2723079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2723079													WOS:000412626500017
J	Zhu, WB; Yan, JB; Jia, SF				Zhu, Wenbin; Yan, Jiabao; Jia, Shaofeng			Monitoring Recent Fluctuations of the Southern Pool of Lake Chad Using Multiple Remote Sensing Data: Implications for Water Balance Analysis	REMOTE SENSING												The drought episodes in the second half of the 20th century have profoundly modified the state of Lake Chad and investigation of its variations is necessary under the new circumstances. Multiple remote sensing observations were used in this paper to study its variation in the recent 25 years. Unlike previous studies, only the southern pool of Lake Chad (SPLC) was selected as our study area, because it is the only permanent open water area after the serious lake recession in 1973-1975. Four satellite altimetry products were used for water level retrieval and 904 Landsat TM/ETM+ images were used for lake surface area extraction. Based on the water level (L) and surface area (A) retrieved (with coinciding dates), linear regression method was used to retrieve the SPLC's L-A curve, which was then integrated to estimate water volume variations (DV). The results show that the SPLC has been in a relatively stable phase, with a slight increasing trend from 1992 to 2016. On annual average scale, the increase rate of water level, surface area and water volume is 0.5 cm year(-1), 0.14 km(2) year(-1) and 0.007 km(3) year(-1), respectively. As for the intra-annual variations of the SPLC, the seasonal variation amplitude of water level, lake area and water volume is 1.38 m, 38.08 km(2) and 2.00 km(3), respectively. The scatterplots between precipitation and D V indicate that there is a time lag of about one to two months in the response of water volume variations to precipitation, which makes it possible for us to predict D V. The water balance of the SPLC is significantly different from that of the entire Lake Chad. While evaporation accounts for 96% of the lake's total water losses, only 16% of the SPLC's losses are consumed by evaporation, with the other 84% offset by outflow.

Fatty acid composition of Cladocera and Copepoda from lakes of contrasting temperature	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												We studied the fatty acid (FA) composition of six species of Cladocera and six species of Copepoda from five cold-water lakes, situated in the tundra and/or in the mountains, and eight species of Cladocera and four species of Copepoda from eight warm-water lakes (including one reservoir) in temperate regions. We asked whether the contrasting temperature would result primarily simply in changes in the percentages (i.e. percentage of total FAs) and absolute contents (quantities) of the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3, EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA), or whether there are other FAs with various number of double bonds and/or chain lengths which could be responsible for a putative homeoviscous adaptation. We also aimed to reveal any consistent phylogenetic differences in FA percentages and contents between Cladocera and Copepoda, separable from any temperature effects. Both taxa in warm waters had greater percentages of 18:0, and lower percentages of 14:0 and 18:4n-3, than in cold waters, but there were no differences in percentages of DHA. In addition, Cladocera, besides the lower percentage of EPA, had higher percentages of 20:0 and 22:0 in warm waters. These patterns in the percentages of 14:0, 18:0, 18:4n-3, 20:0 and 22:0 are in a good agreement with the hypothesis of homeoviscous adaptation. Thus, the role of EPA, and particularly DHA, as unique regulators of the homeoviscous adaptation of the zooplankton may have been overestimated. Overall, we confirmed the known differences between Cladocera and Copepoda, namely higher percentages of EPA in Cladocera and higher percentages of DHA in Copepoda. However, there was c.50% overlap in the ranges of the percentage of EPA in Cladocera and Copepoda, while the ranges in the content of EPA per unit organic carbon in Cladocera and Copepoda overlapped completely. Differences in the percentages and content of DHA between Cladocera and Copepoda were statistically significant and invariant with temperature, and therefore are probably due to phylogenetic factors, rather than any temperature adaptation. Contrasting temperature was not associated with significant differences in the contents of EPA and DHA per unit of organic carbon within the taxa studied. If this remained the case in a warming climate, such warming would be unlikely to reduce the accumulation of these important PUFAs in the zooplankton, at least if species composition was unchanged. However, if there were shifts in the proportions of Cladocera and Copepoda in the zooplankton, for example fewer copepods as temperature rises, a decrease of the flux of PUFA in the ecosystem is plausible, taking into account the phylogenetic (and temperature invariant) differences in DHA between the two groups.

In many lakes, the population dynamics of the dominant cyanobacteria species follows seasonal shifts. In Lake Dianchi, a plateau lake in China, blooms involve the alternating seasonal succession of two dominant cyanobacteria species, Aphanizomenon and Microcystis. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of five Microcystis strains on a strain of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, all isolated during blooms in Lake Dianchi. We used dialysis tubing involved batch and semi-continuous co-culture bioassays to investigate the interaction between these two genera. Our results revealed that different Microcystis inhibited the growth of A. flos-aquae to various degrees, with the strains Microcystis ichthyoblabe kutz 1313 and Microcystis aeruginosa 905 (Ma905) exhibiting the strongest inhibitory effects. The axenic Ma905 did not differ from a non-axenic strain in the inhibitory effect, demonstrating that the growth inhibitory effects we observed were due to Microcystis rather than bacteria. Filtrate of most Microcystis monoculture in different growth phases had a negligible effect on A. flos-aquae. However, the filtrate of Microcystis viridis 1337 (Mv1337) and Ma905 co-cultured with A. flos-aquae from day 21 and day 28, respectively, exhibited stronger inhibitory effects than did their corresponding monoculture filtrates, suggesting that the allelopathic effect of some Microcystis strains is inducible. Results of experiments using solid phase extraction (SPE) fractions of Microcystis monoculture were similar to those from the dialysis tubing bioassays. The microcystin content of the SPE fractions of Ma905 and Mv1337 from day 28 contained 380 mu g L-1 and 290 mu g L-1 microcystin-LR (MC-LR), respectively. However, a further bioassay with pure MC-LR with concentrations of 250 mu g L-1 and 500 mu g L-1 did not inhibit A. flos-aquae, and further excluded MC-LR as a candidate allelochemical. In summary, our research demonstrates that some Microcystis strains are able to suppress the growth of A. flos-aquae. This finding indicates that allelopathic effects likely play a role in driving the alternating seasonal succession of these dominant cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Dianchi. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Generally, the WSI concentrations were highest at the e-waste site and comparable at the other sites and secondary species (SO42-, NH4+, and NO3-) were dominant components at the three sites. The compositions and seasonal variations of WSIs at the e-waste site were distinct from those in the urban and background areas suggesting significant influence of e-waste recycling on PM2.5 components. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) dominated the HFRs in PM2.5 from the e-waste site, and their concentrations (median = 883 pg/m(3)) were significantly higher than those at the urban (375 pg/m(3)) and background site (52.4 pg/m(3)). However, novel decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) was the primary HFRs in the urban air, with noticeably elevated concentrations (median = 356 pg/m(3)) compared to those in the other two areas (medians = 623 and 5.09 pg/m(3)). The composition profiles of HFRs in the background air followed those in the e-waste areas, with substantial contributions of legacy chemicals. This was explained by the prevailing NE wind, which favored atmospheric transport of HFRs from the e-waste recycling area to the background area. Correlation analysis showed that most HFRs in the urban air are associated with Cl-, implying an industrial emission sources. In the e-waste area, HFRs are associated with organic and elemental carbons (OC and EC) and K+, confirming a common source of e-waste recycling. Significant correlations between HFRs and EC and Cl- in the background air suggest that their occurrence in this region was attributed to both the e-waste and urban areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The MCs (MC-RR+MC-YR+MC-LR) concentration in liver and gut content was highest in phytoplanktivorous fish, followed by omnivorous fish, and was lowest in carnivorous fish; while MCs concentration in muscle was highest in omnivorous fish, followed by phytoplanktivorous fish, and was lowest in carnivorous fish. This is the first study reporting MCs accumulation in the gonad of fish in field. The main uptake of MC-YR in fish seems to be through the gills from the dissolved MCs. The WHO limit for tolerable daily intake was exceeded only in common carp muscle. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Pollution indices (i.e., Enrichment factor, Index of geoaccumulation, sediment quality guidelines, pollution load index, and potential ecological risk index) were applied to ascertain the sediment quality. The distribution pattern of Cr, Zn, and Cd revealed higher concentrations in the northern arm of the estuary and near the industrial regions indicating non-geogenic inputs. The concentration of THg and MeHg exhibited spatial and temporal variations and were higher than the background values. The results showed that higher levels of trace metals were found in the northern part of the Cochin Estuary, which could be attributed to the weak flow and significant input of industrial effluents.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

M.; Domingos, Patricia; Soininen, Janne; Marinho, Marcelo Manzi			Downstream transport processes modulate the effects of environmental heterogeneity on riverine phytoplankton	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Environmental heterogeneity (EH) in space and time promotes niche-partition, which leads to high variation in biological communities, such as in algae. In streams, EH is highly related to the intensity of the water flow and may lead to community variation mainly during the low flow conditions. Despite the wide knowledge on the responses of phytoplankton communities to EH in lentic and semi-lentic systems, studies of riverine phytoplankton community variation are still scarce. Here, we first investigated the relationship between phytoplankton community variation and EH in different courses of the river and between seasons. We expected that under low or intermediate flow conditions, there is a positive correlation between community variation and EH. Alternatively, we did not expect any relationship between EH and community variation under high flow condition because stronger downstream transport would mask environmental filtering. We sampled nine sites monthly (May 2012 to April 2013) in a tropical river of Brazilian Southeast. We calculated EH from abiotic data whereas for community variation, here community distinctiveness (CD), we used Sorensen (CDSor) and Bray-Curtis (CDBray) dissimilarities. Differences in EH, CDSor and CDBray were tested at between-season and among-course levels. We found lower distinctiveness during the dry season when EH was the highest. Contrastingly, phytoplankton CD was the highest even when EH was low during the wet season. We found that this pattern raised from the increasing in individuals dispersal during the wet season, promoting mass effects. Finally, our results thus reject the first hypothesis and show a negative relationship between EH and distinctiveness. However, results support our alternative hypothesis and show that during the wet season, distinctiveness is not driven by EH. These results provide new insights into how EH drives community variation, being useful for both basic research about riverine algal communities and biomonitoring programs using phytoplankton communities as bioindicators.

Solar powered integrated multi sensors to monitor inland lake water quality using statistical data fusion technique with Kalman filter	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												This study proposes a data-driven statistical model using multi sensor fusion and Kalman filtering for real-time water quality assessment in lakes. A recursive estimation technique, the Kalman Filter, is employed to handle uncertainties and enhance computational efficiency. The fusion process integrates data from sensors monitoring parameters like chlorophyll concentration, surface water elevation, temperature, and precipitation, producing Markov features to capture temporal transitions and environmental dynamics. Data synchronization and fusion are achieved through recursive KF methods, enabling real-time adaptive management in response to environmental fluctuations such as seasonal changes, precipitation (6-18%), and evaporation rates (1.2-11.9 mm/day). Over a 30-day evaluation period, the model accurately predicted chlorophyll concentrations, reaching 128 mg/m3\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\hbox {mg}/\hbox {m}<^>{3}$$\end{document} in mid-level inflow regions (3.6 m water elevation) compared to 86 mg/m3\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\hbox {mg}/\hbox {m}<^>{3}$$\end{document} in extreme inflow areas (5.5 m). The integration of Markov feature extraction and eigenvalue estimation enhanced prediction stability and sensitivity, with the KF maintaining computational efficiency at 7.8 ms per computation cycle. The model's accuracy was validated by achieving a residual error of less than 0.05 with minimal noise interference.

Sustainable urban growth and improving urban environments need understanding Urban Heat Island (UHI) causes and finding effective mitigation techniques. This research examines the seasonal deviations in surface temperatures for the UHI effect in Pune, India, focusing on land use patterns and water body cooling. Land use categorization included residential, commercial, industrial, vegetation, and open spaces. The research studied the cooling potential and temperature variance by distance from water bodies in the form of lakes, rivers, and ponds. These aquatic bodies have surface and ambient temperature sensors. Roads, soil, commercial areas, residential areas, industrial areas, and vegetation have all shown increases in NDBI, ranging from 15.84 to 36.45%. Urban regions with heat accumulation and dissipation have been revealed by DEM and contour maps. The research found that the water bodies have a cooling effect on LST till the distance of 350 m. The research finds hotter places and shows how natural features mitigate UHI by analyzing land use patterns and water body cooling. The findings emphasize the significance of green areas and water bodies in urban design and development to improve Pune's climate resilience and inhabitability.

Physical controls on CH4 emissions from a newly flooded subtropical freshwater hydroelectric reservoir: Nam Theun 2	BIOGEOSCIENCES												In the present study, we measured independently CH4 ebullition and diffusion in the footprint of an eddy covariance system (EC) measuring CH4 emissions in the Nam Theun 2 Reservoir, a recently impounded (2008) subtropical hydroelectric reservoir located in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), Southeast Asia. The EC fluxes were very consistent with the sum of the two terms measured independently (diffusive fluxes + ebullition=EC fluxes), indicating that the EC system picked up both diffusive fluxes and ebullition from the reservoir. We showed a diurnal bimodal pattern of CH4 emissions anti-correlated with atmospheric pressure. During daytime, a large atmospheric pressure drop triggers CH4 ebullition (up to 100 mmol m(-2) d(-1)), whereas at night, a more moderate peak of CH4 emissions was recorded. As a consequence, fluxes during daytime were twice as high as during nighttime. Additionally, more than 4800 discrete measurements of CH4 ebullition were performed at a weekly/fortnightly frequency, covering water depths ranging from 0.4 to 16m and various types of flooded ecosystems. Methane ebullition varies significantly seasonally and depends mostly on water level change during the warm dry season, whereas no relationship was observed during the cold dry season. On average, ebullition was 8.5 +/- 10.5 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and ranged from 0 to 201.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1). An artificial neural network (ANN) model could explain up to 46% of seasonal variability of ebullition by considering total static pressure (the sum of hydrostatic and atmospheric pressure), variations in the total static pressure, and bottom temperature as controlling factors. This model allowed extrapolation of CH4 ebullition on the reservoir scale and performance of gap filling over four years. Our results clearly showed a very high seasonality: 50% of the yearly CH4 ebullition occurs within four months of the warm dry season. Overall, ebullition contributed 60-80% of total emissions from the surface of the reservoir (disregarding downstream emissions), suggesting that ebullition is a major pathway in young hydroelectric reservoirs in the tropics.

While numerous studies have documented the changes of the outlet glaciers of the Northern and Southern Patagonia Icefields (NPI/SPI), information about glacier changes in the Patagonian Andes (to the north of the NPI) is much scarcer. Here we present an assessment of area changes for glaciers mainly located in the Palena district of Chile based on glacier inventories for 1985, 2000 and 2011 that were derived from two consecutive Landsat scenes and a digital elevation model. The analysis revealed a dramatic area decline for the largest glaciers and total area loss of 25% from 1985 to 2011. The lower parts of several larger glaciers (>10 km(2)) melted completely. Area loss below 1000 m elevation was 50-100% in both periods, and 374 glaciers out of 1664 disappeared. The number of proglacial lakes increased from 223 to 327 and their area expanded by 11.6 km(2) (59%) between 1985 and 2011. Seasonal snow persisting at high elevations in the 2011 scene was a major obstacle to glacier delineation, so the obtained area change rate of similar to 1% a(-1) over the entire period is a lower-bound estimate. The observed climate trends (e.g. cooling in Puerto Montt) are in contrast to the observed shrinkage.																			0022-1430	1727-5652					2014	60	224					1033	1043		10.3189/2014JoG14J104	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/2014JoG14J104													WOS:000348275000001

In the current research, climatology data, and seasonal coefficient have been used to estimate monthly pan evaporation (E-pan) for 2005-2018 study years at four selected stations of the Urmia Lake basin with Dsa and six selected stations of Gavkhouni basin with Bsk climate categories, in Iran. Estimation of monthly E-pan was performed using data-driven methods such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and gene expression programming (GEP) as well as wavelet-hybrids (WANN, WANFIS, and WGEP). Based on the evaluation criteria, the WGEP model performance was better than the other models in estimating the monthly E-pan. The results indicated that WGEP and ANN are the best and poorest models for all stations without affecting the climate condition of basins. The values of RMSE for WGEP model for stations of Urmia Lake and Gavkhouni basins were varied from 15.839 to 26.727 and 20.651 to 70.318, respectively. Also, the values of RMSE for ANN model for stations of Urmia Lake and Gavkhouni basins were varied from 29.397 to 38.452 and 30.635 to 85.237, respectively. The model's performance was improved as a result of considering the data noise elimination and applying seasonal coefficient to estimate E-pan of various climatic conditions. This study with presenting mathematical equations for estimating monthly Epan has a significant impact on the management and planning of water resources policymakers in the future.

J	Liu, TT; Yang, H				Liu, Tong-tong; Yang, Hong			Different nutrient levels, rather than seasonal changes, significantly affected the spatiotemporal dynamic changes of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in Lake Taihu	WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY												Ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOM) play crucial roles in the degradation of ammonia nitrogen in freshwater lakes. Hence, it is necessary to reveal the spatiotemporal dynamic changes of AOM in freshwater lakes. Here, we conducted a study on the spatial and temporal dynamic changes of AOM in different lake regions under gradient nutrient levels in Lake Taihu, and found that the abundance of AOM had significant spatial changes, while the seasonal changes had relatively little effect on the abundance of AOM. We also found that ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were adapted to freshwater habitats with low nutrient levels, while ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AAOB) had higher abundance in high nutrient level lake regions. Moreover, the amoA gene abundance of AOB was much higher than that of AOA, indicating that AOB was the dominant aerobic ammonia oxidizer in the water of Lake Taihu. In addition, temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen all had a positive effect on AOM, especially AOB; while C- and N-related physicochemical factors had a significant positive effect on AAOB, but exhibited a significant negative correlation with AOA. The community structure of AOM also had obvious spatial changes and Group I.1a, Nitrosomonas and Candidatus Brocadia fulgida were the dominant cluster of AOA, AOB and AAOB, respectively.

Experimental monitored catchments have identified main controlling factors on erosion dynamics, but because of the short time span of the instrumental measurements they do not integrate the complete temporal and spatial variability of these environments. To obtain some long-term series of Mediterranean landscape evolution we propose a novel strategy based on multi-proxy analyses of lake sediments aimed to quantify sediment delivery and erosion dynamics. Karstic lakes in the Iberian Range (Central Spain) provide an opportunity to reconstruct the depositional evolution of the watersheds and to evaluate the response to both, the variable anthropogenic impacts and climate forcings during the last 1000 years. The most significant periods of increased sediment delivery (26-483 T km yr(-1)) in the Iberian Range sites took place during the 15th-161h and 18th-19th centuries as a result of large land use changes and land clearing. Positive synergies between increasing human population and more humid periods led to peaks in sediment deliver during some phases of the Little Ice Age. Recent changes associated with the rural exodus and land abandonment during mid-20th century are more clearly shown in larger watersheds by decreased sediment delivery to the lakes due to the re-vegetation of the landscape (6-200 T km yr(-1)). This new integrated approach based on long-term lake sequences provides a longer perspective of erosion processes in Mediterranean watersheds and validates the main factors identified in monitoring surveys (land cover and surface formations erodibility). In both settings, lakes and experimental catchments, most sediment delivery occurs during flooding events. Measured and reconstructed values show comparable large ranges, underlying the punctuated nature of sediment dynamics in Mediterranean landscapes at decadal and centennial scales.

Analysis of water environment changing trend in Bhagirathi tributary of Ganges in India	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												While determining the quality of water for any water body, low, medium and high values of a parameter stand out to be a very important reference. Moreover, these values are used to decide various design parameters based on scientific aspects and its real applications around the world. In this research, determination of trend of water quality (WQ) status for Bhagirathi River was carried out at two sites, Uttarkashi and Tehri station (Tehri Zero point), for 18 WQ parameters and discharges. Preliminary analysis reveals that all parameter concentrations are below the standard permissible limit. No significant correlation was observed between any parameter with respect to discharge; however, out of 18 parameters, 14 were showing negative correlation indicating groundwater source and geological origin. Moreover, a strong correlation was found between 11 parameters at both sites. Seasonal MannKendall test and Sen's slope method have been used to detect trend and to quantify its magnitude. Increasing trend in the concentration of 7 WQ parameters (Q, EC, K+, Na+, SO42-, BOD and Na%) was observed while decreasing trend was observed for 8 parameters (TA, Ca2+, HCO3-, Mg2+, NO2 + NO3, o-PO43-, DO and TH). Overall, WQ of Bhagirathi River was found to be good and hence is suitable for drinking and life-supporting activities.

J	Nelson, DB; Knohl, A; Sachse, D; Schefulss, E; Kahmen, A				Nelson, Daniel B.; Knohl, Alexander; Sachse, Dirk; Schefulss, Enno; Kahmen, Ansgar			Sources and abundances of leaf waxes in aerosols in central Europe	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Atmospheric transport is an understudied mechanism for leaf wax hydrogen isotope applications that contributes to mobilizing and depositing these compounds on the surface of the Earth. While previous efforts have identified the importance of atmospheric leaf wax deposition in remote marine locations, the processes are not well constrained on land in temperate latitudes where lakes are common and sedimentary leaf wax hydrogen isotope values are an attractive tool for understanding past precipitation changes. This work presents results from a field study that was conducted in 2010 and 2011 at Hainich National Park, Germany in order to evaluate the quantity and sources of leaf waxes in the atmosphere. Aerosols were sampled at approximately weekly intervals inside the forest canopy, and n-alkane distributions and hydrogen isotope values were compared with those from major tree species surrounding the sampling site. Despite sampling in what was expected to be a major production center, the distribution and hydrogen isotope values of atmospheric n-alkanes bore little resemblance to those of the local vegetation. Comparison with local meteorological data and to 10-day and 36-h back air mass trajectories indicated shifting effects of winds and temperature, and that mesoscale transport processes were more important than longrange mechanisms. Back trajectories also highlighted source effects, with easterly winds coinciding with relatively lower leaf wax hydrogen isotope values from more continental regions. These results suggest that leaf wax aerosols average over spatial scales that exceed typical surface catchment areas for small lake systems, even in forested areas, yet that the area over which these compounds are derived is still relatively regional. Depositional fluxes were also estimated in order to assess the potential importance of atmospheric transport to sedimentary archives. Although difficult to constrain, these estimates suggest that atmospheric deposition may be non-negligible for lake systems in cases where inputs from rivers or surface runoff are limited. Together, these observations provide new insights on how leaf waxes from different sources are integrated during aeolian transport and the spatial scales over which these processes occur.

A diatom functional-based approach to assess changing environmental conditions in temporary depressional wetlands	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Functional-based assessments to identify the effects of human-induced disturbances on diatom communities are increasingly used. However, information on the response of functional groups to natural disturbances in temporary depressional wetlands is limited although important for the development of temporary wetland biological assessments. We assessed how diatom life-form and ecological guilds responded to a seasonal hydrological and hydrochemical gradient in three least human-disturbed, temporary depressional wetlands. We assigned species to their respective life-form and ecological guild groups and compared metric composition along the gradient. Overall, temporal variability in alkalinity and ionic composition, essentially Na+, as well as hydrological factors, wetland depth and total relative evapotranspiration (ETo), were good predictors of diatom species and functional group composition. Low profile guilds dominated by pioneer life-forms showed the strongest relationship with higher disturbance levels (i.e. increasing Na+, alkalinity with a decrease in depth). Similarly, the planktonic guild and tube-living, rosette and adnate life-forms dominated at higher disturbance levels whereas the high profile diatoms displayed the reverse trend. Our study shows the effectiveness of functional-based assessments beyond traditional species-based approaches for understanding and predicting community responses to temporal changes in environmental conditions. We also highlight the benefit of using both life-forms and ecological guilds where a broad set of metrics can enhance our understanding of the mechanisms relating diatom composition to environmental stressors and provide signs of underlying ecological processes.

The mean aboveground phytomass C storage is 0.7 kg C m(-2). Estimated landscape SOC storage in the four areas varies between 34.5 and 47.0 kg C m(-2) with LCC (land cover classification) upscaling and 32.5-49.0 kg C m(-2) with soil map upscaling. A nested upscaling approach using a Landsat thematic mapper land cover classification for the surrounding region provides estimates within 5 +/- 5% of the local high-resolution estimates. Permafrost peat plateaus hold the majority of total and frozen SOC, especially in the more southern study areas. Burying of SOC through cryoturbation of O- or A-horizons contributes between 1% and 16% (mean 5%) of total landscape SOC. The effect of active layer deepening and thermokarst expansion on SOC remobilization is modeled for one of the four areas. The active layer thickness dynamics from 1980 to 2099 is modeled using a transient spatially distributed permafrost model and lateral expansion of peat plateau thermokarst lakes is simulated using geographic information system analyses. Active layer deepening is expected to increase the proportion of SOC affected by seasonal thawing from 29% to 58%. A lateral expansion of 30 m would increase the amount of SOC stored in thermokarst lakes/fens from 2% to 22% of all SOC. By the end of this century, active layer deepening will likely affect more SOC than thermokarst expansion, but the SOC stores vulnerable to thermokarst are less decomposed.

Hysteresis effect poses a challenge in model simulation of evaporation (latent heat flux, LE) at hourly or intradaily scales. The hidden mechanisms behind the hysteresis remain unclear, given the diverse reports in various climates, geographical locations, and underlying surfaces. This study took advantage of eddy covariance flux observation over Poyang Lake of China, an ephemeral lake experiencing seasonal shifts from land to water. It depicted the hysteresis behavior of LE to environmental forces for the period from May to July in 2018, a hydrologic transition period from land to water surface. Our results showed obvious clockwise hysteresis loops between LE and water vapor pressure deficit (VPD), surface temperature (Ts), and air temperature (Ta). Counterclockwise loops exhibited between LE and surface net radiation (Rn), wind speed (WS), and temperature difference (Ts-Ta). Rn, WS, and Ts-Ta dominants control the hysteresis effects and regulate LE variations. The hysteresis loops changed in direction, shape, and area when the surface shifted from land to water. It was primarily related to the lengthened lag time between LE and other variables except for WS, which was attributable to enhanced impacts from WS and VPD, and weakened impacts from Rn and Ts-Ta. The findings should help to improve our understanding of the complicated water-atmosphere interactions at the intradaily scale.

Seasonality and physical drivers of deep chlorophyll layers in Lake Superior, with implications for a rapidly warming lake	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A deep chlorophyll layer (DCL) is a common feature of many deep, oligotrophic lakes including Lake Superior. Mechanisms generating and maintaining DCLs are variable across lakes, and seasonal patterns and relationships of DCL structure to physical variables are not well described. Using vertical profile data for physical and biological variables from western and central Lake Superior, we described seasonal patterns in DCL structure and other physical and biological parameters and applied linear mixed-effects models to determine how different physical factors (surface temperature, thermocline depth, and 1% photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) depth) affect the depth, thickness, maximum concentration, and integrated chlorophyll of the DCL. We observed clear seasonal patterns in the development and degradation of the DCL that coincide with seasonal changes in light and temperature. Modeling analysis using linear mixed-effects models showed that the DCL thickness was best predicted by surface temperature (R-2 = 0.51) followed by thermocline depth (R-2 = 0.36), and the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) concentration was best predicted by surface temperature (R-2 = 0.26). The 1% PAR depth was not implicated as an important predictor, but observations from seasonal data suggest that it plays a role in the depth of the DCM. While no relationship was found between surface temperature and DCL-integrated chlorophyll, DCL thickness decreased and DCM concentration increased with increasing surface temperature, which could have implications for productivity in the DCL as the lake continues to warm.

Landscape changes in avulsive river systems: Case study of Taquari River on Brazilian Pantanal wetlands	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The Pantanal is an important active sedimentary basin in central South America where highly diverse flora and fauna are sustained by seasonal floods. Intense land use in the catchment areas enhanced sediment load and destabilized avulsive river systems in the plains. A well-known avulsion in the Taquari River during the 1980-90s, called "Ze da Costa", has shifted the river mouth and drastically changed the nearby landscapes, making them difficult to map because of the hard access and the large variations in spectral and spatial attributes of raster data like Landsat images. Therefore, we developed a useful method to map and explore landscape changes in "Ze da Costa" avulsion that combines geotagged field pictures, randomly selected high-resolution orbital truths, normalized difference vegetation index, digital elevation models, linear spectral mixture models and Landsat historical imagery in pixel-based and object-oriented supervised classifications. We found that bands in green, red, and near-infrared spectra provide better mapping results with object-oriented algorithms for deriving and studying temporal dry/wet ratio dynamics. The temporal analyses of the dry/wet ratio showed that avulsions in the Taquari River have the potential to change permanently the "Ze da Costa" area into a dry landscape, making it susceptible for land use (deforestation and fire), except areas seasonally inundated by the floods of the Paraguay River. Overall, our method might be also useful for long-term studies of land use and climate change in avulsive rivers in wetlands around the world. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluated the relative influence of terrestrial ecosystem state factors, anthropogenic gradients, and aquatic habitat variables on patterns of N concentration in streams and rivers across Sweden. We analyzed data from 115 national monitoring stations distributed along a 1,300 km latitudinal gradient, draining catchments that differed by more than 10 A degrees C in mean annual temperature (MAT), and more than five orders of magnitude in area. Regional trends in total organic nitrogen (TON) and carbon:nitrogen (C:N) were closely linked to broad-scale gradients in state factors (e.g., MAT), reflecting the importance of long-term ecosystem development on terrestrial organic matter accrual and export. In contrast, trends in nitrate (NO3 (-)), the dominant form of inorganic N, were largely unrelated to state factors, but instead were closely connected to gradients related to anthropogenic inputs (e.g., agricultural cover). Despite large differences in drainage size and cover by lakes and wetlands among sites, these descriptors of the aquatic environment had little influence on spatial patterns of N chemistry. The temporal variability in N concentrations also differed between forms: inorganic N was strongly seasonal, with peaks during dormant periods that underscore biotic control over terrestrial losses of limiting resources. Organic N showed comparatively weaker seasonality, but summertime increases suggest temperature-driven patterns of soil TON production and export-temporal signals which were modified by variables that govern water residence time within catchments. Unique combinations of regional predictors reflect basic differences in the cycling of organic versus inorganic N and highlight variation in the sensitivity of these different N forms to environmental changes that directly alter inputs of resources, or indirectly modify terrestrial ecosystems through shifts in species composition, rates of forest productivity, soil development, and hydrologic routing.

Insecticide resistance is increasing, and alternative methods of vector control are needed. The objectives of this study were to determine the blood meal origins and the susceptibility to insecticides of An. arabiensis from Chano village near Arba Minch in South-West Ethiopia. Methods: Blood meal sources of anopheline mosquitoes collected using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps and pyrethrum spray catches (PSC) from human dwellings, and hand-held mouth aspirators from outdoor pit shelters were analysed using a direct enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The susceptibility of An. arabiensis to pyrethroid insecticides (alphacypermethrin, lambdacyhalothrin, deltamethrin, and cyfluthrin) and DDT was assessed using females reared from larval and pupal collections from natural breeding sites. Results: The blood meal origins of 2967 freshly fed Anopheles mosquitoes were determined. An. arabiensis was the predominant species (75%), and it fed mainly on cattle. The densities of both freshly fed An. arabiensis and those fed on human blood followed similar seasonal patterns. The overall human blood index (HBI) of An. arabiensis, including mixed blood meals, was 44% and the bovine blood index (BBI) was 69%. The HBI of An. arabiensis from CDC light trap collections was 75% and this was higher than those for PSC (38%) and outdoor pit shelter collections (13%), while the BBI was 65% for PSC, 68% for outdoor pit shelters and 72% for CDC light traps. More freshly fed and human blood-fed An. arabiensis were sampled from houses close to the shore of Lake Abaya (the major breeding site). A high proportion of An. arabiensis was resistant to the pyrethroid insecticides, with a mortality rate of 56% for lambdacyhalothrin, 50% for cyfluthrin and alphacypermethrin, 47% for deltamethrin, and 10% for DDT. Conclusion: Anopheles arabiensis is the predominant species of anopheline mosquito in this region, and cattle are the main source of its blood meals. The greater tendency of this species to feed on cattle justifies the application of insecticides on cattle to control it. However, An. arabiensis has already developed resistance to the available pyrethroid insecticides, and alternative insecticides are needed for malaria vector control.					; Lindtjorn, Bernt/K-9465-2018; Massebo, Fekadu/CAG-5111-2022	Lindtjorn, Bernt/0000-0002-6267-6984; 													1756-3305					FEB 22	2013	6								44	10.1186/1756-3305-6-44	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-6-44								23433306					WOS:000316620800001

Hence, hydrological regime changes and potential human-induced impacts have been drawing increasing attention from local government and hydrologists. This study investigates hydrological regime changes in the natural and measured runoff series at four hydrological stations on the main Wei River and quantifies features of their long-term change by analysing their historical annual and seasonal runoff data using several approaches, i.e., continuous wavelet transform, cross-wavelet, wavelet coherence, trend-free pre-whitening Mann-Kendall test and detrended fluctuation analysis. By contrasting two different analysis results between natural and measured river runoff series, the impacts of human activities on the long-term hydrological regime were investigated via the changes of spatio-temporal distribution in dominant periods, the trends and long-range memory of river runoff. The results show : (a) that periodic properties of the streamflow changes are the result of climate, referring to precipitation changes in particular, while human activities play a minor role; (b) a significant decreasing trend can be observed in the natural streamflow series along the entire main stream of the Wei River and the more serious decrease emerging in measured flow should result from human-induced influences in recent decades; and (c) continuous decreasing streamflow in the Wei River will trigger serious shortages of freshwater in the future, which may challenge the sustainability and safety of water resources development in the river basin, and should be paid great attention before 2020.

To prevent and control water inrush disasters, it is imperative to investigate the characteristics and mechanizations of overburden failure under the combined effect of gully terrain and repeated mining in coal seams. This study takes multiseam mining within the gully region of the Xiqu Coal Mine as a case study. The comprehensive analytical method that integrates surface exploration, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurement, numerical simulation, and rainfall-runoff analysis, is used to anatomize the entire process of overburden failure induced by downward multiseam mining and the accumulation process of runoff in the gully region. The results reveal that compared to single-seam mining activities, repeated mining and the occurrence of key stratum (KS) structure failure triggered the comprehensive subsidence of the interburden, producing a cutting-type fracture and stepped subsidence, while the overburden exhibited severe damage. Compared to gentle surface topography, gully slopes are prone to shear sliding under the effects of mining subsidence and gravity, resulting in the connection of the downward cracks of the slope and the upward cracks of the overburden. In addition, if the accumulation formed by gully landslides due to repeated mining blocks the river channel and forms a barrier lake during the flood season, it may cause a surge in underground water. High-precision terrain synthesized by UAV tilt photogrammetry is used to simulate the rainfall inundation range and time of different durations during the "100-year return period" rainstorm in the study area. This study proposes a zoning prevention and control method for surface runoff disasters based upon the characteristics of surface deformation and surface inundation time; this method involves filling surface cracks in runoff areas and submerged and crack development areas, implementing slope cutting and control in potential landslide areas, and strengthening the riverbed in submerged and maximum settlement areas.

Through extensive sampling, a total of 109 zooplanktonic taxa were identified and quantified. The average zooplankton abundance was found to be 60 individuals per liter, with copepods and rotifers being the most dominant groups, comprising 68.1% and 29.1% of the total abundance, respectively. The key factor identified as driving the structure of the zooplanktonic assemblages was salinity, which showed significant seasonal variation. The results revealed that during the high water period, when the lagoon was filled with fresh water, rotifers were dominant, zooplanktonic diversity was highest, and abundances were quite high. Conversely, during the low water period, when the lagoon was characterized by brackish water, diversity was minimal, and abundance decreased slightly. The study also found that some areas of the lagoon showed high abundances independent of salinity levels, suggesting that other factors such as riverine inputs or the presence of acadjas (home-made brush parks used as fish traps) may also have notable effects on the zooplankton community. Overall, the findings of this study provide valuable insights into the functioning of one of the most biologically productive lagoons in West Africa.					; Djihouessi, Metogbe/O-6630-2019; Azémar, Frédéric/A-9041-2010; Azemar, Frederic/A-9041-2010; DOSSOU-SOGNON, Fridolin/HJZ-4215-2023; Chaigneau, Alexis/E-4324-2010	OUINSOU, Francois T./0000-0003-2821-4599; Djihouessi, Metogbe/0000-0002-4893-983X; OKPEITCHA, Olaegbe Victor/0000-0003-4411-1629; Azemar, Frederic/0000-0002-3098-8676; DOSSOU-SOGNON, Fridolin Ubald/0000-0003-2871-7022; chaigneau, alexis/0000-0001-6770-0114														2077-1312				MAR	2023	11	3							556	10.3390/jmse11030556	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jmse11030556													WOS:000956508500001

For monitoring freshwater, satellite remote sensing is efficient and has large-scale application. This study proposed a modified model of the quasi-analytical algorithm (Z(SD)-QAAv6m) to retrieve the water clarity of inland waters (>1 km(2)) across Hainan Island, China using Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument data. By adjusting the threshold of R-rs(665), the proposed model could accurately estimate water clarity with diverse optical properties on the island and avoid underestimation in moderately clear waters. Based upon this, the first spatiotemporal analysis of recent water clarity in Hainan Island was conducted. The results show that lake water clarity in the central region was generally higher (with average value of 1.4 m) than that of coastal regions (with average value of 1.2 m). Seasonally, the water clarity during the wet season was usually lower than that in the dry season, with average values of 1.1 m and 1.3 m across the island respectively. From 2017 to 2021, the proportion of water bodies with water clarity > 0.5 m increased from 60% to 100%. The overall spatial pattern of water clarity was correlated to the regional vegetation cover in Hainan Island, with higher clarity associated with higher vegetation cover in the central regions. The seasonal variation of water clarity may be attributed to heavy rainfall and runoff during the wet season; while the distinct annual variation may be benefited from the strengthened surface water protections in Hainan Province in recent years. This study provides a practical approach for evaluating the SDG 6.3.2 indicator in Hainan Island using remote sensed water clarity as a comprehensive water quality indicator and the findings could facilitate the island's water resource management and conservation.					; Zhang, Wenzhi/S-3658-2018; Shi, Jiankang/JFJ-7278-2023	li, jun sheng/0000-0002-8590-9736; Zhang, Fangfang/0000-0002-9628-1817; 														2072-4292				MAR	2023	15	6							1600	10.3390/rs15061600	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15061600													WOS:000958579800001

However, these field measurements can be used in the pCO(2) remote sensing modeling and verification. By focusing on inland waters (including lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and streams), this paper reviews the temporal and spatial variability of pCO(2) based on published data. The results indicate the significant daily and seasonal variations in pCO(2) in lakes. Rivers and streams contain higher pCO(2) than lakes and reservoirs in the same climatic zone, and tropical waters typically exhibit higher pCO(2) than temperate, boreal, and arctic waters. Due to the temporal and spatial variations of pCO(2), it can differ in different inland water types in the same space-time. The estimation of CO2 fluxes in global inland waters showed large uncertainties with a range of 1.40-3.28 Pg C y(-1). This paper also reviews existing remote sensing models/algorithms used for estimating pCO(2) in sea and coastal waters and presents some perspectives and challenges of pCO(2) estimation in inland waters using remote sensing for future studies. To overcome the uncertainties of pCO(2) and CO2 emissions from inland waters at the global scale, more reliable and universal pCO(2) remote sensing models/algorithms will be needed for mapping the long-term and large-scale pCO(2) variations for inland waters. The development of inverse models based on dissolved biogeochemical processes and the machine learning algorithm based on measurement data might be more applicable over longer periods and across larger spatial scales. In addition, it should be noted that the remote sensing-retrieved pCO(2)/the CO2 concentration values are the instantaneous values at the satellite transit time. A major technical challenge is in the methodology to transform the retrieved pCO(2) values on time scales from instant to days/months, which will need further investigations. Understanding the interrelated control and influence processes closely related to pCO(2) in the inland waters (including the biological activities, physical mixing, a thermodynamic process, and the air-water gas exchange) is the key to achieving remote sensing models/algorithms of pCO(2) in inland waters. This review should be useful for a general understanding of the role of inland waters in the global carbon cycle.

In this study, the water, sediments, soils and agricultural product samples were collected in the Huangshui River basin, and contents of the PFCs and values of water parameters were determined. This study investigated dominantly regulating factors of the distribution of PFCs in the water emphatically, explored the sources and assessed potential risks of the PFCs integrally. The results showed that perfluorohexanesulfonic acid, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid presented high maximum concentrations of 3207.42, 3015.96, 1941.89 and 826.4 ng L-1 in the water, respectively. There were 12 PFCs detected in crops, with the maximum concentration of 5206.86 ng g-1 for PFBA. The significantly positive correlation (p < 0.05) was observed between the concentrations of PFBA in crops and that in adjacent rivers, indicating that the irrigation most likely contributed to the accumulation of PFBA in the studied crops. The occurrence of the PFCs in the water during the dry season was dominantly regulated by fluorescent dissolved organic matters via the hydrophobic interaction, while it was primarily regulated by the total nitrogen and electrical conductivity via electrostatic interaction during the wet season. The PFCs in the water were mainly from the wastewater discharged from wastewater treatment plants and carpet factories, while the resuspension of the PFCs in sediments was also an important contribution especially in wet season. The PFCs in the river has posed sustained risk to the public health, especially children.					wang, jiaqi/HGF-2290-2022	Wei, Zhuo/0000-0001-7227-8851; Zhang, Guixiang/0000-0003-1673-6728													0147-6513	1090-2414				DEC 25	2021	228								113043	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.113043	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2021.113043		DEC 2021						34863078					WOS:000740097900006

Environmental stability and lake zooplankton diversity - contrasting effects of chemical and thermal variability	ECOLOGY LETTERS												P>Environmental variability in space and time is a primary mechanism allowing species that share resources to coexist. Fluctuating conditions are a double edged sword for diversity, either promoting coexistence through temporal niche partitioning or excluding species by stochastic extinctions. The net effect of environmental variation on diversity is largely unknown. We examined the association between zooplankton species richness in lakes and environmental variability on interannual, seasonal and shorter time scales, as well as long-term average conditions. We analyzed data on physical, chemical and biological limnology in 53 temperate zone lakes in North America and Europe sampled over a combined 1042 years. Large fluctuations in pH, phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon concentration on different time scales were associated with reduced zooplankton species richness. More species were found in lakes that showed greater temperature variation on all time scales. Environmental variability on different time scales showed similar or, in some cases, stronger associations with zooplankton species richness compared with long-term average conditions. Our results suggest that temporal fluctuations in the chemical environment tend to exclude zooplankton species while temperature variability promotes greater richness. The results indicate that anthropogenic increases in temporal variability of future climates may have profound effects on biodiversity.

Only about 1,000 of these constitute between 80 and 99% of the total microbial community, depending on the season, whereas the remaining species are rare. The functioning and resilience of the lake ecosystem depend on these microorganisms, and it is therefore important to understand their dynamics throughout the year. We propose a two-layered set of dynamic mathematical models that capture and interpret the yearly abundance patterns of the species within the metapopulation. The first layer analyzes the interactions between 14 subcommunities (SCs) that peak at different times of the year and together contain all species whereas the second layer focuses on interactions between individual species and SCs. Each SC contains species from numerous families, genera, and phyla in strikingly different abundances. The dynamic models quantify the importance of environmental factors in shaping the dynamics of the lake's metapopulation and reveal positive or negative interactions between species and SCs. Three environmental factors, namely temperature, ammonia/phosphorus, and nitrate+nitrite, positively affect almost all SCs, whereas by far the most interactions between SCs are inhibitory. As far as the interactions can be independently validated, they are supported by literature information. The models are quite robust and permit predictions of species abundances over many years both, under the assumption that conditions do not change drastically, or in response to environmental perturbations.

David			Shrinking ponds in subarctic Alaska based on 1950-2002 remotely sensed images	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Over the past 50 years, Alaska has experienced a warming climate with longer growing seasons, increased potential evapotranspiration, and permafrost warming. Research from the Seward Peninsula and Kenai Peninsula has demonstrated a substantial landscape-level trend in the reduction of surface water and number of closed-basin ponds. We investigated whether this drying trend occurred at nine other regions throughout Alaska. One study region was from the Arctic Coastal Plain where deep permafrost occurs continuously across the landscape. The other eight study regions were from the boreal forest regions where discontinuous permafrost occurs. Mean annual precipitation across the study regions ranged from 100 to over 700 mm yr(-1). We used remotely sensed imagery from the 1950s to 2002 to inventory over 10,000 closed-basin ponds from at least three periods from this time span. We found a reduction in the area and number of shallow, closed-basin ponds for all boreal regions. In contrast, the Arctic Coastal Plain region had negligible change in the area of closed-basin ponds. Since the 1950s, surface water area of closed-basin ponds included in this analysis decreased by 31 to 4 percent, and the total number of closed-basin ponds surveyed within each study region decreased from 54 to 5 percent. There was a significant increasing trend in annual mean temperature and potential evapotranspiration since the 1950s for all study regions. There was no significant trend in annual precipitation during the same period. The regional trend of shrinking ponds may be due to increased drainage as permafrost warms, or increased evapotranspiration during a warmer and extended growing season.																			2169-8953	2169-8961				OCT 10	2006	111	G4							G04002	10.1029/2005JG000150	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005JG000150													WOS:000241297700001

We report here the evaporitic precipitation in the shallow, small lakes (puquios) at the Salar de Llamara (Atacama Desert, northern Chile). We have used a combination of in situ/laboratory/modeling methodologies allowing for the definition of a detailed, in-depth model for the sequence of evaporitic precipitation in the puquios. The in situ measurements in these ponds reveal that brines are density-stratified with important gradients in salinity, temperature, and other properties of the solution (pH, oxidation/reduction potential, and dissolved oxygen). These vertical gradients, along with the lateral and seasonal variations, are the main factors of chemical variability controlling the precipitation processes. The evaporation of these brines drives the chemical evolution of the different ions and produces two distinct mineral assemblages: (i) large structures made of millimetric to centrimetric-size crystals of gypsum often forming thrombolite-like or stromatolite-like morphologies in the ponds and (ii) salt crusts made of mainly gypsum, eugsterite, halite, and thenardite surrounding the ponds. Evaporation experiments in the laboratory monitored by in situ X-ray diffraction and optical videomicroscopy reveal a precipitation sequence in accordance with field observations but distinct from the thermodynamically predicted precipitation. The actual formation of eugsterite, rather than glauberite, and the observed delay in gypsum dissolution are explained using kinetic evaporation models.

J	Brezinová, T; Vymazal, J				Brezinova, Tereza; Vymazal, Jan			Evaluation of heavy metals seasonal accumulation in Phalaris arundinacea in a constructed treatment wetland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Constructed wetland for treatment of municipal wastewater was studied with focus on seasonal dynamics of heavy metals in the aboveground biomass of Phalaris arundinacea. Aboveground biomass was harvested and evaluated in one or two-month intervals during the period May 2011-March 2012 and concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn were determined. Using the heavy metal concentration and biomass values, accumulation as standing stock was calculated for each heavy metal. The results indicated that maximum standing stock values occurred at different time for each heavy metals. The results therefore revealed that it is not easy to set the optimum time for aboveground biomass harvest in order to remove maximum of all heavy metals at one time. However, it seems that the harvest during the early growing season may be the most effective. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Weyhenmeyer, GA; Karlsson, J				Weyhenmeyer, Gesa A.; Karlsson, Jan			Nonlinear response of dissolved organic carbon concentrations in boreal lakes to increasing temperatures	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Recent increases in concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in lakes and rivers over large regions have been related to both changes in the climate and in atmospheric deposition chemistry. Using a data set of 1041 boreal lakes along a 13 degrees latitudinal gradient, sampled in 1995, 2000, and 2005, and an additional data set of 90 lakes along a 1000-m altitudinal gradient at 68 degrees N, we show that DOC concentrations increase in a nonlinear way along a latitudinal and altitudinal temperature gradient. The nonlinear relation of DOC to increasing temperatures was consistent over space and time. Out of 14 meteorological, catchment, morphometric, and atmospheric deposition variables tested, the variable best explaining this kind of nonlinear pattern was the number of days when air temperatures exceeded 0 degrees C, i.e., the duration of the main growing and runoff season (D-T>0). Using D-T>0 as an input variable, we were able to predict the nonlinear temperature response of DOC concentrations, both spatially (R-2 = 0.90, p < 0.0001) and temporally (R-2 = 0.90, p < 0.0001). D-T>0 has an advantage over other variables because it includes the time factor, which is decisive for the duration that biogeochemical processes can take place. We suggest that DOC concentrations in lakes are influenced by climate change and that present temperature increases over Sweden result in an accelerated DOC increase toward warmer geographical regions.

Modelling climate change impacts on the flood pulse in the Lower Mekong floodplains	JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE												The flood pulse is a key element characterizing the hydrology of the Mekong River and driving the high ecosystem productivity in the Lower Mekong floodplains, both in the Cambodian lowlands and the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. This paper assesses the impacts of climate change, both in terms of changed basin water balance and sea level rise, on the Lower Mekong flood pulse. The impacts were simulated by a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model using the projected changes in sea level and the Mekong mainstream discharge under the influence of climate change as boundary conditions. The model simulations projected that average and maximum water levels and flood duration increase in 2010-2049. The most consistent and notable changes occurred in the average and dry hydrological years. Sea level rise had the greatest effects in the Mekong Delta, whereas the impacts of changed basin water balance were more notable in the upper areas of the Mekong floodplains. The projected impacts were mostly opposite to those resulting from regional water infrastructure development. Higher and longer flooding could cause damage to crops, infrastructure and floodplain vegetation, and decrease the fertile land area. On the other hand, it might boost ecosystem productivity and enhance dry season water availability.

The roles of environmental filtering and spatial processes in shaping phytoplankton metacommunity in Tibetan floodplain ecosystems under various hydrological conditions are still unclear. Here, multivariate statistics and a null model approach were used to compare the spatiotemporal patterns and assembly processes of phytoplankton communities in the river-oxbow lake system of Tibetan Plateau floodplain between non-flood and flood periods. The results showed that phytoplankton communities had significant seasonal and habitat variations, with the seasonal variations being more remarkable. Phytoplankton density, biomass, and alpha diversity were distinctly lower in the flood than non-flood period. The habitat differences (rivers vs. oxbow lakes) in phytoplankton community were less pronounced during the flood than non-flood period, most likely due to the increased hydrological connectivity. There was a significant distance-decay relationship only in lotic phytoplankton communities, and such relationship was stronger in the non-flood than flood period. Variation partitioning and PER-SIMPER analysis showed that the relative role of environmental filtering and spatial processes affecting phytoplankton assemblages varied across hydrological periods, with environmental filtering dominating in the non-flood period and spatial processes in the flood period. These results suggest that the flow regime plays a key role in balancing environmental and spatial factors in shaping phytoplankton communities. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of ecological phenomena in highland floodplains and provides a theoretical basis for floodplain ecosystem maintenance and ecological health management.

Some pigments act as bio-markers and are important for separation of phytoplankton functional types. Among many efforts that have been made to obtain information on phytoplankton pigments from bio-optical properties, Gaussian curves decomposed from phytoplankton absorption spectrum have been used to represent the light absorption of different pigments. We incorporated the Gaussian scheme into a semi-analytical model and obtained the Gaussian curves from remote sensing reflectance. In this study, a series of sensitivity tests were conducted to explore the potential of obtaining the Gaussian curves from multi-spectral satellite remote sensing. Results showed that the Gaussian curves can be retrieved with 35% or less mean unbiased absolute percentage differences from MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-like sensors. Further, using Lake Erie as an example, the spatial distribution of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations were obtained from the Gaussian curves and used as metrics for the spatial extent of an intense cyanobacterial bloom occurred in Lake Erie in 2014. The seasonal variations of Gaussian absorption properties in 2011 were further obtained from MERIS imagery. This study shows that it is feasible to obtain Gaussian curves from multi-spectral satellite remote sensing data, and the obtained chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations from these Gaussian peak heights demonstrated potential application to monitor harmful algal blooms (HABs) and identification of phytoplankton groups from satellite ocean color remote sensing semi-analytically.

J	Wang, Q; Kelly, BC				Wang, Qian; Kelly, Barry C.			Occurrence and distribution of halogenated flame retardants in an urban watershed: Comparison to polychlorinated biphenyls and organochlorine pesticides	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Due to restrictions on polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), market demand for alternative flame retardants is projected to increase, worldwide. Information regarding the environmental behavior of these compounds is limited. The present study involved field measurements of several alternative halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), along with PBDEs and legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPS) in surface water, bottom sediments and suspended particulate matter (SPM) within a highly urbanized watershed in Singapore. Several alternative HFRs were detected in water and sediments. Dechlornane Plus stereoisomers (syn- and anti-DP) were detected in all samples, exhibiting relatively high concentrations in water, sediments and SPM. The maximum syn-DP concentrations in water, sediments and SPM were 24.30 ng/L, 2.48 ng/g dry wt. and 7774 ng/g dry wt., respectively. 1,2-Bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), pentabromotoluene (PBT), hexabromobenzene (HxBBz) and tetrabromoethylcyclohexane (TBECH) were routinely detected. PBDE concentrations were relatively low and often non-detectable. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations ranged from 0.017 to 8.37 ng/L in water, 9.86-27.92 ng/g dry wt. in SPM, and 6.48-212.3 ng/g dry wt. in sediments. Congener and isomer patterns suggested no recent inputs of PBDEs or dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). Rainfall was found to be an important factor influencing temporal and spatial patterns of DPs, BTBPE, PBDEs and some organochlorines in surface water. Land use index was found to be important for several organochlorines, but not HFRs. The observed sediment-water partitioning behavior of the studied HFRs and legacy POPs was highly dependent on chemical hydrophobicity. The data demonstrate that the studied HFRs have a relatively high affinity for SPM and bottom sediments. For example, the log K-OC,K-OBS for TBECH, syn-DP and anti-DP and BTBPE in bottom sediments ranged between 8.1 and 9.6. The findings will aid future studies regarding fate, transport and bioaccumulation of these current-use contaminants of concern. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Study focus: The surface water area (SWA) of the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) has changed significantly due to intensified human interferences. But no study investigated the variations in different water types and its drivers yet. To figure out the long-term changes in water bodies and the underlying driving forces, an improved method based on satellite data was developed to accurately delineate the seasonal SWA of the YRB from 1990 to 2020. Changes in different categories (reservoirs, lakes, and rivers) of water bodies are discriminated and attributed to various climatic and anthropogenic factors. New hydrological insights for the region: Trend of the total SWA in the YRB was non-significant, but obvious changes happened at sub-basin scale. The SWA in the source region and upper reaches demonstrated an upward trend, while a decline was observed in the middle and lower reaches. The increase is largely attributed to reservoir changes (70 %). While, the decreases are attributed to changes in lakes (45 %) and rivers (55 %). Attribution analysis reveals that climatic factors primarily drive the SWA changes in the source region (74 %), while human activities play a more substantial role in the upper reaches (64 %). For the middle and lower reaches, climate and human activities have equally influences. This study shed light on the significant impact of human activities on the redistribution of SWA.

However, this remains challenging due to insufficient accuracies of existing process-based models for fully depicting anthropogenic activities as part of the hydrological cycle. To this end, this study enhances a national-scale coupled land surface-hydrologic-hydrodynamic model (CLHMS) with a dynamic irrigation scheme for distinct crops, an extended reservoir operation scheme incorporating both water storage anomalies and water demand anomalies, and a cost-function-based approach to link water demands with reservoir operation. The enhanced model is extensively validated against historical streamflow, water storage of 90 reservoirs, and irrigation water withdrawal in the YRB, and the water level and storage of the Poyang Lake (PYL). By setting up controlled experiments in the YRB, we show that the streamflow decreases by 2%-6% due to irrigation and water withdrawal, and manifests an attenuated seasonality due to reservoir operation. At the basin scale, the increasing trend of extreme flood peaks exhibits a reversal under human activities, with the flood mitigation effect of irrigation and water withdrawal accounting for up to 50% of that of reservoir operation. The hydrodynamics of the PYL also exhibits considerable human-induced alterations, with a 1.79 m-decrease in the water level at the end of flood season. Our study sheds light on quantifying anthropogenic hydrologic impacts at basin scales, with important implications for understanding the co-evolution between anthropogenic activities and the hydrological cycle.

Therefore, the geometry and evolution of moulins has the potential to influence subglacial water pressure variations, ice motion, and the runoff hydrograph delivered to the ocean. We develop the Moulin Shape (MouSh) model, a time-evolving model of moulin geometry. MouSh models ice deformation around a moulin using both viscous and elastic rheologies and melting within the moulin through heat dissipation from turbulent water flow, both above and below the water line. We force MouSh with idealized and realistic surface melt inputs. Our results show that, under realistic surface melt inputs, variations in surface melt change the geometry of a moulin by approximately 10 % daily and over 100 % seasonally. These size variations cause observable differences in moulin water storage capacity and moulin water levels compared to a static, cylindrical moulin. Our results suggest that moulins are important storage reservoirs for meltwater, with storage capacity and water levels varying over multiple timescales. Implementing realistic moulin geometry within subglacial hydrologic models may therefore improve the representation of subglacial pressures, especially over seasonal periods or in regions where overburden pressures are high.					; Andrews, Lauren/D-8274-2017	Poinar, Kristin/0000-0002-1386-9659; 													1994-0416	1994-0424				JUN 23	2022	16	6					2421	2448		10.5194/tc-16-2421-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-2421-2022													WOS:000814520900001
J	Liu, Y; Chen, HP				Liu, Yong; Chen, Huopo			Future warming accelerates lake variations inthe Tibetan Plateau	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Mounting evidence suggests that lakes in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) have been exposed to the dangers of climate warming. However, rare studies have been devoted to quantitatively estimating the contribution of climate warming to changes in lake ice phenology and lake expansion. Our results reveal a warmer future will further shorten lake ice duration in the TP and aggravate lake expansion in the Inner TP (ITP). Based on the statistical model and CMIP6 multimodel ensemble mean, the projected lake ice duration loss in the TP was presented. Specifically, the rising temperature in the cold season at the middle of the 21st century will lead to the generation of 22 ice-free days and 29 ice-free days in the scenarios of SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. While at the end of the 21st century, the average lake ice duration will decrease by 35 and 71 days, respectively, and some individual models indicate that a few lakes will no longer freeze in the scenario of SSP5-8.5. Moreover, the results retrieved from the lake mass balance model simulation indicate that the increased precipitation in the warm season will yield the total lake expansion of approximately 8,000 and 9,000 km(2) from 2015 to 2050 in the scenarios of SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, respectively. But the simulations suggest that lake expansion in the future is insensitive to the glacier mass loss. This study presents evidence to illustrate that the future warming will greatly impact the lake evolution in the TP and benefits for understanding of the TP cryosphere response to climate warming.					; Huopo, Chen/B-7771-2013	Chen, Huopo/0000-0003-0760-8353; Liu, Yong/0000-0003-0837-0244													0899-8418	1097-0088				DEC 30	2022	42	16					8687	8700		10.1002/joc.7760	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.7760		JUN 2022											WOS:000814901200001
J	Irwandi, H; Rosid, MS; Mart, T				Irwandi, Hendri; Rosid, Mohammad Syamsu; Mart, Terry			The effects of ENSO, climate change and human activities on the water level of Lake Toba, Indonesia: a critical literature review	GEOSCIENCE LETTERS												This research quantitatively and qualitatively analyzes the factors responsible for the water level variations in Lake Toba, North Sumatra Province, Indonesia. According to several studies carried out from 1993 to 2020, changes in the water level were associated with climate variability, climate change, and human activities. Furthermore, these studies stated that reduced rainfall during the rainy season due to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the continuous increase in the maximum and average temperatures were some of the effects of climate change in the Lake Toba catchment area. Additionally, human interventions such as industrial activities, population growth, and damage to the surrounding environment of the Lake Toba watershed had significant impacts in terms of decreasing the water level. However, these studies were unable to determine the factor that had the most significant effect, although studies on other lakes worldwide have shown these factors are the main causes of fluctuations or decreases in water levels. A simulation study of Lake Toba's water balance showed the possibility of having a water surplus until the mid-twenty-first century. The input discharge was predicted to be greater than the output; therefore, Lake Toba could be optimized without affecting the future water level. However, the climate projections depicted a different situation, with scenarios predicting the possibility of extreme climate anomalies, demonstrating drier climatic conditions in the future. This review concludes that it is necessary to conduct an in-depth, comprehensive, and systematic study to identify the most dominant factor among the three that is causing the decrease in the Lake Toba water level and to describe the future projected water level.					; Mart, Terry/AAD-4810-2021	Mart, Terry/0000-0003-4628-2245; 													2196-4092					MAY 12	2021	8	1							21	10.1186/s40562-021-00191-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40562-021-00191-x													WOS:000649716700001

Terengganu River experienced deterioration in water quality, resulting from the sedimentation, anthropogenic, geomorphology problems and unsustainable development management around the river basin. This study was implemented to prove the sedimentation problem especially the formation of total suspended solid (TSS) and annual sediment load (SL). The technique of analysis of primary data obtained which determine according with the procedure TSS and SL. The results showed that the highest average of TSS (mg/L) is 67.2 (wet season) and 128.2 (dry season) which are class III. While the highest turbidity is 43.57 (wet season) and 21.57 (dry season) which are Class II based on National Water Quality Standard (NWQS). The highest annual average estimation for annual SL flow out from the Terengganu River Basin is 6,846.709 tonnes/km(2)/year (Manir River Basin) the lowest in the Pauh River Basin is 2.850 tonnes/km(2)/year. The statistical analysis proved the weak regression relationship between TSS, river discharges (Q), SL and area of catchment caused by the anthropogenic factors and uncertain climate changes. Furthermore, the water in the Terengganu River was classified under class III caused by the active land use activities especially industrial and development but it is still suitable for recreational activities and safe for body contact because its water quality index is not less than 65% which early stage of Class II. The contributors of sedimentation problems are from unsustainable land use such as sand mining activities which effectively trap the bed sediments, backflow that carries out high sediments, as well as sedimentation produced due to the river bank erosion. This study suggests the sedimentation management methods including land use settlement, cliff erosion problems, settlement and negotiable of uncontrolled development operations in Terengganu River and the integration of river management methods based on integrated river basin management in Terengganu River Basin is recommended.

Potential export of soluble reactive phosphorus from a coastal wetland in a cold-temperate lagoon system: Buffer capacities of macrophytes and impact on phytoplankton	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The main pathways for phosphorus flux from land to sea are particle-associated (erosion) and dissolved runoff (rivers, groundwater, and agricultural drainage systems). These pathways can act as diffused sources for aquatic systems and support primary production, therefore, counteracting the efforts aimed at reducing phosphorus input from point sources such as sewage treatment plants. Phosphorus supports primary production in the water column and can elevate phytoplankton and macrophyte growth. Coastal wetlands with emerged (Phragmites australis) and submerged (Stuckenia pectinata and Chara sp.) macrophytes can affect phosphorus fluxes in the land-water transitional zone. The macrophytes have the potential to act as a buffer for phosphorus run-off. The aim of this study was to determine the phosphorus stocks in the transitional land-sea zone of a cold temperate lagoon at the southern Baltic Sea. Phosphorus in macrophytes, water samples, and phytoplankton growth were analyzed along a gradient moving away from the wetland. The phosphorus stocks in the above ground biomass of the Phragmites plants were the highest at the end of August and with more than 8000 mg P m(-2) in the interior zone of the wetland, threefold the amount of P in Phragmites plant tissue at the wetland fringe. The submerged macrophytes stored only 300 mg P m(-2), close to the wetland. Concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus in the water column were higher in the zones of emerged macrophytes than in the zones of submerged macrophytes and decreased along the land-sea transect. Phytoplankton could grow proximal to the wetland during all seasons, but not further away. This study indicates that macrophytes can act as phosphorus sinks. However, short-term releases of phosphate within the Phragmites wetland have the potential to lead to phytoplankton growth. Phytoplankton can use these nutrient pulses either immediately or later, and support high biomass and turbidity within the system. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Based on routine water level and runoff measurements at 10 field stations, the water level in flood season during the last 50 years was lowest in 2006, a situation here we describe as "no flood in the flood season'' (NFFS). In contrast, there was no obvious change in runoff of the mid-lower reaches of the Changjiang river (MLRCR) in the drought season in 2006, which we correspondingly describe as "no drought in the drought season (NDDS)''. The extreme drought of Changjiang and impounding of TGD contributed to NFFS. However, the adjustment of TGD and the replenishment from tributaries and lakes resulted in NDDS. Meanwhile, 54% of the water flux was lost at Datong during September 20 to October 27, 2006, in comparison with the same period in 2005. It can be estimated that the impounding of TGD and the extreme drought in 2006 contributed 9% and 45% of this loss, respectively.

However, our knowledge of microbial necromass carbon (MNC) in the drawdown area remains to be seen, which has been considered an essential precursor to soil organic carbon (SOC). Here, we examined the content of MNC and its contribution to SOC in three typical habitats (mudflat, grass, and reed area) from the water edge to the uplands in the seasonal drawdown area of Dongting Lake. MNC content in the drawdown area ranged from 1.31 to 3.73 g kg -1, accounting for 27.39 %, 24.51 %, and 27.91 % of SOC in mudflat, grass, and reed areas, respectively. Compared to mudflat areas (1.83 +/- 0.11 g kg -1), vegetated areas (grass: 2.15 +/- 0.18 g kg -1; reed: 2.51 +/- 0.18 g kg -1) showed a higher MNC content. MNC variation was mainly related to carbon and nitrogen availability, plant biomass, clay content, and soil moisture. Our results showed that microbial properties were not essential in regulating MNC accumulation. Instead, external factors such as plant and soil properties played a more critical role in the long-term iterative process of MNC accumulation. Carbon and nitrogen availability, as regulated by plant biomass, clay content, and soil moisture, was dominant in MNC accumulation in drawdown areas. In conclusion, these findings highlight the critical role of external factors in MNC accumulation, which would enhance our understanding of MNC stability in drawdown areas.

Moraines and talus features can play an important role in groundwater flow and storage processes in alpine watersheds, but neither process is well understood for these features. We examined the complex hydrogeological environment of a partially ice-cored moraine in the Lake O'Hara watershed in the Canadian Rockies. Electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) and seismic refraction tomography delineated regions of buried ice and frozen and unfrozen moraine material. Seismic refraction data also clearly indicated the depth to bedrock, which varied primarily due to the thickness of the overlying moraine material. Water levels in a lake and several tarns on the moraine responded differently to inputs of rain, snowmelt, and glacier melt, indicating the different degree of hydrological connectivity of these features to the groundwater flow system in the moraine. Such differences reflect the effects of bedrock topography and the location and geometry of buried ice. Ground-penetrating radar images and ERI indicated regions of perched groundwater and focused infiltration. The location of these regions appears to be controlled by buried ice. All geophysical and hydrological data suggest that a relatively thin (<5 m) layer of saturated sediments and/or fractured bedrock likely provides a major flow system within the moraine.

J	Ylla, I; Romaní, AM; Sabater, S				Ylla, Irene; Romani, Anna M.; Sabater, Sergi			Labile and Recalcitrant Organic Matter Utilization by River Biofilm Under Increasing Water Temperature	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Microbial biofilms in rivers contribute to the decomposition of the available organic matter which typically shows changes in composition and bioavailability due to their origin, seasonality, and watershed characteristics. In the context of global warming, enhanced biofilm organic matter decomposition would be expected but this effect could be specific when either a labile or a recalcitrant organic matter source would be available. A laboratory experiment was performed to mimic the effect of the predicted increase in river water temperature (+4 A degrees C above an ambient temperature) on the microbial biofilm under differential organic matter sources. The biofilm microbial community responded to higher water temperature by increasing bacterial cell number, respiratory activity (electron transport system) and microbial extracellular enzymes (extracellular enzyme activity). At higher temperature, the phenol oxidase enzyme explained a large fraction of respiratory activity variation suggesting an enhanced microbial use of degradation products from humic substances. The decomposition of hemicellulose (beta-xylosidase activity) seemed to be also favored by warmer conditions. However, at ambient temperature, the enzymes highly responsible for respiration activity variation were beta-glucosidase and leu-aminopeptidase, suggesting an enhanced microbial use of polysaccharides and peptides degradation products. The addition of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC; dipeptide plus cellobiose) caused a further augmentation of heterotrophic biomass and respiratory activity. The changes in the fluorescence index and the ratio Abs(250)/total DOC indicated that higher temperature accelerated the rates of DOC degradation. The experiment showed that the more bioavailable organic matter was rapidly cycled irrespective of higher temperature while degradation of recalcitrant substances was enhanced by warming. Thus, pulses of carbon at higher water temperature might have consequences for DOC processing.

A snapshot of microbial communities from the Kutch: one of the largest salt deserts in the World	EXTREMOPHILES												Here we present the first report on the taxonomic diversity of the microbial communities of the saline desert of the Great Rann of Kutch, Gujarat, India, using a metagenomic approach. Seven samples, differing in salinity levels and covering different seasons, were analysed to investigate the dynamics of microbial communities in relation to salinity and season. Metagenomic data generated using whole metagenome sequencing revealed that despite its very high salinity (4.11-30.79 %), the saline desert's microbiota had a rich microbial diversity that included all major phyla. Notably, 67 archaeal genera, representing more than 60 % of all known archaeal genera, were present in this ecosystem. A strong positive correlation (0.85) was observed between the presence of the extremely halophilic bacterium Salinibacter and salinity level. Taxonomic and functional comparisons of the saline desert metagenome with those of other publicly available metagenomes (i.e. sea, hypersaline lagoon, solar saltern, brine, hot desert) was carried out. The microbial community of the Kutch was found to be unique yet more similar to the sea biomes followed by hypersaline lagoon.					; Bagatharia, Snehal/KMY-0006-2024	Bagatharia, Snehal/0000-0001-5342-063X; Ayachit, Garima/0000-0001-6776-1435; Inayatullah, Mohammed/0000-0003-1638-4443													1431-0651	1433-4909				SEP	2015	19	5					973	987		10.1007/s00792-015-0772-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00792-015-0772-z								26186976					WOS:000360192600008

Methanotrophy within the water column of a large meromictic tropical lake (Lake Kivu, East Africa)	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The permanently stratified Lake Kivu is one of the largest freshwater reservoirs of dissolved methane (CH4) on Earth. Yet CH4 emissions from its surface to the atmosphere have been estimated to be 2 orders of magnitude lower than the CH4 upward flux to the mixed layer, suggesting that microbial CH4 oxidation is an important process within the water column. A combination of natural abundance stable carbon isotope analysis (delta C-13) of several carbon pools and (CH4)-C-13-labelling experiments was carried out during the rainy and dry season to quantify (i) the contribution of CH4-derived carbon to the biomass, (ii) methanotrophic bacterial production (MBP), and (iii) methanotrophic bacterial growth efficiency (MBGE), defined as the ratio between MBP and gross CH4 oxidation. We also investigated the distribution and the delta C-13 of specific phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), used as biomarkers for aerobic methanotrophs. Maximal MBP rates were measured in the oxycline, suggesting that CH4 oxidation was mainly driven by oxic processes. Moreover, our data revealed that methanotrophic organisms in the water column oxidized most of the upward flux of CH4, and that a significant amount of CH4-derived carbon was incorporated into the microbial biomass in the oxycline. The MBGE was variable (2-50%) and negatively related to CH4 : O-2 molar ratios. Thus, a comparatively smaller fraction of CH4-derived carbon was incorporated into the cellular biomass in deeper waters, at the bottom of the oxycline where oxygen was scarce. The aerobic methanotrophic community was clearly dominated by type I methanotrophs and no evidence was found for an active involvement of type II methanotrophs in CH4 oxidation in Lake Kivu, based on fatty acids analyses. Vertically integrated over the water column, the MBP was equivalent to 16-60% of the average phytoplankton particulate primary production. This relatively high magnitude of MBP, and the substantial contribution of CH4-derived carbon to the overall biomass in the oxycline, suggest that methanotrophic bacteria could potentially sustain a significant fraction of the pelagic food web in the deep, meromictic Lake Kivu.					; Morana, Cedric/AAL-5025-2021; Borges, Alberto/C-4989-2008; Bouillon, Steven/C-5177-2011; Darchambeau, Francois/AAX-1206-2021	Morana, Cedric/0000-0002-5521-0414; Bouillon, Steven/0000-0001-7669-2929; Borges, Alberto V./0000-0002-5434-2247													1726-4170	1726-4189					2015	12	7					2077	2088		10.5194/bg-12-2077-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-12-2077-2015													WOS:000352958400002

Climatic variability and human impact during the last 2000 years in western Mesoamerica: evidence of late Classic (AD 600-900) and Little Ice Age drought events	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												We present results of analysis of biological (diatoms and ostracodes) and non-biological (Ti, Ca / Ti, total inorganic carbon, magnetic susceptibility) variables from an 8.8 m long, high-resolution (similar to 20 yr sample(-1)) laminated sediment sequence from Lake Santa Maria del Oro (SMO), western Mexico. This lake lies at a sensitive location between the dry climates of northern Mexico, under the influence of the North Pacific subtropical high-pressure cell and the moister climates of central Mexico, under the influence of the seasonal migration of the intertropical convergence zone and the North American monsoon (NAM). The sequence covers the last 2000 years and provides evidence of two periods of human impact in the catchment, shown by increases in the diatom Achnanthidium minutissimum. The first from AD 100 to 400 (Early Classic) is related to the shaft and chamber tombs cultural tradition in western Mexico, and the second is related to Post-Classic occupation from AD 1100 to 1300. Both periods correspond to relatively wet conditions. Three dry intervals are identified from increased carbonate and the presence of ostracodes and aerophilous Eolimna minima. The first, from AD 500 to 1000 (most intense during the late Classic, from AD 600 to 800), correlates with the end of the shaft and chamber tradition in western Mexico after ca. AD 600. This late Classic dry period is the most important climatic signal in the Mesoamerican region during the last 2000 years, and has been recorded at several sites from Yucatan to the Pacific coast. In the Yucatan area, this dry interval has been related with the demise of the Maya culture at the end of the Classic (AD 850 to 950). The last two dry events (AD 1400 to 1550 and 1690 to 1770) correspond with the onset of, and the late, Little Ice Age, and follow largely the Sporer and Maunder minima in solar radiation. The first of these intervals (AD 1400 to 1550) shows the most intense signal over western Mexico; however this pattern is different at other sites. Dry/wet intervals in the SMO record are related with lower/higher intensity of the NAM over this region, respectively.					; P, Dr.Gopinathan/O-2348-2018	Ortega-Guerrero, Beatriz/0000-0002-3823-1926; Roy, Priyadarsi D./0000-0003-3284-8762; Caballero, Margarita/0000-0001-5691-0773; Lozano-Garcia, Socorro/0000-0002-3579-175X													1814-9324	1814-9332					2015	11	9					1239	1248		10.5194/cp-11-1239-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-11-1239-2015													WOS:000362459100008

The community assembly mechanism of diatoms has always been a central issue in the study of aquatic ecology. In recent years, many measures have been implemented in the Ashi River Basin (ASRB) to promote social and economic development, such as bridge construction, river bottom sand mining, agricultural irrigation, and urban expansion. However, there are few studies on the effects of these activities on the mechanism of diatom community assembly. First, we found that the alpha- and beta-diversity of planktonic diatoms was higher in the normal season, while the alpha- and beta-diversity of benthic diatoms was higher in the dry season, and the alpha- and beta-diversity of both planktonic and benthic diatoms was reduced in the wet season. Second, the community structures of planktonic and benthic diatoms were significantly different in different hydrological periods, and the differences between planktonic diatoms communities were more evident than those between benthic diatom communities. Third, distance-decay analysis indicated that the distribution of the two types of diatom communities in the ASRB was influenced by both dispersal limitation and environmental selection. Finally, variance partitioning analysis revealed that dispersal limitation was the dominant driving factor for the spatial and temporal differentiation of planktonic and benthic diatoms. Our study reveals the important role of dispersal limitation in the community assembly of planktonic and benthic diatoms in rivers under different hydrological conditions. This study provides new insights for further understanding the relative importance of niche theory and neutral theory to aquatic microbial community assembly. Our research provides key information for analysing the structure of aquatic ecosystems and basic data for designing biodiversity conservation strategies in China's cold watersheds.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				DEC 15	2023	157								111258	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111258	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111258		NOV 2023											WOS:001150174000001
J	Lee, Y; Hur, J; Shin, KH				Lee, Yeonjung; Hur, Jin; Shin, Kyung-Hoon			Characterization and source identification of organic matter in view of land uses and heavy rainfall in the Lake Shihwa, Korea	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The characteristics and sources of organic matter in water of the Lake Shihwa, which receives inputs from rural, urban, and industrial areas, were evaluated by examining the biodegradable organic carbon concentration, fluorescence spectra, and carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios, especially during rainy season and dry season. The organic matter transported from rural areas was of refractory nature, while that of industrial origin decomposed rapidly. As compared to the dry season, the organic matter in the rainy season was characterized by a reduced labile fraction. During the dry season, the autochthonous organic matter dominated in the lake, however, the contributions of allochthonous organic sources by industrial and rural areas significantly increased at rainy season. This investigation revealed that the transport of organic matter of anthropogenic origin to the Lake Shihwa was mainly influenced by heavy rainfall. Moreover, each anthropogenic source could differently influence the occurrence of organic matter in water of the Lake Shihwa. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To monitor the toxicity and assess the risk of Microcystis blooms in Lake Taihu, it is important to investigate the relationship between MC production and Microcystis colony size. In this study, we classified Microcystis collected from Zhushan Bay of Lake Taihu during blooms into four classes with size of <50 mu m, 50-100 mu m, 100-270 mu m and >270 mu m and studied their differences in MC production and genetic structure. The results showed that colonies with size of <50, 50-100, 100-270 and >270 mu m produced 12.2 +/- 11.2%, 19.5 +/- 7.9%, 61.3 +/- 12.6%, and 7.0 +/- 9.6% of total MC, respectively. The proportion of cell density of colonies with size of 50-100, 100-270 and >270 mu m was positively correlated with MC concentration during blooms, while that of colonies with size of <50 mu m was negatively correlated. The MC cell quota tended to be higher during blooms in colonies with larger size except that of colonies with size of 100-270 mu m was higher than that of colonies with size of >270 mu m from June 11 to September 16. Colonies with size of <50 mu m showed the highest proportion of the less toxic MC congener MC-RR, and colonies with size of >100 mu m showed higher proportion of the most toxic MC congener MC-LR than colonies with size of <100 mu m. Real-time PCR indicated that larger colonies had higher proportion of potential toxic genotype. Principal component analysis of PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profile showed that cpcBA and mcyJ genotype compositions were different between colonies with size of <50 mu m and colonies with size of >50 mu m, and cpcBA genotype composition was also different among colonies with size of 50-100 mu m, 100-270 mu m and >270 mu m. These results indicated that MC cell quota and congener composition were different in Microcystis colonies with different sizes in Lake Taihu during blooms, and the differences in MC production in colonies with different size resulted chiefly from the difference in their genotype composition. Therefore, the authorities of water quality monitoring and drinking water supply service in Lake Taihu should be alert that the toxicity of Microcystis colony with different size was different during blooms, and the high abundance of colonies larger than 50 mu m could be an indicator of relatively high bloom toxicity.

Ramana			Mesozooplankton distribution in relation to the salinity gradient in a tropical hypersaline lake	JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH												Fluctuations in salinity are known to influence coastal marine communities. In this study, we present the effect of salinity on the distribution characteristics of mesozooplankton in Pulicat lake, the second largest lagoon situated along the south east coast of India. During different seasons of the study period, salinity varied from hyposaline (12.57) to hypersaline (139.74) in the lake. Salinity values were moderate in southern (33.75 +/- 0.7) and northern inlets (29.38 +/- 4.33), which were connected with the sea; while in the central region of the lake salinity was observed to be higher (52.32 +/- 4.57). Mesozooplankton biovolume and abundance were high in the southern and northern inlets whereas a severe reduction in diversity and abundance was observed in the central region of the lake manifesting that increase in salinity is negatively impacting the mesozooplankton distribution. Copepod (Acartia tonsa, Acrocalanus gibber, Paracalanus parvus, Oithona brevicornis and Oithona similis), crustacean and molluscan larvae dominated the mesozooplankton abundance. A. tonsa predominance (79%) over the lake and across different seasons indicates its tolerance to a wide range of salinity fluctuations i.e., brackish to hypersaline environment of the Pulicat. The distribution of euryhaline species A. tonsa in all the sampling locations throughout the study period indicated their prevalence in the lake. Multilinear analysis between biotic and abiotic components through redundancy analysis (RDA) also suggested that salinity is the major constraint factor for the distribution of mesozooplankton. In conclusion, this study showed that the increased salinity levels have profound effects on mesozooplankton community and distribution.					gera, anitha/ABB-6955-2021; GERA, ANITHA/J-3312-2012; Munnooru, Kumaraswami/AAR-8108-2020; Munnooru, Kumaraswami/HZJ-7837-2023; Kumar, Basuri/AAS-5563-2021	gera, anitha/0000-0002-3736-9763; Munnooru, Kumaraswami/0000-0001-5779-5842; 													1385-1101	1873-1414				DEC	2021	178								102138	10.1016/j.seares.2021.102138	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2021.102138		NOV 2021											WOS:000744288900002

Ecosystem metabolism in a stratified lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Seasonal changes in rates of gross primary production (GPP), net ecosystem production (NEP), and respiration (R) were determined from frequent automated profiles of dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature in a clear-water polymictic lake. Metabolic rate calculations were made using a method that integrates rates across the entire depth profile and includes DO exchange between depth layers driven by mixed-layer deepening and eddy diffusivity. During full mixing, NEP was close to zero throughout the water column, and GPP and R were reduced 2-10 times compared to stratified periods. When present, the metalimnion contributed 21% and 27% to whole-lake areal rates of GPP and R, respectively. Net autotrophy prevailed in the epilimnion (NEP = 11 +/- 14 mmol O-2 m(-3) d(-1); mean 6 +/- SD) compared to balanced production in the metalimnion (NEP = 2 +/- 19 mmol O-2 m(-3) d(-1)) and net heterotrophic conditions in hypolimnic waters (NEP = -15 +/- 24 mmol O-2 m(-3) d(-1)). Positive NEP occurred in the metalimnion during periods when the photic depth extended below the mixed-layer depth. Although the single-sonde method estimated higher areal GPP (19%) and R (14%) compared to the two depth-integrated approaches, differences were not significant. During stratification, daily variability in epilimnetic DO was dominated by metabolism (46%) and air-water gas exchange (44%). Fluxes related to mixed-layer deepening dominated in meta- and hypolimnic waters (49% and 64%), while eddy diffusion (1% and 14%) was less important. Although air-water gas exchange rates differed among the three formulations of gas-transfer velocity, this had no significant effect on metabolic rates.

Reconstruction of Late Pleistocene Paleoenvironments Using Bulk Geochemistry of Paleosols from the Lake Victoria Region	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												The impact of changing environments on the evolution and dispersal of Homo sapiens is highly debated, but few data are available from equatorial Africa. Lake Victoria is the largest freshwater lake in the tropics and is currently a biogeographic barrier between the eastern and western branches of the East African Rift. The lake has previously desiccated at similar to 17 ka and again at similar to 15 ka, but little is known from this region prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. The Pleistocene terrestrial deposits on the northeast coast of Lake Victoria (94-36 ka) are ideal for paleoenvironmental reconstructions where volcaniclastic deposits (tuffs), fluvial deposits, tufa, and paleosols are exposed, which can be used to reconstruct Critical Zones (CZ) of the past (paleo-CZs). The paleo-CZ is a holistic concept that reconstructs the entire landscape using geologic records of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, biosphere, and pedosphere (the focus of this study). New paleosol-based mean annual precipitation (MAP) proxies from Karungu, Rusinga Island, and Mfangano Island indicate an average MAP of 750 +/- 108mm year(-1) (CALMAG), 800 +/- 182 mm year(-1) (CIA-K), and 1,010 +/- 228 mm year(-1) (PPM1.0) with no statistical difference throughout the 11 m thick sequence. This corresponds to between 54 and 72% of modern precipitation. Tephras bracketing these paleosols have been correlated across seven sites, and sample a regional paleo-CZ across a similar to 55 km transect along the eastern shoreline of the modern lake. Given the sensitivity of Lake Victoria to precipitation, it is likely that the lake was significantly smaller than modern between 94 and 36 ka. This would have removed a major barrier for the movement of fauna (including early modern humans) and provided a dispersal corridor across the equator and between the rifts. It is also consistent with the associated fossil faunal assemblage indicative of semi-arid grasslands. During the Late Pleistocene, the combined geologic and paleontological evidence suggests a seasonally dry, open grassland environment for the Lake Victoria region that is significantly drier than today, which may have facilitated human and faunal dispersals across equatorial East Africa.					; Peppe, Daniel/O-5010-2019; Tryon, Christian/B-1172-2010; Faith, J./E-7146-2015	Faith, J.

Axenic and xenic algae were incubated in situ with and without allelopathically active macrophytes, and in the laboratory with sterile and nonsterile lake water and an allelochemical, tannic acid (TA). Bacterial community composition (BCC) of algae-associated bacteria was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), nonmetric multidimensional scaling, cluster analyses, and sequencing of DGGE bands. BCC of xenic algal cultures of both species were not significantly affected by changes in their environment or bacterial source community, except in the case of TA additions. Species-specific interactions therefore appear to overrule the effects of environmental conditions and source communities. The BCC of xenic and axenic D.armatus cultures subjected to in situ bacterial colonization, however, had lower similarities (ca.55%), indicating that bacterial precolonization is a strong factor for bacteriaalgae associations irrespective of environmental conditions and source community. Our findings emphasize the ecological importance of species-specific bacteriaalgae associations with important repercussions for other processes, such as the remineralization of nutrients, and organic matter dynamics.

Mercury in wet deposition was measured over the year 2010, in Lhasa the capital and largest city in Tibet. Precipitation samples were analyzed for total Hg (Hg-T), particulate-bound Hg (Hg-P), and reactive Hg (Hg-R). The volume-weighted mean (VWM) concentrations and wet deposition fluxes of Hg-T, Hg-P and Hg-R in precipitation were 24.8 ng L-1 and 82 mu g m(-2) yr(-1), 19.9 ng L-1 and 7.1 mu g m(-2) yr(-1), and 0.5 ng L-1 and 0.19 mu g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Concentrations of Hg-T and Hg-P were statistically higher during the non-monsoon season than during the monsoon season, while Hg-R concentrations were statistically higher during the monsoon season than during the non-monsoon season. Most Hg-T, Hg-P and Hg-R wet deposition occurred during the monsoon season. Concentrations of Hg-P and Hg-R were 77% and 5% of the Hg-T on average (VWM), respectively. Concentrations of Hg-T and HgP were weakly negatively correlated with precipitation amount (r(2) = 0.09 and 0.10; p<0.05), indicating that below-cloud scavenging of Hg from the local atmosphere was an important mechanism contributing Hg to precipitation. High Hg-P%, as well as a significant positive correlation between Hg-T and Hg, confirms that Hg wet deposition at Lhasa was primarily occurring in the form of atmospheric Hg-P below-cloud scavenging. Moreover, the Hg-T concentration, rather than the precipitation amount, was found to be the governing factor affecting Hg-T wet deposition flux. A comparison among modeled wet and dry deposition fluxes, and measurements suggested that estimates of both wet and dry Hg deposition fluxes by the GEOS-Chem model were 2 to 3 times higher than the measured annual wet flux.

Chinook Salmon Foraging Patterns in a Changing Lake Michigan	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Since Pacific salmon stocking began in Lake Michigan, managers have attempted to maintain salmon abundance at high levels within what can be sustained by available prey fishes, primarily Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus. Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha are the primary apex predators in pelagic Lake Michigan and patterns in their prey selection (by species and size) may strongly influence pelagic prey fish communities in any given year. In 19941996, there were larger Alewives, relatively more abundant alternative prey species, fewer Chinook Salmon, and fewer invasive species in Lake Michigan than in 20092010. The years 20092010 were instead characterized by smaller, leaner Alewives, fewer alternative prey species, higher abundance of Chinook Salmon, a firmly established nonnative benthic community, and reduced abundance of Diporeia, an important food of Lake Michigan prey fish. We characterized Chinook Salmon diets, prey species selectivity, and prey size selectivity between 19941996 and 20092010 time periods. In 19941996, Alewife as prey represented a smaller percentage of Chinook Salmon diets than in 20092010, when alewife comprised over 90% of Chinook Salmon diets, possibly due to declines in alternative prey fish populations. The size of Alewives eaten by Chinook Salmon also decreased between these two time periods. For the largest Chinook Salmon in 20092010, the average size of Alewife prey was nearly 50mm total length shorter than in 19941996. We suggest that changes in the Lake Michigan food web, such as the decline in Diporeia, may have contributed to the relatively low abundance of large Alewives during the late 2000s by heightening the effect of predation from top predators like Chinook Salmon, which have retained a preference for Alewife and now forage with greater frequency on smaller Alewives.

Use of optical absorption indices to assess seasonal variability of dissolved organic matter in Amazon floodplain lakes	BIOGEOSCIENCES												Given the importance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the carbon cycling of aquatic ecosystems, information on its seasonal variability is crucial. In this study we assess the use of optical absorption indices available in the literature based on in situ data to both characterize the seasonal variability of DOM in a highly complex environment and for application in large-scale studies using remote sensing data. The study area comprises four lakes located in the Mamiraud Sustainable Development Reserve (MSDR). Samples for the determination of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and measurements of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) were acquired in situ. The R-rs was used to simulate the response of the visible bands of the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), which was used in the proposed models. Differences between lakes were tested using the CDOM indices. The results highlight the role of the flood pulse in the DOM dynamics at the floodplain lakes. The validation results show that the use of the absorption coefficient of CDOM (a(CDOM)) as a proxy of the spectral slope between 275 and 295 nm (S275-295) during rising water is worthwhile, demonstrating its potential application to Sentinel-2 MSI imagery data for studying DOM dynamics on the large scale.

Using ALOS/PALSAR and RADARSAT-2 to Map Land Cover and Seasonal Inundation in the Brazilian Pantanal	IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING												The Brazilian Pantanal is a large continuous tropical wetland with large biodiversity and many threatened habitats. The interplay between the distribution of vegetation, the hydrology, the climate and the geomorphology nourishes and sustains the large diversity of flora and fauna in this wetland, but it is poorly understood at the scale of the entire Pantanal. This study uses multi-temporal L-band ALOS/PALSAR and C-band RADARSAT-2 data to map ecosystems and create spatial-temporal maps of flood dynamics in the Brazilian Pantanal. First, an understanding of the backscattering characteristics of floodable and non-floodable habitats was developed. Second, a Level 1 object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification defining Forest, Savanna, Grasslands/Agriculture, Aquatic Vegetation and Open Water cover types was achieved with accuracy results of 81%. A Level 2 classification separating Flooded from Non-Flooded regions for five temporal periods over one year was also accomplished, showing the interannual variability among sub-regions in the Pantanal. Cross-sensor, multi-temporal SAR data was found to be useful in mapping both land cover and flood patterns in wetland areas. The generated maps will be a valuable asset for defining habitats required to conserve the Pantanal biodiversity and to mitigate the impacts of human development in the region.

However, the relationships between climate change and hydrological processes in the alpine arid regions remain elusive. We sampled surface water and groundwater at high spatial and temporal resolutions to investigate these relationships in the Qaidam Basin, an extremely arid area in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Stable H-O isotopes and radioactive 3 H isotopes were combined with atmospheric simulations to examine hydrological processes and their response mechanisms to climate change. Contemporary climate processes and change dominate the spatial and temporal variations of surface water isotopes, specifically the westerlies moisture transport and the local temperature and precipitation regimes. The H-O isotopic compositions in the eastern Kunlun Mountains showed a gradually depleted eastward pattern, while a reverse pattern occurred in the Qilian Mountains water system. Precipitation contributed significantly more to river discharge in the eastern basin (approximately 45 %) than in the middle and western basins (10 %-15 %). Moreover, increasing precipitation and a shrinking cryosphere caused by current climate change have accelerated basin groundwater circulation. In the eastern and southwestern Qaidam Basin, precipitation and meltwater infiltrate along preferential flow paths, such as faults, volcanic channels, and fissures, permitting rapid seasonal groundwater recharge and enhanced terrestrial water storage. However, compensating for water loss due to long-term ice and snow melt will be a challenge under projected increasing precipitation in the southwestern Qaidam Basin, and the total water storage may show a trend of increasing before decreasing. Great uncertainty about water is a potential climate change risk facing the arid Qaidam Basin.

Leaf reflectance can surrogate foliar economics better than physiological traits across macrophyte species	PLANT METHODS												Background Macrophytes are key players in aquatic ecosystems diversity, but knowledge on variability of their functional traits, among and within species, is still limited. Remote sensing is a high-throughput, feasible option for characterizing plant traits at different scales, provided that reliable spectroscopy models are calibrated with congruous empirical data, but existing applications are biased towards terrestrial plants. We sampled leaves from six floating and emergent macrophyte species common in temperate areas, covering different phenological stages, seasons, and environmental conditions, and measured leaf reflectance (400-2500 nm) and leaf traits (dealing with photophysiology, pigments, and structure). We explored optimal spectral band combinations and established non-parametric reflectance-based models for selected traits, eventually showing how airborne hyperspectral data could capture spatial-temporal macrophyte variability. Results Our key finding is that structural-leaf dry matter content, leaf mass per area-and biochemical-chlorophyll-a content and chlorophylls to carotenoids ratio-traits can be surrogated by leaf reflectance with normalized error under 17% across macrophyte species. On the other hand, the performance of reflectance-based models for photophysiological traits substantively varies, depending on macrophyte species and target parameters. Conclusions Our main results show the link between leaf reflectance and leaf economics (structure and biochemistry) for aquatic plants, thus envisioning a crucial role for remote sensing in enhancing the level of detail of macrophyte functional diversity analysis to intra-site and intra-species scales. At the same time, we highlighted some difficulties in establishing a general link between reflectance and photosynthetic performance under high environmental heterogeneity, potentially opening further investigation directions.

The effects of the inception of Amazonian transcontinental drainage during the Neogene on the landscape and vegetation of the Solimoes Basin, Brazil	PALYNOLOGY												Amazonia covers nearly 50% of Brazil. The history of this biome is marked by many changes in the landscape caused mainly by the Central and Northern Andes uplift. This event has influenced the palaeogeography of the Amazon and therefore its biogeography and possibly biodiversity. Herein we present palynological and lithostratigraphical results from the Solimoes Formation in the well 1AS-33-AM. It was drilled in the Solimoes Basin, Amazonas State, Brazil, reaching 405 m in depth. We identified 152 palynomorphs, in 32 samples, among them some biostratigraphical markers, such as Crassoretitriletes vanraadshoovenii, Fenestrites spinosus, Cichoreacidites longispinosus, Ladakhipollenites? caribbiensis and Echitricolporites mcneillyi, allowing us to recognise four biozones sensu Lorente (1986): Crassoretitriletes Interval Zone (399.10-276.70 m), Asteraceae Interval Zone (276.70-262.00 m), Psilatricolporites caribbiensis Interval Subzone (239.90-70.00 m) and Echitricolporites-Alnipollenites Interval Subzone (70-32 m). The palynological and lithostratigraphical results indicate two environmental phases. The palynomorph association presents a change marked by the sudden appearance and predominance of Grimsdalea magnaclavata from 239.90 m upwards and a general increase in the number of species. The lithostratigraphy shows from approximately the same depth greater amounts of sandstones towards the top of the well, suggesting a change from a paralic to a fluvial environment of higher energy. The first phase can be associated with the Pebas/Acre depositional systems, wetlands composed by lakes and swamps with seasonal floods that existed from 23 to 7-5 Ma. The second phase indicates a fluvial system that may be interpreted as a record of the modern Amazon transcontinental fluvial system, which was already established in the Pliocene.

A thorough understanding of the past vegetation dynamics at mid elevation is crucial to assess past and future altitudinal range shifts of tree species in response to climate change. Lake sediments from Lac de Champex (1,467 m a.s.l.), a small lake in the Canton Valais in the Central Swiss Alps were analysed to reconstruct the vegetation, land use and fire history for the last 14,500 years, using pollen, macrofossils, non-pollen palynomorphs and charcoal. The record indicates that the tree line had already reached the Champex area during the Allerod (14,000 cal bp) but dropped below the lake's catchment during the Younger Dryas cooling (12,750-11,550 cal bp). Reforestation started again with Betula and Pinus sylvestris in the Early Holocene at 11,500 cal bp in response to rapid climate warming. Temperate tree species (Ulmus, Tilia, Quercus, Acer) may have reached the altitude of the lake during the Holocene Thermal Maximum (ca. 10,000-5,000 cal bp). Mixed forests with mesophilous Abies alba were dominant between 7,500 and 5,000 cal bp. The mass expansions of Picea abies after 5,000 cal bp and Alnus viridis thickets after 4,500 cal bp were directly linked to increasing human disturbance. High values of coprophilous Sporormiella fungal spores and cereal pollen suggest pastoral and arable farming at the site from the Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age onwards (5,000 cal bp). Our data imply that vegetation at intermediate elevation was less affected by human activities than at higher or lower elevations but that these areas served as important stations between the permanent settlements in the valleys and the seasonally occupied alpine huts at higher elevations. We argue that future climate warming will lead to drastic reorganizations of mountain ecosystems.					; Tinner, Willy/F-6727-2013; Schwörer, Christoph/P-3488-2016; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023; Bachofner Maurer, Corina/AAQ-4609-2021; Schworer, Christoph/P-3488-2016; Maurer, Corina/AAQ-4609-2021	Camara-Brugger, Sandra Olivia/0000-0003-4188-2276; Rey, Fabian/0000-0002-0737-3921; Tinner, Willy/0000-0001-7352-0144; Bachofner Maurer, Corina/0000-0001-8103-4111; Schworer, Christoph/0000-0002-8884-8852; Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835													0939-6314	1617-6278				AUG	2022	31	4					377	393		10.1007/s00334-021-00859-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00334-021-00859-6		NOV 2021											WOS:000716263000001

Discharge-driven flood and seasonal patterns of phytoplankton biomass and composition of an Australian tropical savannah river	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Discharge is a primary determinant of river phytoplankton, but its influence can be mediated by climate, water quality and catchment development. The relationship between discharge and phytoplankton over seasonal and flood temporal scales was examined for the Daly River in the Australian tropical savannah. Phytoplankton, water quality and hydrographic data were collected over the high-discharge wet season and lower-discharge dry season. Wet season main channel river conditions were unfavourable for phytoplankton growth. Floods, however, connected the main channel to off-channel water bodies that supplied phytoplankton, predominately Cryptomonas, to the river. Wet season phytoplankton biovolume and cell concentrations were higher than in the dry season and comprised the majority of the annual phytoplankton biomass load. High discharges served to both temporally connect the river to off-channel phytoplankton sources as well as dilute these sources. In the dry season, the Daly River was groundwater-fed and disconnected from off-channel phytoplankton sources and dominated by a potamoplanktonic population of Cryptomonas and Peridinium. River phytoplankton were determined by the seasonal discharge regime which drove water quality and underpinned a shift from highly productive, spatially extensive off-channel sources in the wet season to less productive more spatially confined in-channel sources in the dry season.

J	Knoche, HR; Kunstmann, H				Knoche, Hans Richard; Kunstmann, Harald			Tracking atmospheric water pathways by direct evaporation tagging: A case study for West Africa	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												One of the central questions in hydrological research is where and to what extent evaporated water of a region returns as precipitation in another region. This study addresses this question and presents a detailed process-based approach implemented into a regional climate model. It allows tagging and tracking of the moisture evaporating from a given region into the atmosphere until it returns to the land surface as precipitation. Our approach is fully three-dimensional and enables the detailed consideration of vertical transport mechanisms for tagged water. We present a case study for the region around Lake Volta in West Africa. The simulation demonstrates the performance of the regional model and the implemented tagging mechanism. It shows the evolution of the tagged moisture field and reveals details of the transport: Moisture evaporated from Lake Volta is initially transported predominantly to the east and north, lifted by convective processes and then transported in upper layers to the west far away from the source of evaporation. The results indicate that the coupling between boundary layer and higher levels through convective processes can be essential for the fate of tagged water substances. Detailed analysis for a 2 month period in the rainy season 1998 shows that locally up to 6% of precipitating water originates from the Lake Volta region. Less than 2% of the evaporated water is locally recycled as precipitation in the source area. A further 10% precipitates in the rest of the Volta Basin.

Historic Trends of Dechloranes 602, 603, 604, Dechlorane Plus and Other Norbornene Derivatives and Their Bioaccumulation Potential in Lake Ontario	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Temporal trends and seasonal variation of Dechloranes (Dec) 602, 603, 604, and Chlordene Plus (CP) in Niagara River suspended sediment, a Lake Ontario sediment core, and Lake Ontario lake trout were investigated, with Mirex and Dechlorane Plus (DP) included for comparison. Temporal concentration trends were generally consistent in each of the media for all compounds with the lowest concentrations observed in or after the late 1990s. In Niagara River suspended sediments, all compounds showed seasonal variation over a year with distinct profiles observed. The relative concentration patterns observed were total DP > Mirex > Dec 602 and Dec 604 > Dec 603 > CP in suspended sediments and sediment cores, whereas Mirex was highest in lake trout, followed by Dec 602 and DP. Dec 602 concentrations were 50 to 380 times greater than those of DP in lake trout, indicating Dec 602 has a greater bioaccumulation potential. The estimated biota-sediment accumulation factor (BSAF) for Dec 602 was much greater than for DP in Lake Ontario, and was greater than those calculated for PBDEs, indicating that assessment of some dechlorane compounds is merited if use is ongoing or planned.					; Zhang, Xianming/A-2926-2010; Helm, Paul/ABC-1534-2021; Reiner, Eric/A-4094-2017	Helm, Paul/0000-0002-7462-4217; Zhang, Xianming/0000-0002-5301-7899; Brindle, Ian/0000-0002-0008-1248; Reiner, Eric/0000-0002-5349-2139													0013-936X	1520-5851				APR 15	2011	45	8					3333	3340		10.1021/es104328r	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es104328r								21434636					WOS:000289341300022

The most diverse and widespread NOB genus is Nitrospira, which also contains complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox) that oxidize ammonia to nitrate. To date, little is known about the occurrence and biology of comammox and canonical nitrite oxidizing Nitrospira in extremely alkaline environments. Here, we studied the seasonal distribution and diversity, and the effect of short-term pH changes on comammox and canonical Nitrospira in sediments of two saline, highly alkaline lakes. We identified diverse canonical and comammox Nitrospira clade A-like phylotypes as the only detectable NOB during more than a year, suggesting their major importance for nitrification in these habitats. Gross nitrification rates measured in microcosm incubations were highest at pH 10 and considerably faster than reported for other natural, aquatic environments. Nitrification could be attributed to canonical and comammox Nitrospira and to Nitrososphaerales ammonia-oxidizing archaea. Furthermore, our data suggested that comammox Nitrospira contributed to ammonia oxidation at an extremely alkaline pH of 11. These results identify saline, highly alkaline lake sediments as environments of uniquely strong nitrification with novel comammox Nitrospira as key microbial players.

In this study, net ecosystem production (NEP), ecosystem respiration (R), and gross primary production (GPP) rates were estimated in relation to physicochemical, hydrological, and meteorological variables in La Salada (LS) and Sauce Grande (SG), two shallow lakes located in an important agricultural region with water management. LS is a mesosaline, mesotrophic-eutrophic lake, whereas SG is a hyposaline and eutrophic lake. GPP and R showed daily and seasonal variations, with R exceeding GPP during most of the study period in both lakes. Net heterotrophic conditions prevailed during the study period (NEP LS: -1.1 mmol O-2 m(-2) day(-1) and NEP SG: -1.25 mmol O-2 m(-2) day(-1)). From data analysis, the temperature, wind speed, and lake volume are the main drivers of ecosystem metabolism for both lakes. Despite the significant differences between the two lakes, the NEP values were similar. The different hydrological characteristics (endorheic vs. flushing lake) were crucial in explaining why the two different systems presented similar ecosystem metabolic rates, emphasizing the importance of water management.					; Seitz, Carina/HAX-3738-2022; Alfonso, Maria/JNS-2767-2023; Perillo, GME/AAV-3784-2021	Piccolo, Maria Cintia/0000-0002-5184-9149; Perillo, Gerardo/0000-0002-1200-5138; Alfonso, Maria Belen/0000-0003-0543-8098; Seitz, Carina/0000-0001-7985-3724; 														2073-4441				SEP	2018	10	9							1136	10.3390/w10091136	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10091136													WOS:000448821900028

Competition overwhelms environment and genetic effects on growth rates of endangered white sturgeon from a conservation aquaculture program	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Improving the status of endangered species can be challenging because the efficacy of conservation actions is often uncertain. Conservation aquaculture has been the main recovery action for endangered white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) in the Transboundary Reach of the upper Columbia River. Using long-term mark-recapture data (2002-2018), we predicted variation in growth rates due to genetic, environmental, and competition effects to evaluate the efficacy of the aquaculture program. Environmental conditions (by season and country) and competition had the greatest effects on growth. Growth, length-at age, weight-at-age, and condition factor were higher for fish residing in reservoir habitats (US) compared to those in riverine habitat (Canada). Growth declined over the study period but growth in length for larger fish remained higher in the US as fish > 100 cm fork length in Canada were not growing. Small differences in growth among families indicate that differences in genetics among parents spawned in the hatchery had negligible effects on growth in the wild. Our estimate of substantive negative density-dependent growth in Canada is important for management of conservation aquaculture for sturgeons.

BIEB.) under climate change. Area of study: The study was carried out in the Lakes District that covers Burdur, Isparta and Antalya provinces in the west of the Mediterranean region. Material and methods: During the study, the inventory data of 40 productive juniper stands in the region were collected. The future projections for the study area were made for the year 2070 with all Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios and 19 bioclimatic predictors from HadGEM2-ES. Modeling process was performed by using the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) method. Main results: The AUC value of the model was determined as 0.966 +/- 0.028. The model identified that Precipitation of Driest Month, Temperature Seasonality, Precipitation of Coldest Quarter, Max Temperature of Warmest Month, Mean Diurnal Range were the major variables influencing the current and future distributions of the species. According to the models, there will be a dramatic decrease in the potential distribution of the Crimean juniper. Consequently, the results from all these studies will be able to create an effective base for the biodiversity and ecosystem planning studies to be realized according to the climate change scenarios. Highlights: Understanding how climate change will affect the distribution of plant species in the future is an important topic in ecological researches. Climate change scenarios are the most preferred parameters to remove this uncertainty. It is predicted that the Crimean juniper will be affected by climate change and its distribution will decrease dramatically.

INFLUENCE OF NITROGEN FERTILIZER AND STRAW RETURNING ON CH4 EMISSION FROM A PADDY FIELD IN CHAO LAKE BASIN, CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In the rice paddy ecosystem, application of nitrogen fertilizer and straw to soil methanogenic bacteria provides abundant methanogenic substrates, which significantly influences methane (CH4) emission from paddy fields. The effects of nitrogen fertilizer and straw returning on CH4 emissions in rice paddy fields were studied during a two year of the field experiment in Chao lake basin, China The experiment consisted of 4 treatments: Control (CK), Traditional fertilizer (CT), Optimized fertilizer (CO) and CO with straw-return (CO + SR). The cumulative effects of straw-returning practices on greenhouse gas emission in a rice-wheat rotation system were determined, along with an estimation of CH4 in a rice growing season. According to our results, The CH4 emission fluxes from paddy field showed three different peak trends; Compared to CK, CT, CO, and CO + SR increased seasonal CH4 emission by 36.6%, 45.8% and 42.0% in 2013 and by 42.0%, 48.5% and 80.1% in 2014, respectively. Anaerobic decomposition of wheat straw accelerates the decline of soil redox potential (Eh) after flooding, thereby providing suitable environmental conditions for the growth of methanogens and promoting CH4 production in the subsequent rice season. The CH4 emission fluxes of CK, CT, CO, and CO + SR were significantly correlated with soil temperatures at 5 cm depth. Therefore, our findings show that application rates of nitrogen fertilizer and straw returning to a paddy field could significantly affect the CH4 emissions in China.

These reforms led to the abolishment of a century-old commercial fishing lot system in 2012 and the establishment of new fish sanctuary and community fishing areas. However, the status of fisheries and fish assemblages following the reforms is not well understood. Here, we investigated the temporal changes in fish catch weight and fish assemblage structure for the period 1995-2000 before fishing lot abolishment (BLA) and for the period 2012-2015 after the removal of all fishing lots (after lot abolishment-ALA) using time-series fish catch data recorded from the Tonle Sap Lake (TSL), one of the world largest inland fisheries. We found (i) mean catch trends vary seasonally, with stable catch trends during the BLA and decreasing catch trends during the ALA and (ii) significant shifts in fish assemblage composition, notably a shift from large-bodied, migratory, and/or predatory species during the BLA toward more short-distance migratory and/or floodplain, small-bodied species during the ALA. Fishing lot abolishment coincided with substantial changes to floodplain habitats and increases in fishing pressure, threatening TSL fish stocks. Flow alterations caused by dams and climate change may exacerbate the problem. Therefore, to realize the fisheries reform objectives, it is imperative to strengthen the fisheries' governance and management system, including effective law enforcement, institutional strengthening, improved planning, cooperation, and coordination as well as clearly defined roles and responsibilities among concerned stakeholders at all levels.

To ensure national applicability of the results, this study encompassed ten major metropolitan areas in South Korea. Using cluster analysis, watersheds were classified into three land-cover types: Urban-dominated (URB), agriculture-dominated (AGR), and forest-dominated (FOR). For each land-cover type, factor analysis (FA) was used to ensure simple and feasible parameter selection for developing the minimum water quality index (WQI(min)). The chemical oxygen demand, fecal coliform (total coliform for FOR), and total nitrogen (nitrate-nitrogen for URB) were selected as key parameters for all land-cover types. Our results suggest that WQI(min) can minimize bias in water quality assessment by reducing redundancy among correlated parameters, resulting in better differentiation of pollution levels. Furthermore, the dominant land-cover type of watersheds, not only affects the level and causes of pollution, but also influences temporal patterns, including the long-term trends and seasonality, of stream water quality in urban areas in South Korea.

Pleistocene Branchiopods (Cladocera, Anostraca) from Transbaikalian Siberia Demonstrate Morphological and Ecological Stasis	WATER												Pleistocene water bodies have been studied using the paleolimnological approach, which traces environmental changes using particular subfossils as ecological proxies, rather than analysis of the paleocommunities themselves. Within a given taphocoenosis, the presence and quantity of animals are related to environmental conditions rather than to community types where relationships between taxa are stabilized during their long-term co-occurrence and are (at least partially) more important than the particular environmental conditions at the time of deposition, which may have experienced significant seasonal and inter-seasonal variations. Here, we analyze Branchiopoda (Crustacea) of two paleolocalities in the Transbaikalian Region of Russia: Urtuy (MIS3) and Nozhiy (older than 1.5 million years). Cladocerans Daphnia (Ctenodaphnia) magna, D. (C.) similis, D.

With the exception of the last taxon, which now occurs in the southern Holarctic, all other taxa inhabit the Transbaikalian Region. Within Eurasia, the steppe zone has the greatest diversity of large branchiopods and a high diversity of some cladocerans, such as subgenus Daphnia (Ctenodaphnia) and Moina sp.

New geochemical data based on high-resolution X-ray fluorescence scanning provide in-situ, and continuous analysis of predefined element suites on split-core surfaces. Variations of elements over time were assessed constructing correlation matrices based on the calculation of Pearson correlation coefficients. The element suite includes Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Zn, Rb, Sr, and Zr. A major result includes that changes in element behaviour are related to hydrological changes in the catchment (precipitation), lake level status, and evaporation (insolation/solar activity), and are ultimately driven by climate. Major trends/shifts in elemental ratios correspond to the climate development in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Based on correlation of Rb/Sr, reflecting wet/dry climates, with foraminiferal proxies of marine core LC21 from the Southern Aegean Sea, and the stable oxygen-isotope record of Soreq cave (Israel), the Belling-Allerod, the Younger Dryas, and the 8.2 ka cold event were identified.

However, in the Taihu Lake Region (TLR) of China, farmers' injudicious and excessive use of P fertilizer has led to a dramatic spike in P accumulation. A five-year (ten consecutive crop seasons) pot experiment was conducted using four paddy soils with three P concentrations (2 P-rich, 1 P-moderate, and 1 P-deficient soils) from the TLR under four P fertilization regimes: P fertilization only for the wheat season (PW), P fertilization only for rice season (PR), P fertilization for both rice and wheat seasons (PR + W), and no P fertilization during either season (Pzero; control). Over 5 years, compared to the PR + W treatment, the PW treatment did not decrease crop yield (P < 0.05) because it could supply enough available P sources (124-210 mg kg(-1) labile P and moderately labile P) for crop growth and similar microorganism community composition. Also, compared to the Pzero treatment, applied P fertilization significantly increased the concentration of labile P and moderately labile P. Additionally, applied P fertilization decreased acid phosphatase enzyme activity and increased the total relative abundance of microorganisms significantly in P-rich soil, although they decreased in P-deficient soil. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) showed significant positive correlations with soil labile P (P < 0.05), which indicated that AMF played important roles in the transformation of P in the soil P pool. P fertilizer applied only for the wheat season may be a viable option for saving P fertilizer and sustaining crop yields in the current rice-wheat rotated system of China, and effective utilization of AMF which are related to P availability in the soil will be important in the future reasearch.

J	Li, XH; Zhang, Q				Li Xianghu; Zhang Qi			Variation of Floods Characteristics and Their Responses to Climate and Human Activities in Poyang Lake, China	CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE												The Poyang Lake is one of the most frequently flooded areas in China. Understanding the changing characteristics of floods as well as the affecting factors is an important prerequisite of flood disaster prevention and mitigation. The present study identified the characteristics variations of historical floods in the Poyang Lake and their tendencies based on the Mann-Kendall (M-K) test, and also investigated the related affecting factors, both from climate and human activities. The results revealed that the highest flood stages, duration as well as hazard coefficient of floods showed a long-term increasing linear trend during the last 60 years with the M-K statistic of 1.49, 1.60 and 1.50, respectively. And, a slightly increasing linear trend in the timing of the highest stages indicated the floods occurred later and later during the last six decades. The rainfall during the flood season and subsequent discharges of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River and runoff from the Poyang Lake Basin were mainly responsible for the severe flood situation in the Poyang Lake in the 1990s. In addition, the intensive human activities, including land reclamation and levee construction, also played a supplementary role in increasing severity of major floods. While, the fewer floods in the Poyang Lake after 2000 can be attributed to not only the less rainfall over the Poyang Lake Basin and low discharges of the Changjiang River during flood periods, but also the stronger influences of human activity which increased the floodwater storage of the Poyang Lake than before.					; ZHANG, Qi/MFJ-8647-2025	Li, Xianghu/0000-0001-9934-1822; 													1002-0063	1993-064X				FEB	2015	25	1					13	25		10.1007/s11769-014-0724-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-014-0724-z													WOS:000351088100002

Temporal variations in the densities of communities belonging to the planktonic food web (i.e., microbial: bacteria, flagellate, and ciliate; and grazing: zooplankton and phytoplankton) were investigated, aiming to clarify the interactions between these organisms and the dynamics of the planktonic food web in a floodplain lake. We hypothesized that hydrological pulse determines the path of matter and energy flow through the planktonic food web of this floodplain lake. Data were collected monthly from March 2007 to February 2008 at three different sites in Guarana Lake (Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil). The path analysis provided evidence that the dynamics of the planktonic food web was strongly influenced by the hydrological pulse. The high-water period favored interactions among the organisms of the microbial loop, rather than their relationships with zooplankton and phytoplankton. Therefore, in this period, the strong interaction among the organisms of the grazing food chain suggests that the microbial loop functions as a sink of matter and energy. In turn, in the low-water period, higher primary productivity appeared to favor different interactions between the components of the grazing food chain and microorganisms, which would function as a link to the higher trophic levels.

Observations are also often not available at time scales to allow evaluation of satellite products at their finest resolutions. In the present study, we utilized a 3-month rainfall data set from an experimental network of eight automatic gauges in Gilgel Abbay watershed in Ethiopia to evaluate the 1-hourly, 8x8-km Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH) rainfall product. The watershed is situated in the Lake Tana basin which is the source of the Blue Nile River. We applied a suite of statistical metrics that included mean difference, bias, standard deviation of differences and measures of association. Our results indicate that the accuracy of the CMORPH product shows a significant variation across the basin area. Its estimates are mostly within +/- 10mmh-1 of the gauge rainfall observations; however, the product does not satisfactorily capture the rainfall temporal variability and is poorly correlated (<0.27) to gauge observations. Its poor rain detection capability led to significant underestimation of the seasonal rainfall depth (total bias reaches up to -52%) with large amounts of hit rain bias as well as missed rain and false rain biases. In the future refinement of CMORPH algorithm, more attention should be given to reducing missed rain bias over the mountains of Gilgel Abbay, whereas equal attention should be given to hit, missed rain and false rain biases over other parts of the watershed.

The AMMA-CATCH Gourma observatory site in Mali: Relating climatic variations to changes in vegetation, surface hydrology, fluxes and natural resources	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The Gourma site in Mali is one of the three instrumented meso-scale sites deployed in West-Africa as part of the African Monsoon Multi-disciplinary Analysis (AMMA) project. Located both in the Sahelian zone sensu stricto, and in the Saharo-Sahelian transition zone, the Gourma meso-scale window is the northernmost site of the AMMA-CATCH observatory reached by the West African Monsoon. The experimental strategy includes deployment of a variety of instruments, from local to meso-scale, dedicated to monitoring and documentation of the major variables characterizing the climate forcing, and the spatio-temporal variability of surface processes and state variables such as vegetation mass, leaf area index (LAI), soil moisture and surface fluxes. This paper describes the Gourma site, its associated instrumental network and the research activities that have been carried out since 1984. In the AMMA project, emphasis is put on the relations between climate, vegetation and surface fluxes. However, the Gourma site is also important for development and validation of satellite products, mainly due to the existence of large and relatively homogeneous surfaces. The social dimension of the water resource uses and governance is also briefly analyzed, relying on field enquiry and interviews. The climate of the Gourma region is semi-arid, daytime air temperatures are always high and annual rainfall amounts exhibit strong inter-annual and seasonal variations. Measurements sites organized along a north-south transect reveal sharp gradients in surface albedo, net radiation, vegetation production, and distribution of plant functional types. However, at any point along the gradient, surface energy budget, soil moisture and vegetation growth contrast between two main types of soil surfaces and hydrologic systems. On the one hand, sandy soils with high water infiltration rates and limited run-off support almost continuous herbaceous vegetation with scattered woody plants. On the other hand, water infiltration is poor on shallow soils, and vegetation is sparse and discontinuous, with more concentrated run-off that ends in pools or low lands within structured endorheic watersheds. Land surface in the Gourma is characterized by rapid response to climate variability, strong intra-seasonal, seasonal and inter-annual variations in vegetation growth, soil moisture and energy balance. Despite the multi-decadal drought, which still persists, ponds and lakes have increased, the grass cover has largely recovered, and there are signs of increased tree cover at least in the low lands.

Two types of activities were conducted to control the population of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) in Lake Izunuma-Uchinuma, Japan. The first activity was a lake wide catch using set nets deployed all along the lakeshore beginning in 2001. The second activity, beginning in 2004, focused on catches during the spawning season over spawning sites, distributed along lakeshore segments with sandy substrates. The efforts of both activities were similar (involving about 140 people/year). From 2001 to 2003, the catch per unit of fishing effort (CPUE) of largemouth bass using set nets increased; however, CPUE decreased dramatically after catches at the spawning sites started. The numbers of nests spawned, larvae, and adults of largemouth bass also decreased after the start of spawning site catches. In 2010, the CPUE of other fish species, whose numbers had decreased due to predation by largemouth bass, recovered to the same number as before the expansion of largemouth bass. Capturing largemouth bass at the spawning sites was an effective approach to controlling this species and conserving fish communities in the lake.

In this study, we present global positioning system (GPS), gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) and follow-on (FO) observations obtained during the 2002-2020 period to identify hydrological changes on the TP. The spatial long-term trends in the GRACE/GRACE-FO data show continuous glacier mass losses around the Himalayas and accumulated mass on the inner TP due to the increased water mass in lakes. The singular spectrum analysis (SSA) was applied for interpolation of the data gap with GRACE/GRACE-FO. We evaluated the correlation between the vertical displacements obtained from 214 continuous GPS stations and GRACE/GRACE-FO-modeled water mass loads and found a high correlation, with spatial variabilities associated with the seasonal terrestrial water storage (TWS) pattern. The common-mode component obtained from continuous GPS coordinates was decomposed using principal component analysis (PCA) and presented different periodic signals related to interannual fluctuations in hydrology and the dynamics of the inner Earth. Moreover, the various characteristics of precipitation and temperature revealed similar interannual fluctuations to those of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation. We conclude that the GPS-inferred interannual fluctuations and the corresponding GRACE/GRACE-FO-modeled hydrological loads reflect climate responses. These findings shed light on the complex role of the spatiotemporal climate and water mass balance on the TP since the beginning of the 21st century.

Case: San Pedro Lagoons, Chile	REMOTE SENSING												Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is a crucial water quality parameter that modulates many lake and reservoir processes. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor it from a long-term perspective. Over the last decades, many methods to retrieve LSWT fields from satellite imagery have been developed. This work aims to test, implement and automate six methods. These are performed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, using 30 m spatial resolution images from Landsat 7 and 8 satellites for 2000-2020. Automated methods deliver long-term time series. Series are then calibrated with in situ data. Two-dimensional (2D) x time data fields are built on the lakes with the calibration, and a subsequent LSWT climatology is derived. Our study area is two urban lagoons with areas smaller than two (2) km2 of the city of San Pedro de la Paz, South-Central Chile. The six methods describe the seasonal variation of LSWT (Willmott's index of agreement > 0.91, R2 > 0.67). The main difference between series is their bias. Thus, after a simple calibration, all series adequately describe the LSWT. We utilized the Pedro de la Paz lagoons to demonstrate the method's utility. Our research demonstrates that these adjacent lagoons exhibit comparable LSWT spatial (15.5-17 & LCIRC;C) and temporal (7-25 & LCIRC;C) trends throughout the year. Differences in geographical pattern might result from the northern island's heat impact and the existence of the Biobio river to the east. Our work represents an efficient alternative for obtaining LSWT in particular lakes and reservoirs, especially useful in medium and small-sized ones.

We use 11 years of above-canopy wind speed measurements from spatially and temporally heterogeneous forest environments to disentangle the effects of different features of changing canopy structure on the surface roughness parameters: displacement height (d), roughness length (z(0)), and the aerodynamic canopy height (h(a)). We find a significant increasing long-term trend of dormant-season (leaf-off) h(a), which closely resembles the rate of biometrically derived vertical stem growth over years. We show that the values of d and z(0) trade-off with higher d and shorter z(0) when leaf area is high in the growing season. Using airborne lidar measurements and a footprint model for flux-source location detection, we show that these d and z(0) trade-offs also correspond with the spatial differences between taller and shorter subplot patches. We show that incorporating seasonal-scale temporal heterogeneity of d and z(0) into surface-flux and ecosystem models will improve their accuracy. However, incorporating simple empirical modifications to surface-structure roughness parameters due to inter-annual variation in canopy height and leaf area did not lead to improved modeling of frictional velocity within this study. Further investigation of structure-roughness relationships is needed to incorporate these aspects. Finally, this study proposes a meteorological-based method for estimating vertical stem growth in undisturbed forest environments by tracking h(a) Over time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the eddy covariance (EC) technique was used to monitor the carbon fluxes in a grassland ecosystem in the Badain Jaran Desert (BJD) during the growing season from 2018 to 2020. The responses of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (R-eco), and gross primary productivity (GPP) to precipitation were analysed, as well as the effects of environmental factors on carbon fluxes at half-hour and daily scales. The results showed that (1) during the growing seasons in 2019 and 2020, the grassland ecosystem in a lake basin in the BJD was a net CO2 sink, and the cumulative NEE was - 91.9 and - 79.2 g C m(-2), respectively. The greater the total precipitation in the growing season, the stronger the carbon sequestration capacity of a grassland ecosystem. (2) The precipitation intensity, frequency, and timing significantly affected the carbon fluxes in the ecosystem. Isolated minor precipitation events did not trigger obvious NEE, GPP, and R-eco pulses. However, large precipitation events or continuous minor precipitation events over several days caused delayed high assimilation; in addition, the greater the precipitation intensity, the greater the carbon flux pulse and carbon assimilation. The timing and frequency of precipitation events had more important effects on carbon exchange than total precipitation. Droughts create a shift in grasslands, causing them to move from being a carbon sink to a carbon source. (3) Correlation analysis showed that NEE was significantly negatively correlated with photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). On the half-hour scale, R-eco and GPP were significantly positively correlated with soil temperature at 5 cm deep (T-s5) and PAR, respectively. However, they were strongly correlated with air temperature (T-a), soil surface temperature (T-s) and (T-s5) on the daily scale. The correlations between daily NEE, R-eco, GPP, and precipitation varied across years and seasons. Due to warming and humidification in northwest China, precipitation events will have a greater impact on the carbon sequestration capacity of the BJD. The results are vital for predicting the possible effects of climate change on the carbon cycle.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				OCT	2022	29	50					75805	75821		10.1007/s11356-022-21098-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-21098-w		JUN 2022						35655020					WOS:000805092300005

Atmospheric deposition of semivolatile organic pollutants in European high mountains: Sources, settling and chemical degradation	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Bulk atmospheric deposition samples, including wet and dry deposition, were collected during 2004-2006 in four high mountain European lakes: Skalnate Pleso (Tatra mountains, Slovakia), Gossenkollesee (Alps, Austria), Redon (Pyrenees, Spain), and Lochnagar (Grampian Mountains, Scotland). Samples were analysed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), endosulfans, and polybromodiphenyl ethers (PBDEs). The deposition of PCBs, HCHs, and low brominated BDEs reflected baseline contributions from long range atmospheric transport. This was also the case for PAHs in Redon and Gossenkollesee, endosulfans in Lochnagar and Gossenkollesee and HCB in these three lakes. However, Skalnate received PAHs, endosulfans, and HCB from regional sources as it was the case for endosulfans in Redon. The distinct origin of these pollutants was reflected in the relative composition of some metabolites such as the proportion of endosulfan sulfate vs alpha-and beta-endosulfans or the relative composition of BDE47 and BDE99. Wet deposition was the main process for atmospheric removal of PAHs, HCHs, and HCB. In addition, warm season revolatilization from soils and melting snow with subsequent condensation at low temperature were significant for volatile PAHs, HCB, low chlorinated PCBs, and endosulfans. Reaction with OH radicals was not a significant loss process of HCHs and HCB in remote areas, dominated by wet deposition, whereas PCBs and PAHs were significantly removed by both wet deposition and OH radical oxidation, the latter dominating in the highest altitude sites. Photolysis was the main atmospheric removal process of PBDEs, dominating over atmospheric deposition and OH depletion in all sites. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, DDT and Hg contamination and bioavailability were assessed by using different approaches: (1) direct evaluation of sediment contamination, (2) assessment of bioaccumulation in native benthic invertebrates belonging to different taxonomic/functional groups, and (3) evaluation of the in situ bioavailability of DDT and Hg using passive samplers. Sampling sites were selected upstream and downstream the industrial plant along the river axis. Benthic invertebrates (Gammaridae, Heptageniidae, and Diptera) and sediments were collected in three seasons and analyzed for DDT and Hg content and the results were used to calculate the biota sediment accumulation factor (BSAF). Polyethylene passive samplers (PEs) for DDT and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGTs) for Hg were deployed in sediments to estimate the concentration of the toxicants in pore water. Analysis for (DDx) were performed using GC-MS. Accuracy was within +/- 30 % of the certified values and precision was > 20 % relative standard deviation (RSD). Total mercury concentrations were determined using an automated Hg mercury analyzer. Precision was > 5 % and accuracy was within +/- 10 % of certified values. The results of all the approaches (analysis of sediment, biota, and passive samplers) showed an increasing contamination from upstream to downstream sites. BSAF values revealed the bioavailability of both contaminants in the study sites, with values up to 49 for DDx and up to 3.1 for Hg. No correlation was found between values in sediments and the organisms. Concentrations calculated using passive samplers were correlated with values in benthic invertebrates, while no correlation was found with concentrations in sediments. Thus, direct analysis of toxicant in sediments does not provide a measurement of bioavailability. On the contrary, analysis of bioaccumulation in benthic organisms provides the most realistic picture of the site-specific bioavailability of DDx and Hg, but this approach is time-consuming and not always feasible. On the other hand, the in situ deployment of passive samplers proved to be a powerful tool, providing a good surrogate measure of bioaccumulation.

Supraglacial melt channel networks in the Jakobshavn Isbrae region during the 2007 melt season	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Supraglacial channels are an important mechanism for surface water transport over the ablation zone of western Greenland. The first assessment of the spatio-temporal distribution of surface melt channels and their relationship to supraglacial lakes over the Jakobshavn Isbrae region of Western Greenland was analysed using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus panchromatic images during the 2007 melt season. A total of 1188 melt channels were delineated and show an increase in the number of melt channels throughout the season, reaching a peak on 9 August. Water-filled melt channels advanced to amaximum elevation of 1647m on 9 August and attained a minimumaverage slope of 0.009 on 8 July. The ablation zone demonstrates two hydrologic modes, where crevasse and moulin terminating channels dominate at elevations <800m and higher-order channel networks >800m. Development of higher-order networks is interrupted by flow divergence due to partitioning of melt water into vertical infiltration through moulins and crevasse fields prevalent at lower elevations. Tributary and connector networks between 800 and 1200m in elevation are correlated with fewer lake occurrences, lower surface velocities (similar to 50ma(-1)), and ice flow dominated by internal deformation over basal sliding. High-order channels are associated with lake basins that exceed melt water storage capacity. Evolution of channel networks is coupled to changes in melt water production, runoff, and ice dynamics with implication for the englacial and subglacial environments. (C) 2013 The Authors.

In contrast, knowledge of the spatial extent reached by glaciers during the Neoglacial period (similar to 4.2-0.14 ka) is still fragmentary because of the scarcity of preserved moraines predating the Little Ice Age (LIA). In addition, although the climatic meaning of the geomorphological imprints left by debris-covered glaciers or rock glaciers is increasingly investigated, direct comparison with those of debris-free glaciers is often not possible. Here, we provide an unprecedentedly large TCN dataset for the region (n = 53) constraining the behaviour of Arsine Glacier, French Alps, from the end of the Lateglacial to the end of the LIA. Stadial moraines are present in both the western and eastern valleys formerly occupied by two separate branches of the ice body, up to c. 3 km from the extant glacier front. Further upslope, the forefield of Arsine Glacier is characterized by two prominent geomorphic complexes. The first is a peculiar landform with concentric ridges, previously interpreted as a moraine-derived rock glacier. It is framed by an extensive and chaotic boulder field and is overtopped - in the most glacier-proximal part - by the second outstanding feature, a large complex of unvegetated lateral and frontal composite moraines. The chronological results indicate that the most distal moraine sets testify to five oscillations of the western glacier branch between 11.88 +/- 0.43 ka and 11.10 +/- 0.37 ka. Robust constraints on the spatial extent of these positions show depression of the glacier equilibrium line altitude ranging from 224 m to 169 m relative to the LIA. The innermost EH complex dated here is interpreted as being related to the regional expression of the Preboreal Oscillation (PBO). The previously interpreted moraine-derived rock glacier was found to rather represent a moraine complex deposited following a rock avalanche covering the eastern branch of the ice body and the surrounding floor. This catastrophic event occurred at 10.71 +/- 0.42 ka, during the first significant warming of the Preboreal period, as shown by dating of the framing boulder field deposit. Dating of the ridges of the resulting moraine complex shows a subsequent advance of c. 1250 m peaking at 10.25 +/- 0.42 ka, followed by persistence of the debris-covered eastern tongue outboard the LIA extent until 9.52 +/- 0.43 ka. By contrast, during this interval no prominent moraine was deposited by the western glacier branch, not affected by the rock avalanche. Like elsewhere in the Alps, no Be-10 boulder ages corresponding to the Mid-Holocene (8.2-4.2 ka) were found. Dating of the glacier-proximal moraine complex allows assigning its deposition to the Neoglacial period. The emplacement of this feature had started no later than 3.74 +/- 0.02 ka. A subsequent period of glacier maxima deposited a till unit dated on both sides of the glacier at 2.69 +/- 0.14 ka. During the Common Era, the first LIA-like advance occurred at 1.67 +/- 0.05 ka. During the LIA, an early advance (eLIA) deposited the outermost Neoglacial frontal moraine 650 +/- 30 a ago. Finally, the innermost preserved lateral moraine was deposited at the end of the LIA, 170 +/- 10 a ago. The Arsine Glacier record is, to our knowledge, the most detailed Be-10-based Holocene-long glacier chronology in the Alps, and agrees well with other existing glacier records in the region. We propose that, apart from the directly climate-driven glacier advances and corresponding ice-marginal moraine deposits of the EH and the Neoglacial, a large EH rock avalanche occurred following warm-period-related destabilization of the cirque headwalls, bringing large amount of debris onto one part of the glacier. This excessive supply - estimated to a volume of c. 8.4 x 10(6) m(3) - led the eastern glacier branch to evolve into a heavily debris-covered tongue that recorded climate-related oscillations between similar to 10.3 and 9.5 ka outboard the LIA extent.

Hence, it can be augmented by developing irrigation and water resources, mainly fisheries resources. In Ethiopia, especially in the Tana Sub-basin, the expanded irrigation practices by building dams and weirs along the tributaries of Lake Tana did not consider fisheries nor the development and management. The aim of this research was, therefore, to promote fisheries and integrate them into the irrigation systems of the Ribb Reservoir in Ethiopia. During the sampling time (from September 2020 to August 2021), primary and secondary data collection and discussions with experts and fishers were conducted. Although the dam prevented the upstream spawning migration of the Labeobarbus species, the reservoir created a new fisheries development. Water quality parameters, such as temperature (23.82 +/- 1.38 degrees C), pH (6.36 +/- 0.64) and dissolved oxygen (8.84 +/- 3.54 mgl(-1)), were within the acceptable range for fish. Of the 11 identified fish species, L. nedgia and L. surkis were the most and the least common species, respectively. Riverine and cut spawner species were the sources of the population. However, Oreochromis niloticus (Nile tilapia) was restocked in 2017 to increase the livelihoods of fishers. The Fulton condition factor, K values of L. nedgia (1.63 +/- 0.25), L. intermedius (1.70 +/- 0.27), C. gariepinus (0.61 +/- 0.13) and O. niloticus (1.65 +/- 0.29), and their 'b' values were <3. The newly established fishery in the reservoir is the source of income for fishers, and its annual production has been shown to increase from 148.5 to 1034.1 tons/year, indicating fish are adapting to the reservoir. However, the fishery has faced many challenges, such as illegal fishing, fisher engagement, and fishing gears. Limiting the number of fishers, restrictions on fishing gears and seasonality of fishing are some of the mitigations.

In the present study, we studied the evolutionary characteristics of water quality in Dongting Lake in three recent years. Moreover, the evolution rules and dominant groups of the phytoplankton community were explored, and the major influencing factors of phytoplankton and their distribution were assessed based on the field survey and detection data from 2017 to 2019. The results indicated that the water quality of Dongting Lake improved in recent years. The concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) increased by 6.91%, whereas the concentrations of the five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) decreased by 17.5%, 13.0%, 33.8%, 7.6%, and 13.3%, respectively. The mean phytoplankton density reached 4.15 x 10(5) cells center dot L-1 in September 2017, whereas it was only 1.62 x 10(5) cells center dot L-1 in December 2018. There were 15 dominant species belonging to Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Cryptophyta, and Miozoa. Moreover, Fragilaria radians (Kutzing) D.M.Williams & Round and Aulacoseira granulata (Ehrenberg) Simonsen were the dominant populations in all seasons. The Pearson and linear regression analysis also indicated that the composition and distribution of phytoplankton in Dongting Lake were mainly affected by electrical conductivity (Cond), BOD5, potassium permanganate (CODMn), and CODCr, especially in Eastern Dongting Lake. Of course, NH4+-N, TN, and TP were also the main factors affecting the density and species of the phytoplankton community, especially in Western Dongting Lake. Finally, we suggested that local government could take "The relationship between Yangtze River and Dongting Lake", "The relationship between the seven fed rivers and Dongting Lake", and "The relationship between human activities and Dongting Lake" as the breakthrough points to guarantee the ecological flow, water environment, and ecological quality of Dongting Lake.

Lake type definition is not trivial because the different lake types may require different nutrient loading reduction targets to achieve the goal of at least "good" ecological status. Using data from 770 Danish lakes, we illustrate some of the problems associated with classification. In Denmark, 16 potentially different lake types are defined using an alkalinity boundary of 0.2 meq/L, a colour boundary of 60 mg/L Pt, a salinity boundary of 0.5 parts per thousand, and a water mean depth boundary of 3 m. However, all classification variables showed considerable seasonal and interannual variation. Most lakes with a mean depth <3 m were polymictic, but stratification depended on lake size, complicating simple classification according to depth. Conditional inference tree analyses defined relatively clearly delineated groups of macrophytes, phytoplankton, and fish based on species presence, thereby confirming the relevance of using lake type classification. Alkalinity and salinity were the 2 most important factors and defined alkalinity split points at 0.07 and 0.76 meq/L and salinity split points between 0.5 parts per thousand and 4 parts per thousand. However, with a few exceptions, the individual taxa occurred over a broad range of lake characteristics. Lake classification may be necessary for management reasons, but the absence of well-defined boundaries among lake types and a large natural variability in morphological and chemical characteristics urge cautious decisions when defining targets for external nutrient loading reduction for the various lake categories.

JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYCOLOGY												Haslea ostrearia is a marine diatom known to produce marennine, a water-soluble blue-green pigment responsible for the greening of oysters in ponds along the French Atlantic coast. This phenomenon occurs seasonally when H. ostrearia blooms in oyster ponds, and it increases the economic value of cultured oysters. From an ecological perspective, H. ostrearia blooms are accompanied by a decrease in the abundance of other microalgae, suggesting that this diatom produces allelochemicals. Recent studies showed that purified marennine has other biological activities, for instance antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral activities, which could be used in aquaculture to promote this pigment as a natural antipathogen agent. One important issue regarding the possible use of H. ostrearia in aquaculture as a mixed algal diet, however, is the importance of marennine allelopathy. In this study, we investigated the allelopathic effect of H. ostrearia on the growth of five microalgal species relevant to aquaculture: Chaetoceros calcitrans, Skeletonema costatum, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Tetraselmis suecica, and Tisochrysis lutea. Allelopathic tests were realized by coculturing these microalgae with H. ostrearia in batch and in semi-continuous mode, based on initial biovolume ratios. Our findings showed that inhibition of the growth of microalgae due to the presence of H. ostrearia and marennine was species dependent. Skeletonema costatum, C. calcitrans, and T. lutea were significantly more sensitive, whereas T. suecica and P. tricornutum appeared to be more resistant. Growth irradiance significantly influenced the allelopathic effect against the sensitive species S. costatum, and the H. ostrearia production of marennine increases with irradiance. Data presented in this study partly support the hypothesis that marennine released into the culture medium possibly acts as an allelochemical compound, thus explaining the dominance of H. ostrearia and the loss of sensitive algae in oyster ponds, but also that some species are insensitive, which allows co-culturing and use in a mixed algal diet in aquaculture.					; Tremblay, Rejean/A-4971-2013; Decottignies, Priscilla/A-4894-2012; Cognie, Bruno/A-4906-2012; Widowati, Ita/GPK-2944-2022; PRASETIYA, FIDDY SEMBA/ABH-1561-2021	Tremblay, Rejean/0000-0003-2590-8915; Safitri, Ikha/0009-0008-5673-2450; Semba Prasetiya, Fiddy/0000-0001-6474-2319; Mouget, Jean-Luc/0000-0003-0154-7289; Cognie, Bruno/0000-0003-1018-5902; Gastineau, Romain/0000-0001-8661-5118; 													0921-8971	1573-5176				AUG	2016	28	4					2241	2254		10.1007/s10811-015-0779-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-015-0779-y													WOS:000383571300013

These networks are the dominant pathways for surface meltwater transport on this part of the ice sheet, but their fluvial morphometry has received little study. This paper utilizes high-resolution (2m) WorldView-1/2 images, digital elevation models, and GIS tools to present a detailed morphometric characterization (river number, river length, Strahler stream order, width, depth, bifurcation ratio, braiding index, drainage density, slope, and relief ratio) for 523 GrIS supraglacial river networks. A new algorithm is presented to determine Strahler stream order in supraglacial environments. Results show that (1) Supraglacial river networks are broadly similar to terrestrial landscapes in that they follow Horton's laws (river number, mean river length, and slope versus stream order), widen downstream, and have comparable mean bifurcation ratios (3.7 +/- 1.9) and braiding indices; (2) unlike terrestrial systems, supraglacial drainage densities (0.90-4.75km/km(2)) have no correlation with elevation relief, but instead display a weakly inverse correlation with ice surface elevation; (3) both well-developed (e.g., fifth-order) and discrete (e.g., first-order) supraglacial river networks form on the ice sheet, with the latter associated with short flow distances upstream of a terminal moulin; (4) mean river flow widths increase substantially, but flow depths only modestly, with increasing stream order. Viewed collectively, the 523 supraglacial river networks studied here display fluvial morphometries both similar and dissimilar to terrestrial systems, with moulin capture an important physical process driving the latter.

Vegetation, disturbance, and climate history since the onset of ice-free conditions in the Lago Rosselot sector of Chiloe continental (44°S), northwestern Patagonia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We present results from Lago Negro, a small closed-basin lake adjacent to Lago Rosselot, to examine the vegetation and environmental history of an insufficiently studied sector of Chiloe Continental (41 degrees 30'-44 degrees S) in northwestern Patagonia. Lake sediment cores from Lago Negro reveal 27 tephra deposited since similar to 12.7 ka, including two prominent rhyodacite tephra marker beds erupted from Volcan Melimoyu, and a stratified basal clastic unit we attribute to meltwater discharge from an ice tongue that originated from Monte Queulat and covered Lago Rosselot during its expanded position, presumably Antarctic Cold Reversal in age. The pollen record shows closed-canopy North Patagonian rainforests since similar to 12.7 ka, with variations in species composition and structure that suggest dynamic responses of the vegetation to past environmental changes. Vegetation responses to climate in the Lago Negro record were modulated, sometimes interrupted, by high magnitude and frequent disturbance regimes, most notably during maxima in explosive volcanic activity (similar to 9.5-7.2 ka and similar to 3.6-1.6 ka) and heightened fire activity. Since Lago Negro is the southernmost palynological site so far investigated in the region and is located within a volcanically active sector, it provides a valuable perspective for assessing past vegetation responses along environmental gradients since the last glaciation. When compared with other sites throughout northwestern Patagonia, our record reveals a distinct north-to-south gradient in temperature and precipitation, with peak temperature and rainfall seasonality in the north, and a west-to-east gradient in disturbance regimes, with maximum frequency and magnitude of explosive volcanic events in the east. These gradients have modulated the response of rainforest vegetation to climate forcing at regional scale since similar to 12.7 ka. We identify negligible differences in timing for the majority of key vegetation signals during the initial phase of the Lago Negro record, and propose that plant colonization and expansion along the similar to 360 km long corridor through the Pacific slope of the northwestern Patagonian Andes was a rapid process during the Last Glacial Termination.

Distribution and ecological preferences of the freshwater lineage LimA (genus Limnohabitans) revealed by a new double hybridization approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The ecological relevance and factors shaping dynamics of Limnohabitans sp. have been largely studied by fluorescence in situ hybridization with a 16S rRNA probe targeting the R-BT group (lineages LimBCDE), but not lineage LimA. Consequently, ecology and distribution of LimA remained unknown. We developed a double hybridization strategy using a novel 23S rRNA probe specifically targeting LimA and LimE that in combination with the existing R-BT probe can discriminate LimA populations. This technique was applied for more than 1000 samples from 46 freshwater sites including long-term data sets from oligo-mesotrophic Lake Zurich, CH and meso-eutrophic Rimov reservoir, CZ. LimA was ubiquitously distributed and highly abundant. Observed ecological preferences of LimA in Lake Zurich were in general similar to already reported for Limnohabitans with highest numbers in surface waters during growing seasons. Three times higher densities of LimA were detected in Rimov reservoir, where they were significantly more abundant at the riverine zone especially after flood events that introduced fresh terrestrial DOM (dissolved organic matter). Moreover,statistical analyses of biological and physicochemical parameters obtained from small dynamic water bodies confirmed a correspondence between LimA and allochthonous DOM, in opposite to R-BT that was more related to algal primary production.					; Šimek, Karel/AAB-1956-2021; Znachor, Petr/F-8901-2014; Kasalicky, Vojtech/F-8578-2014; Nedoma, Jiri/F-9063-2014; Salcher, Michaela/A-1141-2013; Shabarova, Tanja/B-5327-2015; Pernthaler, Jakob/A-2257-2008	Pernthaler, Jakob/0000-0001-7558-909X; Kasalicky, Vojtech/0000-0002-9132-8321; Simek, Karel/0000-0002-7058-9063; Posch, Thomas/0000-0001-5145-3761; Salcher, Michaela/0000-0003-1063-6523; Shabarova, Tanja/0000-0003-4526-3587; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				MAR	2017	19	3					1296	1309		10.1111/1462-2920.13663	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.13663								28063252					WOS:000397525100036

Here, we determined which of the basal resources mostly contribute to the food webs in a floodplain lake of the Middle Parana River using isotopic composition of C and N (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of potential food sources in the Parana floodplain (Argentina). We analyzed if organic matter sources isotope of C and N differ between flooding and low water seasons, and analyzed the isotopic niche representations of consumers in order to characterize niches width and intraguilds overlapping. To estimate the contribution of different sources of carbon to primary consumers, we measured the stable isotopic compositions of bottom sediment organic matter, coarse particulate organic matter, biofilm, suspended particulate organic matter, epiphyton, phytoplankton, C3 and C4 macrophytes and riparian tree leaves, benthic macroinvertebrates, aquatic orthopterans and fishes in dry and flooding seasons. The packages Stable Isotope Analysis and the Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses algorithm in R were calculated to compare the C and N isotopic variability between the primary consumers and their sources. The energy sources available for benthic organisms mainly originated from autochthonous sources based on the C3 photosynthesis pathway. The isotopic signatures of sources and primary consumers did not differ significantly between low and high water seasons. Our results demonstrated a higher contribution to primary consumers of 0 macrophytes and low contributions of C4 for herbivores; biofilm and benthic organic matter for gatherer collectors (Oligochaeta and Chironominae); epiphyton for ephemeropterans, amphipods and fishes, whereas biofilm was the most important source for mussels.

J	Hsu, TTD; Mitsch, WJ; Martin, JF; Lee, J				Hsu, Tsung-Ta David; Mitsch, William J.; Martin, Jay F.; Lee, Jiyoung			Towards sustainable protection of public health: The role of an urban wetland as a frontline safeguard of pathogen and antibiotic resistance spread	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wetlands are known for providing important ecosystem services, such as reduction of eutrophication. However, less research has focused on public health service of wetlands: their ability to protect microbial quality of water for downstream while they attract wildlife populations. For urban surface water, transmission of antibiotic resistance is also an important concern. Under anticipated climate change scenarios, more extreme precipitation patterns are emerging. Thus, runoff and flooding from increased precipitation will impair surface water quality more significantly. The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate the dynamics of bacteria of public health concern in urban wetlands, including: Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Arcobacter, and two antibiotic resistance genes (sulfonamide, sul1 and tetracycline, tetQ); and 2) identify the major fecal contamination sources using microbial source tracking (MST). Water samples were collected across the urban wetlands in central Ohio from June 2013 to June 2014 and tested with a culture-based (E. coli) and quantitative PCR (the rest) methods. Since Canada geese were the most observed wildlife at the study sites and they are known to carry an array of infectious disease agents, their fecal samples were also collected. From the water samples, E. coli (fecal indicator) had the highest occurrence in 99.2% of the total samples, followed by sul1 (98.3%), Arcobacter (94.9%), STEC (74.6%), tetQ (58.5%), and Campylobacter (1.7%). Overall reduction in E. coli was 22.3% across the wetlands, but variation was observed depending on the season. Microbial source tracking suggested a high prevalence of avian- (44.9%) and ruminant- (38.1%) originated fecal contaminations (e.g., Canada geese and deer). From the geese fecal samples, STEC (93.2%) and Arcobacter (4.5%) were detected, which could potentially compromise wetlands functions in reductions in bacteria of public health concern and antibiotic resistance. The results suggest that careful wildlife management together with long-term monitoring of microorganisms of concern are needed for making urban wetlands as a sustainable frontline safeguard of pathogen and antibiotic resistance spread in surface water.

J	Xia, YQ; Yan, XY				Xia, Yongqiu; Yan, Xiaoyuan			Ecologically optimal nitrogen application rates for rice cropping in the Taihu Lake region of China	SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE												Excessive nitrogen (N) fertilization in intensive agricultural areas in the Taihu Lake region of East China has resulted in low N utilization efficiency and serious environmental problems, giving rise to the need for an urgent reduction in the N fertilization rate. However, no holistic evaluations of rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield effect and environmental effects of N fertilization have been conducted when recommending an optimal N rate. The current study provides an economic indicator and an evaluation model to account for the environmental effects of different N losses after N fertilizer application in the ecological and economic N rate for one rice season in the Taihu Lake region. Based on the assembled data and economic index, a general economic evaluation model to measure efficiently the cascading costs of the chemical N cycle at the regional scale was developed. Thereafter, fertilizer-stimulated benefit curves and fertilizer-induced cost curves were generated to determine an economically and ecologically optimal N application rate. The results revealed that the maximum net benefits were 3,123 yuan ha(-1) at 202 kg N ha(-1) for one rice season in the Taihu Lake region. Additional N application up to a rate of 263 kg N ha(-1) would increase rice production, but the increase in the total marginal costs would be slightly greater than the increase in marginal benefits. Among the marginal costs, the fertilizer and acidification costs were the greatest expenses, amounting to 1,716 yuan at 263 kg N ha(-1), followed by eutrophication and global warming costs. When compared with the conventional N fertilization rate, this recommended rate could decrease the amount of N applied to rice from 10 to 40%, thereby, enabling optimum economic and ecological results.

In this study, we identify the temporal- spatial characteristics and driving factors of the hydrochemical components in Baiyangdian Lake using geochemical methods (Gibbs diagram, Piper diagram and End-element diagram of ion ratio) and multivariate statistical techniques (Principal component analysis and Correlation analysis). 16 sets of samples were collected from Baiyangdian Lake in May (normal season), July (flood season), and December (dry season) of 2022. Results indicate significant spatial variation in Na+, Cl-, SO42- and NO3- , suggesting a strong influence of human activities. Cation concentrations exhibit greater seasonal variation in the dry season compared to the flood season, while the concentrations of the four anions show inconsistent seasonal changes due to the combined effects of river water chemical composition and human activities. The hydro- chemical type of Baiyangdian Lake is primarily HCO3'Cl-Na'Ca2+, Mg2+ and HCO3- originate mainly from silicate and carbonate rock dissolution, while K+, Na+ and Cl- originate mainly from sewage and salt dissolution in sediments. SO42- may mainly stem from industrial wastewater, while NO3- primarily originates from animal feces and domestic sewage. Through the use of Principal Component Analysis, it is identified that water-rock interaction (silicate and carbonate rocks dissolution, and dissolution of salt in sediments), carbonate sedimentation, sewage, agricultural fertilizer and manure, and nitrification are the main driving factors of the variation of hydrochemical components of Baiyangdian Lake across three hydrological seasons. These findings suggest the need for effective control of substandard domestic sewage discharge, optimization of agricultural fertilization strategies, and proper management of animal manure to comprehensively improve the water environment in Baiyangdian Lake.

The use of nutrient budget approach for informing eutrophication management in urbanised shallow coastal lakes: A case study from Lake Nokoue in Benin	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												Lake Nokoue in Benin supports the livelihoods of more than 500.000 people through fish production and sand mining. However, its health is jeopardised by eutrophication and excessive growth of the invasive water hyacinth, which dies off and sink to sediment during dry seasons when the lake's salinity increases due to tidal intrusion. Water-hyacinth constitutes then a potential source of internal nutrient loading through the decomposition of detritus and therefore can exacerbate eutrophication problems. An important management question is whether the removal of water hyacinth before it dies would significantly reduce eutrophication problems through the removal of nutrients. To compare the amount of nutrients removed by water-hyacinth biomass to the amount of nutrients transported into the Lake, mass-balance approach has been taken. Nutrient concentrations, water hyacinth cover, and hydrological inflows were measured over a 12 month period from November 2016 to October 2017. Water-hyacinth biomass estimation was based on a calibrated NDVI and field measurement relationship. In total the hyacinth covered up to 18 km(2) (10%) of the lake, corresponding to 80,000 tonnes of dry weight which sink to the bottom each year when salinity rise. The potential internal nutrient loaded from hyacinth to the system was estimated to 1021 tonnes of nitrogen (8% of external input) and 231 tonnes of phosphorus (40% of external input). Considering that the tidal nutrient output compensates almost all the external nutrient inputs (about 70%), part of the nutrient available for eutrophication must come from internal sources, likely through the decomposition of sediment detritus.

Study focus: Recent drawdown of the delta's abundant shallow lakes and rivers has deteriorated vital habitat for wildlife and impaired navigation routes. Here, we report continuous measurements at similar to 50 lakes during open-water seasons of 2018 and 2019 to improve understanding of hydrological processes causing lake-level variation. New hydrological insights for the region: Analyses reveal four patterns of lake-level variation attributable to influential hydrological processes, which provide the basis for a new lake classification scheme: 1) 'Drawdown' (>= 15 cm decline) by evaporation and/or outflow after ice-jam floods, 2) 'Stable' lake levels (<15 cm change) sustained by rainfall, 3) 'Gradual Rise' by inundation from the open-drainage network, and 4) 'Rapid Rise' by input of river floodwater. River flooding during the open-water season is an under-recognized recharge mechanism yet occurred extensively in the Athabasca sector and appears to be a common occurrence based on the Athabasca River hydrometric record. Lake-level loggers show strong ability to track shifts in hydrological processes, and can be integrated with other methods to decipher their causes and ecological consequences across water-rich landscapes.

However, the differential characteristics and driving mechanisms of bacterial community structures in the ice, water, and sediments of seasonally frozen lakes remain unclear. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to analyze and compare the structure, function, network characteristics, and assembly mechanisms of bacterial communities in the ice, water, and sediment of Wuliangsuhai, a typical cold region in Inner Mongolia. The results showed that the bacterial communities in the ice and water phases had similar diversity and composition, with Proteobacteria, Bacteroidota, Actinobacteria, Campilobacterota, and Cyanobacteria as dominant phyla. The bacterial communities in sediments displayed significant differences from ice and water, with Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Desulfobacterota, and Acidobacteriota being the dominant phyla. Notably, the bacterial communities in water exhibited higher spatial variability in their distribution than those in ice and sediment. This study also revealed that during the frozen period, the bacterial community species in the ice, water, and sediment media were dominated by cooperative relationships. Community assembly was primarily influenced by stochastic processes, with dispersal limitation and drift identified as the two most significant factors within this process. However, heterogeneous selection also played a significant role in the community composition. Furthermore, functions related to nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, carbon, and hydrogen cycling vary among bacterial communities in ice, water, and sediment. These findings elucidate the intrinsic mechanisms driving variability in bacterial community structure and changes in water quality across different media phases (ice, water, and sediment) in cold-zone lakes during the freezing period, offering new insights for water environmental protection and ecological restoration efforts in such environments.																			0147-6513	1090-2414				OCT 1	2024	284								116903	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116903	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116903		AUG 2024						39205354					WOS:001306825900001
J	Hansen, CH; Williams, GP				Hansen, Carly Hyatt; Williams, Gustavious Paul			Evaluating Remote Sensing Model Specification Methods for Estimating Water Quality in Optically Diverse Lakes throughout the Growing Season	HYDROLOGY												Spectral images from remote sensing platforms are extensively used to estimate chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations for water quality studies. Empirical models used for estimation are often based on physical principles related to light absorption and emission properties of chl-a and generally relying on spectral bands in the green, blue, and near-infrared bands. Because the physical characteristics, constituents, and algae populations vary widely from lake to lake, it can be difficult to estimate coefficients for these models. Many studies select a model form that is a function of these bands, determine model coefficients by correlating remotely-measured surface reflectance data and coincidentally measured in-situ chl-a concentrations, and then apply the model to estimate chl-a concentrations for the entire water body. Recent work has demonstrated an alternative approach using simple statistical learning methods (Multiple Linear Stepwise Regression (MLSR)) which uses historical, non-coincident field data to develop sub-seasonal remote sensing chl-a models. We extend this previous work by comparing this method against models from literature, and explore model performance for a region of lakes in Central Utah with varying optical complexity, including two relatively clear intermountain reservoirs (Deer Creek and Jordanelle) and a highly turbid, shallow lake (Utah Lake). This study evaluates the suitability of these different methods for model parameterization for this area and whether a sub-seasonal approach improves performance of standard model forms from literature. We found that while some of the common spectral bands used in literature are selected by the data-driven MLSR method for the lakes in the study region, there are also other spectral bands and band interactions that are often more significant for these lakes. Comparison of model fit shows an improvement in model fit using the data-driven parameterization method over the more traditional physics-based modeling approaches from literature. This suggests that the sub-seasonal approach and exploitation of information contained in other bands helps account for lake-specific optical characteristics, such as suspended solids and other constituents contributing to water color, as well as unique (and season-specific) algae populations, which contribute to the spectral signature of the lake surface, rather than only relying on a generalized optical signature of chl-a. Consideration of these other bands is important for development of models for long-term and entire growing season applications in optically diverse water bodies.

The Early Miocene Critical Zone at Karungu, Western Kenya: An Equatorial, Open Habitat with Few Primate Remains	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Early Miocene outcrops near Karungu, Western Kenya, preserve a range of fluvio-lacustrine, lowland landscapes that contain abundant fossils of terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. Primates are notably rare among these remains, although nearby early Miocene strata on Rusinga Island contain a rich assemblage of fossilized catarrhines and strepsirrhines. To explore possible environmental controls on the occurrence of early Miocene primates, we performed a deep-time Critical Zone (DTCZ) reconstruction focused on floodplain paleosols at the Ngira locality in Karungu. We specifically focused on a single stratigraphic unit (NG15), which preserves moderately developed paleosols that contain a microvertebrate fossil assemblage. Although similarities between deposits at Karungu and Rusinga Island are commonly assumed, physical sedimentary processes, vegetative cover, soil hydrology, and some aspects of climate state are notably different between the two areas. Estimates of paleoclimate parameters using paleosol B horizon elemental chemistry and morphologic properties are consistent with seasonal, dry subhumid conditions, occasional waterlogging, and herbaceous vegetation. The reconstructed small mammal community indicates periodic waterlogging and open-canopy conditions. Based on the presence of herbaceous root traces, abundant microcharcoal, and pedogenic carbonates with high stable carbon isotope ratios, we interpret NG15 to have formed under a warm, seasonally dry, open riparian woodland to wooded grassland, in which at least a subset of the vegetation was likely C-4 biomass. Our results, coupled with previous paleoenvironmental interpretations for deposits on Rusinga Island, demonstrate that there was considerable environmental heterogeneity ranging from open to closed habitats in the early Miocene. We hypothesize that the relative paucity of primates at Karungu was driven by their environmental preference for locally abundant closed canopy vegetation, which was likely absent at Karungu, at least during the NG15 interval if not also earlier and later intervals that have not yet been studied in as much detail.

Sinninghe; Villanueva, Laura			Potential recycling of thaumarchaeotal lipids by DPANN Archaea in seasonally hypoxic surface marine sediments	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Thaumarchaeota synthesize specific glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), the distribution of which is affected by temperature, thereby forming the basis of the paleotemperature proxy, TEX86. Lipids in marine surface sediments are believed to be derived mainly from pelagic Thaumarchaeota; however, some studies have evaluated the possibility that benthic Archaea also contribute to the lipid fossil record. Here, we compared the archaeal abundance and composition from DNA-based methods with the archaeal intact polar lipid (IPL) diversity in surface sediments of a seasonally hypoxic marine lake to determine the potential biological sources of the sedimentary archaeal IPLs under changing environmental conditions. The archaeal community changed from March (oxic conditions) to August (euxinic) from a Thaumarchaeota-dominated community (up to 82%) to an archaeal community dominated by the DPANN super phylum (up to 95%). This marked change coincided with a one order of magnitude decrease in the total IPL-GDGT abundance. In addition, IPL-GDGTs with a glyco polar head group increased. This may indicate a transition to Thaumarchaeota growing in stationary phase or selective preservation of the GDGT pool. In addition, considering the apparent inability of the DPANN Archaea to synthesize their own membrane lipids, we hypothesize that the dominant DPANN Archaea population present in August use the lipids synthesized previously by the Thaumarchaeota or other Archaea to form their own cell membranes, which would indicate an active recycling of fossil IPLs in the marine surface sediment.

This group of bows has allowed different aspects of prehistoric archery to be considered. Firstly with regard to the manufacturing processes of these weapons, which show great uniformity in terms of the raw material used, but some variety in shapes and sizes. Secondly about the socioeconomic significance of weapons in societies which no longer based their economy on hunting and gathering. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Response of glacier basal motion to transient water storage	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												Basal motion of glaciers is responsible for short-term variations in glacier velocity(1-6). At the calving fronts of marine-terminating outlet glaciers, accelerated basal motion has led to increased ice discharge and thus is tightly connected to sea level rise(1,7). Subglacial water passes through dynamic conduits that are fed by distributed linked cavities at the bed, and plays a critical role in setting basal motion(8). However, neither measured subglacial water pressure nor the volume of water in storage can fully explain basal motion(2-6,8,9). Here, we use global positioning system observations to document basal motion during highly variable inputs of water from diurnal and seasonal melt, and from an outburst flood at Kennicott Glacier, Alaska. We find that glacier velocity increases when englacial and subglacial water storage is increasing. We suggest that whenever water inputs exceed the ability of the existing conduits to transmit water, the conduits pressurize and drive water back into the areally extensive linked cavity system. This in turn promotes basal motion. Sustained high melt rates do not imply continued rapid basal motion, however, because the subglacial conduit system evolves to greater efficiency. Large pulses of water to the bed can overwhelm the subglacial hydrologic network and incite basal motion, potentially explaining recent accelerations of the Greenland Ice Sheet(3), where rapid drainage of large surficial melt ponds delivers water through cold ice(10).

Microbial processes in the weathering crust aquifer of a temperate glacier	CRYOSPHERE												Incident solar radiation absorbed within the ablation zone of glaciers generates a shallow perched aquifer and seasonal icebound microbial habitat. During the melt seasons of 2014 and 2015, borehole investigations were used to examine the physical, geochemical, and microbiological properties in the near-surface ice and aquifer of the temperate Matanuska Glacier (south-central Alaska). Based on temperature, solar forcing, and ice optical properties, the dissipation of shortwave radiation promoted internal melting and the formation of a weathering crust with a maximum depth of similar to 2 m. Boreholes into the weathering crust provided access to water percolating through the porous ice. The water had low ion concentrations (4-12 mu S cm 1), was aerobic (12 mg O-2 L-1), contained 200 to 8300 cells mL(-1), and harbored growing populations with estimated in situ generation times of 11 to 14 days. During the melt season, the upper 2 m of ice experienced at least 3% of the surface photosynthetically active radiation flux and possessed a fractional water content as high as 10 %. Photosynthetic subsistence of biogeochemical reactions in the weathering crust ecosystem was supported by ex situ metabolic experiments and the presence of phototrophic taxa (cyanobacteria, golden and green algae) in the aquifer samples. Meltwater durations of similar to 7.5 months coupled with the growth estimates imply biomass may increase by 4 orders of magnitude each year. Our results provide insight into how seasonal dynamics affect habitability of near-surface ice and microbial processes in a portion of the glacial biome poised to expand in extent with increasing global temperature and ablation season duration.

Marine-derived nutrients, bioturbation, and ecosystem metabolism: reconsidering the role of salmon in streams	ECOLOGY												In coastal areas of the North Pacific Ocean, annual returns of spawning salmon provide a substantial influx of nutrients and organic matter to streams and are generally believed to enhance the productivity of recipient ecosystems. Loss of this subsidy from areas with diminished salmon runs has been hypothesized to limit ecosystem productivity in juvenile salmon rearing habitats (lakes and streams), thereby reinforcing population declines. Using five to seven years of data from an Alaskan stream supporting moderate salmon densities, we show that salmon predictably increased stream water nutrient concentrations, which were on average 190% (nitrogen) and 390% (phosphorus) pre-salmon values, and that primary producers incorporated some of these nutrients into tissues. However, benthic algal biomass declined by an order of magnitude despite increased nutrients. We also measured changes in stream ecosystem metabolic properties, including gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), from three salmon streams by analyzing diel measurements of oxygen concentrations and stable isotopic ratios (delta O-18-O-2) within a Bayesian statistical model of oxygen dynamics. Our results do not support a shift toward higher primary productivity with the return of salmon, as is expected from a nutrient fertilization mechanism. Rather, net ecosystem metabolism switched from approximately net autotrophic (GPP >= ER) to a strongly net heterotrophic state (GPP << ER) in response to bioturbation of benthic habitats by salmon. Following the seasonal arrival of salmon, GPP declined to <12% of pre-salmon rates, while ER increased by over threefold. Metabolism by live salmon could not account for the observed increase in ER early in the salmon run, suggesting salmon nutrients and disturbance enhanced in situ heterotrophic respiration. Salmon also changed the physical properties of the stream, increasing air-water gas exchange by nearly 10-fold during peak spawning. We suggest that management efforts to restore salmon ecosystems should consider effects on ecosystem metabolic properties and how salmon disturbance affects the incorporation of marine-derived nutrients into food webs.

Short-term bacterial community composition dynamics in response to accumulation and breakdown of Microcystis blooms	WATER RESEARCH												Short-term bacterial community composition (BCC) dynamics in response to accumulation and breakdown of Microcystis blooms were examined by conducting in situ mesocosm experiments with varying levels of Microcystis sp. biomass, ranging from 15 to 3217 mu g/L as measured by chlorophyll-a concentration in the freshwater water column. The BCC was assessed by means of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of 16S ribosomal RNA genes followed by cloning and sequencing of selected samples. The results showed that the composition of both free-living and particle-attached bacterial communities changed during the accumulation and breakdown phases of a Microcystis bloom, and differences were also evident with different levels of Microcystis biomass. The relative abundance of bacteria affiliated with Micrococcineae and Legionellales increased in general after amendment with Microcystis. Significant correlation between the relative abundance of Micrococcineae and breakdown of Microcystis biomass was also observed. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that the changes in the free-living and particle-attached bacterial community were mostly related to the changes in the concentrations of chlorophyll-a, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH, which were mainly induced by the breakdown of Microcystis biomass. Overall, our study revealed the following: i) accumulation of Microcystis blooms and their breakdown have strong impacts on bacterial community composition; ii) there might be saprophytic association between Micrococcineae and decomposition of Microcystis biomass; iii) it is necessary to reveal potential associations between Legionellales organisms and Microcystis blooms in eutrophic freshwater lakes.

Oceanic migration behaviour of tropical Pacific eels from Vanuatu	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Information on oceanic migrations and spawning areas of tropical Pacific freshwater eels (genus Anguilla) is very limited. Lake Letas and its single outflowing river, Mbe Solomul on Gaua Island, Vanuatu, were surveyed for large migrating individuals. Twenty-four Anguilla marmorata (87 to 142 cm), 39 A. megastoma (50 to 131 cm), and 3 A. obscura (119 to 126 cm) were caught. Seven individuals were tagged with pop-up satellite transmitters and released offshore. One A. marmorata migrated 843 km towards the South Equatorial Current. The tag surfaced only 330 km from the point where the smallest leptocephalus has been captured so far. Tags on A. megastoma and A. obscura popped up within the archipelago. All 3 species exhibited pronounced diel vertical migrations. Eels descended from around 200 m nighttime depth, to 320 (A. obscura), 650 (A. marmorata), and 750 m (A. megastoma) during the day. A clear impact of the lunar cycle on the upper limit of migration depths was found in A. marmorata (full moon: 230 m, new moon: 170 m). These behaviours may be explained as a trade-off between predator avoidance and the necessity to maintain a sufficiently high metabolism for migration.

The collected samples were examined for their physicochemical parameters (pH, EC, TDS, TOC, and turbidity), heavy metals, namely chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn), and bacteriological parameters (aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and total coliforms). All the physicochemical parameters obtained were within the recommended guidelines set by the World Health Orga-nization (WHO, 2011). Among the metals, Fe, Ni, and Zn were found to be higher than the recommended guideline values in the dry season. A significant (p < 0.05) positive correlation was found between Cu and Zn indicating that water pollution by these two metals may have originated from common anthropogenic sources. The present study revealed, for the first time, that the river Gomti was considerably polluted with bacterial populations. Identified in the water samples include Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Bacillus licheniformis, Alcaligenes sp., Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella sp., Bacillus megaterium, Enterobacter sp., and Staphylococcus sp. The presence of Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli in the bacterial isolates is certainly a major water quality concern. Aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and total coliform counts were found to be 0.45 x 102 to 1.84 x 104 CFU/mL and 0.05 x 102 to 7.32 x 103 CFU/mL, respectively, which were above the permissible limits of WHO (2011) and are deemed unfit for drinking and domestic purposes, and fish culture. From this study, the priority pollutants of concern in the Gomti River water are Fe, Ni, Zn, aerobic heterotrophic bacteria, and total coliforms. Considering the importance of the Gomti River in the national economy of Bangladesh, appropriate water management along with the Best Management Practices in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems should be adopted.

Methods: The research modeled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) spreading and dissemination patterns sensitivity by redesigning time series data extraction of daily new cases in terms of deviation consistency concerning variables that sustain COVID-19 transmission. The approach opened a new scenario where seasonality forcing behavior was introduced to understand SARS-COV-2 non-linear dynamics due to heterogeneity and confounding epidemics scenarios. Results: The main research results are the elucidation of three birth- and death-forced seasonality persistence phases that can explain COVID-19 skew patterns worldwide. They are presented in the following order: (1) the environmental variables (Earth seasons and atmospheric conditions); (2) health policies and adult learning education (HPALE) interventions; (3) urban spaces (local indoor and outdoor spaces for transit and social-cultural interactions, public or private, with natural physical features (river, lake, terrain). Conclusions: Three forced seasonality phases (positive to negative skew) phases were pointed out as a theoretical framework to explain uncertainty found in the predictive SIR model equations that might diverge in outcomes expected to express the disease's behaviour.					; Telles, CHARLES/B-7046-2018	Lopes, Henrique/0000-0002-7586-401X; ROBERTO TELLES, CHARLES/0000-0001-9624-2423; Franco, Diogo/0000-0002-9046-0435														2073-8994				APR	2021	13	4							676	10.3390/sym13040676	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym13040676													WOS:000643660600001

Yet, there is still limited knowledge on bacterial seasonal dynamics in lotic environments. This study explores a temporal pattern of bacterial community structures in lotic freshwater over a 2-year period. The aquatic bacterial communities were assessed using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Overall, the communities were dominated by alpha-, beta-, and gamma-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Flavobacteriia, and Sphingobacteriia. The bacterial compositions varied substantially in response to seasonal changes (cold vs. warm), but they were rather stable within the same season. Furthermore, higher diversity was observed in cold seasons compared to warm periods. The combined seasonal-environmental impact of different physico-chemical parameters was assessed statistically, and temperature, suspended solids, and nitrogen were determined to be the primary abiotic factors shaping the temporal bacterial assemblages. This study enriches particular knowledge on the seasonal succession of the lotic freshwater bacteria.					; Paruch, Lisa/AAZ-8253-2021; Paruch, Adam/ABG-7328-2020	Paruch, Adam M./0000-0003-4392-7239; Paruch, Lisa/0000-0002-8593-9994; 													2045-2322					OCT 2	2020	10	1							16399	10.1038/s41598-020-73293-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73293-9								33009479					WOS:000577151300005

Telemetry reveals limited exchange of walleye between Lake Erie and Lake Huron: Movement of two populations through the Huron-Erie corridor	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Immigration and emigration of individuals among populations influence population dynamics and are important considerations for managing exploited populations. Lake Huron and Lake Erie walleye (Sander vitreus) populations are managed separately although the interconnecting Huron-Erie Corridor provides an unimpeded passageway. Acoustic telemetry was used to estimate inter-lake exchange and movement within St. Clair River and Detroit River. Of 492 adult walleyes tagged and released during 2011 and 2012, one fish from Tittabawassee River (Lake Huron; 1 of 259, 0.39%) and one individual from Maumee River (Lake Erie; 1 of 233, 0.43%) exchanged lakes during 2011-2014. However, both fish returned to the lake where tagged prior to the next spawning season. The one walleye from Maumee River that moved to Lake Huron made repeated round-trips between Lake Erie and lake Huron during three consecutive years. Of twelve fish tagged in the Tittabawassee River detected in the Huron-Erie Corridor, few (n = 3) moved south of Lake St. Clair to the Detroit River. Ten walleye tagged in the Maumee River entered the Huron-Erie Corridor, and five were detected in the St. Clair River. Our hypothesis that walleye spawning in Maumee River, Lake Erie, served as a source population to Lake Huron ("sink population") was not supported by our results. Emigration of walleye to Lake Huron from other populations than the Maumee River, such as those that spawn on in-lake reefs, or from Lake St. Clair may contribute to Lake Huron walleye populations.

J	Libanda, B; Nkolola, NB				Libanda, Brigadier; Nkolola, Namwiinga Babra			Skill of CMIP5 models in simulating rainfall over Malawi	MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT												Unravelling future projections of precipitation at the local scale is vitally important for building a climate-resilient economy and for the formulations of National Policies on Climate Change. Central to the entire discipline of climate projections is the use of models. However, model performance varies from one region to another. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the performance of 18 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) historical simulations of precipitation over Malawi against rain gauge data. The period of study runs from 1982 to 2005. Statistical analyses were extensively carried out at both spatial and temporal scales using the following metrics: correlation coefficient (R), bias, percentage bias (PBias), standard deviation (STDEV), root mean square error (RMSE), and trend. At spatial scales, Hovmoller diagrams (HD) were used to analyse model simulations. Results indicate that the models adequately reproduce the expected annual cycle of rainfall although similar to 77% of them overestimate rain gauge data. Further, only nine of the models analysed correlate positively with rain gauge data. The correlation ranges from - 0.2 to 0.43. Seasonal root mean square errors (RMSEs) are largest during the core of the rainy season (December-February), the beginning (September-October), and the end (March-May), respectively. Rainy gauge data showed that the highest standard deviation was in the north-eastern parts of the country and around the Lake Malawi region. In general, most models poorly simulated the spatial standard deviation. Although there are large variations in model performance, models that generally perform better than others are: CNRM-CM5, EC-EARTH, GISS-E2-H, and MPI-ESM-LR. While these models are identified as well performing, their deficiencies have also been extensively discussed in this work, and therefore, caution needs to be exercised by end users when using these models to make decisions pertaining to climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.					; , Libanda/N-9781-2019	NKOLOLA, Babra Namwiinga/0009-0000-9857-1482; Libanda, Brigadier/0000-0001-8215-5572													2363-6203	2363-6211				DEC	2019	5	4					1615	1626		10.1007/s40808-019-00611-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40808-019-00611-0													WOS:000491437600035

The results showed that the Cu and Zn concentrations in the wetland soils were 6.83-342.54 mgkg(-1) and 34.39-195.36 mgkg(-1), respectively. The highest heavy metal concentrations were found in the wetland soils located in the lower reaches of mines and metal smelters. The metal speciation analysis showed that Cu and Zn were mainly linked to the residual fraction in all samples which account for 65.64% and 68.14%, respectively. The content of the exchangeable fraction (Cu 1.00%, Zn 3.60%) and carbonate fraction (Cu 2.09%, Zn 1.53%) was generally lower. Assessments of pollution levels revealed that Cu and Zn were much higher than their background value and heavy metal pollution in the wetland soils located in the lower reaches of mines and metal smelters was often more severe.

As a proxy for heat tolerance we measured time to immobilization (T-imm) for 25 clonal lineages isolated from a single lake. The clonal lineages were grown on Chlamydomonas reinhardii at 15 degrees C. Upon deposition of the first clutch, T-imm and body fatty acids were determined. We report significant differences of T-imm and of the content of PUFAs and of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) among the D. magna clonal lineages. T-imm was negatively related to total PUFA-content, indicating that increased body PUFA-content may be detrimental for membrane properties at high temperatures. Juvenile somatic growth varied significantly among clonal lineages, and was not related to total body PUFA-content, hence body PUFA-content was no proxy for PUFA-limitation. No correlative evidence for an impact of body EPA-content on T-imm or juvenile growth was obtained. We hypothesize that the observed intra-population variability of body PUFA-content might be related to potentially different amplitudes in diel vertical migration in response to fish. These different amplitudes would mean differences in the extent of diurnal temperature fluctuations among the clonal lineages.					von Elert, Eric/S-1666-2018; Ilić, Maja/AAO-9143-2020	von Elert, Eric/0000-0001-7758-716X; Ilic, Maja/0000-0002-8387-9932													0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	2019	846	1					17	26		10.1007/s10750-018-3769-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3769-7													WOS:000504323100003

This study aims to im-prove knowledge of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) transport in low permeability agricultural watersheds by consid-ering spatial and temporal trends of surface water nutrient concentrations in relation to hydroclimatic drivers, sediment quality, shallow hyporheic exchange, groundwater quality, and tile drain discharge over a 14-month field study in a clay hydrosystem of the Lake Huron basin, one of the five Great Lakes. Results found that events of varying magnitude and intensity enhanced nutrient release from overland flow and subsurface pathways. Tile drain discharge was found to be a consistent and elevated source of P and N to surface waters when flowing, mobilizing both diffuse nutrients from fertilizer application and legacy stores in the vadose zone. Surface water quality was temporally vari-able at the seasonal and event scale. Targeted sampling following fertilization periods, snowmelt, and moderate pre-cipitation events revealed catchment wide elevated nutrient concentrations, emphasizing the need for targeted sampling regimes. Controls other than discharge magnitude and overland flow were found to contribute to peak nutri-ent concentrations, including internal nitrate loading, soil-snowmelt interaction, catchment wetness, and freeze thaw cycles. Sediments were found to store P in calcium minerals and have a high P storage capacity. Instream mechanisms such as sediment P fixation and hyporheic exchange may play a role in mediating surface water quality, but currently have no discernable benefit to year-round surface water nutrient concentrations. Best management practices need to focus on reducing sources of agricultural nutrients (e.g., field phosphorus concentrations and tile drain discharge loading) at the watershed scale to reduce nutrient concentrations and export in flashy clay catchments.

Seasonal measurements were performed in two reservoirs that pertain to the same hydrological basin but are drastically different in terms of allochthonous carbon input. These results were used to feed a mass balance model, from which a large number of overall parameters were determined to explicitly describe the dynamics and spatial attributes of the carbon cycle in the reservoirs. A single graphical representation of each reservoir was created to facilitate an overall appraisal of the carbon cycle. The impact of cultural eutrophication was profound and resulted in a complete redistribution of how the various bioprocesses participated in the methane, carbon dioxide, and oxygen cycles. Among several identified impacts of eutrophication, it was observed that while eutrophication triggered increased methane production, this effect was followed by a similar increase in methane emissions and methanotrophic rates, while gross primary production was depleted.

Geographic Distribution of Bacillus thuringiensis Cry1F Toxin Resistance in Western Bean Cutworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Populations in the United States	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												The western bean cutworm (WBC), Striacosta albicosta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), can be a severe pest of transgenic corn in the western Plains and Great Lakes regions of North America, including on hybrids expressing the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cry1F toxin. The level and geographic distribution of Cry1F resistance are not completely known. Neonate S. albicosta from 10 locations between Nebraska and New York state were subjected to dose-response trypsin-activated native Cry1F toxin overlay bioassays. In 2017, the mean estimated lethal concentration causing 50% larval mortality (LC50) ranged from 15.1 to 18.4 mu g Cry1F cm(-2), and were not significantly different among locations. In 2018, LC50 estimates at Scottsbluff, NE (22.0 mu g Cry1F cm(-2)) and Watertown, NY (21.7 mu g Cry1F cm(-2)) were significantly higher when compared to locations in Michigan (15.8 mu g Cry1F cm(-2)). Significantly lower 14-day larval weight among survivors was correlated with higher Cry1F dose. Results from this study indicate that S. albicosta survivorship on purified Bt Cry1F toxin shows a relatively even distribution across the native and range expansion areas where seasonal field infestations typically occur.

Flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer (FAAS) laboratory analysis was employed to determine heavy metals (cadmium [Cd], lead [Pb], iron [Fe], manganese [Mn] and zinc) present in water and fish samples within the Muni Lagoon. The study revealed that the Muni Lagoon and feeder rivers were polluted with heavy metals (Fe = 0.453, Cd = 0.201, Mn = 0.105 and Pb = 0.024) comparing their concentrations with the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and Water Resources Commission (WRC) limit. Fish within the lagoon were found to pose no harm to consumers as traces of heavy metal concentrations were below the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations/World Health Organisation maximum permissible limit. The study further revealed that the application of agricultural inputs such as fertilisers, pesticides and domestic waste as well as unregulated gutter channels were the major source of heavy metals. A paired sample t-test showed a statistically significant difference between the wet and dry season's concentrations of cadmium and lead. For cadmium, the t-test found t(5) = -7.265; p = .001 between the wet season's concentration and the dry season's concentration and for lead, the t-test found t(5) = 5.061, p = .004 between the wet and dry season concentrations in the lagoon. It is therefore recommended that the Forestry Commission, Municipal Assembly and the local leaders should collaborate in regulating activities occurring in and around the catchment of the lagoon.

J	Song, HL; Liu, XT				Song, Hongli; Liu, Xingtu			Anthropogenic Effects on Fluxes of Ecosystem Respiration and Methane in the Yellow River Estuary, China	WETLANDS												To evaluate the influence of human activities on ecosystem respiration (CO2) and CH4 fluxes and determine the seasonal and spatial variations, we measured CO2 and CH4 fluxes at four sampling sites (west side of the seawall, WSS; oilfield, OF; Spartina alterniflora coastal marsh, SCM; aquaculture pond, ACP) in the Yellow River estuary from June to December in 2013. Both CO2 and CH4 fluxes showed seasonal and spatial variations in the Yellow River estuary. The average CO2 fluxes from WSS, OF, SCM and ACP were 125.36, 111.03, 241.97 and -39.49 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1), while CH4 fluxes were -0.0110, -0.0165, 0.2012 and 0.0034 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Spatial variations of CO2 and CH4 fluxes were mainly affected by vegetation and soil moisture. There were significant relationships between both CO2 fluxes in WSS and SCM and CH4 flux in SCM with temperature. CO2 and CH4 fluxes were mainly affected by the interactions of thermal conditions and other abiotic factors in OF and ACP. Human activities have great effect on greenhouse gas emission, especially in the area where exotic-species S. alterniflora invaded. The construction of seawall blocked sea water transporting into the study area leading to low soil moisture which accelerated CO2 emission. Aquaculture ponds act as an emission of CH4 and consumption of CO2.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				MAR	2016	36			1			S113	S123		10.1007/s13157-014-0587-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-014-0587-1													WOS:000371706900011

In experimentally heated mesocosms the emergence and growth of Potamogeton crispus shoots under ambient and increased temperatures (+4.5 degrees C) were tracked over 55 days. At the end of the experiment we measured the C, N and P content of the P. crispus leaves. The results indicate that warming advanced the emergence of P. crispus shoots by approximately 10 days, whereas the final number of shoots and plant biomass were similar in ambient and heated tanks. Furthermore, warming influenced the ecological stoichiometry of this plant significantly. Leaf C and N content were both less in the heated tanks resulting in an increase in C:N ratios, whereas P content and C:P and N:P ratios were not affected. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Altered precipitation patterns due to climate change may significantly affect the water quality and influence treatment procedures. This study aims to identify the most suitable water quality prediction models for the assessment of the water quality status for three water supply reservoirs in Toowoomba, Australia. It employed four machine learning and two deep learning models for determining the Water Quality Index (WQI) based on five parameters sensitive to rainfall impact. Temporal WQI variations over a period of 22 years (2000-2022) are scrutinised across 4 seasons and 12 months. Through regression analysis, both machine learning and deep learning models anticipate WQI gauged by seven accuracy metrics. Notably, XGBoost and GRU yielded exceptional outcomes, showcasing an R2 value of 0.99. Conversely, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) demonstrated moderate accuracy with results hovering at 88% to 90% for water quality prediction across all reservoirs. The Coefficient of Efficiency (CE) and Willmott Index (d) showed that the models capture patterns well, while MAE, MAPE and RMSE provided good performance metrics for the RFR, XGBoost and GRU models. These models have provided valuable knowledge that can be utilised to assess the adverse consequences of extreme climate events such as shifts in rainfall patterns. These insights can be used to improve strategies for managing water bodies more effectively.					; Paudyal, Dev/AAP-8471-2020; Alam, Md Jahangir/M-7963-2013	Paudyal, Dev Raj/0000-0003-1010-2118; Alam, Md Jahangir/0000-0001-6621-4720														2076-3263				OCT	2023	13	10							293	10.3390/geosciences13100293	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences13100293													WOS:001093568700001

Time after time: detecting annual patterns in stream bacterial biofilm communities	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												To quantify the major environmental drivers of stream bacterial population dynamics, we modelled temporal differences in stream bacterial communities to quantify community shifts, including those relating to cyclical seasonal variation and more sporadic bloom events. We applied Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA bacterial gene sequencing of 892 stream biofilm samples, collected monthly for 36-months from six streams. The streams were located a maximum of 118 km apart and drained three different catchment types (forest, urban and rural land uses). We identified repeatable seasonal patterns among bacterial taxa, allowing their separation into three ecological groupings, those following linear, bloom/trough and repeated, seasonal trends. Various physicochemical parameters (light, water and air temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, nutrients) were linked to temporal community changes. Our models indicate that bloom events and seasonal episodes modify biofilm bacterial populations, suggesting that distinct microbial taxa thrive during these events including non-cyanobacterial community members. These models could aid in determining how temporal environmental changes affect community assembly and guide the selection of appropriate statistical models to capture future community responses to environmental change.					; Lear, Gavin/AHD-1751-2022	Gautam, Anju/0000-0003-1482-8979; Lear, Gavin/0000-0001-5083-4773													1462-2912	1462-2920				MAY	2022	24	5			SI		2502	2515		10.1111/1462-2920.16017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.16017		MAY 2022						35466520					WOS:000790168900001

The warm subtropical climate of the Black Sea coastal area and inland regions of Georgia likely provides a favorable environment for various Vibrio species. From 2006 to 2009, the abundance, ecology, and diversity of clinically important Vibrio species were studied in different locations in Georgia and across seasons. Over a 33-month period, 1,595 presumptive Vibrio isolates were collected from the Black Sea (n = 657) and freshwater lakes around Tbilisi (n = 938). Screening of a subset of 440 concentrated and enriched water samples by PCR-electrospray ionization/mass spectrometry (PCR-ESI/MS) detected the presence of DNA from eight clinically important Vibrio species: V cholerae, V parahaemolyticus, V vulnificus, V mimicus, V alginolyticus, V harveyi. V metschnikovii, and V cincinnatiensis. Almost 90% of PCR/ESI-MS samples positive for Vibrio species were collected from June through November. Three important human-pathogenic Vibrio species (V cholerae, V parahaernolyticus, and V vulnificus) were detected in 62.8, 37.8, and 21.4% of samples testing positive for Vibrios, respectively. The results of these activities suggest that natural reservoirs for human-pathogenic Vibrios exist in Georgian aquatic environments. Water temperature at all sampling sites was positively correlated with the abundance of clinically important Vibrio spp. (except V metschnikovii), and salinity was correlated with species composition at particular Black Sea sites as well as inland reservoirs.

This study was therefore aimed at examining seasonal and spatial variations in the water quality of Lake Hawassa Watershed (LHW) and identifying possible sources of pollution using multivariate statistical techniques. Water and effluent samples from LHW were collected monthly for analysis of 19 physicochemical parameters during dry and wet seasons at 19 monitoring stations. Multivariate statistical techniques (MVST) were used to investigate the influences of an anthropogenic intervention on the physicochemical characteristics of water quality at monitoring stations. Through cluster analysis (CA), all 19 monitoring stations were spatially grouped into two statistically significant clusters for the dry and wet seasons based on pollution index, which were designated as moderately polluted (MP) and highly polluted (HP). According to the study results, rivers and Lake Hawassa were moderately polluted (MP), while point sources (industry, hospitals and hotels) were found to be highly polluted (HP). Discriminant analysis (DA) was used to identify the most critical parameters to study the spatial variations, and seven significant parameters were extracted (electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), sodium ion (Na+), and potassium ion (K+) with the spatial variance to distinguish the pollution condition of the groups obtained using CA. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to qualitatively determine the potential sources contributing to LHW pollution. In addition, three factors determining pollution levels during the dry and wet season were identified to explain 70.5% and 72.5% of the total variance, respectively. Various sources of pollution are prevalent in the LHW, including urban runoff, industrial discharges, diffused sources from agricultural land use, and livestock. A correlation matrix with seasonal variations was prepared for both seasons using physicochemical parameters. In conclusion, effective management of point and non-point source pollution is imperative to improve domestic, industrial, livestock, and agricultural runoff to reduce pollutants entering the Lake. In this regard, proper municipal and industrial wastewater treatment should be complemented, especially, by stringent management that requires a comprehensive application of technologies such as fertilizer management, ecological ditches, constructed wetlands, and buffer strips. Furthermore, application of indigenous aeration practices such as the use of drop structures at critical locations would help improve water quality in the lake watershed.					; Lencha, Semaria Moga/ABC-2225-2021	Ulsido, Mihret Dananto/0000-0002-6961-3193; Moga, Semaria/0000-0003-4152-3871; Muluneh, Alemayehu/0009-0002-7192-7965; 														2076-3417				OCT	2021	11	19							8991	10.3390/app11198991	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app11198991													WOS:000708186700001

Satellite altimetry enables remote sensing of these lakes, but the lake phenology is problematic as radar reflection surfaces include water, snow, and ice. Reflection from multiple surfaces gives rise to two-peak waveforms across ice-covered lakes. Misinterpretation of the altimetric height has caused extracted water levels to be low compared with gauge data. In this study, a modified retracker is used to determine heights from the first altimetric subwaveform. Using in situ snow depth and ice thickness, the first reflection surface is shown to correspond closely to the snow/ice interface when the lake is frozen. The modified retracker is applied to the Great Bear Lake (GBL), Great Slave Lake (GSL), and Lake Athabasca (ATL) of the Mackenzie River Basin for the period 1992-2020. Standard deviations (Std) of differences between lake levels from Jason-2 waveforms and in situ data across GBL and GSL are 0.06 m with the new methodology compared with 0.11 and 0.08 m, respectively, using the standard Ice retracker. With an Std of 0.11 m between altimetric and gauge lake levels, TOPEX/Poseidon is less accurate than the combined Jason missions (Std: 0.07 m).					; Li, Zhenhong/F-8705-2010; Li, Zhenhong/F-8705-2010	yang, yuande/0000-0001-7689-9698; Li, Zhenhong/0000-0002-8054-7449; Li, Zhenhong/0000-0002-8054-7449; Moore, Philip/0000-0001-5141-3743													0196-2892	1558-0644				OCT	2021	59	10					8143	8152		10.1109/TGRS.2020.3040853	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2020.3040853													WOS:000698968700014

Results show SPM concentrations ranging from 0.823 to 44.172 mg/l, with significant seasonal variations. Higher SPM concentrations post-monsoon indicate increased anthropogenic influence, particularly in the northern area.

The increasing availability of data with high spatial and temporal resolution allows assessing short-term dynamics and small-scale variations of chla within larger water bodies. In freshwater reservoirs, the nutrient concentrations and the physical conditions that control phytoplankton growth vary along their longitudinal extend. Here, we analyze how the flow paths of the inflowing river water into density-stratified reservoirs affect the vertical and longitudinal distribution of nutrients and chla. We combine spatially resolved and high-frequency measurements of chla from satellite remote sensing and in-situ sensors, with numerical simulations using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model to assess the influence of density currents on chla dynamics along a subtropical drinking water reservoir in the south of Brazil. Chla did not have pronounced seasonal dynamics (4.9 +/- 1.2 mu g L-1, at the continuous measurement station); instead, spatial variability along the reservoir was more pronounced (4.4 +/- 2.1 mu g L-1, all monitored points within the euphotic zone). Most of the nutrients from the inflowing river were consumed in the upstream region, and phytoplankton in the lacustrine zone depended on internal loading. Temporal variability was observed only in the upstream region, and phytoplankton produced in that area was transported downstream by density currents, resulting in large concentrations of chla below the euphotic zone. The results of a hydrodynamic model that simulates the present state are in good agreement with the observations. Two simulated scenarios, where the density current patterns were altered, resulted only in slight variations in density currents, indicating that the influence of the main inflow was of minor relevance in chla concentrations in downstream regions of the reservoir. Our results highlight the importance of two-dimensional hydrodynamic processes in regulating phytoplankton dynamics in reservoirs.

Variable deceleration ofWhillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												The Whillans Ice Stream Ice Plain (WIP) has been slowing since at least 1963. Prior constraints on this slowdown were consistent with a constant long-term deceleration rate. New observations of ice velocity from 11 continuous and 3 seasonal GPS sites indicate the deceleration rate varies through time including on interannual time scales. Between 2009 and 2012 WIP decelerated at a rate (6.1 to 10.9 +/- 2 m/yr(2)) that was double the multidecadal average (3.0 to 5.6 +/- 2 m/yr(2)). To identify the causes of slowdown, we used new and prior velocity estimates to constrain longitudinal and transverse force budget models as well as a higher-order inverse model. All model results support the conclusion that the observed deceleration of WIP is caused by an increase in basal resistance to motion at a rate of 10 to 40 Pa/yr. Subglacial processes that may be responsible for strengthening the ice stream bed include basal freeze on, changes in subglacial hydrology, or increases in the area of resistant basal substrate through differential erosion. The observed variability in WIP deceleration rate suggests that dynamics in subglacial hydrology, plausibly driven by basal freeze on and/or activity of subglacial lakes, plays a key role in modulating basal resistance to ice motion in the region.

The Role of Seasonal Sediment Transport and Sintering in Shaping Titan's Landscapes: A Hypothesis	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Titan is a sedimentary world, with lakes, rivers, canyons, fans, dissected plateaux, and sand dunes. Sediments on Saturn's moon are thought to largely consist of mechanically weak organic grains, prone to rapid abrasion into dust. Yet, Titan's equatorial dunes have likely been active for 10s-100s kyr. Sustaining Titan's dunes over geologic timescales requires a mechanism that produces sand-sized particles at equatorial latitudes. We explore the hypothesis that a combination of abrasion, when grains are transported by winds or methane rivers, and sintering, when they are at rest, could produce sand grains that maintain an equilibrium size. Our model demonstrates that seasonal sediment transport may produce sand under Titan's surface conditions and could explain the latitudinal zonation of Titan's landscapes. Our findings support the hypothesis of global, source-to-sink sedimentary pathways on Titan, driven by seasons, and mediated by episodic abrasion and sintering of organic sand by rivers and winds.

However, in a local context such as in mountain regions of the developing world different water risks are intertwined and shaped by multi-dimensional natural and socio-economic drivers. Progressing glacier melt and the associated growing number of lakes rises the threat of glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs); at the same time declining melt water supply changes the hydrological regime, resulting in changing water availability, especially during dry seasons. Here, we address this challenge by integratively assessing water scarcity and GLOF risks and their interactions for two study sites in glacierized catchments in the Cordillera Blanca and Urubamba in the Peruvian Andes. We used hydrological modelling, GLOF flow path modelling, and interviews with local people and technical experts to assess the hazard and risks of water scarcity and GLOFs. We incorporate perspectives of people living in those areas in order to gain a more comprehensive view on risks. While metrics of flood and water scarcity hazards are difficult to compare, we found insightful results using a comparative analysis of elements at risk from different water related hazards with different probabilities of occurrence. Furthermore, our study shows that considering the diverse local perspectives on risks as well as the social, cultural, economic and political context is essential to more successful and sustainable disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation and integrated water management.					; Munoz, Randy/MGV-3809-2025	Motschmann, Alina/0000-0003-3822-3878; Munoz, Randy/0000-0001-6797-3999; 														2197-8670				SEP 23	2020	7	1							26	10.1186/s40677-020-00159-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40677-020-00159-7								33184601					WOS:000642285500001

They differ, however, in cultural, historical, and economic aspects. The purpose of this study was to reveal the similarities and differences between Russian and Japanese respondents regarding the visual and emotional evaluation of landscapes based on ethno-cultural and regional differences. We asked respondents at universities in Russia (Moscow, Irkutsk, and Kamchatka) and Japan (Hokkaido, Chiba, and Miyazaki) to group and rate 70 landscape images. Unlike theoretical concepts that explain landscape preferences within an evolutionary framework or according to individual and cultural differences, we found that these factors interact in more complicated ways. Cultural traditions and features of the natural environment that were familiar to respondents influenced their visual perception and aesthetic evaluation of landscape. Russian respondents seemed more emotional while Japanese respondents tended to be more restrained in their assessments. However, there was a strong correlation between their estimates of landscape attractiveness, which might confirm the existence of universal human concepts of landscape aesthetics. The most attractive for both Russian and Japanese respondents were waterfalls, mountains, and lakes; waterless plains were the least attractive. At the same time, we found cross-cultural differences in assessing seacoasts, rivers, forests, and swampy plains. There was practically no correlation between Russian and Japanese respondents in their appreciation of exotic/familiar landscapes. For the Russian respondents, the most exotic landscapes were also the most attractive, although we did not observe such a tendency for the Japanese. All respondents appreciated certain familiar landscapes that were symbols of native nature as very attractive. Unlike 'geoscientific' landscape classifications, in the visual and emotional grouping of landscapes, the most important feature appeared to be the presence/absence of water and the type of water basin (river, lake, and sea); for Russian respondents (especially Muscovites), topography was also important, while the Japanese respondents mostly used visual and seasonal characteristics in their classifications. All Japanese respondents assessed the attractiveness and exoticism of landscapes almost identically, while there were some differences among Russian respondents from different regions.					; aoki, yoji/KHD-8406-2024; Matsushima, Hajime/B-7739-2012; Petrova, Elena/A-8341-2011; Ueda, Hirofumi/NTP-9920-2025; Furuya, Katsunori/ABH-2107-2021	Furuya, Katsunori/0000-0003-1331-6808; Petrova, Elena/0000-0003-0620-2060; 													2197-4284					MAR 31	2015	2								6	10.1186/s40645-015-0033-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40645-015-0033-x													WOS:000363942400001

The sediments of Lake Lisan provide a unique record of hydroclimatic change during the last glacial to Holocene transition (ca. 24-11 ka) with its tremendous water level drop of similar to 240 m that finally led to its transition into the present hypersaline water body-the Dead Sea. Here we utilize high-resolution sedimentological analyses from the marginal terraces and deep lake to reconstruct an unprecedented seasonal record of the last millennia of Lake Lisan. Aragonite varve formation in intercalated intervals of our record demonstrates that a stepwise long-term lake level decline was interrupted by almost one millennium of rising or stable water level. Even periods of pronounced water level drops indicated by gypsum deposition were interrupted by decades of positive water budgets. Our results thus highlight that even during major climate change at the end of the last glacial, decadal to millennial periods of relatively stable or positive moisture supply occurred which could have been an important premise for human sedentism.					; Enzel, Yehouda/AAV-5829-2021; ben dor, yoav/LJW-0144-2024; Neugebauer, Ina/AAG-2278-2020	Muller, Daniela/0000-0001-7458-7113; 													2045-2322					APR 27	2022	12	1							6052	10.1038/s41598-022-10217-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-10217-9								35477958					WOS:000788639400050

While the physico-chemical conditions supporting the supersaturation of water with respect to calcite are theoretically well described, the magnitude and con-ditions underlying calcite precipitation at flne temporal and spatial scales are poorly constrained. In this study, we used high frequency, depth-resolved (0-30 m) data collected over 18 months (June 2019 - November 2020) in the deeper basin of Lake Geneva to describe the dynamics of calcite precipitation fluxes at a flne temporal resolution (day to sea-son) and to scale them to carbon flxation by primary production. Calcite precipitation occurred during the warm strat-ifled periods when surface water CO2 concentrations were below atmospheric equilibrium. Seasonally, the extent of Alk loss due to calcite precipitation (i.e., [30-42] g C m-2) depended upon the level of Alk in surface waters. Moreover, interannual variability in seasonal calcite precipitation depended on the duration of stratiflcation, which determined the volume of the water layer susceptible to calcite precipitation. At flner timescales, calcite precipitation was charac-terized by marked daily variability with dynamics strongly related to that of planktonic autotrophic metabolism. In-creasing daily calcite precipitation rates (i.e., maximum values 9 mmol C m-3 d-1) coincided with increasing net ecosystem production (NEP) during periods of enhanced water column stability. In these conditions, calcite precipita-tion could remove as much inorganic carbon from the productive layers as NEP. This study provides mechanistic in-sights into the conditions driving pelagic calcite precipitation, and quantifles its essential contribution to the coupling of organic and inorganic carbon cycling in lakes.

Microcystin as a biogeochemical cycle: Pools, fluxes, and fates of the cyanotoxin in inland waters	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Microcystin poses a serious threat to aquatic ecosystems and human health. There is a pressing need to understand the production, movement, and storage of microcystin in lakes. We constructed a conceptual biogeochemical model for microcystin through a comprehensive literature synthesis, identifying four major pools and nine major fluxes in lakes that also connect to the terrestrial environment. This conceptual model can be used as the framework for developing ecosystem mass balances of microcystin. We propose that the concentration of microcystin in the water column is the balance between the import, sediment translocation, production and degradation, uptake, burial, and export. However, substantial unknowns remain pertaining to the magnitude and movement of microcystin. Future investigations should focus on sediment fluxes, drivers of biodegradation, and seasonal dynamics. Adopting the framework of a "microcystin cycle" improves our understanding of processes driving toxin prevalence and helps to prioritize strategies for minimizing exposure risks.					; Wilkinson, Grace/AAD-3202-2020	Wilkinson, Grace/0000-0003-4051-2249; Shingai, Quin/0000-0002-7788-4233														2378-2242				JUN	2023	8	3					406	418		10.1002/lol2.10300	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10300		DEC 2022											WOS:000901574100001

Trin. ex Steudel in a constructed wetland in the west of Ireland	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												An understanding of the seasonal variation in the standing stock of metals and nutrients in emergent vegetation of constructed wetlands (CWs), as well as the amounts present in aboveground (AG) and belowground (BG) biomass, is crucial to their design and management. Given that biomass harvesting is a labour and time consuming operation, a paucity of information currently exists on accumulation and standing stocks in biomass in CWs, in particular in North Western European countries. To address this knowledge gap, this paper examined the seasonal variations of metals and nutrients in Phragmites australis (Cay.) Trin. ex Steudel in a CW treating municipal wastewater, with a view to identifying an optimal time for biomass harvesting of the AG vegetation. Although the AG biomass was greatest in August (1636 +/- 507 g m(-2)), the maximum concentrations and accumulations of metals and nutrients occurred at different times throughout the duration of the study (April to November). Furthermore, with the exception of zinc and nitrogen, metals and nutrients measured in BG biomass ranged from 66% (phosphorus) to greater than 80% (nickel and chromium) of the AG biomass. This indicates that analysis of only the emergent shoots may significantly underestimate the metal and nutrient uptake and capacity of the plant. In order to effectively target the bulk of metals and nutrients, an AG harvest in late August or September is suggested. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Gull diets reveal dietary partitioning, influences of isotopic signatures on body condition, and ecosystem changes at a remote colony	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												As top predators that feed on a wide range of prey items, gull diets may serve as important biological indicators of regional prey availability and changes in marine ecosystems. We studied the diets of herring gulls Larus argentatus and great black-backed gulls L. marinus on Sable Island, Nova Scotia, Canada, a remote colony which has shown high levels of contaminants in herring gull eggs and which has experienced significant ecological and anthropogenic change in its surrounding marine region over the past 40 yr. Analysis of regurgitated pellets suggested that current gull diets have proportionally less offshore prey (e. g. fish) and terns and tern eggs, and proportionally more molluscs, rock crabs Cancer borealis, and seal Halichoerus grypus carrion than diets sampled 40 yr ago. The composition of recent diets observed from pellet analysis is supported by stable isotope mixing models of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15), which revealed that great black-backed gulls had high proportions of seals and crab in their diets, whereas herring gulls had high proportions of crab, sand lance Ammodytes sp., and terrestrial invertebrates. Isotopic analyses also identified dietary variability through seasonal, age-specific and body condition relationships for each species. Biometric-isotope relationships showed that larger great black-backed gulls fed at higher trophic levels, and that higher trophic level foraging in herring gulls was associated with better body condition. Collectively, these results indicate dietary partitioning within this community of sympatrically nesting gulls, and broad-scale dietary shifts since the early 1970s.

The concentration of the selected heavy metals was in the order of Al > Fe > Zn > Mn > Cr > Ni > Cu > Pb > Cd and Al > Fe > Zn > Mn > Cr > Ni > Pb > Cu > Cd for pre-monsoon and post-monsoon season respectively. Further indices like the heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) indicated that the water of the Narmada River was medium polluted, heavy metal pollution index (HPI) categorized the water as moderately to heavily polluted. The nemerrow pollution index (NPI) classified 8% of sampling sites as low polluted, 42% as medium polluted, and 50% as highly polluted in pre-monsoon. Similarly, for the post-monsoon, NPI classified 42% of sampling sites as low polluted, 33% as medium polluted, and 36% as highly polluted water. Total hazard risk indicated a non-carcinogen risk for children and adults. In both seasons, based on human health risk assessment, ingestion of heavy metals contaminated water especially with Cr was identified to be highly prone to cancer risk. This research will aid in the development of effective planning and policies for enhancing river water quality and reducing ecological and human health risks.					; Gupta, Deepak/AAW-3796-2021; mishra, virendra/AAR-3368-2020	Gupta, Deepak/0000-0003-4695-0530; Srivastava, Dr. Pankaj Kumar/0000-0002-8950-4402; Mishra, Virendra/0000-0002-0129-5483													2363-5037	2363-5045				AUG	2024	10	4							154	10.1007/s40899-024-01131-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40899-024-01131-1													WOS:001278966500001

Plankton community interactions in an Amazonian floodplain lake, from bacteria to zooplankton	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The simple view of the classical phytoplankton-zooplankton-fish food chain (CFC) has been replaced by a more complex framework, integrating microbial compartments (microbial food web, MFW). Few studies considered all components of the pelagic MFW in freshwaters and mostly are from temperate regions. We investigated carbon partitioning in the CFC and the MFW in an Amazonian floodplain system and analyzed the strength of interactions among components through structure equation modeling. We hypothesized that (i) MFW contributes highly to total plankton biomass throughout the year; and (ii) all plankton communities increase in biomass during low water, increasing the role of trophic interactions. We collected 30 subsurface samples (nutrients and plankton communities). MFW predominated over CFC in carbon biomass, and plankton components and their interactions changed according to the contrasting water level. Because phosphorus can be a potentially limiting resource for strict primary producers, higher biomass and a more complex MFW occurred during low water. We concluded that hydrology is a key factor shaping biotic interactions during low-water periods, and that MFW plays a key role in floodplain lakes, being potential mixotrophy an important strategy for phytoplankton.					; Sarmento, Hugo/A-7655-2008; Bastos, Wanderley/AAQ-5875-2020; Sarmento, Hugo/W-3805-2019; Huszar, Vera/J-7126-2012	Huszar, Vera/0000-0002-8096-1404; Sarmento, Hugo/0000-0001-5220-7992; Rodrigues Bastos, Wanderley/0000-0002-2105-9947; Castelo Branco, Christina W/0000-0002-0509-171X; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2019	831	1			SI		55	70		10.1007/s10750-018-3855-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3855-x													WOS:000458372800006

Remotely operated vehicle (ROV) submersible-based investigations of hydrothermal vents offshore from Stevenson Island reveal numerous non-constructional similar to 10-cm-diameter orifices with diffuse fluid flow at temperatures up to 174 degrees C. The vent field occurs in a large roughly conical depression on the lake floor at a water depth of similar to 120 m. The volatile-rich composition (CO2, H2S) of the vent fluids is preserved by using a novel isobaric sampling system that precludes degassing effects. In addition to high temperatures, the vent fluids have high CO2 and H2S, but low chloride (Cl) and major element concentrations largely indistinguishable from those in ambient lake water. These results are consistent with steam addition to the sublacustrine hydrothermal system. Kaolinite-and boehmite-rich alteration indicates acidic conditions and provides a low-permeability substrate that may contribute to the development of a steam-heated upflow zone. At the scale of individual vent areas (centimeters to meters), perturbations cause bursts of steam-rich fluids that locally expel and disperse sediment and contribute to the formation of vent orifices. Here we report on chemical and physical phenomena associated with the hottest and deepest sublacustrine hydrothermal vents in Yellowstone Lake. Results indicate that vapor-dominated sublacustrine systems are fundamentally different in hydrothermal alteration and hydrothermal dynamic characteristics than their liquid-dominated counterparts.

We established an experiment with both static and flowing water in 2017 to observe N removal from rice paddy drainage by eco-ditches containing three different types of monoculture vegetation: Zizania aquatica, Canna indica L., and Pontederia cordata. Results showed that ammonia volatilization and plant uptake contributed little to N removal. Harvest of Z. aquatica from the eco-ditch during the late growing season had an appreciable effect on N removal. However, harvest of C. indica L. and P. cordata had negligible effects. During static test, the concentration of total N (TN) and ammonium N (NH4+-N) and the pH all decreased from the surface to the bottom of water. The concentration of nitrate N (NO3--N) did not exhibit stratification. In a flowing water experiment, ditches with Z. aquatica, C. indica L., and P. cordata had the following average removal rates: TN 15.8%, 11.6%, and 27.9%; NO3--N 4.2%, 8.4%, and 17.8%; NH4+-N 22.8%, 16.4%, and 37.5%, respectively. The removal rates of TN and NH4+-N decreased with the increase of water level, while that of NO3--N increased significantly. Nitrogen removal rates decreased with the increase of influent TN concentration or flow rate. Nitrogen removal rate of P. cordata ditch was highly dependent on the influent TN concentration, but the flow rate was not as important due to the great drag caused by its large density. While the contrary was observed in the C. indica L. ditch. For Z. aquatica ditch, both the flow rate and the TN concentration had a strong negative correlation with the N removal rate.

In this study, projections of seven global circulation models (GCMs) associated with high and medium-low Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5) for the period 2021-2040 and 2081-2100 were adopted to assess changes on runoffs in the Gilgel Abbay watershed, the upper Blue Nile basin. A weather generator was employed to generate daily temperature and precipitation to drive a hydrological model for impact assessment. Despite the projected magnitude of changes varied among different GCMs and RCPs, increasing runoffs in wet-season and decreasing in dry-season are observed in both periods, mainly attributed to the change in projected precipitation. Such changes are profound in cases of RCP 8.5 with respect to those of RCP 4.5 and in cases of 2081-2100 with respect to those of 2021-2040. Although the increasing runoffs would provide greater inflow to Lake Tana, the increase of precipitation in wet-season would imply a higher possibility of flash floods. On the other hand, decrease runoffs in dry-season further intensify existing shortage of irrigation water demand. These changes will have deleterious consequences on the economic wellbeing of the country and require successful implementation of adaption measures to reduce vulnerability.

The critically endangered Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis), once commonly observed in the Yangtze River-Poyang Lake junction, is now rarely seen in the river-lake corridor. In this study, static passive acoustic monitoring techniques were used to detect the biosonar activities of the Yangtze finless porpoise in this unique corridor. Generalized linear models were used to examine the correlation between these activities and anthropogenic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and boat navigation, as well as environmental variables, including hydrological conditions and light levels. Over approximately three consecutive years of monitoring (2020-2022), porpoise biosonar was detected during 93% of logged days, indicating the key role of the corridor for finless porpoise conservation. In addition, porpoise clicks were recorded in 3.80% of minutes, while feeding correlated buzzes were detected in 1.23% of minutes, suggesting the potential existence of localized, small-scale migration. Furthermore, both anthropogenic and environmental variables were significantly correlated with the diel, lunar, monthly, seasonal, and annual variations in porpoise biosonar activities. During the pandemic lockdown period, porpoise sonar detection showed a significant increase.Furthermore, a significant negative correlation was identified between the detection of porpoise click trains and buzzes and boat traffic intensity. In addition to water level and flux, daylight and moonlight exhibited significant correlations with porpoise biosonar activities, with markedly higher detections at night and quarter moon periods. Ensuring the spatiotemporal reduction of anthropogenic activities, implementing vessel speed restrictions (e.g., during porpoise migration and feeding), and maintaining local natural hydrological regimes are critical factors for sustaining porpoise population viability.

The results showed that particulate organic phosphorus (POP) was the dominant form of PP (>88.0%). The concentration of POP showed higher levels in the bloom-sensitive northwestern zone (phytoplankton-dominated zone and estuary zone) during warm seasons, phytoplankton blooms and input of exogenous particulate matter were the main sources of POP in the lake water. Based on P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (P-31 NMR) analysis, orthophosphate (Ortho-P) was the dominant molecular species of PP and positively correlated with soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) (p < 0.01). This suggested that the release of Ortho-P from suspended particulate matter (SPM) was the main source of SRP in the lake water. Pyrophosphate (Pyro-P), which is regarded as a highly labile species of P compounds, represented a large fraction of PP, and its significant positive correlations with chlorophyll a (Chl a), indicated that the concentration of Pyro-P could be used as an important indicator for the degree of eutrophication of Lake Taihu. These results proved that PP in lake water was a significant factor supporting lake eutrophication and must be controlled.

In this paper, we further evaluated the applications and limitations of using DC as both a qualitative and semi-quantitative woodsmoke marker via joint continuous measurements of PM2.5 (by nephelometer pDR-1500) and light-absorptive PM (by 2-wavelength and 7-wavelength Aethalometer (R)) in three northeastern US cities/towns including Rutland, VT; Saranac Lake, NY and Ithaca, NY. Residential wood combustion has shown to be the predominant source of wintertime primary PM2 .5 emissions in both Rutland and Saranac Lake, where we conducted ambient measurements. In Ithaca, we performed woodsmoke plume measurements. We compared the pDR-1500 against a FEM PM2.5 sampler (BAM 1020), and identified a close agreement between the two instruments in a woodsmoke-dominated ambient environment. The analysis of seasonal and diurnal trends of DC, black carbon (BC, 880 nm) and PM2.5 concentrations supports the use of DC as an adequate qualitative marker. The strong linear relationships between PM2.5 and DC in both woodsmoke-dominated ambient and plume environments suggest that DC can reasonably serve as a semi-quantitative woodsmoke marker. We propose a DC-based indicator for woodsmoke emission, which has shown to exhibit a relatively strong linear relationship with heating demand. While we observed reproducible PM2.5-DC relationships in similar woodsmoke-dominated ambient environments, those relationships differ significantly with different environments, and among individual woodsmoke sources. Our analysis also indicates the potential for PM2.5-DC relationships to be utilized to distinguish different combustion and operating conditions of woodsmoke sources, and that DC-heating-demand relationships could be adopted to estimate woodsmoke emissions. However, future studies are needed to elucidate those relationships.

This study assessed the seasonal variations in the epidemiology of malaria among children under 10 years of age living in two villages in Selingue: Carriere, located along the Sankarani River but distant from the hydroelectric dam, and Binko, near irrigated rice fields, close to the dam. The aim of this study was to provide baseline data, seasonal pattern and age distribution of malaria incidence in two sites situated close to a lake in Selingue. Methods: Geographically, Selingue area is located in the basin of Sakanrani and belongs to the district of Yanfolila in the third administrative region of Mali, Sikasso. Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted in October 2010 (end of transmission season) and in July 2011 (beginning of transmission season) to determine the point prevalence of asymptomatic parasitaemia, and anaemia among the children. Cumulative incidence of malaria per month was determined in a cohort of 549 children through active and passive case detection from November 2010 through October 2011. The number of clinical episodes per year was determined among the children in the cohort. Logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for malaria. Results: The prevalence of malaria parasitaemia varied significantly between villages with a strong seasonality in Carriere (52.0-18.9 % in October 2010 and July 2011, respectively) compared with Binko (29.8-23.8 % in October 2010 and July 2011, respectively). Children 6-9 years old were at least twice more likely to carry parasites than children up to 5 years old. For malaria incidence, 64.8-71.9 % of all children experienced at least one episode of clinical malaria in Binko and Carriere, respectively. The peak incidence was observed between August and October (end of the rainy season), but the incidence remained high until December. Surprisingly, the risk of clinical malaria was two-to nine-fold higher among children 5-9 years old compared to younger children. Conclusions: A shift in the peak of clinical episodes from children under 5-9 years of age calls for expanding control interventions, such as seasonal malaria chemoprophylaxis targeting the peak transmission months.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in late Eocene to early Pleistocene mudstones of the Sylhet succession, NE Bengal Basin, Bangladesh: Implications for source and paleoclimate conditions during Himalayan uplift	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Distribution and possible sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been investigated in 23 late Eocene to early Pleistocene mudstones from the Sylhet succession of the northeastern Bengal Basin, Bangladesh. Paleoclimatic conditions in the southern Himalaya region throughout the Himalayan uplift were reconstructed, based on combustion derived PAHs and aromatic land plant derived biomarkers. Phenanthrene, fluoranthene (Fla), pyrene (Py), benz[a] anthracene (BaAn), chrysene/triphenylene (Chry + Tpn), benzofluoranthenes (Bflas), benzo[e] pyrene (BePy), benzo[a] pyrene (BaPy), perylene (Pery), indeno[1,2,3-cd] pyrene (InPy), benzo[ghi] perylene (BghiP), coronene (Cor) and retene (Ret) were the identified PAHs. Fla/(Fla + Py) ratios > 0.5 and InPy/(InPy + BghiP) > 0.2 from almost all Sylhet samples suggest occurrence of natural wildfires. Low contents of BaAn and BaPy indicate decomposition by long exposure to sunlight before sedimentation, or early diagenetic weathering. Increased Cor, InPy and BghiP contents suggest occurrence of larger, high temperature wildfires. Correlation coefficients of the PAHs and p-values for statistical hypothesis testing showed that the positive and negative correlations within the PAHs may be indicative of high or low temperatures in wildfires. Fungi derived Pery showed negative correlations with Py (r = -0.67, p = 4.6 x 10(-4)) and Fla (r = -0.56, p = 5.0 x 10(-3)), but not with Cor, Bflas, InPy and BghiP. Based on the correlation coefficients for all PAHs and their p-values, five statistical groups ([Py, Fla], [Cor, Bflas, InPy, BghiP], [BaAn, Chry + Tpn, BaPy], [Pery] and [Ret]) were recognized. These groups are probably correlated with origins and depositional processes. According to the results, the Sylhet succession was deposited in three differing paleoclimatic regimes: (1) First phase (late Eocene to early Miocene, early to middle stage of Himalayan uplift): High contents of combustion derived PAHs (Fla, Py and BePy), significant gymnosperm derived Ret, and low Pery abundances in the Jaintia and Barail groups indicate arid climatic conditions. Although wildfires could often occur, 5- or 6-ring combustion PAHs (Cor, InPy and BghiP) contents are low, suggesting that the wildfires were relatively low temperature. (2) Second phase (middle to late Miocene: middle to late stage of Himalayan uplift): Combustion derived PAHs and fungi derived Pery were dominant in the Surma Group. The climate was arid to humid and seasonal, with a dry season giving conditions suitable for combustion. Abundant Fla, Bflas, BePy, Cor, InPy and BghiP imply high temperatures in large wildfires. However, frequency of the wildfires decreased because of wet climate. (3) Third phase (late Miocene to Pleistocene: late stage of Himalayan uplift): Moderate to high Pery contents and low Fla, Py and BePy abundances in the Tipam and Dupitila groups indicate establishment of more humid climate. InPy, BghiP, Cor, Bflas and BaPy were predominant. Intensified humid and seasonal climate arising from the Himalayan monsoon decreased the incidence and frequency of general wildfires, but increased the ratio of large to small wildfires.

In response, the Chinese Government implemented the Ecological Water Diversion Project (EWDP) in 2000. To evaluate the effects of the EWDP, this study monitored changes in land use and vegetation in the Ejin Oasis since 2000 and examined driving factors behind such changes. Results demonstrated that the Ejin Oasis ecosystem generally improved between 2000 and 2011. Water body area significantly increased. Lake area of once dried-up Sogo Nuur increased to 45 km(2). Accordingly, vegetation cover restoration has also significantly increased. For example, the Seasonally Integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (SINDVI) has shown that 31.18% of the entire study area experienced an increase in vegetation area. On the other hand, even though the EWDP has been successful in driving vegetation recovery and lake restoration, farmland reclamation has counteracted such restoration initiatives. Farmland area almost doubled between 2000 and 2011. Thus, farmland expansion management is necessary for the full restoration of the Ejin Oasis ecosystems as well as HRB sustainable development. The results of this study can provide a reference for the management of the HRB.					hu, xiaoli/B-7374-2018; Li, Xin/F-7473-2011	Li, Xin/0000-0003-2999-9818													1996-1073					JUL	2015	8	7					7040	7057		10.3390/en8077040	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en8077040													WOS:000359897800042

The multi-year natural flood pulse pattern in the Lower Parana River drove the ecosystem regime from a FFP-dominant state during very high waters (1998-1999) to absolute phytoplankton prevalence with blooms of nitrogen fixing Cyanobacteria during extreme low waters (2008-2009). Satellite images support the observed changes over the decade and show the decrease of the surface lake area covered by FFP as well as the modification of the spectral firm in open waters, which documents the significant increases in phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentrations. We discuss the possibility that, despite a slow eutrophication in these highly vegetated systems, water level changes and not nutrients account for the shift from a floating macrophyte community to phytoplankton dominance. Cyclic shifts may occur in response to the seasonal floodpulse, but more strongly, as indicated by our results, in association to the extreme drought and flood events related to the El Nio Southern Oscillation, which is linked to discharge anomalies in the Parana River.

Nutrient stoichiometry of linked catchment-lake systems along a gradient of land use	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Catchments export nutrients to aquatic ecosystems at rates and ratios that are strongly influenced by land use practices, and within aquatic ecosystems nutrients can be processed, retained, lost to the atmosphere, or exported downstream. The stoichiometry of carbon and nutrients can influence ecosystem services such as water quality, nutrient limitation, biodiversity, eutrophication and the sequestration of nutrients and carbon in sediments. However, we know little about how nutrient stoichiometry varies along the pathway from terrestrial landscapes through aquatic systems. 2. We studied the stoichiometry of nitrogen and phosphorus exported by three catchments of contrasting land use (forest versus agriculture) and in the water column and sediments of downstream reservoirs. We also related stoichiometry to phytoplankton nutrient limitation and the abundance of heterocystous cyanobacteria. 3. The total N : P of stream exports varied greatly among catchments and was 18, 54 and 140 (molar) in the forested, mixed-use and agricultural catchment, respectively. Total N : P in the mixed layers of the lakes was less variable but ordered similarly: 35, 52 132 in the forested, mixed-use and agricultural lake, respectively. In contrast, there was little variation among systems in the C : N and C : P ratios of catchment exports or in reservoir seston. 4. Phytoplankton in the forested lake were consistently N limited, those in the agricultural lake were consistently P limited, and those in the mixed-use lake shifted seasonally from P- to N limitation, reflecting N : P supply ratios. Total phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomass were highest in the agricultural lake, but heterocystous (potentially N fixing) cyanobacteria were most abundant in the forested lake, corresponding to low N : P ratios. 5. Despite large differences in catchment export and water column N : P ratios, the N : P of sediment burial (integrated over several decades) was very low and remarkably similar (4.3-7.3) across reservoirs. N and P budgets constructed for the agricultural reservoir suggested that denitrification could be a major loss of N, and may help explain the relatively low N : P of buried sediment. 6. Our results show congruence between the catchment export N : P, reservoir N : P, phytoplankton N versus P limitation and the dominance of heterocystous cyanobacteria. However, the N : P stoichiometry of sediments retained in the lakes was relatively insensitive to catchment stoichiometry, suggesting that a common set of biogeochemical processes constrains sediment N : P across lakes of contrasting catchment land use.					; Christian, Alan/JXN-4157-2024	Christian, Alan/0009-0004-4620-1104; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2011	56	5					791	811		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02436.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02436.x													WOS:000289171400001
J	Guo, Y; Lai, XJ; Gan, M				Guo, Yan; Lai, Xijun; Gan, Min			Cyanobacterial biomass prediction in a shallow lake using the time series SARIMAX models	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												To address the challenge of forecasting harmful algal blooms caused by excessive growth of cyanobacteria in a shallow lake, we investigated cyanobacterial biomass prediction models based on a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX). Cyanobacteria cell density (CCD) was chosen as the indicator of cyanobacterial biomass. Ten years monthly observations from 2009 to 2018 collecting from a typical eutrophication shallow lake (Meiliang Bay, Lake Taihu) with frequent occurrence of algae blooms were used to construct and validate the proposed models. The mathematical experiments show that the variability and fluctuations of cyanobacterial biomass can be well-predicted by the models with appropriate exogenous variables. The selection of exogenous variables is critical for the model performance. Feature importance analysis of exogenous variables reveals that main variables influencing the prediction of cyanobacterial blooms are chlorophyll a, chemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus and temperature. These variables should be considered in actual prediction of cyanobacterial blooms. This study provides an efficient tool for forecasting algal bloom with ecological interpretability and can improve our ability to deal with bloom-induced environmental issues in shallow lakes.					guo, yan/N-3299-2013; Lai, xijun/AGI-7278-2022														1574-9541	1878-0512				DEC	2023	78								102292	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102292	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102292		SEP 2023											WOS:001080594600001

Individual-based analyses reveal high repeatability in timing and location of reproduction in lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Few studies have quantified the repeatability of reproductive decisions by individuals or assessed their relationship with environmental variables over multiple seasons for long-lived iteroparous fish species. Using individual-based data collected for 678 lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) over 8 consecutive years, we evaluated hypotheses regarding spawning periodicity and repeatability of spawning location, spawning time, and environmental cues associated with spawning. At our study site (Upper Black River, northern Michigan, USA), interspawning interval differed between males (2.3 +/- 0.08 years) and females (3.7 +/- 0.16 years), but was not significantly related to age. Individual spawning behavior was highly repeatable with respect to spawning time (relative day within the spawning season) for both sexes regardless of size or age, but was less repeatable, though still significant, relative to water temperature, river discharge, and lunar phase. Breeding area was also repeatable, with individuals spawning earlier in the season selecting locations further upstream than those spawning later. Repeatability in spawning times and locations suggest that subpopulation differentiation may develop among different spawning groups, even within small and spatially contiguous areas.

J	Yang, W; Sun, T; Yang, ZF				Yang, Wei; Sun, Tao; Yang, Zhifeng			Does the implementation of environmental flows improve wetland ecosystem services and biodiversity? A literature review	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Environmental flow releases are a tool for wetland restoration, but there has been no systematic evaluation of their success. We systematically assessed 102 published studies from a wide range of wetland ecosystems across the globe to determine whether releasing environmental flows could maintain or promote biodiversity and increase ecosystem services, and which strategies were most effective. We found that environmental flow releases remarkably increased regulating services (sediment regulation and water purification) and supporting services (primary production and habitat maintenance), and maintained biodiversity and provisioning services. Biodiversity responses were positive only in river wetlands, and were negative in coastal, lake, and marsh wetlands; the overall delivery of ecosystem services responded positively in all ecosystem types except artificial wetlands. The effects were positive for ecosystem services under all environmental flow regimes, and seasonal minimum flow releases could maintain biodiversity and improve ecosystem services. We also found that long-term environmental flow releases (years to decades) maintained biodiversity. Values of a change-in-flow parameter (D) ranging from 0 to 10% improved both biodiversity and ecosystem services. In summary, long-term implementation, a high-flow regime, and D ranging from 0 to 10% for the environmental flows promoted biodiversity and improved ecosystem services around the world, particularly in river wetlands. Regional-level conclusions might be applicable to guide the implementation of environmental flow releases, but small sample sizes reduce their reliability. We also found that the effect sizes of environmental flow release projects for biodiversity and ecosystem services were significantly and positively correlated in rivers, but not in other wetlands.					; Yang, Zhifeng/AAB-8803-2022	Yang, Wei/0000-0003-1353-846X; 													1061-2971	1526-100X				NOV	2016	24	6					731	742		10.1111/rec.12435	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.12435													WOS:000387366100005

The double-cropping rice system due to its unique characteristic of wide seasonal span and high nitrogen input make the variations and losses in Nr components during different rice seasons and in response to water and nitrogen regulation worthy of more attention. In this study, utilizing the method of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), based on two years of in-situ observations, we quantified the nitrogen footprint (NF) of a double-cropping rice system under five different water-nitrogen management practices in Poyang Lake Basin, and evaluated their potential for emission reduction individually. The results showed that the NF of early rice was mainly contributed by runoff of NH4+ (40.15%-59.18%), while for late rice, NH3 dominated (77.15%-93.35%). Among the different treatments, the NF ranking was as follows: farmer's practice (FP) > alternate wetting and drying (AWD) > optimized nitrogen management (OPTN) > AWD + OPTN > control (CK). Compared to FP, AWD, OPTN and AWD + OPTN reduced the yield-scale NF by 20.58%, 40.38% and 51.98%, respectively, which demonstrated effective and robust performance of AWD + OPTN between NF reduction and crop yield maintaining. From the perspective of the climate effects of gaseous Nr, the short-term cooling effect caused by NH3 and NO emissions could offset 42.76% of the warming effect from N2O emissions. However, in the long-term, only the OPTN treatment exhibited a reduction of the net global temperature potential by approximately 4.09%. Therefore, the OPTN and AWD + OPTN modes are recommended as optimized approaches from different sights for double-cropping rice systems in the Poyang Lake Basin. This study also provides policymakers with more accurate Nr loss inventories and NF predictions in rice fields.

The impact of mesh size on collection of meiofauna with special regard to nematodes	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Meiofaunal organisms are the predominant metazoans in benthic systems and important members of the benthic food web. They are defined by mesh size and specifically by their retention on a sieve with a 44-mu m mesh size. In this study, we examined the accuracy of this standard collection method by counting the number of meiobenthic individuals, life stages and nematode species in a sample. A filter cascade consisting of five different mesh sizes (41 mu m, 30 mu m, 20 mu m, 10 mu m and 1 mu m) was used to fractionate a natural freshwater meiobenthic collection, and the individuals in each fraction were then counted. In line with the current definition of meiofauna, all tardigrades, microcrustaceans, chironomids and oligochaetes were retained by the largest mesh size, whereas 9% of the rotifers were first retained on the 30-mu m meshes. For nematodes, 23% were not retained on the 41-mu m meshes and individuals were collected even from the 1-mu m fraction. With declining mesh size, the yield of retained nematodes increased, the age structure shifted to juveniles, evenness declined, and the species composition changed. As all of these findings were significant, this study therefore shows that the current definition of meiofauna is not sufficient to encompass the entire spectrum of meiofauna present in a sample and may result in misleading assessments of the diversity and composition of these organisms. We therefore propose that, especially for nematodes, a definition based on a smaller mesh size (at least 20 mu m) is more appropriate.					; Traunspurger, Walter/KGL-7190-2024	Ptatscheck, Christoph/0000-0002-2079-4130; Traunspurger, Walter/0000-0002-9828-8430													1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2020	54	4					1135	1143		10.1007/s10452-020-09798-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-020-09798-2		SEP 2020											WOS:000566857600002

Regional vs. global temperature calibrations for lacustrine BrGDGTs in the North American (sub)tropics: Implications for their application in paleotemperature reconstructions	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) have shown great promise in lacustrine temperature reconstructions across different continents. While brGDGTs have been reported from many different regions and global brGDGT-temperature calibrations have been developed with various methods, southern North America remains an understudied area with little available data. In this study, we analyzed 101 lake surface sediment samples across Mexico and Central America and compared their distributions with those in other lacustrine systems. Nine major brGDGTs were found in all samples. We investigated the relationships between the distribution of the fractional abundances of the nine major brGDGTs and temperature and developed regional calibrations for Mean Annual Temperature using three different approaches, including a novel machine learning method - Ridge Regression. All the regional calibrations provide similar results with very close error ranges (RMSE = 3.1 degrees C). The majority of global brGDGT-temperature calibrations tend to reconstruct lower temperatures when it is below 15 degrees C. Interestingly, regional brGDGT calibrations appear to reduce the "cold bias", but the various global and regional calibrations tested here are not significantly different in their predictive capability.					; laura, macario-gonzález/AAR-8906-2021; Perez, Liseth/HZI-0811-2023	Macario-Gonzalez, Laura/0000-0002-6105-8033; Caballero, Margarita/0000-0001-5691-0773; Schwalb, Antje/0000-0002-4628-1958; Perez, Liseth/0000-0002-5256-3070													0146-6380	1873-5290				OCT	2023	184								104660	10.1016/j.orggeochem.2023.104660	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2023.104660		SEP 2023											WOS:001078722700001

Recently, ecologists have obtained conflicting conclusions while analyzing the influence of species diversity on plankton resource use efficiency (RUE) and community turnover. In this study, both phytoplankton and zooplankton communities were investigated seasonally from 2011 to 2013 in Lake Nansihu, a meso-eutrophic and recovering lake in China. The effects of phytoplankton diversity on RUE of phytoplankton (RUEPP), zooplankton (RUEZP), and community turnover were analyzed. Results showed that both phytoplankton species richness and evenness were positively correlated with RUEPP. RUEZP had a negative relationship with phytoplankton species richness, but a weak unimodal relationship with phytoplankton evenness. Cyanobacteria community had the opposite influence on RUEPP and RUEZP. Thus, cyanobacteria dominance will benefit RUEPP in eutrophic lakes, but the growth and reproduction of zooplankton are greatly limited. The strong negative relationship between total phosphorus and RUEZP confirmed these results. Phytoplankton community turnover tended to decrease with increasing phytoplankton evenness, which was consistent with most previous studies. The correlation coefficient between phytoplankton species richness and community turnover was negative, but not significant (p > 0.05). Therefore, phytoplankton community turnover was more sensitive to the variation of evenness than species richness. These results will be helpful in understanding the effects of species diversity on ecosystem functioning in aquatic ecosystems.

Climatology of cold season lake-effect cloud bands for the North American Great Lakes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) visible imagery was used to identify lake-effect (LE) clouds in the North American Great Lakes region for the cold seasons (October-March) of 1997/1998 through 2013/2014 to provide a comprehensive climatological description of the seasonal and interannual variability of LE cloud bands. During the average cold season, at least 60% of days each month had LE clouds over some portion of the Great Lakes region and nearly 75% of all LE days had LE clouds present over several lakes simultaneously. Wind-parallel bands (WPB) are observed far more frequently than any other type of LE over Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron during the months of December, January, and February. Over Lake Erie, the occurrence of days per month with WPB was found to be approximately 5-10% greater than days with shore-parallel bands (SPBs) throughout the entire cold season. The greatest frequency of SPB occurrences in the Great Lakes region was over Lake Ontario during the months of January and February (approximate to 20% of days). In addition, Lake Ontario was the only lake where the frequencies of WPB and SPB occurrences were fairly similar each month. The annual frequency of WPB occurrences are the most variable among the Great Lakes, decreasing in frequency from the western lakes toward the eastern lakes. Lake Ontario has the largest annual frequency of SPB occurrences and the greatest variation in SPB annual frequency. Lake Huron has the second largest annual frequency of SPB days with small interannual variation. The primary differences of the annual frequency of lake-to-lake (L2L) LE occurrences when compared with previous research were a greater variability in the L2L annual frequency of Superior-to-Michigan connections, greater frequency of Michigan-to-Huron connections, and less frequent occurrences for Superior-to-Huron and Michigan-to-Erie connections.					; Gaudet, Lauriana/AAA-8528-2019	Gaudet, Lauriana/0000-0003-4679-4507; Grasmick, Coltin/0000-0001-6755-3695; Higgins, Lindsey/0000-0002-0778-777X; 													0899-8418	1097-0088				MAR 30	2017	37	4					2111	2121		10.1002/joc.4838	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.4838													WOS:000397497700032
J	Steinschneider, S; Brown, C				Steinschneider, Scott; Brown, Casey			Dynamic reservoir management with real-option risk hedging as a robust adaptation to nonstationary climate	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The implications of climate change and the potential nonstationarity of the hydrologic record necessitate innovative approaches to water management. This study presents a novel adaptation strategy for water reservoir management under nonstationary hydrologic conditions. Seasonal hydrologic forecasts and a real-option instrument allow reservoir operations that dynamically adapt to an evolving hydrologic record. System operating policies are conditioned on seasonal hydrologic forecasts to account for year-to-year variability and climate change and a real option is established to hedge against the risk associated with operational forecasts and unexpected climate outcomes. This scheme is implemented over an ensemble of climate futures based on general circulation model (GCM) simulations. Two alternative management strategies are considered, one in which system operations are optimized for the GCM-based ensemble mean projection of the future and a baseline strategy in which assumptions of stationarity are maintained and operations are left unchanged from historic norms. The approach is evaluated for a water supply-hydropower facility on the Westfield River in the northeast United States. Results suggest that seasonal hydrologic forecasts are a promising adaptation to nonstationary hydrology, even without the support of a risk hedging option. Surprisingly, the option approach enabled even a stationary assumption to perform well in the future, suggesting that option instruments alone can act as a robust adaptation mechanism.

Multivariate statistical methods define the end-member water groups, identifying dominant processes explaining hydrogeochemical variance in wet and dry season water chemistry datasets. Mineral saturation indices (SIs) and inverse geochemical modeling (IGM) investigate potential geochemical reactions and mixing processes responsible for the observed groundwater compositions and their spatiotemporal evolution along reversed flow paths caused by overexploitation in the Rhodope aquifer system. Results reveal that a concise set of reactant and product phases, including CO 2(g) , H2O, 2 O, calcite, gypsum, halite, celestite, plagioclase, K-feldspar, illite, and Ca-montmorillonite, along with ion exchange processes (CaX2, 2 , MgX2, 2 , and NaX), explains the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater along reversed flow paths between genetically and compositionally different surface and groundwater bodies. Systematic changes in water chemistry along the flow paths are attributed to mixing of surface waters and/or different groundwater end-members, dilution by a freshwater component, water-rock interaction (WRI) processes, and ion exchange involving Ca/Mg- and/or Na-clays. The chemical evolution represented by IGMs initiates with the mixing of Aegean seawater and Aspropotamos River, incorporating WRI and ion exchange processes (Mg- and Na-clays) to produce the water chemistry of Vistonida Lake, the only surface water body with hydraulic interaction with the groundwater system in the study area. Statistically-defined end-member water groups effectively explain the groundwater flow system and evolutionary processes between hydraulically connected surface and groundwater bodies. Overall, the fusion of multivariate statistical analysis (MVSA), inverse geochemical modeling (IGM), and GIS techniques proves potent and comprehensive, enhancing understanding of groundwater dynamics, improving prediction accuracy, aiding proficient management, and facilitating data-driven decision-making within the realm of groundwater assessment and management.

This study aimed to determine the spatial and temporal variability of total coliforms (TCs) and fecal coliforms (FCs) in the surface water of San Pedro Lake as well as the gills and skin of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) cultivated in the lake. The study consisted of seasonal sampling during an annual cycle. Using the multiple-tube fermentation technique, we quantified the microbial load of TCs in the lake and fish. The median of the TC and FC groups in surface water showed differences during the seasonal cycle, in which a significant correlation was observed between rainfall and bacterial load in the lake surface water. There was a significant seasonal difference between FCs and TCs in the gills as well as in skin FCs. Anthropogenic activities in the watershed combined with rainfall influence the bacterial load of San Pedro Lake. However, the water quality is still classified as excellent and uncontaminated according to Mexican regulations with lower FC values acceptable for higher FC values. In addition, the bacterial load in tilapia from San Pedro Lake does not pose a risk to human health.

Here, we report a unique case of non-seasonal, multiannual regime shift of phytoplankton community structure in Lake Kivu, East Africa, and explore the possible causes for such changes. We recorded phytoplankton biomass every 2 weeks over a period of 12 years (from 2002 to 2015). Phytoplankton community previously dominated by cyanobacteria and diatoms changed considerably from 2012, with a conspicuous rise in the biomass of green algae (from 3 to 33% lake-wide), and a decline of cryptophytes and cyanobacteria along with an increase in total chlorophyll a concentration. Concomitantly, we observed significant differences in the mixed layer depth between the two periods, resulting from changes in the thermal gradient. The euphotic zone depth was also reduced in 2012-2015, probably from the higher phytoplankton biomass. Moreover, mean particulate nitrogen and phosphorus increased as well as the particulate N:P ratio. Desmids (Cosmarium laeve) now dominate the mixolimnion, probably due to atelomixis, observed in high-frequency temperature measurements. We believe that decadal or multidecadal variability of climate on the Indian Ocean may be the reason for this regime shift in thermal stratification, with a strong impact in phytoplankton community structure. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that tropical lakes may be subject to non-seasonal fluctuations that generate multiannual regime shifts. These regime shifts have probably never been reported previously because of the lack of long phytoplankton time-series in low latitudes.					; Thiery, Wim/AAJ-6692-2021; Darchambeau, Francois/AAX-1206-2021; Stoyneva-Gärtner, Maya/F-4549-2018; Sarmento, Hugo/W-3805-2019; Sarmento, Hugo/A-7655-2008	Stoyneva-Gartner, Maya/0000-0003-2439-3737; Thiery, Wim/0000-0002-5183-6145; Sarmento, Hugo/0000-0001-5220-7992; Descy, Jean-Pierre/0000-0003-1649-7800													0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2019	64	11					1940	1955		10.1111/fwb.13383	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13383													WOS:000490904700005

A Characterization of the Delaware Sea Breeze Using Observations and Modeling	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Sea-breeze circulations are a prominent source of diurnal wind variability along coastlines throughout the world. For Delaware, the sea breeze is the largest source of variability in the coastal wind field. We developed a detailed, year-round sea-breeze climatology for the Delaware coastline using 9 years of meteorological station data and an objective sea-breeze detection algorithm. Sea-breeze fronts were identified and characterized by timing, speed, and duration as well as the resulting temperature and humidity changes. The observed temperature change associated with the Delaware sea-breeze front varied spatially, as well as with season, time of day, location, and developmental stage of the front. The observed sea breeze also had some unique features because of the location of southern Delaware on the Delmarva Peninsula and the complicated shape of the local coastline. Details of the summertime sea breeze were further explored using simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting Model for June-August of 2000-09. Model-simulated sea-breeze characteristics were then compared with the observed sea-breeze climatology whenever possible. Results suggest that the mesoscale atmospheric model is capable of simulating the complex, observed spatial and temporal characteristics of the Delaware Sea breeze. However, the sea breeze in the model was weaker than that observed and tended to dissipate earlier in the afternoon, making it a challenging phenomenon to detect and characterize in the model. Improved detection and simulation of the sea-breeze fronts will increase our understanding of the impact this regional phenomenal has on the local climate and on the populations living by the coast.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				JUL	2018	57	7					1405	1421		10.1175/JAMC-D-17-0186.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-17-0186.1													WOS:000437724600001

Performance of faecal indicator bacteria, microbial source tracking, and pollution risk mapping in tropical water	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) are used for the assessment of faecal pollution and possible water quality deterioration. There is growing evidence that FIB used in temperate regions are not adequate and reliable to detect faecal pollution in tropical regions. Hence, this study evaluated the adequacy of FIB, including total coliforms (TC), Escherichia coli (EC), Enterococci (IEC), and Clostridium perfringens (CP) in the highaltitude, tropical country of Ethiopia. In addition to FIB, for microbial source tracking (MST), a ruminant-associated molecular marker was applied at different water types and altitudes, and faecal pollution risk mapping was conducted based on consensus FIB. The performances of the indicators were evaluated at 22 sites from different water types. The results indicate that EC cell enumeration and CP spore determination perform well for faecal contamination monitoring. Most of the sub-basins of Lake Tana were found to be moderately to highly polluted, and the levels of pollution were demonstrated to be higher in the rainy season than in the post-rainy season. Markers associated with ruminants (BacR) were identified in more than three quarters of the sites. A bacterial pollution risk map was developed for sub-basins of Lake Tana, including the un-gauged sub-basins. We demonstrate how bacterial pollution risk mapping can aid in improvements to water quality testing and reduce risk to the general population from stream bacteria. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Submerged Vegetation Responses to Climate Variation and Altered Hydrology in a Subtropical Estuary: Interpreting 33 Years of Change	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Links between hydrologic modifications, flow and salinity regimes, and submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) species composition and abundance were assessed with an empirical analysis of 33 years of monitoring data collected at nine sites in Florida's Caloosahatchee River Estuary (CRE). Freshwater inflows to the estuary (30-day means) were often outside the previously recommended envelope of 12.74 to 79.29 m(3) s(-1). Discharges from Lake Okeechobee through a synthetic hydrologic link were responsible for 43% of the above-envelope flows, but reduced the incidence of below-envelope flows by 30%. A salinity model and salinity stress indices developed for each SAV species indicated that the observed flows generated variable salinity conditions likely to harm both seagrasses and freshwater SAV in the estuary. Regression modeling of SAV abundance generally confirmed the flow and salinity responses expected for each species:Halodule wrightiiandThalassia testudinumin the lower estuary were both harmed by high-flow, low-salinity conditions, whileVallisneria americanain the upper estuary was decimated by low-flow, high-salinity conditions. There was a species-specific effect of the seasonal timing of high flows-T. testudinumwas more negatively correlated with high flows in the dry season;H. wrightiiin the wet season.The regression analyses also highlighted strong, year-to-year autocorrelations in SAV abundance, indicating reduced resilience after severe losses, particularly forV. americana. Large residual variation in some regression models suggested that factors other than salinity (e.g., optical water quality or grazing impacts) may also influence the system dynamics and should be incorporated in continuing research. This analysis suggests that use of artificial water management infrastructure to reduce extreme high and low flows to the Caloosahatchee and other estuaries could help maintain SAV health in light of intensifying climate variability and degraded watershed flow regulation capacity.

J	Kralles, ZT; Ikuma, K; Dai, N				Kralles, Zachary T.; Ikuma, Kaoru; Dai, Ning			Assessing disinfection byproduct risks for algal impacted surface waters and the effects of peracetic acid pre-oxidation	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY												This study assessed the disinfection byproduct (DBP) risks of algal impacted surface waters and the effects of peracetic acid (PAA) pre-oxidation on DBP risks. Authentic samples from three eutrophic lakes were collected over a 13-week period during the algal bloom season. The formation of 11 DBPs (four trihalomethanes, four haloacetonitriles, two haloketones, and trichloronitromethane) in these samples was assessed under uniform formation conditions (UFC) approximating drinking water disinfection. Trihalomethanes formed in the greatest abundance (90-370 mu g L-1), followed by haloacetonitriles (6.5-87 mu g L-1), haloketones (0.4-11.4 mu g L-1), and trichloronitromethane (0.3-9.7 mu g L-1). Total chlorophyll, a common indicator of algal activity, was not found to correlate with DBP yields. On the other hand, the yields of trichloronitromethane and haloacetonitriles correlated with nitrite/nitrate concentrations and DON concentrations in the samples, respectively. PAA pre-oxidation reduced the formation of trihalomethanes in the subsequent UFC tests in 80% of the samples, but promoted the formation of haloacetonitriles and trichloronitromethane in 70% and 50% of the samples, respectively. Analyses of DOC, DON, SUVA, and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices suggest that PAA pre-oxidation can alter the DBP precursors of a sample through the release of high haloacetonitrile/trichloronitromethane-yielding organic matter from algal cells and the oxidative transformation of existing and newly released dissolved organic matter. The results of this study, obtained from authentic surface water samples, suggest that mixed organic matter dynamics is an important consideration for the DBP risks of algal-impacted waters.					; Dai, Ning/N-7200-2015	Kralles, Zachary/0000-0002-0960-608X; Ikuma, Kaoru/0000-0003-3715-7821; Dai, Ning/0000-0002-8468-5611													2053-1400	2053-1419				SEP 1	2020	6	9					2365	2381		10.1039/d0ew00237b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ew00237b													WOS:000562926300008

However, human activities have resulted in wetland loss in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MLYRB), while the wetland distribution in this area shows great discrepancy in previous estimates. It is, therefore, imperative to estimate the distribution of potential wetlands at present and project their variation under future climate change scenarios. In this study, we simulate the wetland distribution in the MLYRB at 15 '' resolution using 5 machine learning methods with 19 predicting factors of topographic index, vegetation index, climate data, hydrological data, and soil type data. A 5-fold cross-validation with observed permanent wetlands shows that the reconstructions from Adaptive Boosting tree (AdaBoost) algorithm have the highest accuracy of 97.5%. The potential wetland area in the MLYRB is approximately similar to 1.25 x 10(5) km(2), accounting for 15.66% of the study region. Direct human activities have led to the loss of nearly half of the potential wetlands. Furthermore, sensitivity experiments with the well-trained models are performed to quantify the response of the total wetland area to each influencing factor. Results indicate vulnerability of wetland areas to increases in leaf area index (LAI), coldest season temperature, warmest season temperature, and solar radiation. By the 2100s, the potential wetland area is expected to decrease by 40.5% and 50.6% under the intermediate and very high emissions scenarios, respectively. The changes in LAI and the coldest season temperature will contribute to 50% and 40% of this loss of potential wetlands, respectively. Wetland loss may further undermine biodiversity, such as waterfowl, and fail to provide functions such as flood protection, and water supply. This work reveals the spatial pattern of potential wetland areas and their sensitivity to climate changes, stressing the need for effective strategies to mitigate wetland loss at specific regions in the MLYRB.

The excessive proliferation of cyanobacteria caused by rising temperature and eutrophication leads to the production and release of copious amounts of microcystins, requiring critical management and control approaches to prevent the adverse environmental and public health problems associated with these bioactive metabolites. Despite hypotheses reported to explain the phylogeography and mechanisms responsible for cyanobacterial blooms in aquatic water bodies, many aspects are scarcely understood in Africa due to the paucity of investigations and lack of uniformity of experimental methods. Due to a lack of information and large-scale studies, cyanobacteria occurrence and genetic diversity are seldom reported in African aquatic ecosystems. This review covers the diversity and geographical distribution of potential microcystin-producing and non-microcystin-producing cyanobacterial taxa in Africa. Molecular analyses using housekeeping genes (e.g., 16S rRNA, ITS, rpoC1, etc.) revealed significant sequence divergence across several cyanobacterial strains from East, North, West, and South Africa, but the lack of uniformity in molecular markers employed made continent-wise phylogenetic comparisons impossible. Planktothrix agardhii, Microcystis aeruginosa, and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (presently known as Raphidiopsis raciborskii) were the most commonly reported genera. Potential microcystin (MCs)-producing cyanobacteria were detected using mcy genes, and several microcystin congeners were recorded. Studying cyanobacteria species from the African continent is urgent to effectively safeguard public and environmental health because more than 80% of the continent has no data on these important microorganisms and their bioactive secondary metabolites.					; Lorenzi, Adriana/H-2164-2013; Chia, Mathias/E-3448-2013; Balogun, Emmanuel/AAF-3352-2020	Balogun, Emmanuel/0000-0002-2092-0045; Ameh, Ilu/0000-0002-8346-047X; Korie, George Chibuike/0000-0001-6083-0063; Sturion Lorenzi, Adriana/0000-0002-2247-0543; Chia, Mathias/0000-0002-3549-5475; 														2305-6304				DEC	2022	10	12							772	10.3390/toxics10120772	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxics10120772								36548605					WOS:000903241200001

Statistical models have been developed to predict the water-quality constituent loads from the available data of sampled con-centration (low-frequency/grab chemistry data) and continuous discharge (high frequency) at a particular sampled location and to further analyze trends and changes in water quality. However, the performance of statistical models to estimate water quality constituent loads depends on many aspects including the type of water quality constituent, sampling strategy and frequency, and the land use and areas of the watershed. This study evaluates the performance of a wide range of statistical models for the estimation of total suspended solids (TSS) and total phosphorus (TP) loads under various sampling scenarios and monitoring stations in Southern Ontario, Canada. Trends in TSS and TP concentrations and loads were further analyzed in major tributaries. The Weighted Regression on Time, Discharge, and Season Kalman Filter (WRTDS_K) model was found to be the most suitable model (p > 0.05 and Percentage Difference (%) (PDIFF) between +/- 20) for predicting TSS loads at most sampling stations and under most sampling scenarios, while, the Weighted Regression on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) model was found to be the most suitable model (p > 0.05 and flux bias statistics (FBS) between +/- 0.1) for predicting TP loads. The applied statistical models (LOADEST simple and curvilinear models, WRTDS, WRTDS_k, Beale's estimator, composite and interpolation models) have shown a limited potential to estimate load accurately at monitoring stations covering small drainage areas.

The total concentration of 11 heavy metal(loid)s (Al, Cu, Pb, Zn, Cr, Ni, Co, Cd, Mn, As, and Hg) was determined to investigate their physicochemical properties and spatial-temporal distribution characteristics. The heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) and the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model were employed to evaluate water quality and to reveal quantitatively identified pollution sources for further investigation to obtain a health risk assessment using the hazard index (HI) and carcinogenic risk (CR) of various pollution sources. The mean concentrations of heavy metal(loid)s in surface water in the wet and dry seasons were ranked as: Al > Mn > Zn > Ni > Cd > Cr > Cu > As >Hg = Pb > Co, with the mean concentration of Hg being higher than the national Class II surface water environmental quality standard (GB3838-2002). In terms of time scale, the concentration of most heavy metal(loid)s was higher in the wet season; most heavy metal(loid)s were distributed mainly in the midstream area. HEI index indicated that the main water quality status was "slightly affected" in the study area. Five potential sources of pollution were obtained from the PMF model, including industrial activities, traffic sources, agricultural activities, domestic waste emissions, and natural resources. The source-oriented risk assessment indicated that the largest contributions of HI and CR were agricultural sources in the Lijiang River. This study provides a "target" for the precise control of pollution sources, which has a broad impact on improving the fine management of the water environment in the basin.

Dreissenid (quagga and zebra mussel) veligers are adversely affected by bloom forming cyanobacteria	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Quagga (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) and zebra (D. polymorpha) mussels are broadcast spawners that produce planktonic, free swimming veligers, a life history strategy dissimilar to native North American freshwater bivalves. Dreissenid veligers require highly nutritious food to grow and survive, and thus may be susceptible to increased mortality rates during harsh environmental conditions like cyanobacteria blooms. However, the impact of cyanobacteria and one of the toxins they can produce (microcystin) has not been evaluated in dreissenid veligers. Therefore, we exposed dreissenid veligers to eleven distinct cultures (isolates) of cyanobacteria representing Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Dolichospermum, Microcystis, and Planktothrix species and the cyanotoxin microcystin to determine the lethality of cyanobacteria on dreissenid veligers. Six-day laboratory bioassays were performed in microplates using dreissenid veligers collected from the Detroit River, Michigan, USA. Veligers were exposed to increasing concentrations of cyanobacteria and microcystin using the green algae Chlorella minutissima as a control. Based on dose response curves formulated from a Probit model, the LC50 values for cyanobacteria used in this study range between 15.06 and 135.06 mu g/L chlorophyll-a, with the LC50 for microcystin-LR at 13.03 mu g/L. Because LC50 values were within ranges observed in natural waterbodies, it is possible that dreissenid recruitment may be suppressed when veliger abundances overlap with seasonal cyanobacteria blooms. Thus, the toxicity of cyanobacteria to dreissenid veligers may be useful to include in models forecasting dreissenid mussel abundance and spread.					; Boegehold, Anna/AAU-9050-2020	Kashian, Donna/0000-0002-4287-9338; 													0147-6513	1090-2414				OCT 30	2019	182								109426	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109426	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109426								31301595					WOS:000480673000027

A taxonomy-free diatom eDNA-based technique for assessing lake trophic level using lake sediments	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Anthropogenic eutrophication is one of the most pressing issues facing lakes globally. Our ability to manage lake eutrophication is hampered by the limited spatial and temporal extents of monitoring records, stemming from the time-consuming and expensive nature of physiochemical and biological monitoring. Diatom-based biomonitoring presents an alternative to traditional eutrophication monitoring, yet it is restricted by the high degree of taxonomic expertise required. Environmental DNA metabarcoding, while providing a promising substitute for diatom community enumeration, is plagued by inadequate taxonomic coverage of reference databases and methodological bias, limiting its use for biomonitoring. Here we show that taxonomy-free diatom-biomonitoring, in which environmental DNA metabarcoding data is utilised but not assigned to specific taxonomic classes, presents an accurate, fast, and relatively automated alternative to taxonomically assigned eutrophication biomonitoring. Our taxonomy-free index accounted for 85% of trophic level variability across 89 lakes and had the lowest average prediction error of the three approaches tested. By not relying on taxonomic identification or metabarcoding reference databases, taxonomy-free biomonitoring maintains diatom diversity that is lost in taxonomic assignment using molecular approaches. Furthermore, by utilising lake sediments, the approach outlined here presents a time-integrated estimation of lake trophic level and thus does not require timeconsuming seasonal sampling. Taxonomy-free biomonitoring addresses the limitations of traditional physicochemical eutrophication monitoring and taxonomic biomonitoring alternatives and can be used to extend the spatial and temporal extents of eutrophication monitoring.					; Atalah, Javier/AFX-4822-2022; Atalah, Javier/AAV-9077-2021	Gregersen, Rose/0000-0002-7298-1739; Thomson-Laing, Georgia/0000-0001-8337-5489; Pearman, John Kenneth/0000-0002-2237-9723; Atalah, Javier/0000-0003-0625-3431; Wood, Susanna/0000-0003-1976-8266; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				NOV 1	2023	345								118885	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118885	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118885		AUG 2023						37659373					WOS:001080239000001

In this study, we identified six major plankton groups in Lake Bourget (France), based on cell size, taxonomic properties, food-web interactions and occurrence patterns: cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens, small and large phytoplankton, mixotrophs, herbivorous and carnivorous zooplankton. We then developed a deterministic dynamic model that describes the dynamics of these groups in terms of carbon and phosphorus fluxes, as well as of particulate organic phosphorus and dissolved inorganic phosphorus. The modular and generic model scheme, implemented as a set of modules under Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (FABM) enables run-time coupling of the plankton module an arbitrary number of times, each time with a prescribed position across the autotrophy/heterotrophy continuum. Parameters of the plankton groups were mainly determined conjointly by the taxonomic and allometric relationships, based on the species composition and average cellular volume of each group. The biogeochemical model was coupled to the one-dimensional General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) and forced with local meteorological conditions. The coupled model system shows very high skill in predicting the spatiotemporal distributions of water temperature and dissolved inorganic phosphorus for five simulated years within the period 2004 to 2010, and intermediate skill in predicting the plankton succession. We performed a scenario analysis to gain insight into the factors driving the sudden disappearance of P. rubescens in 2010. Our results provide evidence for the hypothesis that the abundance of this species before the onset of stratification is critical for its success later in the growing season, pointing thereby to a priority effect.

Rapid, Efficient Growth Reduces Mercury Concentrations in Stream-Dwelling Atlantic Salmon	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Mercury (Hg) is a potent toxin that biomagnifies in aquatic food webs. Large fish generally have higher Hg concentrations than small fish of the same species. However, models predict that fish that grow large faster will have lower Hg concentrations than small, slow-growing fish owing to somatic growth dilution (SGD). We examined the relationship between Hg concentration and growth rate in fish by means of a large-scale field experiment. Atlantic salmon Salmo salar fry hatched under uniform initial conditions were released at 18 sites in natural streams, collected after one growing season, and measured with respect to Hg concentration and growth. As expected for Hg accumulation from food, the Hg concentrations in the fish tracked those in their prey. Nonetheless, large, fast-growing fish had lower Hg concentrations than small, slow-growing ones, consistent with SGD. While the Hg concentration of the prey accounted for 59% of the explained variation in the Hg concentration in the Atlantic salmon across sites, the salmon growth rate accounted for 38%. A mass-balance Hg accumulation model shows that such SGD occurs when fast growth is associated with high growth efficiency. Fish growth is tremendously variable and sensitive to anthropogenic impacts, so the SGD of Hg has important implications for fisheries management.

Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) spawning habitat in a northern lake: The role of wind and physical characteristics on habitat quality	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) have a broad distribution across Canada's North, yet most studies that describe reproductive habitat are from the southern extent of their range. We assessed whether lake trout spawning habitat, typically characterized as wave-swept shoals with clean cobble that face predominant wind directions, is similar for a northern lake. Specifically, we examined a dozen sites around Alexie Lake, Northwest Territories, to test if physical habitat and wind exposure were important determinants of spawning site use and embryonic survival. Spawning occurred in similar to 2 m water depth, on 3-15 cm diameter clean substrate found on the leading edge of shoals that ended in a rock crib rising abruptly in nearshore regions around the lake. Wind direction was predominantly from the west, although it was highly variable within and among spawning seasons. We found evidence of lake trout spawning at each site examined, but not limited to shoals facing a predominate wind direction. High variation in embryonic survival (2-83%) from incubation trays was observed among spawning sites, suggesting a large gradient in habitat quality exists within a given lake. Modelled wind exposure did not predict embryonic survival, nor did physical characteristics that may influence interstitial water flow on spawning shoals. Our findings challenge the conventional role of wind as a predominant predictor of lake trout spawning site quality. We propose that the unpredictable nature of wind and abundance of suitable habitat may favour lake-wide spawning by lake trout as a bet-hedging strategy in northern lakes with limited fetch.

Geology and environments of subglacial Lake Vostok	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES												The reconstruction of the geological (tectonic) structure and environments of subglacial Lake Vostok is based on geophysical surveys and the study of mineral particles found in cores of accreted ice and frozen lake water (sampled after the lake was unsealed). Seismic reflection and refraction investigations conducted in the southern part of Lake Vostok show very thin (200-300 m) sedimentary cover overlying a crystalline basement. Most of this thin veneer is thought to have been deposited during temperate-glacial conditions in Oligocene to Middle Miocene time (ca 34-14 Ma). The composition of the lake-bottom sediments can be deduced from mineral inclusions found in cores of accreted ice. Inclusions are represented by soft aggregates consisting mainly of clay-mica minerals and micrometre-sized quartz grains. Some of these inclusions contain subangular to semi-rounded rock clasts (siltstones and sandstones) ranging from 0.3 to 8 mm in size. In total, 31 zircon grains have been identified in two rock clasts and dated using SHRIMP-II. The ages of the studied zircons range from 0.6 to 2.0 Ga with two distinct clusters between 0.8 and 1.15 Ga and between 1.6 and 1.8 Ga. Rock clasts obviously came from the western lake shore, which is thus composed of terrigenous strata with an age of not older than 600 Ma. The sedimentary nature of the western lake shore is also confirmed by seismic refraction data showing seismic velocities there of 5.4-5.5 km s(-1) at the bedrock surface. After Lake Vostok was unsealed, its water (frozen and sampled next season) was also studied with scanning electron microscopy and X-ray microprobe analysis. This study showed the existence of calcium carbonate and silica microparticles (10-20 mu m across) in frozen water.					; Leitchenkov, German/G-2221-2015; Lipenkov, Vladimir/Q-8262-2016	Lunev, Pavel/0000-0002-9422-4536; Leitchenkov, German/0000-0001-6316-8511; Lipenkov, Vladimir/0000-0003-4221-5440													1364-503X	1471-2962				JAN 28	2016	374	2059							20140302	10.1098/rsta.2014.0302	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2014.0302								26667916					WOS:000367471500009

Fire Characteristics and Hydrologic Connectivity Influence Short-Term Responses of North Temperate Lakes to Wildfire	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Despite increasing wildfires, few studies have investigated seasonal water quality responses to wildfire characteristics (e.g., burn severity) across a large number of lakes. We monitored 30 total lakes (15 burned, 15 control) monthly following the Greenwood Fire in Minnesota, USA, a lake-rich region with historically prevalent wildfire. We found increases in median concentrations of total nitrogen (68%), total phosphorus (70%), dissolved organic carbon (127%), total suspended solids (71%), and reduced water clarity (48%) and pH (0.45) in burned lakes. Post-wildfire responses in drainage lakes were often persistent or cumulative throughout the open-water season, compared to isolated lakes. Total phosphorus (TP) increased linearly with watershed high-severity burns, and shoreline high-severity burns explained more variation in TP than lake morphometry and watershed variables. Post-wildfire chlorophyll-a responses were nonsignificant and inconsistent, possibly due to light limitation. Our results suggest that increasing wildfires have significant potential to affect water quality of inland lakes.					; Wagner, Tyler/MIU-0726-2025; Lapierre, Jean-Francois/F-1838-2010	Henneck, Jerald/0009-0005-0939-8822; Belair, Mathide/0009-0003-3656-6655; Lapierre, Jean-Francois/0000-0001-5862-7955; McCullough, Ian/0000-0002-6832-674X; Moritz, Max/0000-0002-8995-8893; Filstrup, Christopher/0000-0003-3812-2831													0094-8276	1944-8007				AUG 28	2023	50	16							e2023GL103953	10.1029/2023GL103953	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023GL103953													WOS:001057448600001

The Fate of Carbon in Sediments of the Xingu and Tapajos Clea ater Rivers, Eastern Amazon	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												The Xingu and Tapaj6s rivers in the eastern Amazon are the largest clearwater systems of the Amazon basin. Both rivers have-fluvial rias" (i.e., lake-like channels) in their downstream reaches as they are naturally impounded by the Amazon mainstem. Fluvial rias are widespread in the Amazon landscape and most of the sedimentary load from the major clearwater and blackwater rivers is deposited in these channels. So far, little is known about the role of Amazon rias as a trap and reactor for organic sediments. In this study, we used organic and inorganic geochemistry, magnetic susceptibility, diatom, and pollen analyses in sediments (suspended, riverbed, and downcore) of the Xingu and Tapajos rias to investigate the effects of hydrologic variations on the carbon budget in these clearwater rivers over the Holocene. Ages of sediment deposition (similar to 100 to 5,500 years) were constrained by optically stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon. Major elements geochemistry and concentration of total organic carbon (TOC) indicate that seasonal hydrologic variations exert a strong influence on riverine productivity and on the input and preservation of organic matter in sediments. Stable carbon isotope data (delta C-13 from -31.04 to -27.49 parts per thousand) and pollen analysis indicate that most of the carbon buried in rias is derived from forests. In the Xingu River, diatom analysis in bottom sediments revealed 65 infrageneric taxa that are mostly well adapted to slack oligotrophic and acidic waters. TOC values in sediment cores are similar to values measured in riverbed sediments and indicate suitable conditions for organic matter preservation in sediments of the Xingu and Tapajos rias at least since the mid-Holocene, with carbon burial rates varying from about 84 g m(-2) yr(-1) to 169 g m(-2) yr(-1). However, redox-sensitive elements in sediment core indicate alternation between anoxic/dysoxic and oxic conditions in the water-sediment interface that may be linked to abrupt changes in precipitation. The variation between anoxic/dysoxic and oxic conditions in the water-sediment interface controls organic matter mineralization and methanogenesis. Thus, such changes promoted by hydrological variations significantly affect the capacity of Amazon rias to act either as sources or sinks of carbon.					; Schefuss, Enno/A-7101-2015; Sawakuchi, André/D-1445-2013; Schefuß, Enno/A-7101-2015; Oliveira Sawakuchi, Henrique/K-6194-2014; Chiessi, Cristiano/E-1916-2012; Bicudo, Denise/K-5562-2012; Oliveira Sawakuchi, Henrique/ABA-9796-2021; Bertassoli, Dailson/U-7335-2019; Zabel, Matthias/E-5044-2011; Pereira, Tatiana/J-7886-2012; Fapesp, Biota/F-8655-2017; de Almeida Santos, Rudney/AAD-5079-2022; de Oliveira, Paulo/A-9906-2015; Chiessi, Cristiano/JAZ-0806-2023; McGlue, Michael/C-9752-2014; Pupim, Fabiano/J-7869-2012; Hartmann, Gelvam/K-4856-2012	Bertassoli Jr, Dailson Jose/0000-0003-3141-8533; Schefuss, Enno/0000-0002-5960-930X; Oliveira Sawakuchi, Henrique/0000-0002-6815-7261; Chiessi, Cristiano/0000-0003-3318-8022; Sawakuchi, Andre/0000-0001-5016-2428; PEREIRA, TATIANA/0000-0002-1655-7562; Fapesp, Biota/0000-0002-9887-8449; de Almeida Santos, Rudney/0000-0002-1398-1835; Pupim, Fabiano/0000-0001-7452-1376; Hartmann, Gelvam/0000-0001-6078-3893														2296-7745					2017	4								44	10.3389/fmars.2017.00044	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2017.00044													WOS:000457690600044

Lago Pato is situated in a region overridden by the Southern Patagonian Ice Field during the Last Glacial and in a transitional climatic zone of Southern Patagonia sensitive to seasonal- to millennial-scale changes in the Southern Hemisphere Westerly Winds (SWW). Results show that a deep ice-dammed and enlarged palaeolake encompassed Lago del Toro and Lago Pato c. 30-20 ka after the ice had retreated from local-Last Glacial Maximum (l-LGM) limits at c. 48-34 ka and during the build-up to the global-Last Glacial Maximum (g-LGM), c. 26-19 ka. Gaps in both sediment records between c. 20-13.4 ka and c. 20-10 ka suggest hiatuses in sediment accumulation during the g-LGM and Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR) readvances and/or removal by lake lowering or flushing during the Late Glacial-early Holocene. The palaeolake level dropped from >100 m a.s.l. to similar to 40-50 m a.s.l. towards the end of the ACR c. 13.4-13.0 ka, creating a shallower glaciolacustrine environment dammed by an ice tongue in the Estancia Puerto Consuelo-ultima Esperanza fjord. Further lowering of the enlarged palaeolake level occurred when the ice thinned to <40 m a.s.l., eventually isolating Lago Pato from Lago del Toro and glaciogenic sediment input at c. 11.7 ka. After isolation, the ecology and water levels in Lago Pato became sensitive to regional climate shifts. The shallow, stable, and highly anoxic environment that developed after c. 11.7 ka is associated with weaker (or poleward shifted) SWW at 51 degrees S and was replaced at c. 10 ka by an increasingly productive shallow-littoral lake with a variable lake-level and periodic shifts in anoxic-oxic bottom water conditions and ratios of benthic-planktonic diatoms. A more open Nothofagus forest, established at c. 8.6-7.5 ka, and more arid conditions c. 7.5-5.7 cal ka BP are linked to another phase of weaker (or poleward shifted) SWW at 51 degrees S. More persistently wet conditions from c. 5.7 ka, with extensive closed Nothofagus forests and planktonic diatoms dominant, are associated with stronger (or equatorward shifted) SWW over 51 degrees S. The abrupt return of benthic-to-tychoplanktonic diatoms after c. 3 ka reflects enhanced SWW at 51 degrees S. Increasingly stable lacustrine and littoral wetland conditions established in the last similar to 500 years reflect weaker SWW and lasted until recent decades.

Our study is based on 160 palynological samples from a well-dated peat core. Palynological, assemblages and the associated biome scores show that from similar to 11.5 to similar to 9.5 cal. Kyr BP desert vegetation dominated and from similar to 9.5 to similar to 7.9 cal. Kyr BP steppe and wetland vegetation expanded. From similar to 7.9 to similar to 6.5 cal. Kyr BP wetland continued to be important but coniferous forest also expanded. The period from similar to 6.5 to similar to 3.0 cal. Kyr BP was characterized by coniferous forest while wetlands contracted. Further expansion of coniferous forest coverage and contracted desert cover were features of the last 3000 years. The percentage of Picea and changes in the taiga biome indicate a persistent wetting trend during the Holocene. We infer that this was controlled by the increasing frequency of AMO (Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillations)-like events-linked in Siberian warm-season precipitation. The tundra biome score and the associated percentage of Poaceae+Cyperaceae in the Chaiwopu Basin indicate two major stages of wetland expansion. Wetland expansion can be possibly attributed to i) an increased glacier melt water supply when the ice extent was large, ii) an increase in precipitation when temperature remained more or less constant, or iii) a combined effect of increased precipitation and decreased temperature.

J	Zhang, T; Li, JH; Pu, JB; Wu, FH				Zhang, Tao; Li, Jianhong; Pu, Junbing; Wu, Feihong			Physical and chemical control on CO2 gas transfer velocities from a low-gradient subtropical stream	WATER RESEARCH												CO2 exchanges across the water-air interface in rivers and lakes are currently believed to be responsible for the dominant share of global aquatic CO2 emissions. The gas transfer velocity (k(600)) is the key factor that constrains the CO2 fluxes. It is also the most problematic to establish because of its high spatial and temporal variability. Here, we have evaluated the seasonal and spatial dynamics in k(600) values and their physical and chemical controlling processes by gas tracer and floating chamber (FC) methods in three reaches of a low-gradient stream channel (Guancun surface stream, 'GSS') in a karst terrain in subtropical southwestern China in December 2016 and March, July and September 2017. The k(600) values were highly variable in space and time in this small stream. Physical processes, including the velocity of the stream and its slope, were found to control the variations of k(600). The k(600) values recorded in the dry season (March and December) were at minimal levels due to very slow flow and gentle slope, and were also affected by complexation in the solute-enriched waters. The characteristics high pH and low turbulence of gentle streams in carbonate karst areas are conducive to such complexation, which is of great significance in the limiting CO2 degassing in such regions. We have obtained the first k(600) prediction model for small streams in subtropical karst regions. In conclusion, we present a comprehensive approach for predicting the k(600) values in small channels by comparison of independent SF6 gas tracer and floating chamber methods.					li, jianhong/D-3483-2009; Zhang, Tao/ACM-0777-2022; Pu, Junbing/A-8609-2015														0043-1354	1879-2448				OCT 1	2021	204								117564	10.1016/j.watres.2021.117564	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.117564		AUG 2021						34455157					WOS:000697774700004

All sites samples had high diversity and richness (Rr > 30). The diversity indexes and the analysis of dendrograms obtained by DGGE fingerprint after applying Pearson's and Dice's coefficient showed a strong influence of sampling season. The Pareto-Lorenz (PL) curves and Fo analysis indicated that the microbial communities were balanced and despite the changing environmental conditions, they can preserve their functionality. The main phyla detected by DGGE were Bacteroidetes (39.73%), Proteobacteria (28.43%), Firmicutes (8.23%), and Cyanobacteria (5.14%). The majority of the sequences corresponding to uncultured bacteria belonged to Bacteroidetes phylum. Within Proteobacteria, the main genera detected were Halothiobacillus and Roseovarius. The environmental factors which influenced the community in a higher degree were the salinity and oxygen. The bacteria belonging to Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria were positively influenced by salinity. Nevertheless, bacteria related to Alpha-and Betaproteobacteria classes and phylum Firmicutes showed a positive correlation with oxygen and pH but negative with salinity. The phylumCyanobacteria were less influenced by the environmental variables. The bacterial community composition of Rambla Salada was also studied by dilution-to-extinction technique. Using this method, 354 microorganisms were isolated. The 16S sequences of 61 isolates showed that the diversity was very different to those obtained by DGGE and with those obtained previously by using classic culture techniques. The taxa identified by dilution-to-extinction were Proteobacteria (81.92%), Firmicutes (11.30%), Actinobacteria (4.52%), and Bacteroidetes (2.26%) phyla with Gammaproteobacteria as predominant class (65.7%). The main genera were: Marinobacter (38.85%), Halomonas (20.2%), and Bacillus (11.2%). Nine of the 61 identified bacteria showed less than 97% sequence identity with validly described species and may well represent new taxa. The number of bacteria in different samples, locations, and seasons were calculated by CARD-FISH, ranging from 54.3 to 78.9% of the total prokaryotic population. In conclusion, the dilution-to-extinction technique could be a complementary method to classical culture based method, but neither gets to cultivate the major taxa detected by DGGE. The bacterial community was influenced significantly by the physico-chemical parameters (specially the salinity and oxygen), the location and the season of sampling.					; Martínez-Checa Barrero, Fernando Jose/I-1548-2015; Martinez-Checa Barrero, Fernando Jose/I-1548-2015; Bejar, Victoria/I-1430-2017; Llamas, Inmaculada/AAE-8460-2020; Llamas, Inmaculada/I-2410-2015	Castro, David Jonathan/0000-0002-2267-2583; Martinez-Checa Barrero, Fernando Jose/0000-0003-2852-5071; Bejar, Victoria/0000-0003-1199-957X; Llamas, Inmaculada/0000-0001-6333-5033													1664-302X					JUN 21	2018	9								1377	10.3389/fmicb.2018.01377	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.01377								29977233					WOS:000435761400001

It contains basic knowl-edge for many applications related to the Earth atmosphere. Based on data acquired at aerosol robotic network (AERONET) sites across China, eight aerosol types namely, carbonaceous-black carbon (CBC) type, carbonaceous-brown carbon (CBrC) type, dust-desert (DD) type, dust-city (DC) type, high-humidity and high-pollution(HH-HP) type, high-humidity and low-pollution (HH-LP) type, low-humidity and high -pollution (LH-HP) type, and low-humidity and low-pollution (LH-LP) type, are obtained by cluster analy-sis, and the robustness of the clustering algorithm is then verified. The seasonal variations of the above aerosol types in Beijing, Taihu Lake, Lanzhou and Taiwan are analyzed. The eight aerosol models estab-lished provide a basis for the overall description of aerosols properties in China, and they could be ap-plied in the development of satellite remote sensing algorithms. These models may improve the accuracy and effectiveness of various applications related to atmospheric radiative transfer in China. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang, H; Li, YP; Huang, GH; Ma, Y; Zhang, Q; Li, YF				Wang, Hao; Li, Yongping; Huang, Guohe; Ma, Yuan; Zhang, Quan; Li, Yanfeng			Analyzing variation of water inflow to inland lakes under climate change: Integrating deep learning and time series data mining	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The alarming depletion of global inland lakes in recent decades makes it essential to predict water inflow from rivers to lakes (WIRL) trend and unveil the dominant influencing driver, particularly in the context of climate change. The raw time series data contains multiple components (i.e., long-term trend, seasonal periodicity, and random noise), which makes it challenging for traditional machine/deep learning techniques to effectively capture long-term trend information. In this study, a novel FactorConvSTLnet (FCS) method is developed through integrating STL decomposition, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and factorial analysis into a general framework. FCS is more robust in long-term WIRL trend prediction through separating trend information as a modeling predictor, as well as unveiling predominant drivers. FCS is applied to typical inland lakes (the Aral Sea and the Lake Balkhash) in Central Asia, and results indicate that FCS (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.88, root mean squared error = 67m3/s, mean relative error = 10%) outperforms the traditional CNN. Some main findings are: (i) during 1960-1990, reservoir water storage (WSR) was the dominant driver for the two lakes, respectively contributing to 71% and 49%; during 1991-2014 and 2015-2099, evaporation (EVAP) would be the dominant driver, with the contribution of 30% and 47%; (ii) climate change would shift the dominant driver from human activities to natural factors, where EVAP and surface snow amount (SNW) have an increasing influence on WIRL; (iii) compared to SSP1-2.6, the SNW contribution would decrease by 26% under SSP5-8.5, while the EVAP contribution would increase by 9%. The findings reveal the main drivers of shrinkage of the inland lakes and provide the scientific basis for promoting regional ecological sustainability.					li, yanfeng/HHT-0124-2022; Huang, Guohe (Gordon)/H-5306-2011; Zhang, Quan/LEM-5222-2024; Huang, Guohe/H-5306-2011	Huang, Guohe (Gordon)/0000-0003-4974-3019; 													0013-9351	1096-0953				OCT 15	2024	259								119478	10.1016/j.envres.2024.119478	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2024.119478		JUL 2024						38917931					WOS:001266082300001

The Reactive Mercury Active System (RMAS) uses cation exchange, nylon, and PTFE membranes to determine reactive mercury (RM), gaseous oxidized mercury, and particulate-bound mercury (PBM) concentrations and chemistry. New data for Atlanta, Georgia (NRGT) demonstrated that particulate-bound Hg was dominant and the chemistry was primarily N and S Hg-II compounds. At Great Salt Lake, Utah (GSL), RM was predominately PBM, with N=S > organics > halogen > O Hg-II compounds. At Guadalupe Mountains National Park, Texas (GUMO), halogenated compound concentrations were lowest when air interacting with the site was primarily derived from the Midwest, and highest when the air was sourced from Mexico. At Amsterdam Island, Southern Indian Ocean, compounds were primarily halogenated with some N, S, and organic Hg-II compounds potentially associated with biological activity. The GEOS-Chem model was applied to see if it predicted measurements at five field sites. Model values were higher than observations at GSL, slightly lower at NRGT, and observations were an order of magnitude higher than modeled values for GUMO and Reno, Nevada. In general, data collected from 13 locations indicated that N, S, and organic RM compounds were associated with city and forest locations, halogenated compounds were sourced from the marine boundary layer, and O compounds were associated with long-range transport. Data being developed currently, and in the past, suggest there are multiple forms of RM that modelers must consider, and PBM is an important component of RM.

Thus, the change in water level and the influential variables are analysed for 1960-2014 in the urbanized and watery Taihu Basin, China. The results indicate that the water level displays a significant increasing trend. Furthermore, low-oscillation and high-oscillation periods were found to have occurred in the 1960s-1970s and 2000s, respectively, by the quantile perturbation method. A strong relationship was shown between water level and precipitation in the 1960s-1980s, especially in the flood season. Since then, human activities, such as land-use change, river system degradation and hydrological structures, have played distinct roles and caused more than 82% of the annual and flood-seasonal water level variation. The results may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the hydrological processes and provide a good reference for flood control.

J	Snyder, SA; Kilgore, MA; Emery, MR; Schmitz, M				Snyder, Stephanie A.; Kilgore, Michael A.; Emery, Marla R.; Schmitz, Marissa			Maple Syrup Producers of the Lake States, USA: Attitudes Towards and Adaptation to Social, Ecological, and Climate Conditions	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Maple syrup is an important non-timber forest product derived from the sap of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marshall). However, maple syrup producers are facing a diversity of challenges, including: potential range shifts in the maple resource; increasing variability in the timing, duration and yield of sap flow and syrup operations; invasive species, pests and diseases; and intergenerational land and business transfer challenges. Members of Maple Syrup Producer Associations in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan were surveyed to learn about their operations, adaptation strategies, concerns, and information needs. While many respondents indicated they have undertaken or plan to undertake adaptation activities, only 11% had done so out of specific concern over changing climate conditions. Climate-motivated activities included: being prepared to tap earlier and utilizing newer technology such as vacuum tubing or reverse osmosis to enhance sap collection and processing efficiency. Respondents were generally unlikely to consider planting climate-resilient maple cultivars or tapping trees other than sugar maple. They expressed the greatest concerns over tree health and forest pests, as well as their physical ability and family member interest to continue their operations. Boil season variability and weather issues were viewed with less concern. Respondents were generally optimistic that they can adapt to future conditions, likely in large measure through the adoption of new technologies, and they expect their syrup production levels to slightly increase in the future. If future climate scenarios play out, however, additional planning and adaptation strategies may be called for, particularly as they relate to forest health and productivity issues.																			0364-152X	1432-1009				FEB	2019	63	2					185	199		10.1007/s00267-018-1121-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-018-1121-7								30688998					WOS:000458423900003

However, less emphasis has been given to the littoral part of tropical African lakes, with many of the previous researches focusing only on the open water side. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to investigate the impact of the littoral zone of a shallow freshwater tropical lake (Ziway, Ethiopia), dominated by two emergent macrophytes, on zooplankton community structure. We hypothesized that the wetland vegetation serves as a preferred microhabitat for zooplankton communities. A lake with substantial coverage of emergent macrophytes was monitored monthly from January to August, 2016. The monitoring included the measurements of physical, chemical, and biological parameters. Sampling sites were selected to represent areas of the macrophyte vegetation (Typha latifolia and Phragmites australis) and the open water part of the lake. Sites with macrophyte vegetation were found to be the home of more dense and diverse zooplankton community. However, during the period of high vegetation loss, the density of crustacean zooplankton showed significant reduction within the patches of macrophytes. From biodiversity conservation perspective, it was concluded that the preservation of such small areas of macrophytes covering the littoral zone of lakes could be as important as protecting the whole lake. However, the rapid degradation of wetland vegetation by human activities is a real threat to the lake ecosystem. In the not-too-far future, it could displace and evict riparian vegetation and the biota it supports.

The objective of this study is to understand the basin's current and future water availability for agricultural intensification. This was done by simulating scenarios through an integrated SWAT-MODFLOW model to assess the water balance. The scenarios were co-developed with communities who expressed their aspirations for agricultural intensification in conjunction with projected climate change. The results show that with the present land use and climate, the catchment is already water stressed and communities cannot meet their irrigation water demand, particularly in the first irrigation season (October-January). However, in the second irrigation season (February-May) water resource availability is better and increasing irrigated area by 50% from the present extent is possible. With a climate change scenario that favours more rainfall and shallow groundwater use, agricultural intensification is feasible to some extent.					; Schmitter, Petra/C-8086-2014; Schmitter, Petra/R-6278-2019; Hagos, Fitsum/HPE-9562-2023; Taye, Meron Teferi/HDL-9026-2022	Taye, Meron Teferi/0000-0002-4687-4622; Schmitter, Petra/0000-0002-3826-7224; Hagos, Fitsum/0000-0002-1388-7136													0262-6667	2150-3435				NOV 18	2022	67	15					2271	2293		10.1080/02626667.2022.2138403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2022.2138403		NOV 2022											WOS:000889367300001

Elevated CO2, increased leaf-level productivity, and water-use efficiency during the early Miocene	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Rising atmospheric CO2 is expected to increase global temperatures, plant water-use efficiency, and carbon storage in the terrestrial biosphere. A CO2 fertilization effect on terrestrial vegetation is predicted to cause global greening as the potential ecospace for forests expands. However, leaf-level fertilization effects, such as increased productivity and water-use efficiency, have not been documented from fossil leaves in periods of heightened atmospheric CO2. Here, we use leaf gas-exchange modeling on a well-preserved fossil flora from early Miocene New Zealand, as well as two previously published tropical floras from the same time period, to reconstruct atmospheric CO2, leaf-level productivity, and intrinsic water-use efficiency. Leaf gas-exchange rates reconstructed from early Miocene fossils, which grew at southern temperate and tropical latitudes when global average temperatures were 5-6 degrees C higher than today, reveal that atmospheric CO2 was similar to 450-550 ppm. Early Miocene CO2 was similar to projected values for 2040 CE and is consistent with an Earth system sensitivity of 3-7 degrees C to a doubling of CO2. The Southern Hemisphere temperate leaves had higher reconstructed productivity than modern analogs, likely due to a longer growing season. This higher productivity was presumably mirrored at northern temperate latitudes as well, where a greater availability of landmass would have led to increased carbon storage in forest biomass relative to today. Intrinsic water-use efficiency of both temperate and tropical forest trees was high, toward the upper limit of the range for modern trees, which likely expanded the habitable range in regions that could not support forests with high moisture demands under lower atmospheric CO2. Overall, early Miocene elevated atmospheric CO2 sustained globally higher temperatures, and our results provide the first empirical evidence of concomitant enhanced intrinsic water-use efficiency, indicating a forest fertilization effect.					; Lee, William/KHX-0414-2024	Reichgelt, Tammo/0000-0001-8652-5489; D'Andrea, William/0000-0003-0182-8857													1814-9324	1814-9332				AUG 20	2020	16	4					1509	1521		10.5194/cp-16-1509-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-16-1509-2020													WOS:000563065300001

Variable Iron Mineralogy and Redox Conditions Recorded in Ancient Rocks Measured by In Situ Visible/Near-Infrared Spectroscopy at Jezero Crater, Mars	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS												Using relative reflectance measurements from the Mastcam-Z and SuperCam instruments on the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover, we assess the variability of Fe mineralogy in Noachian/Hesperian-aged rocks at Jezero crater. The results reveal diverse Fe3+ and Fe2+ minerals. The igneous crater floor, where small amounts of Fe3+-phyllosilicates and poorly crystalline Fe3+-oxyhydroxides have been reported, is spectrally similar to most oxidized basalts observed at Gusev crater. At the base of the western Jezero sedimentary fan, new spectral type points to an Fe-bearing mineral assemblage likely dominated by Fe2+. By contrast, most strata exposed at the fan front show signatures of Fe3+-oxides (mostly fine-grained crystalline hematite), Fe3+-sulfates (potentially copiapites), strong signatures of hydration, and among the strongest signatures of red hematite observed in situ, consistent with materials having experienced vigorous water-rock interactions and/or higher degrees of diagenesis under oxidizing conditions. The fan top strata show hydration but little to no signs of Fe oxidation likely implying that some periods of fan construction occurred either during a reduced atmosphere era or during short-lived aqueous activity of liquid water in contact with an oxidized atmosphere. We also report the discovery of alternating cm-scale bands of red and gray layers correlated with hydration and oxide variability, which has not yet been observed elsewhere on Mars. This could result from syn-depositional fluid chemistry variations, possibly as seasonal processes, or diagenetic overprint of oxidized fluids percolating through strata having variable permeability. The oxidation states of the atmosphere and waters (whether rich or poor in oxidants such as oxygen) of Mars and their evolution are poorly constrained but can be recorded in the iron (Fe) mineralogy of rocks. Using data from the Perseverance rover, we analyzed the Fe mineralogy of similar to 4-3 Ga old rocks from an ancient lake at Jezero crater. Oxidized Fe is found in igneous rocks and lowermost portions of sedimentary rocks, carried by clays and poorly crystalline oxides in the former and by sulfates and crystalline oxides in the latter, pointing to past action of oxidizing fluids, affecting more intensely the sedimentary rocks. Fe shows poor to no signs of oxidation in the uppermost strata, which might be evidence for a reducing atmosphere during sediment deposition or that the aqueous environment was too cold or too short-lived to oxidize minerals. We also report Fe mineralogy variability at the cm-scale in alternating colored layers, which has not been observed previously on Mars and could possibly mean that seasonal processes are recorded at Jezero crater. In situ reflectance data measured with Mars 2020 show variable Fe mineralogy in sedimentary rocks at Jezero crater Strata exposed at the fan front experienced stronger oxidative water-rock interactions compared to the upper fan and igneous crater floor We identify cm-scale color banding correlated with Fe-oxide variability that likely indicates time variation in redox					; Johnson, Jay/IWU-6880-2023; Wiens, Roger/S-3078-2017; Maurice, Sylvestre/OBO-3026-2025; Fouchet, Thierry/C-6374-2017; Horgan, Briony/Q-8136-2018; Núñez, Jorge/J-4027-2015; Gomez, Felipe/L-7315-2014; Gómez, Felipe/L-7315-2014	Dehouck, Erwin/0000-0002-1368-4494; Wiens, Roger/0000-0002-3409-7344; Gasda, Patrick/0000-0003-0895-1153; Fouchet, Thierry/0000-0001-9040-8285; Horgan, Briony/0000-0001-6314-9724; Gomez, Felipe/0000-0001-9977-7060; Ehlmann, Bethany/0000-0002-2745-3240; Mandon, Lucia/0000-0002-9310-0742; Loche, Matteo/0000-0003-0413-3305													2169-9097	2169-9100				JUL	2024	129	7							e2023JE008254	10.1029/2023JE008254	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JE008254													WOS:001272641500001

The results were as follows: (1) The annual and flood season runoffs showed significant decreasing trends at Yichang station, and showed slight downward trends at Hankou and Datong stations, while the abrupt changes of dry season runoff at Yichang, Hankou and Datong stations occurred in about 2007 and the change points were followed by significant increasing trends. The construction of the Three Gorges Dam, which began to operate in 2003, influenced the variations of runoff in the mainstream of Yangtze River, but the effect weakened with the distance along the downstream direction from TGD. (2) Since the 1990s, annual sediment loads at Yichang, Hankou, and Datong stations have been decreasing significantly, and after 2002, the annual sediment load at Yichang dropped below that of Hankou and Datong. The dams and deforestation/ forestation contributed to the significant decreasing trend of the sediment load. In addition, the Three Gorges Dam aggravated the downward trend and caused the erosion of the riverbed and riverbanks in the middle and lower reaches. (3) The runoff and sediment load flowing from Dongting Lake into the mainstream of the Yangtze River showed significant decreasing trends at Chenglingji station after 1970s, and in contrast, slight increase in the sediment flow from Poyang Lake to the mainstream of the Yangtze River at Hukou station were detected over the post-TGD period (2003-2013). The result of the study will be an important foundation for watershed sustainable development of the Yangtze River under the human activities.

J	Qian, KM; Liu, X; Chen, YW				Qian Kuimei; Liu Xia; Chen Yuwei			Effects of water level fluctuation on phytoplankton succession in Poyang Lake, China - A five year study	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in the Yangtze floodplain in China, with dramatic seasonal water level changes each year. The quarterly monitoring data from 2009 to 2013 was used to study the impact of the water level fluctuation on the phytoplankton biomass and taxonomic composition variation in different hydrological phases in Poyang Lake. Bacillariophyta species are generally dominant in Poyang Lake, constituting more than 50% of the total phytoplankton biomass, except from July 2009 and January 2012. The results that phytoplankton biomass increased gradually from 2009 to 2013, especially after 2012, indicated there is some time lag in the response of phytoplankton biomass to nutrient loading in Poyang Lake. Our results support the hypothesis that water level fluctuation exert great influence on phytoplankton succession and hydrology fluctuations have an indirect impact on a decrease of Cyanophyta biomass with regard to dilution of nutrients (P, N) in Poyang Lake. This study indicates that we should keep the water level changes more or less as they are because ecologically relevant in Poyang Lake.

Distribution of phthalate esters in alluvial sediment: A case study at JiangHan Plain, Central China	CHEMOSPHERE												This study aimed to investigate the sources and distribution of phthalate esters (PAEs) in alluvial sediment of humid climate regions where water cycle is very active in order to reveal their behavior of transport from topsoil and/or surface water to deep sediment and groundwater. Topsoil and deeper sediment samples were collected from nine and seventeen sites in July 2007, and January 2008, respectively, from the eastern part of JiangHan Plain, Central China. On each site, samples were collected at every 20-40 cm depth within the sediment profiles. Contents of 16 PAEs were detected for each sample. Sigma(16)PAEs contents in the topsoil ranged from 252.6 to 2515.7 ng g(-1), with an average value of 926.8 ng g(-1). Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), and diethyl phthalate (DEP) were the dominant PAE species. The horizontal distribution of PAEs was related to time (season), cultivation type, distance and exact position from surface water. DEP existed only on the upper layer of soil due to its rapid degradation. However, DEHP, DnBP, and DiBP could be transported downward into deep sediment even though large amount of them were lost due to biodegradation and adsorption. On the other hand, DEHP, DnBP, and DiBP could be transported into deep sediment along with the horizontal flow of shallow groundwater from surface water, such as Yangtze River, Hanjiang River, and Honghu Lake.

In this essay, taking Hongze Lake as the study area, a two-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality mathematical model of Hongze Lake was constructed, and based on calibration and verification of parameters, numerical simulation was performed on the changes in N and P concentrations in this lake after water transfer. The study results exhibited that before and after project construction, the absolute values of rates of changes in the annual average concentrations of Ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), Total phosphorus (TP), Total nitrogen (TN), and Permanganate index(CODMn) in Hongze Lake were all lower than 20%, which demonstrates marginal changes in the annual average concentrations. By analyzing the seasonal and spatial distribution characteristics of the concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and other pollutants in the lake area before and after the project operation, it is found that the main reasons that affect the water quality change in the lake area after the project operation are the newly added water transfer volume, water transfer location and water transfer quality.

Such adaptation should be especially important in poikilothermic animals that are often subjected to pronounced seasonal temperature variation that directly affects metabolic function. We conducted a preliminary study of individual lifetime thermal habitat use and respiration rates of four whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus (L.)) morphs (two pelagic, one littoral and one profundal) using stable carbon and oxygen isotope values of otolith carbonate. These morphs, two of which utilized pelagic habitats, one littoral and one profundal recently diverged via adaptive radiation to exploit different major niches in a deep and thermally stratified subarctic lake. We found evidence that the morphs used different thermal niches. The profundal morph had the most distinct thermal niche and consistently occupied the coldest thermal habitat of the lake, whereas differences were less pronounced among the shallow water pelagic and littoral morphs. Our results indicated ontogenetic shifts in thermal niches: juveniles of all whitefish morphs inhabited warmer ambient temperatures than adults. According to sampling of the otolith nucleus, hatching temperatures were higher for benthic compared to pelagic morphs. Estimated respiration rate was the lowest for benthivorous profundal morph, contrasting with the higher values estimated for the other morphs that inhabited shallower and warmer water. These preliminary results suggest that physiological adaptation to different thermal habitats shown by the sympatric morphs may play a significant role in maintaining or strengthening niche segregation and divergence in life-history traits, potentially contributing to reproductive isolation and incipient speciation.					; Patterson, William/J-6473-2012; Harrod, Chris/A-8830-2008; Kiljunen, Mikko/B-5812-2009	Kahilainen, Kimmo/0000-0002-1539-014X; Patterson, William/0000-0003-3387-708X; Harrod, Chris/0000-0002-5353-1556; 													1932-6203					NOV 18	2014	9	11							e112085	10.1371/journal.pone.0112085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0112085								25405979					WOS:000347121300022

To establish effective control and elimination policies, strategies rely on the analysis of cholera dynamics. In this report, we describe the spatio-temporal dynamics of cholera and the associated environmental factors. Methodology/Principal findings: Cholera-associated morbidity and mortality data were prospectively collected at the commune level according to the World Health Organization standard definition. Attack and mortality rates were estimated and mapped to assess epidemic clusters and trends. The relationships between environmental factors were assessed at the commune level using multivariate analysis. The global attack and mortality rates were 488.9 cases/10,000 inhabitants and 6.24 deaths/10,000 inhabitants, respectively. Attack rates displayed a significantly high level of spatial heterogeneity (varying from 64.7 to 3070.9 per 10,000 inhabitants), thereby suggesting disparate outbreak processes. The epidemic course exhibited two principal outbreaks. The first outbreak (October 16, 2010-January 30, 2011) displayed a centrifugal spread of a damping wave that suddenly emerged from Mirebalais. The second outbreak began at the end of May 2011, concomitant with the onset of the rainy season, and displayed a highly fragmented epidemic pattern. Environmental factors (river and rice fields: p<0.003) played a role in disease dynamics exclusively during the early phases of the epidemic. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the epidemic is still evolving, with a changing transmission pattern as time passes. Such an evolution could have hardly been anticipated, especially in a country struck by cholera for the first time. These results argue for the need for control measures involving intense efforts in rapid and exhaustive case tracking.

There is, however, little known about its performance in low-input rainfed rice-based cropping systems. We conducted a study during two growing seasons (2013/14 and 2014/15) on an experiment that was established in 2009 at the agricultural research station of the National Center for Applied Research and Rural Development (FOFIFA) in the Lake Alaotra region of Madagascar. The experimental setup was a randomized block design with four replications. Two soil/residue management treatments were studied, conventional tillage without residue retention (CT) and no-tillage with residue retention (NT). These two treatments were tested for a 2-year rotation of maize + Dolichos lablab followed by rice (MD//R) and a 3-year rotation of maize + Stylosanthes guianensis, followed by S. guianensis in the second year, and rice in the third year (MS//S//R). During the 2013/14 and 2014/15 seasons, two levels of weed pressure: 'high' and 'low' were introduced as a split-plot design on the rice plots. The main determining factors of rice yield in the study region were studied: radiation interception, weed infestation, soil moisture and soil mineral nitrogen (N). Our results showed that five to six years of continuous practice of NT with retention of high amounts of crop residues (more than 5 Mg DM ha(-1)) on the soil surface had a significant (p = 0.02) positive effect on rice yield, irrespective of the level of weed pressure and type of crop rotation. CA systems significantly (p < 0.05) reduced weed density and biomass as compared to CT particularly during the vegetative stage of the rice crop in the two growing seasons, which to a certain extent explained the yield gains under CA. In contrast, treatment effects on soil moisture and mineral N contents were marginal. The positive effects of CA on reduced weed pressure may constitute an important benefit for smallholder farmers, who face labour constraints with hand weeding, and usually cannot afford herbicides for weed control.

The measured fluxes of CO2 (FCO2) ranged from -30.64 to 183.78 mmol/m(2)/day, and the average values varied in the range from -3.52 to 82.11 mmol/m2/day. In most of the cases, emission of CO2 to the atmosphere was observed. The obtained values of CO2 fluxes were comparable to values typical for other temperate reservoirs. Analysis of the influence of selected environmental factors on the FCO2 showed that it depends on parameters characterizing both the sediments and surface water. The CO2 flux at the water-air interface was positively correlated with parameters of bottom sediments such as porosity, content of organic carbon and total nitrogen; and negatively with pH value and delta C-13 of organic carbon. In the case of the parameters characterizing surface water, positive dependences on the concentrations of nitrate and total nitrogen, and negative relationships with water temperature and chlorophyll a concentrations, were found.

Interannual variation in effective number of breeders and estimation of effective population size in long-lived iteroparous lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens)	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Quantifying interannual variation in effective adult breeding number (Nb) and relationships between Nb, effective population size (Ne), adult census size (N) and population demographic characteristics are important to predict genetic changes in populations of conservation concern. Such relationships are rarely available for long-lived iteroparous species like lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens). We estimated annual Nb and generational Ne using genotypes from 12 microsatellite loci for lake sturgeon adults (n=796) captured during ten spawning seasons and offspring (n=3925) collected during larval dispersal in a closed population over 8years. Inbreeding and variance Nb estimated using mean and variance in individual reproductive success derived from genetically identified parentage and using linkage disequilibrium (LD) were similar within and among years (interannual range of Nb across estimators: 41205). Variance in reproductive success and unequal sex ratios reduced Nb relative to N on average 36.8% and 16.3%, respectively. Interannual variation in Nb/N ratios (0.270.86) resulted from stable N and low standardized variance in reproductive success due to high proportions of adults breeding and the species' polygamous mating system, despite a 40-fold difference in annual larval production across years (43716417). Results indicated environmental conditions and features of the species' reproductive ecology interact to affect demographic parameters and Nb/N. Estimates of Ne based on three single-sample estimators, including LD, approximate Bayesian computation and sibship assignment, were similar to annual estimates of Nb. Findings have important implications concerning applications of genetic monitoring in conservation planning for lake sturgeon and other species with similar life histories and mating systems.

The comet assay is a sensitive tool and is recommended for studies of environmental biomonitoring, which aim to determine the genotoxicity potential of water pollutants. This study aimed to assess the genotoxic potential of the Ribeiro Tatu waters, region of Limeira, So Paulo (SP), by the comet assay with mammalian cells (hepatoma tissue culture (HTC)). Water samples were collected along the Ribeiro Tatu at three distinct periods: November 2008, February 2009 and August 2009, and five collection sites were established: P1, source of the stream; P2, site located downstream the urban perimeter of the municipality of Cordeirpolis and after receiving the pollution load of this city; P3, collection site located upstream the urban perimeter of the city of Limeira; P4, urban area of Limeira; and P5, rural area of Limeira, downstream the discharges of the city sewage. The results showed that for the November 2008 collection, there was no water sample-induced genotoxicity; for the February 2009 collection, the sites P1 and P2 were statistically significant in relation to the negative control (NC), and for the August 2009 collection, the site P5 was statistically significant. These results could be explained by the content of different metals during the different seasons that are under the influence of domestic, industrial and agricultural effluents and also due to the seasonality, since the water samples collected in the period of heavy rain (February 2009) presented a higher genotoxicity possibly due to the entrainment of contaminants into the bed of the stream promoted by the outflow of rainwaters. The comet assay showed to be a useful and sensitive tool in the evaluation of hydric resources impacted by pollutants of diverse origins, and a constant monitoring should be done in order to verify the influence of different factors (season, amount of contaminants) in the water quality.

J	Song, LY; Wang, YQ				Song, Li-Yan; Wang, Yang-Qing			Investigation of microbial community structure of a shallow lake after one season copper sulfate algaecide treatment	MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH												In present work we described, for the first time, the phylogenic structure of the microbial community in a shallow freshwater lake (Hawk Island Lake, located in the Lower Peninsula of the State of Michigan, U.S.A.) after one season (four times during May to August 2007) of CuSO4 treatment for algae growth control. The microbial community structure was characterized by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP), clone library and 454 pyrosequencing. The similar structure of water chemistry measured across three sampling sites suggested that the lake was well mixed. The concentration of chlorophyll a (chl-a) and turbidity was low, 3.35 +/- 1.62 mu g/L and 2.5 +/- 1.9 NTU, respectively, implying that photosynthesis was suppressed. TRFLP profiles showed that the lake was dominated by 16 terminal fragments (TFs), accounting for 85.5-92.6% abundance. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that the difference in microbial community structure between upper and lower depths of the water column was not significant (P = 0.101). These results suggested that the microbial community structure within the lake was similar. Clone library and 454 pyrosequencing indicated that the lake was dominated by freshwater phyla, Proteobacteria, Bacteroides, and Actinobacteria. Moreover, the large number of unclassified bacteria (27.4% of total 2090 454 sequences) suggested a complex microbial community structure in the lake. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Hydrological dynamics of temporary wetlands in the southern Great Plains as a function of surrounding land use	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												We used remote sensing imagery to characterize the hydrological dynamics of 8404 temporary freshwater wetlands (playas) in Texas (Landsat 5 TM WRS-2 P30/R36) from 2008 to 2011, comparing known wet and dry periods, and related these to land use within 100 m. Hydroperiods were highly variable, and peak water availability occurred in different seasons in different years, varying by as much as two orders of magnitude with date. Land use affected the likelihood and duration of inundation, with playas in urban settings being modified in such a way as to extend hydroperiod, and playas surrounded by cropland experiencing shorter hydroperiods: 3726 playa basins never contained standing water during the four-year period, and many of these were surrounded by cotton, corn, wheat, or sorghum. In contrast, 25 playas never dried, and most of these were surrounded by urban development. Median hydroperiod was 17-109 days, being longer during the relatively wet year of 2010 compared to exceptional drought in 2011. Remote sensing was useful in monitoring playa surface water fluctuations as a function of land use, providing an alternative source of data in the absence of ground-based hydrological records, and granting a temporal perspective that may otherwise not exist for seasonal or ephemeral wetlands.

Variation in turbidity with precipitation and flow in a regulated river system - river Gota Alv, SW Sweden	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The turbidity variation in time and space is investigated in the downstream stretch of the river Gota Alv in Sweden. The river is heavily regulated and carries the discharge from the largest fresh water lake in Sweden, Lake Vanern, to the outflow point in Goteborg Harbour on the Swedish west coast. The river is an important waterway and serves as a fresh-water supply for 700 000 users. Turbidity is utilised as a water quality indicator to ensure sufficient quality of the intake water to the treatment plant. The overall objective of the study was to investigate the influence of rainfall, surface runoff, and river water flow on the temporal and spatial variability of the turbidity in the regulated river system by employing statistical analysis of an extensive data set. A six year long time series of daily mean values on precipitation, discharge, and turbidity from six stations along the river were examined primarily through linear correlation and regression analysis, combined with nonparametric tests and analysis of variance. The analyses were performed on annual, monthly, and daily bases, establishing temporal patterns and dependences, including; seasonal changes, impacts from extreme events, influences from tributaries, and the spatial variation along the river. The results showed that there is no simple relationship between discharge, precipitation, and turbidity, mainly due to the complexity of the runoff process, the regulation of the river, and the effects of Lake Vanern and its large catchment area. For the river Gota Alv, significant, positive correlations between turbidity, discharge, and precipitation could only be found during periods with high flow combined with heavy rainfall. Local precipitation does not seem to have any significant impact on the discharge in the main river, which is primarily governed by precipitation at catchment scale. The discharge from Lake Vanern determines the base level for the turbidity in the river, whereas local surface runoff and tributary discharge induced by rainfall govern the temporal variability in turbidity. Autocorrelation analysis indicates a temporal persistence in turbidity of about 10 days. The results also show that erosion along the main river, from the river bed and banks, is not a dominant contributor to the suspended sediment transport in the river under normal conditions. Further studies on the correlation between turbidity and suspended sediment transport and its relation to erosion processes are suggested.

Here, we examine the question of the regionality of this isotopic record and its linkage with the marine isotopic record in the Eastern Mediterranean (EM) region. The study presents a new, accurately dated 250-kyr delta(18)O and VC record determined from speleothems of the Peqiin Cave, Northern Israel. Its comparison with the continuous 185-kyr isotopic record of the Soreq Cave speleothems from Central Israel reveals striking similarities. Thus, a strong regional climatic signal, brought about by variations in temperature and rainfall amount, is reflected in both cave records. Low delta(18)O minima in the Peqiin profile for the last 250- to 185-kyr period (interglacial marine isotopic stage 7) match the timing of sapropels 9 to 7 and are indicative of high rainfall in the EM region at these times. The combined Soreq and Peqiin 8180 record for the last 250 kyr excellently matches the published Globigerinoides ruber (G. ruber) marine delta(18)O record for the EM Sea, with the isotopic compositional difference Delta(G.ruber-speleothems) remaining relatively constant at -5.6 +/- 0.7%, thus establishing for the first time a robust, exploitable link between the land and the marine isotopic records. The correspondence of low delta(18)O speleothem values and high cave water stands with low G. ruber delta(18)O values during interglacial sapropel events indicates that these periods were characterized by enhanced rainfall in the EM land and sea regions. By use of sea surface temperatures derived from alkenone data as a proxy for land temperatures at the Soreq Cave, we calculate the paleorainfall delta(18)O values and its amounts. Maximum rainfall and lowest temperature conditions occurred at the beginning of the sapropel events and were followed by decrease in rainfall and increase in temperatures, leading to and conditions. The record for the last 7000 yr shows a trend toward increasing aridity and agrees well with climatic and archeological data from North Africa and the Middle East.

A survey was conducted to analyze the distribution characteristics of the nitrogen and related microbial community in the sediments of the Songhua River during normal season and dry season. In the surface sediments of the Songhua River, no total nitrogen (TN) pollution risk was observed according to the U.S. EPA assessment criteria (1000 mg kg(-1)) for sediment contamination, but TN in several sampling sites (554.9-759.7 mg kg(-1)) exceeded the alert values (550 mg kg(-1)) should be concerned according to the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Environment and Energy of Ontario, Canada. The average TN, NH4+-N, NO3--N and total organic nitrogen (TON) in the surface sediments of the Songhua River during normal season were higher than those in the dry period. TON was the main form of nitrogen in the sediment of Songhua River, NO2--N content was lowest and no obvious difference was observed between normal and dry seasons. The highest average NH4+-N of both seasons occurred in the Nenjiang River, and the highest average NO3--N of both seasons were found in the main stream of the Songhua River. The community abundance of AOB genes (1.1 x 10(7) to 2.5 x 10(8) copies per g soil in normal season, 7.2 x 10(5) to 3.3 x 10(8) copies per g soil in dry season) was higher than that (1.2 x 10(6) to 9.7 x 10(7) copies per g soil in normal season, 6.6 x 10(4) to 3.2 x 10(7) copies per g soil in dry season) of AOA genes in both normal and dry seasons. The denitrifying nirS genes were predominant in both seasons, and their abundance (1.8 x 10(6) to 8.0 x 10(8) copies per g soil) in dry season was higher than that (9.7 x 10(5) to 4.6 x 10(8) copies per g soil) in normal season. Moreover, the moisture concentration, pH, dissolved oxygen and different formation of nitrogen were key factors affecting the variation of nitrogen-transformation microorganisms during normal and dry seasons. This research could help to explain the relationship between nitrogen transformation and the related microbial community in the surface sediment, which could provide a scientific basis for water ecological restoration and water environment improvement of Songhua River.					wang, haiyan/MFK-1898-2025; Li, Congyu/KDM-7598-2024	Li, Congyu/0000-0003-4211-3719														2046-2069				AUG 16	2021	11	43					26721	26731		10.1039/d1ra04903h	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra04903h								35480017					WOS:000683150000030

Mouthpart deformities in Chironomidae (Diptera) as bioindicators of heavy metals pollution in Shiroro Lake, Niger State, Nigeria	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												In this study, mouthpart deformities in Chironomid larvae (Diptera) were investigated in relation to sediment contamination in the Shiroro Lake in Nigeria. Metals and chironomids were sampled monthly at three stations (A-C) between August 2013 and January 2014. Across the stations, zinc ranged (3.9-75 mg/g), manganese (1.29-1.65 mg/g), lead (0.00-0.10 mg/g), iron (101-168 mg/g) and copper (0.13-0.17 mg/g). The metal ions did not differ significantly (P > 0.05) between the sampling stations. However, zinc and iron ions were significantly different between the sampling seasons (P < 0.05). Thirteen chironomid species were recorded, with Chironomus sp., Polypedilum sp. and Ablabesmyia sp. dominating the assemblage structure. Mouthpart deformities were significantly higher at Station A compared with Station C, and seasonally significantly higher during dry season compared with wet season. Elevated incidences of deformity were recorded in Chironomus spp larvae as compared to other genera therefore for further studies in this region assessments should be based solely on Chironomus species and ignoring the rest. Strategies need to be developed to reduce the contaminations and the biological effects.					; Keke, Unique/ABC-4156-2020; Arimoro, Francis/AAV-2783-2020	Odume, Oghenekaro Nelson/0000-0001-5220-3254; Keke, Unique/0000-0002-9528-0599; Arimoro, Francis/0000-0001-6100-4011													0147-6513	1090-2414				MAR	2018	149						96	100		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.10.074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.10.074								29154140					WOS:000424068900013

Inferred fish behavior its implications for hydroacoustic surveys in nearshore habitats	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Population availability and vessel avoidance effects on hydroacoustic abundance estimates may be scale dependent; therefore, it is important to evaluate these biases across systems. We performed an inter-ship comparison survey to determine the effect of vessel size, day-night period, depth, and environmental gradients on walleye (Sander vitreus) density estimates in Lake Erie, an intermediate-scaled system. Consistent near-bottom depth distributions coupled with horizontal fish movements relative to vessel paths indicated avoidance behavior contributed to higher walleye densities from smaller vessels in shallow water (i.e., < 15 m), although the difference decreased with increasing depth. Diel bank migrations in response to seasonally varying onshore-to offshore environmental gradients likely contributed to day-night differences in densities between sampling locations and seasons. Spatial and unexplained variation accounted for a high proportion of total variation; however, increasing sampling intensity can mitigate effects on precision. Therefore, researchers should minimize systematic avoidance and availability related biases (i.e., vessel and day-night period) to improve population abundance estimates. Quantifying availability and avoidance behavior effects and partitioning sources of variation provides informed flexibility for designing future hydroacoustic surveys in shallow-water nearshore environments.					; Vandergoot, Christopher/JAO-1190-2023; Warner, David/C-8858-2009	Kraus, Richard/0000-0003-4494-1841; DuFour, Mark/0000-0001-6930-7666; 													0165-7836	1872-6763				MAR	2018	199						63	75		10.1016/j.fishres.2017.11.018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.11.018													WOS:000423638800010

Biophysical modeling assessment of the drivers for plankton dynamics in dreissenid-colonized western Lake Erie	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Given that phytoplankton and zooplankton communities have served as key ecological indicators of anthropogenic and other perturbations, a high-resolution Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (FVCOM) based Integrated Compartment Model (FVCOM-ICM) was implemented to investigate plankton dynamics with the inclusion of dreissenid invasion in Lake Erie, particularly in the most productive western basin. After identifying suitable horizontal and vertical resolutions that allowed for accurate depiction of in-lake nutrient concentrations and plankton biomass, we explored how variation in nutrient (phosphorus, nitrogen) loading and dreissenid mussel density could influence plankton dynamics. Our scenario-testing showed that western Lake Erie's phytoplankton community appeared more limited by phosphorus than nitrogen on both seasonal and interannual scales with light limitation occurring in the nearshore and Maumee River plume areas. Dreissenid mussel impacts varied temporally, with phytoplankton communities being highly influenced by dreissenid nutrient excretion at times (under low nutrient availability) and dreissenid grazing at other times (under bloom conditions). It was concluded that the effect of zooplankton predation on phytoplankton was stronger than that of dreissenid mussels, and that multiple algal groups could promote the efficiency of nutrient assimilation and the overall plankton production. Additionally, river inputs and wind-driven water circulation were important by causing heterogeneity in habitat conditions through nutrient advection and vertical mixing, and wind-induced surface waves could result in non-negligible down-wind redistribution of plankton biomass, which increased with wind/wave magnitude.

Performance of acoustic telemetry in relation to submerged aquatic vegetation in a nearshore freshwater habitat	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Acoustic telemetry is a powerful tool for learning about the movements and ecology of aquatic animals, but proper use requires evaluation of its performance in different environments. Nearshore freshwater habitats are important to many fishes; however, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in these areas influences the performance of acoustic telemetry through attenuation of the transmissions. Despite this, few studies have quantified the influence of SAV on the detection efficiency and range. We conducted range testing and hydroacoustic surveys to assess the seasonal influence of SAV biovolume on the detection efficiency of 180 kHz transmitters in the nearshore (<1.5 m) habitats of a temperate freshwater riverine ecosystem. The interaction of transmitter-receiver distance and SAV biovolume significantly reduced the detection efficiency of transmitters, which varied with seasonal growth and senescence of SAV. Daily effective detection range (mean +/- s.e.) varied from 6.85 m +/- 1.98 when SAV coverage was high (mean biovolume 0.98) to 196.08 m +/- 51.89 when SAV was largely absent (mean biovolume 0.01). This study demonstrated the impact of SAV on the detection range of acoustic transmitters, illustrating the need for range testing and consideration in study design and analysis to improve the quality of interpretation of data in vegetated habitats.

Cassini imaging of Titan's high-latitude lakes, clouds, and south-polar surface changes	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Cassini's Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) has been observing Titan since April 2004, compiling a nearly global surface map and monitoring the surface and atmosphere for activity. Early images of the south-polar region revealed numerous dark surface features and contemporaneous convective cloud systems, suggesting the presence of hydrocarbon lakes similar to those later detected at Titan's North Pole. Intriguingly, repeated south-polar imaging by ISS revealed differences consistent with ponding of hydrocarbon liquids on the surface due to precipitation from a large storm. More recent ISS images of high northern latitudes illustrate the full extents (> 500,000 km(2)) of hydrocarbon seas, sections of which have been observed by Cassini's RADAR. These observations demonstrate dynamic processes at work on Titan and that the poles harbor liquid-hydrocarbon reservoirs, the extents of which differ from pole to pole and which may be coupled to seasonally varying circulation.

Contrasting Patterns of Community Assembly in the Stratified Water Column of Great Salt Lake, Utah	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Phylogenetic examinations of communities sampled along geochemical gradients provide a framework for inferring the relative importance of niche-based ecological interactions (competition, environmental filtering) and neutral-based evolutionary interactions in structuring biodiversity. Great Salt Lake (GSL) in Utah exhibits strong spatial gradients due to both seasonal variation in freshwater input into the watershed and restricted fluid flow within North America's largest saline terminal lake ecosystem. Here, we examine the phylogenetic structure and composition of archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryal small subunit (SSU) rRNA genes sampled along a stratified water column (DWR3) in the south arm of GSL in order to infer the underlying mechanism of community assembly. Communities sampled from the DWR3 epilimnion were phylogenetically clustered (i.e., coexistence of close relatives due to environmental filtering) whereas those sampled from the DWR3 hypolimnion were phylogenetically overdispersed (i.e., coexistence of distant relatives due to competitive interactions), with minimal evidence for a role for neutral processes in structuring any assemblage. The shift from phylogenetically clustered to overdispersed assemblages was associated with an increase in salinity and a decrease in dissolved O-2 (DO) concentration. Likewise, the phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic similarity of assemblages was strongly associated with salinity or DO gradients. Thus, salinity and/or DO appeared to influence the mechanism of community assembly as well as the phylogenetic diversity and composition of communities. It is proposed that the observed patterns in the phylogenetic composition and structure of DWR3 assemblages are attributable to the meromictic nature of GSL, which prevents significant mixing between the epilimnion and the hypolimnion. This leads to strong physicochemical gradients at the halocline, which are capable of supporting a greater diversity. However, concomitant shifts in nutrient availability (e.g., DO) at and below the halocline drive competitive interactions leading to hypolimnion assemblages with minimal niche overlap.

However, with the frequent occurrence of harsh weather in recent years, the livability of traditional villages is also facing challenges. In order to improve the climatic adaptability of traditional villages, scholars have proposed many methods, but there is a lack of research on the spatial microclimate adaptation of traditional villages based on the perspective of spatial accessibility. This paper selects typical traditional villages in the Taihu Lake Basin, analyzes spatial accessibility and CFD numerical simulation comfort by spatial syntax from the two levels of village and iconic nodes, and discusses the correlation between spatial accessibility and climate comfort. Also, the study concludes the following: (1) The overall integration degree of Mingyuewan Village is not high, and the overall accessibility is poor. (2) The correlation between wind environment and spatial accessibility is weak. The thermal environment is associated with spatial accessibility. Comfort is strongly correlated with the degree of spatial accessibility. This paper proposes to consider the lake surface to dominate the seasonal wind, reserve windward outlets, and add green plants and shade facilities in green public open spaces.					; Hsieh, Chun-Ming/OHR-7506-2025	Hsieh, Chun-Ming/0000-0002-9289-2872; 													2040-2244	2408-9354				SEP	2023	14	9					3329	3344		10.2166/wcc.2023.415	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2023.415		AUG 2023											WOS:001046089000001

Therefore, this study aims at monitoring water quality changes and effective factors in the Dez River Basin, which are required to manage water resources effectively. To this end, the common influence of flow rate changes on water quality was separated by implementing seasonal Mann-Kendall test on residuals resulting from the LOWESS test. The results show that after adjusting the effects of seasonality and streamflow fluctuations, significant positive trends in most water quality parameters are still observed. It emphasizes the role of other factors controlling river water quality in the basin. Comparison of the trends of modified quality parameter time series (residuals) in different subbasins having natural or mad-made conditions, with or without significant groundwater resources, shows almost the same presented trends in water quality. This supports that, overall, minor changes occurred in land use, groundwater table, and environmental and human factors with no important influences on presented trends in water quality. Our analyses show that overall reduction in precipitation as well as positive trends in temperature and evaporation led to intensified streamflow variations, explaining the main changes in the river water quality of the basin.

Especially in eutrophic lakes, F-red may constitute a major fraction of the areal hypolimnetic mineralization rate, but its size and source is often poorly understood. Using a diagenetic reaction-transport model supported by a large data set of sediment porewater concentrations, bulk sediment core data and lake monitoring data, the behavior of F-red was simulated in eutrophic Lake Baldegg. Transient boundary conditions for the gross sedimentation of total organic carbon and for hypolimnetic O-2 concentrations were applied to simulate the eutrophication and re-oligotrophication history of the lake. According to the model, F-red is dominated by methanogenesis, where up to70% to the total CH4 is produced from sediments older than 20 years deposited during the time of permanent anoxia between 1890 and 1982. An implementation of simplified seasonal variations of the upper boundary conditions showed that their consideration is not necessary for the assessment of annual average fluxes in long-term simulations. Four lake management scenarios were then implemented to investigate the future development of F-red and SOU until 2050 under different boundary conditions. A comparison of three trophic scenarios showed that further reduction of the lake productivity to at least a mesotrophic state is required to significantly decrease F-red and SOU from the present state. Conversely, a termination of artificial aeration at the present trophic state would result in high rates of organic matter deposition and a long-term increase of F-red from the sediments of Lake Baldegg.

On the other hand, the 'Spear Horizon' offers an excellent opportunity to approach hominin spatial behavior, thanks to the richness of the archeological assemblage, its exceptional preservation, and the vast expanse of the excavated surface. Analyzing how space was used is essential for understanding hominin behavior at this unique open-air site and, from a wider perspective, for approaching how humans adapted to interglacial environments. In this article, we present an exhaustive spatial study of the complete Schoningen 13II-4 'Spear Horizon' faunal assemblage and its archeological context, combining zooarcheology and spatial analysis through the extensive application of geographic information systems. Our results indicate the existence of different activity areas related to changes in the position of the shoreline due to fluctuations of water table levels of the Schoningen paleolake. These activity areas were likely used on a seasonal basis, whereas the spatial patterning observed in the distribution of faunal remains suggests a diversity of behavioral strategies in terms of intensity and/or duration of occupations. This study refines previous interpretations of the site and reconstructs human behavioral adaptations and the occupational changing lakeland environment during the Middle Pleistocene in Europe.

Routine monitoring of drinking water supplies and recreational waters is performed using fecal indicator microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., and coliphages. However, the presence and numbers of these indicators, especially E. coli and Enterococcus spp., do not correlate well with those of other pathogens, especially enteric viruses, which are a major cause of waterborne outbreaks associated with contaminated water and food, and recreational use of lakes, ponds, rivers, and estuarine waters. For that reason, there is a growing need for a surveillance system that can detect and quantify viral pathogens directly in water sources to reduce transmission of pathogens associated with fecal transmission. In this review, we present an updated overview of relevant waterborne enteric viruses that we believe should be more commonly screened to better evaluate water quality and to determine the safety of water use and reuse and of epidemiological data on viral outbreaks. We also discuss current methodologies that are available to detect and quantify these viruses in water resources. Finally, we highlight challenges associated with virus monitoring. The information presented in this review is intended to aid in the assessment of human health risks due to contact with water sources, especially since current environmental and adaptive changes may be creating the need for a paradigm shift for indicators of fecal contamination.

Although there has been much progress in un-derstanding the components and sources of PM2.5, limited research has been done on the influence of meteo-rological factors. In particular, the influence of the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) on PM2.5 concentration has not been studied due to inadequate observations. From January 2019-June 2020, measure-ments from a High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) filled this gap and allowed for PBLH estimation and aerosol typing. This paper investigates the roles of PBLH and regional and local wind circulations on the temporal evolution of aerosol pollution. Results show that daytime and nighttime PBLH variability is associated with solar heating and radiative cooling, respectively. Cloud-free conditions during the dry season yield a higher PBL growth rate than during the wet season when lower daytime and elevated nighttime PBLH are observed. Lower PM2.5 levels are generally observed during daytime when PBLH is at its maximum. However, the PBLH has a significant inverse correlation with PM2.5 only in the months of December-January-February. We find that horizontal directional wind shear between synoptic and mesoscale circulations confounds the PM2.5 -PBLH relationship by creating stagnant conditions conducive to aerosol accumulation. The lower 20% of PM2.5 con-centrations occur during the prevalence of strong monsoon winds. On the other hand, the upper 80% are found during the occurrence of compound mesoscale winds (i.e., sea/land/lake/valley/mountain breezes and chan-neling monsoon winds). In addition, mountain breeze is found to be associated with lifting of aerosols, resulting in multi-layering within the PBL. The findings in the present study emphasize the role of complex topography and mesoscale scale winds arising from the landscape on aerosol pollution variability.

Effect of season and trophic level on fatty acid composition and content of four commercial fish species from Krasnoyarsk Reservoir (Siberia, Russia)	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Two groups of factors, phylogenetic and ecological, are presently regarded as controlling fatty acid composition of fish, including essential eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids. Environmental effects, e.g., trophic position, temperature and/or seasonality, were previously studied using sums of fatty acids or only their level data. We tested the hypothesis that differences in trophic levels of piscivorous (pike and perch) and omnivorous (roach and bream) fish from a mesotrophic reservoir allow discriminating levels and contents of individual fatty acids, especially EPA and DHA. The more established measurements, i.e., stomach contents and carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in fish muscles, were also carried out to provide linkages between the different ecological tracers, fatty acids versus stable isotopes, and matching the methods for long-term food sources (fatty acids and stable isotopes) and recent foraging (stomach content analysis). We also studied a putative influence of seasonality. Similar to other studies, there were seasonal changes in fatty acid composition and contents of two fish, perch and roach, due to direct and indirect effects of water temperature. Meanwhile, the piscivorous and omnivorous species captured in the same month, were explicitly differentiated on a base of stable isotopes and fatty acids. Significantly higher percentages and contents of DHA in piscivorous fish, perch and pike, relatively to those in roach and bream, likely indicated a higher trophic transfer efficiency for this essential fatty acid. All the fishes have commercial importance for regional fishery and are harvested from the studied reservoir for human nutrition. Regarding content of EPA+ DHA (mg g(-1) fish) as the indicator of nutritive value for humans, pike had the highest nutritive value, roach and perch had intermediate overlapped values, and bream was of the least benefit.

Composite Agrometeorological Drought Index Accounting for Seasonality and Autocorrelation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING												Drought indices are statistical tools used for monitoring the departure from normal conditions of water availability. Recently, the multivariate nature of droughts was addressed through composite indices capable of including different factors contributing to the occurrence of a drought. However, some issues (like the autocorrelation or the proper definition of the multivariate index) are still open and need to be addressed to make these indices applicable in current practice. Here, a composite agrometeorological drought index (AMDI-SA) has been introduced, accounting for meteorological and agricultural droughts, considering specifically seasonality and autocorrelation. The AMDI-SA combines, through the copula concept and the Kendall function, two drought indices [namely multivariate standardized precipitation index (MSPI) and the multivariate standardized soil moisture index (MSSI)] in a statistically consistent (normal distributed) drought indicator. Nonparametric distributions have been used for the variables of interest and the calculation of MSPI and MSSI, whereas parametric and nonparametric (empirical) copulas are used to build the AMDI-SA. A prewhitening procedure has been applied to the MSPI and MSSI to remove the autocorrelation. An application to the Urmia lake basin in Iran has been presented, drought indices compared, and their spatial variability investigated. Results showed that MSPI and MSSI are able to justify 72 and 89% of the variability throughout the year. The AMDI-SA reflects the combined effect of soil moisture and precipitation, and has a behavior in between whitened MSPI and MSSI. In addition, having no memory and being a composite index, the AMDI-SA is able to clearly detect the temporal variability of recorded droughts to a greater extent than the MSPI and MSSI.

J	O'Neill, AR				O'Neill, Alexander R.			Evaluating high-altitude Ramsar wetlands in the Eastern Himalayas	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Himalayan high-altitude wetlands (HAWs) are some of the most iconic and hydrologically dynamic ecosystems in South and Central Asia. Yet little is known about their historical ecology; less is reported on their management. To address these gaps, this article leverages predictive modelling and multi-criteria decision analysis to evaluate HAWs for biological conservation. Specifically, it builds upon prior efforts to recognize HAW "complexes" as Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance. Results indicate that HAWs occupy 69 430 ha in the Sikkim Eastern Himalayas, with marginal, fringe, or seasonal extents expanding outward to 170 700 ha. Over 800 species are documented from these sites, including migratory birds of relevance to the Ramsar Convention. For example, species like the Black-necked Crane, Ruddy Shelduck, and Eurasian Widgeon depend on HAWs for breeding and layover. Although a third of identified HAWs occur within protected areas, those of highest conservation priority are located outside of these zones along India's trans-Himalayan frontier. Existing laws and state notifications largely support wetland conservation. However, both the Ramsar Secretariat and Government of India should further clarify legal terminology, such as the principal of "wise use", to ensure that parties meet Convention obligations. Future efforts are needed to systematically survey HAW biodiversity and monitor their responses to global change. (c) 2019 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Couture, RM; Gobeil, C; Tessier, A				Couture, Raoul-Marie; Gobeil, Charles; Tessier, Andre			Arsenic, iron and sulfur co-diagenesis in lake sediments	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Profiles of porewater pH and dissolved As, Fe, Mn, sulfate, total sulfide (Sigma S-11), total zero-valent sulfur (Sigma S-0), organic carbon and major ion concentrations, as well as those of solid As, acid-volatile sulfide (AVS), total S. Fe, Mn, Al, organic C, Pb-210 and Cs-137 were determined in the sediment of four lakes spanning a range of redox and geochemical conditions. An inverse modeling approach, based on a one-dimensional transport-reaction equation assuming steady-state, was applied to the porewater As profiles and used to constrain the net rates of reactions involving As (R-net(As)). The model defines depth intervals where As is either released to (positive R-net(As)) or removed from (negative R-net(As)) the porewaters. At two of the sites, whose bottom water were oxygenated at sampling time, a production zone (R-net(As) = 12 x 10(-18) mol cm(-3) s(-1)-71 X 10(-18) mol cm(-3) s(-1)) is inferred a few cm below the sediment-water interface, coincident with sharp porewater As and Fe peaks that indicate an intense coupled recycling of As and Fe. This process is confirmed by solid As and Fe maxima just below the sediment surface. In these two lakes a zone of As consumption (R-net(As) = -5 x 10(-18) mol cm(-3) s(-1) to -53 x 10(-18) mol cm(-3) s(-1)), attributed to the slow adsorption of As to authigenic Fe oxyhydroxides, occurs just above the production zone. A second-order rate constant k(ads)(As) of 0.12 +/- 0.03 cm(3) mol(-1) s(-1) is estimated for this adsorption reaction. Such features in the porewater and solid profiles were absent from the two other lakes that develop a seasonally anoxic hypolimnion. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that the porewaters of the four lakes, when sulfidic (i.e., Sigma S-11 >= 0.1 mu M), were undersaturated with respect to all known solid As sulfides; the calculation also predicts the presence of As-V oxythioanions in the sulfidic waters, as suggested by a recent study. In the sulfidic waters, the removal of As (R-net(As) = -1 X 10(-18) mol cm(-3) s(-1) to -23 x 10(-18) mol cm(-3) s(-1)) consistently occurred when saturation, with respect to FeS(,), was reached and when Asv oxythioanionswere predicted to be significant components of total dissolved As. This finding has potential implications for As transport in other anoxic waters and should be tested in a wider variety of natural environments. Crown copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

M.; Verleyen, Elie			Environmental and Human Health Risks of Pesticide Presence in the Lake Tana Basin (Ethiopia)	SUSTAINABILITY												Pesticides are widely used for safeguarding agricultural yields and controlling malaria vectors, yet are simultaneously unintentionally introduced in aquatic environments. To assess the severity of this pressure in the Lake Tana Basin (Ethiopia), we evaluated the occurrence of 17 pesticide residues in the lake, tributary rivers, and associated wetlands during the wet and dry season, followed by a questionnaire. These questionnaires indicated that 35 different compounds were available in the districts surrounding the lake, including pesticides that are banned in Europe, i.e., endosulfan, dicofol, and malathion. Nevertheless, only 7 pesticide residues were detected in the assessed aquatic habitats. Of these, DDE and bifenthrin occurred most often (97.7% and 62.3%, respectively), while alachlor displayed the highest mean concentration (594 +/- 468 ng/L). No significant differences were observed in residue concentrations between seasons nor between habitats. Based on an ecotoxicological risk assessment, the observed concentrations of DDE and cypermethrin pose a high risk to aquatic life, while alachlor and DDT-op residues were below the threshold values. Furthermore, a human risk assessment indicated a low risk for the population that directly consumes water from the Tana basin, while acknowledging the potential of indirect exposure through the consumption of fish and locally grown crops.					; Mengistu, Daniel/MBG-8025-2025; Goethals, Peter/A-1116-2008; Kibret, Mulugeta/LYO-7349-2024; Spanoghe, Pieter/B-9440-2015; Van Echelpoel, Wout/AAH-3755-2019; De Cock, Andrée/HZJ-8668-2023; Nyssen, Jan/B-8280-2009; Abera, Bayeh/AAU-8754-2020	Verleyen, Elie/0000-0003-1426-2960; Van Echelpoel, Wout/0000-0001-9636-5861; Adgo, Enyew/0000-0001-6824-5037; Kibret, Mulugeta/0000-0003-3320-0802; De Cock, Andree/0000-0001-7911-4219; Spanoghe, Pieter/0000-0002-8158-4401; Abera, Bayeh/0000-0002-2559-6635; Mengistu, Daniel/0000-0002-8312-6957; Nyssen, Jan/0000-0002-2666-3860; 														2071-1050				NOV	2022	14	21							14008	10.3390/su142114008	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142114008													WOS:000883602400001

We explore how that knowledge can be incorporated into sustainable management activities. We used a qualitative approach to investigate the local knowledge and perception of changes and their causes. About 64 respondents comprising fishermen, fish processers, Beach Management Unit leaders, fisheries officers and elders were interviewed between April and December 2016. Our analysis shows that there have been increasing fishing activities in the lake from the 1970s. Increased fishing activities and climate-related changes in the lake have resulted in dramatic decreases in fish landings between the 1990s and the present. It was also revealed that fishermen hold valuable knowledge on fish availability, ecological conditions of the lake, and seasonal weather conditions. While they acknowledge the effects of changes in fishing practices and fishing pressure to explain the gradually decreasing fisheries, they have less understanding of the importance of longer-term changes in the lake environment resulting from climate change. This study concludes that future fisheries management could benefit from further incorporation of fishers' local knowledge such as those related to ecological conditions of the lake and pressures from fishing practices. By expanding mechanisms to include the fishermen's local knowledge, a strong signal is sent to them that their knowledge is valued by fisheries management. This has the potential to further motivate the fishermen to be active participants in contributing to sustainable management practices that can positively impact declining fish resources. In other words, fishermen need to be further "brought at the center" in decision-making processes that influence fisheries management options.

Investigating sources and transformations of nitrogen using dual stable isotopes for Lake Okeechobee restoration in Florida	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												An analysis of nitrate concentrations and isotopic compositions was undertaken on Florida's large (1730 km(2)) and shallow (mean depth 2.7 m) Lake Okeechobee to determine possible connectivity between the lake's many inflows and outflows and to illustrate how stable isotopes can assist in the restoration of a very large subtropical lake. The Kissimmee River, as expected, dominated inflows to Lake Okeechobee (58.4 +/- 2.11 m(3)/s) much higher than the second most important inflow, Fisheating Creek, (9.2 +/- 0.27 m(3)/s).The primary outflows (which are sometimes inflows) are the Caloosahatchee (27.7 +/- 0.63 m(3)/s), which flows westward to the Gulf of Mexico and the St. Lucie River (6.98 +/- 0.30 m(3)/s) that flows eastward to the Atlantic Ocean. Water samples of inflows and outflows were collected at 14 locations around the lake in both the dry and wet seasons in 2018. Total nitrogen and total phosphorus averaged 1.56 +/- 0.42 mg L-1 and 0.11 +/- 0.06 mg L-1 respectively with no significant seasonal variations. Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON = TKN-NH4+) was the dominant form of nitrogen at all sampling sites, with an average value of 1.18 +/- 0.32 mg L-1. The TN:TP ratios were mostly less than 22:1. Isotope delta N-15-NO3- ranged from -8.75 to 9.14 parts per thousand, and delta O-18-NO3- from -0.26 to 11.97 parts per thousand. Inflow delta N-15-NO3- and delta O-18-NO3- measurements ranged from -3.92 to 9.14 parts per thousand and 0.50 to 11.97 parts per thousand. A Bayesian mixing model output revealed that non-point sources from NH4+ fertilizers and soil nitrogen were the main nitrate sources in Lake Okeechobee. NH4+ fertilizer contributes 36.7% of nitrate in the dry season and 54.9% in the wet season, while soil N contributes 31.4% in the dry season and 25.1% in the wet season. Although pasture is the dominant land use in the watershed of Lake Okeechobee, manure was not the dominant source of nitrate; it contributes only 12.0% of the nitrate in the wet season and 25.4% in the dry season. Isotopes of NO3- suggested that denitrification was strong, and nitrification was weak in both the dry and wet seasons. High levels of NH4+ during the wet season, partly caused by weakness of nitrification, promoted uptake of NH4+ that affects microbial food web recycling processes in the lake. These results indicate that monitoring and regulatory strategies for the lake restoration should consider the control of nitrogen pollution sources from agriculture to complement the control of phosphorus inflows that are thought to be the main drivers for harmful algal blooms in the lake and downstream of the lake.

The sum of 8 BDE congeners (E8PBDEs) had a concentration varied from 0.31 to 84 ng L-1, with those of BDE 209, BDE 47, BDE 99, and BDE 153 being 0.31-83, <0.012-0.36, <0.012-1.3, and <0.012-0.77 ng L-1, respectively. These levels were in the high range of the global PBDEs concentrations in the water environments. The highest concentrations of E8PBDEs were detected in the western rivers, of which the main pollution sources were strongly related to human activities in urban centers, such as automobile-derived wastes. A sewage treatment plant was likely an important source of the lower brominated BDEs input to one western river. The correlation analyses (all p < 0.05) between PBDEs and DOC, TN, TP, and EC, suggested that the distributions and sources of PBDEs in rivers might also be related with the soil erosion by heave floods. E8PBDEs input to Lake Chaohu from the rivers outlets was estimated at 344 kg yr-I during the flood season. BDE 209 was the dominant contributor with an input of 340 kg yr-I, followed by BDE 99 (1.3 kg yr-I), BDE 47(0.83 kg yr(-1)) and BDE 153 (0.60 kg yr(-1)). 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Pathogen and Surrogate Survival in Relation to Fecal Indicator Bacteria in Freshwater Mesocosms	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The microbial quality of agricultural water for fresh produce production is determined by the presence of the fecal indicator bacterium (FIB) Escherichia coli, despite poor correlations with pathogen presence. Additional FIB, such as enterococci, have been utilized for assessing water quality. The study objective was to determine the survival times (first time to detect zero or censored) of FIB (E. coli and enterococci), surrogates (Listeria innocua, Listeria seeligeri, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and PRD1), and pathogens (four strains each of pathogenic E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes and five Salmonella serovars) simultaneously inoculated in freshwater mesocosms exposed to diel and seasonal variations. Six separate mesocosm experiments were conducted for <28days each season, with samples (sediment/water) collected each day for the first 7 days and weekly thereafter. Microorganisms survived significantly longer in sediment than in water (hazard ratio [HR] for water/sediment is 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.79 to 2.71). Also, FIB E. coli survived significantly longer than FIB enterococcus (HR for enterococci/E. coli is 12.9 [95% CI, 8.18 to 20.37]) after adjusting for the sediment/water and lake/river effects. Differences in the area under the curve (calculated from log CFU or PFU over time) were used to assess pathogen and surrogate survival in relation to FIB. Despite sample type (sediment/water) and seasonal influences, survival rates of pathogenic Salmonella serovars were similar to those of FIB E. coli, and survival rates of L. monocytogenes and pathogenic E. coli were similar to those of FIB enterococci. Further investigation of microbial survival in water and sediment is needed to determine which surrogates are best suited to assess pathogen survival in agricultural water used in irrigation water for fresh produce. IMPORTANCE Contamination of fresh produce via agricultural water is well established. This research demonstrates that survival of fecal indicator bacteria, pathogenic microorganisms, and other bacterial and viral surrogates in freshwater differs by sample type (sediment/water) and season. Our work highlights potential risks associated with pathogen accumulation and survival in sediment and the possibility for resuspension and contamination of agricultural water used in fresh produce production. Specifically, a greater microbial persistence in sediments than in water over time was observed, along with differences in survival among microorganisms in relation to the fecal indicator bacteria E. coli and enterococci. Previous studies compared data among microbial groups in different environments. Conversely, fecal indicator bacteria, surrogates, and pathogenic microorganisms were assessed within the same water and sediment mesocosms in the present study during four seasons, better representing the agricultural aquatic environment. These data should be considered when agricultural microbial water quality criteria in fresh produce operations are being determined.					; Baker, Christopher/AAG-7217-2019	, Christopher Baker/0000-0003-0366-5799; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				AUG	2021	87	15							e00558-21	10.1128/AEM.00558-21	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00558-21								34047635					WOS:000693256900010

Existence of trends and other changes in the data invalidates this assumption, and detection of the changes in hydrological time series should help us revise the approaches used in assessing, designing and operating our systems. In addition, trend and step change studies help us understand the impact of man's activities (e. g. urbanisation, deforestation, dam construction, agricultural activities, etc.) on the hydrological cycle. Trends and step changes in the seasonal and annual total rainfall for 20 stations in the Lake Victoria basin were analysed. The seasonal rainfall for any station in a given year was defined in two ways: (1) fixed time period where the rainy seasons were taken as occurring from March-May (long rains) and from October-December (short rains); and (2) variable periods where the rainy seasons were taken as the three consecutive months with maximum total rainfall covering the period of January-June (long rains) and July-December (short rains), to take into account the fact that the onset of rainy seasons within the basin varies from year to year and from one station to the next. For each station, sub datasets were derived covering different periods (all available data at the station, 1941-1980, 1961-1990, 1971-end of each station's time series). The trends were analysed using the Mann-Kendall method, while the step changes were analysed using the Worsley Likelihood method. The results show that positive trends predominate, with most stations showing trend being located in the northern part of the basin, though this pattern is not conclusive. In all, 17% of the cases have trends, of which 67% are positive. The 1960s represent a significant upward jump in the basin rainfall. Seasonal rainfall analysis shows that the short rains tend to have more trends than the long rains. The impact of the varying month of onset of the rainy season is that the results from analyzing the fixed-period and variable-period time series are rarely the same, meaning the two series have different characteristics. It may be argued that the variable-period time series are more reliable as a basis for analysing trends and step changes, since these time series reflect more closely the actual variability in rainy seasons from one year to the next. The fixed-period analysis would, on the other hand, find more practical use in planning.

Assessing the Effects of Phytoplankton Structure on Zooplankton Communities in Different Types of Urban Lakes	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Urban lakes play important roles in microclimate regulation such as controlling run-off and groundwater recharge, as well as being a source of water supply and a habitat for a wide variety of flora and fauna. Bucharest has a wide variety of water resources where phytoplankton represent the dominant primary producer, the defining biological factor for zooplankton development. Our hypothesis was that as a result of anthropogenic pressures, phytoplankton in the urban aquatic ecosystems diminish the qualitative and quantitative capacity to maintain a good health condition with effects on the food web. By the structural features of the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities, the objectives were to determine the changes in diversity in different types of urban lakes, to explore the relationships between communities, and to determine the response of phytoplankton and zooplankton functional groups to the environmental factors. The ecological status assessed by Chlorophyll-a (mu L-1) highlights that most of the investigated lakes were eutrophic and hypereutrophic. The phytoplankton were influenced by lake types, seasonal variations and nutrient input. The dominance of the Chlorophyceae, Cyanobacteria and Bacillariophyceae influenced the zooplankton's development. The rotifers were the most represented in both species richness and abundance in zooplankton, followed by Copepoda young stages.

Thus, few studies focus on the nocturnal evapotranspiration (ETN) in alpine region. In this study, based on the half-hour eddy and meteorological data of the growing season (from May to September) in 2019, we quantified the ETN of alpine desert (AD), alpine meadow (AM), alpine meadow steppe (AMS), and alpine steppe (AS) in the Qinghai Lake Basin and clarified the different response of evapotranspiration to climate variables in daytime and nighttime with the variation of elevation. The results show that: (1) ETN accounts for 9.88~15.08% of total daily evapotranspiration and is relatively higher in AMS (15.08%) and AD (12.13%); (2) in the daytime, net radiation (Rn), temperature difference (TD), vapor pressure difference (VPD), and soil moisture have remarkable influence on evapotranspiration, and Rn and VPD are more important at high altitudes, while TD is the main factor at low altitudes; (3) in the nighttime, VPD and wind speed (WS) control ETN at high altitudes, and TD and WS drive ETN at low altitudes. Our results are of great significance in understanding ETN in the alpine regions and provide reference for further improving in the evapotranspiration estimation model.

Here, we evaluate the potential of dried Eichhornia crassipes as a dispersal vector of ostracod resting eggs by assessing the abundance, richness and beta diversity of the dormant associated fauna. We test two hypotheses: (1) that the roots of E. crassipes shelter and disperse ostracod resting eggs and (2) that the abundance, richness and beta diversity of dormant assemblages will increase over the incubation time after re-hydration. Dried E. crassipes from floodplain lakes were hydrated with distilled water. The microcosms were kept in germinating chambers with controlled temperature and photoperiod during 147 days. A total of 397 ostracods representing seven species hatched from the resting eggs attached to dried macrophyte roots. An increase in richness and a decrease in abundance were observed over the weeks, although these trends were not significant. However, the beta diversity increased significantly over the incubation time. Our results show that the complex root systems of E. crassipes have the potential for storage and dispersal of ostracod resting eggs.					; Higuti, Janet/A-7492-2017	Higuti, Janet/0000-0002-3721-9562; Rosa, Jonathan/0000-0002-2407-6240; Martens, Koen/0000-0001-8680-973X; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2023	850	6			SI		1319	1329		10.1007/s10750-022-04818-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-022-04818-8		MAR 2022											WOS:000762927200001

Physical Limnology and Sediment Dynamics of Lago Argentino, the World's Largest Ice-Contact Lake	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Proglacial lakes, whose numbers have been growing around the world, may drive accelerated glacier retreat and provide valuable records of past glacier and climatic changes. Despite their importance, few studies have investigated the sedimentary properties and processes acting within large proglacial lakes. Lago Argentino (LArg) is a 1,500 km(2) ice-contact lake on the eastern flank of the Southern Patagonian Icefield. Here, we describe the results from a detailed analysis of 47 sediment cores obtained throughout this lake basin, supplemented with remotely sensed data. We show that: (a) LArg exhibits a seasonal variation in sediment properties (varves); (b) varve formation results from three distinct processes, driven by seasonal changes in glacial sediment input, seasonal changes in fluvial sediment input, and seasonal variations in lake mixing; and (c) distance from glacier calving fronts provides the first-order control on sediment grain size and accumulation rate. Our findings highlight the exceptional preservation of annual laminations within proglacial lakes, their potential for reconstructing past glacier changes, and their relevance for forecasting future glacier-lake interactions.					; Wickert, Andrew/C-2021-2014; Miller, Louis/OIU-6793-2025; Wickert, Andy/C-2021-2014	Romero, Matias/0000-0002-5840-7845; Shapley, Mark/0000-0003-4770-1878; Brignone, Guido/0000-0002-8591-5669; Ito, Emi/0000-0001-9401-243X; VAN WYK DE VRIES, MAXIMILLIAN/0000-0001-7752-8813; Miller, Louis/0000-0001-6056-843X; Wickert, Andy/0000-0002-9545-3365													2169-9003	2169-9011				MAR	2022	127	3							e2022JF006598	10.1029/2022JF006598	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JF006598													WOS:000776590100015

Lake Agassiz outburst age and routing by Labrador Current and the 8.2 cal ka cold event	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Catastrophic drainage of glacial Lake Agassiz, impounded by the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS), into Hudson Bay and Strait is widely thought to have caused the 8.2 cal ka cold event, though the path of its drainage in the North Atlantic is poorly known. Analysis and compilation of 10 sediment cores from 8 sites distributed on the eastern Canadian continental shelf and upper slope south of Hudson Strait revealed distinct beds with elevated detrital carbonate (DC) concentrations, known by their distinct composition to originate from erosion of carbonate bedrock and carbonate-rich glacial sediments in the Hudson Bay-Hudson Strait region. At all but one site, radiocarbon ages, bracketing and within the thickest and most widespread of these beds, are coeval with the age constraints for the Agassiz floods in Hudson Strait and southeastern Hudson Bay. The DC distribution and concentration of this bed are consistent with southward transport in the Labrador Current. Transfer function analysis of dinoflagellate assemblage data from cores on the central Labrador Shelf, in Hudson Bay, and on the Northeast Newfoundland Shelf reveal that early Holocene seasonal ice cover was 5-6 months longer than at present, requiring the application of a 200-year reduction to the radiocarbon age constraints on the Lake Agassiz outburst floods. The age of the floods is reduced to about 8.33 cal ka (7.5 C-14 ka) from the previous determination of 8.47 cal ka (7.7 C-14 ka), with a similar reduction in their error ranges to 8.04-8.49 cal ka from 8.16-8.74 cal ka. Based on present current routing, the Agassiz floodwaters and icebergs are inferred to have travelled south in the Labrador Current, and to have possibly become incorporated into the North Atlantic Current, and transported to the Nordic seas. There the freshwater additions would have lessened deepwater production with a concomitant reduction in northward heat transport in the upper limb of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, thereby contributing to the 8.2 cal ka cold event. Variation in the calcite and dolomite content of the Agassiz DC bed, two salinity reductions during Agassiz bed deposition, and low-level shorelines of lakes Agassiz and Ojibway suggest that more than one outburst was delivered during the final Agassiz drainage.

Effects of drought on groundwater-fed lake areas in the Nebraska Sand Hills	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: The Nebraska Sand Hills (NSH) lies in the western part of Nebraska, United States. We chose the north-eastern, central, and western parts of NSH with distinct climate, topography, and hydrology. Study focus: The study assesses the response of hundreds of shallow groundwater-fed lakes to drought. Total lake area (TLA), determined by classifying Landsat satellite images from 1984 to 2018, was juxtaposed with published Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and detrended cumulative PDSI (DeCumPDSI) at monthly and annual timescales. The PDSI and DeCumPDSI were time lagged to incorporate the preceding climatic effect (groundwater time lag) and evaluated against TLA using Bayesian regression analysis. New hydrologic insight for the region: TLA in the NSH respond to the seasonal as well as long-term climatic effects moderated by topography, surface, and subsurface hydrology. A higher determination coefficient R2 and lower mean square error of TLA at annual PDSI and DeCumPDSI illustrate the effect of long-term climatic fluctuations and groundwater influence: the evaporative losses from lakes are modulated by the lake-groundwater exchange, but the groundwater recharge has a longer response time to the drought. The study provides a simple method of assessment of the climate impact that results from the satellite data, gridded climate observation, and statistics for sensitive landscape of the NSH.					; Neale, Christopher/AAB-3578-2022	Gilmore, Troy/0000-0001-9939-4780; Shrestha, Nawaraj/0000-0002-4882-1006; Antzelevich Zlotnik, Vitaly/0000-0002-9601-9464; 														2214-5818				AUG	2021	36								100877	10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.100877	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2021.100877		JUL 2021											WOS:000687246700002

Numerical evaluation of flow regime changes induced by the Three Gorges Dam in the Middle Yangtze	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												The full operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has altered the downstream natural flow regime. Flow regime changes have resulted in profound influences on the utility of water resources and hence a large area with a riparian ecosystem including China's two largest freshwater lakes in the Middle Yangtze. Because of complicated flow regimes in this large-scale river-lake system, the TGD's impacts on flow regimes are highly heterogeneous and require to be carefully addressed. To better understand them, we estimated water level and discharge changes solely induced by the TGD from 2006 to 2011 using a hydrodynamic model that facilitates the separation of the TGD's contribution to flow regimes. Results indicated that water regulation of the TGD caused profound impacts on the flow regimes of the Middle Yangtze. In the impoundment period from mid-September to October, rapid and significant decline of the water discharge downstream the TGD produced a prolonged dry season that occurred around 10 days earlier than before. Our analysis elucidated a pattern of recent changes in the flow regimes caused by the TGD. The findings are useful for addressing the TGD-induced environmental issues, optimizing the TGD's operation, and generating adaptive management strategy for the complex river-lake ecosystem.					; Lu, Xi Xi/C-5609-2008; Lu, Xi/C-5609-2008; LAI, Xijun/F-8722-2010	Lai, Xijun/0000-0002-3973-6539; Lu, Xi Xi/0000-0002-2528-4631; 													0029-1277	2224-7955				DEC	2016	47			1			149	160		10.2166/nh.2016.158	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2016.158													WOS:000391003300011

This study describes the seasonal changes in inundation area and water volume in the floodplain along the TSR over three years. The method employed time series remote sensing images of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data, the digital elevation model (DEM) of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), bathymetric data, and observed water level data. Adding normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a "third band" in the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) provided higher accuracy compared to thresholding NDVI and pure MLC (two bands) only. The results showed that the inundation area ranged from 123.8 to 3251.2 km(2) (mean: 1028.5 km(2)) with overall accuracy of 96.9%. The estimated water volume ranged from 418.3 to 2223.9 million m(3) (mean: 917.3 million m(3)) from the dry to wet season, respectively. Seasonally, the TSR floodplain accounted for up to 5.3% and 3.2% of the mean annual inflow and outflow of the TSR, respectively. In addition to the TSL water reservoir, the TSR and its floodplain exchanged and stabilized the flow of the MR and its downstream delta, respectively. Overall, the obtained results have enhanced our understanding of the TSR, supporting further studies on river connectivity and reversal flow in this study area.

Lakeshore retrogression, water temperatures, and ground temperatures beneath and around the lake were monitored. About 80 per cent of the lakeshore edge collapsed each year with a maximum rate of about 1.8 m from August 2007 to October 2008. The warm season was the main period of shoreline collapse, especially from August to October. Ice forms in the lake towards the end of October and reaches its maximum thickness of about 0.7 m by the end of the cold season. The thaw depth at the lakeshore edge is about 0.7 m greater than in the adjacent terrain, while any pre-existing permafrost below its centre has thawed entirely. Overall, the high degree of disturbance associated with the thermokarst lake is shown by mean annual ground temperatures beneath it that are more than 5 degrees C higher than in the surrounding terrain at the same depth.

With this study, country-based classification of natural lakes >2000 ha was realized via the use of remote sensing technology and Google Earth Engine platform coupled with different intrinsic properties of the lakes like geographical location, altitude, water-type, intended use, depth. Following a general evaluation of the overall 27 selected lakes in the long- and short-term covering 35 years and 5 years, respectively, some individual lakes were screened representing different water types and more focus on their areal changes in the long- and short-term were analyzed. Landsat images were utilized for the long-term investigation on the areal changes and Sentinel-2 was used in the short-term analysis. The aim of individual inspection of some of the lakes was to put forth a guideline on investigating the cause-and-effect relationship of the areal variations over time/season and thus, to enlighten the decision-makers. Moreover, the long-term meteorological values of the nearest stations to two of the lakes that have been suffering from continuous loss in their surface areas over time were further inspected. As expected, 2(o)C temperature increase over 35 years has shown its alerting signs over the long-term inspection on both of the lakes.					; TANIK, Aysegul/B-1104-2014; dervisoglu, adalet/ABB-3279-2020; MUSAOGLU, NEBIYE/HSH-3813-2023; Yagmur Aydin, Nur/AAA-7286-2020	Yagmur, Nur/0000-0002-5915-6929; Dervisoglu, Adalet/0000-0001-7455-4282; MUSAOGLU, NEBIYE/0000-0002-8022-8755; firatli, ertug/0000-0002-3860-1405; TANIK, AYSEGUL/0000-0002-0319-0298													1865-0473	1865-0481				JUN	2022	15	2					951	964		10.1007/s12145-022-00778-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12145-022-00778-8		FEB 2022											WOS:000761859900001

In contrast, nutrient and suspended solid loads tended to exhibit decreasing or sta-tionary trends at most of the more western stations. Trends in nutrients and suspended solids typically corresponded to discharge, particularly in the Red-Assiniboine subdrainage where rapidly increasing nutrient loads were almost exclusively associated with runoff patterns. Our findings will serve as a baseline against which future trend assessments can be compared. Moreover, our findings suggest that land management practices aimed at reducing nutrient loads to Lake Winnipeg should be prioritized towards the rivers of the eastern subdrainages of the Lake Winnipeg basin.					; Yates, Adam/Y-1532-2019	Yates, Adam Gordon/0000-0002-2239-9046; 														2214-5818				DEC	2022	44								101249	10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101249	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101249		OCT 2022											WOS:000878761700003

Many studies have examined the effects of low light and high nutrient alone on the decline of submersed macrophytes. Some studies have also examined the combined effects of low light and high nutrient on seagrass, but very few on freshwater macrophytes. In the present study, a factorial design of three sunlight intensities (100%. 42% and 11% full sunlight) with two nutrient levels in water (mesotrophic water and eutrophic water) was used to examine the combined effects of low light and high nutrient stresses of the water column on submersed macrophyte. Specifically, we examined the changes by testing the changes of the carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolisms, and response of antioxidant enzymes in a submersed macrophytes Potamogeton crispus. The results showed that plants tended to reduce tissue soluble protein. soluble carbohydrates (SC) contents, and SC/FAA ratios both in nutrient-enriched waters and shaded conditions, while plants accumulated free amino acids (FAA). promoted superoxide dismutase (SOD) and guaiacol peroxidase (POD) activities under these conditions. The potential mechanisms may involve the following aspects: (1) FAA was formed to transfer the accumulated NH4+-N in the plant; (2) Carbohydrates and protein contents of the plants decreased due to the decline of photosynthesis in shaded condition; (3) Carbohydrates were also consumed significantly due to their transformation into the carbon skeleton of FAA: (4) Antioxidant enzymes SOD and POD were found to closely collaborate with each other in responding to low light and high nutrient stresses. The present study indicated that low light and high nutrient in water column could aggravate the carbon consumption and nitrogen accumulation metabolisms, and caused oxidative stress in the submersed plant. These findings contributed to the mechanisms for submersed macrophytes' decline in eutrophic lakes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multivariate statistical analysis such as ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Discriminant Analysis (DA) were employed for data interpretation. Nutrient stoichiometry revealed that the Chilika Lagoon experiences phosphorus limitation with regard to nitrogen and silicate (N:P:Si = 16:1:16) throughout the study period. As per the computed TSI values, the southern sector (SS), central sector (CS), and outer channel (OC) were assigned with a mesotrophic status, whereas the northern sector (NS) was assigned with the eutrophic status. From PCA, total nitrogen was found to be negatively correlated with salinity and positively correlated with silicate, thus indicating that the major source of nitrogen in the lagoon was freshwater ingress by rivers with high silicate content. DA indicated that it was successful in discriminating the groups as predicted.

The lake, which is well known for its dramatic decrease in surface area during the 1970s and 1980s, experiences an annual flood resulting in a maximum total surface water area generally during February or March, though sometimes earlier or later. People along the shores of Lake Chad make their living fishing, farming, and raising livestock and have a vested interest in knowing when and how extensive the annual flooding will be, particularly those practicing recession farming in which the fertile ground of previously flooded area is used for planting crops. In this study, the authors investigate the relationship between lake and basin parameters, including rainfall, basin evapotranspiration, lake evapotranspiration, lake elevation, total surface water area, and the previous year's total surface water area, and develop equations for each dry season month (except November) linking total surface water area to the other parameters. The resulting equations allow the user to estimate the December average monthly total surface water area of the lake in late November, and to make the estimates for January to May in early December. Based on the results of a Leave One Out Cross Validation analysis, the equations for lake area are estimated to have an average absolute error ranging from 5.3 percent (for February estimates) to 7.6 percent (for May estimates).					; Zaitchik, Benjamin/AAB-3298-2020; Policelli, Frederick/D-8994-2018	Zaitchik, Benjamin/0000-0002-0698-0658; Jung, Hahn Chul/0000-0002-6330-1834; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				JAN	2019	568						1071	1080		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.11.037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.11.037													WOS:000455694400085

Coupled long-term limnological data and sedimentary records reveal new control on water quality in a eutrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Human impacts on freshwater ecosystems are pervasive, but the short and discontinuous nature of most datasets limits our ability to understand the controls on water quality and effectively manage freshwater resources. We examine change in Lake Mendota (Madison, Wisconsin) over the last two centuries by pairing analyses of a sedimentary archive with the site's > 100 yr limnological record. We show that eutrophication of the lake, evident as an abrupt shift in sediment composition, began in the late 19(th) century following the intensification of urban and agricultural land use in the watershed. Efforts to address deterioration of lake water quality, including the removal of point-source pollutants and biomanipulation, have had a measurable influence on sediment composition and water clarity. Since the early 1980s, quasi-seasonal cycles of phytoplankton blooms have induced calcite precipitation, leaving distinct laminations in the sedimentary record. These "whiting events" evidently did not accumulate in lake sediments until the late 20(th) century, indicating that efforts to remediate water quality have shifted the lake to a new ecosystem state. Calcite whitings can improve water quality in eutrophic lakes by coprecipitation with phosphate, increasing phosphorus (P) burial in lake sediments. Using long-term limnological records, we report negative correlations between calcite saturation indices and P in lake surface waters and show that calcite whitings could partially explain recent P decline in Lake Mendota surface waters. Our study reveals a previously uncharacterized potential control on water quality in this eutrophic lake and demonstrates the benefit of coupling long-term limnological data with sedimentary records.

Therefore, this study investigated the seasonal variations in water uptake patterns of different-aged H. rhamnoides and their associated species via stable isotopes and leaf water potential analyses. The model results showed that seedling (Hs) and juvenile (Hj) H. rhamnoides extracted water mainly from shallow and middle soil layers throughout the growing seasons, whereas mature H. rhamnoides (Hm) exhibited high plasticity, shifting water source between shallow soil water and groundwater when the former become less available. By contrast, the associated grasses (Taraxacum mongolicum, Thermopsis lanceolata, and Polygonum sibiricum) mainly absorbed shallow soil water across the whole growing seasons, suggesting that direct competition for shallow soil water occurred between grasses and H. rhamnoides. In addition, the obviously higher delta C-13 values of Hj with more negative predawn (mean psi(pd), -1.37 MPa) and midday (mean psi(md), -2.23 MPa) leaf water potential indicated the Hj experienced greater water stress relative to Hs and Hm. These results provide new understanding of the seasonal water use strategies of different-aged H. rhamnoides, which will be important for the successful management of plantations in this region.					; Si-Yi, Zhang/ISS-2652-2023; Zhang, Cicheng/JKI-5065-2023; He, Bin/F-8497-2014; Li, Xiaoyan/K-8544-2012	zhang, si yi/0000-0003-1928-5766; Li, XiaoYan/0000-0002-7454-7821; He, Bin/0000-0002-7224-9214													1936-0584	1936-0592				JAN	2019	12	1							e2049	10.1002/eco.2049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2049													WOS:000454601400001

Despite increasing attention, our understanding of the hydrological behaviors of thermokarst lakes under permafrost degradation remains limited on the QTP. In this study, water stable isotope tracers were used to characterize the spatial and seasonal hydrological changes of thermokarst lakes on the central QTP. Significant seasonal variations and factors influencing the isotopic hydrology of lakes were revealed through the ice-free season. Substantial differences in lake-specific input water isotope compositions (delta(I)) among the lakes indicate two lake-recharge regimes: rain-dominated, and snowmelt/permafrost thaw-dominated. We suggest that precipitation and active-layer hydrology controlled these hydrological changes in the ice-free season. However, under ice cover, melting of the surrounding permafrost (including ground ice) dominated the hydrology of thermokarst lakes. Importantly, a conceptual model delineates the hydrological evolution of thermokarst lakes under permafrost degradation. This study serves as a baseline for future investigations of hydrological processes and water balance relating to thawing permafrost on the QTP.					; Hou, Yandong/MGW-3933-2025; Zhang, Peng/AAR-6614-2021; Yang, Yuzhong/F-4983-2019	Xu, Xiaoming/0000-0002-1693-8584; 													1045-6740	1099-1530				JAN	2019	30	1					58	71		10.1002/ppp.1996	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppp.1996													WOS:000456319500005

The source area of the Yellow river (SAYR) in Tibet Plateau, underlain by permafrost which provides important source water, was investigated. One hundred and eleven water samples across SAYR were collected in April 2014, when permafrost thawing began and the precipitation season had not arrived yet. It was found that the arsenic concentration level was relatively higher than other pristine surface water in the world, but similar to other source regions on the Tibetan Plateau, showing SAYR is pristine and can serve as a reference region for determining the human influence on permafrost-affected landscapes. The positive correlation of arsenic with sulfate suggested that the arsenic was predominantly derived from the weathering process of arsenic-rich sulfides. Climate warming enhanced thawing depth of permafrost may accelerate the release and mobilization of arsenic to the surface water.

A total of 26 species (22 agglomerated and 4 non-agglomerated) belonging to 8 genera has been identified from 8 study sites where Tintinnopsis (17 species) represented the most dominant genera, contributing up to 65 % of total tintinnid community followed by Tintinnidium (2 species), Leprotintinnus (2 species) and Dadayiella, Favella, Metacylis, Eutintinnus and Helicostomella (each with solitary species). The maximum (1,666 ind.l(-1)) and minimum (62 ind.l(-1)) abundance of tintinnids was recorded during post-monsoon and monsoon, respectively. A distinct seasonal dynamics in terms of biomass (0.005-2.465 mu g C l(-1)) and daily production rate (0.04-3.13 mu g C l(-1) day(-1)) was also noticed, accounting highest value during pre-monsoon. Chlorophyll a and nitrate were found to be potential causative factors for the seasonal variations of tintinnids as revealed by a stepwise multiple regression model. The result of ANOVA showed a significant variation between species abundance and months (F=2.36, P <= 0.05). k-dominance curves were plotted to determine the comparison of tintinnid dominance between the investigated stations. Based on a principal component analysis (PCA), three main groups were delineated with tintinnid ciliates and environmental parameters. The changes in lorica morphology in terms of temperature and salinity, recorded for three dominant species, provided information on the ecological characteristics of the species assemblage in this estuarine system.

The additional high nutrient availability in highly decomposed peat soils of these newly formed ecosystems favours the fast establishment of a small number of helophytes while the return of lost target species like low sedges and brown mosses could be delayed for decades. We hypothesise that the phosphorus (P) uptake of the newly developed vegetation substantially influences the P cycle in rewetted fens. Therefore, we investigated how much of the P released in upper degraded peat soils is pumped across the redox-interface between the soil and surface water (='P barrier') during the growing season (similar to 150 days) by six helophytes (Phragmites australis, Typha latifolia, Glyceria maxima, Carex acutiformis, Carex riparia, and Phalaris arundinacea) in five rewetted fens. We then assessed how this would affect the different plant-available P fractions in the rooted degraded peat layers. The highest P uptake during the growing season (duration 150 days from May to September) was recorded for T. latifolia and G. maxima (3.0 and 2.8 g m(-2), respectively). Overall, the P uptake was in the range of the P mobilisation rates we measured in highly decomposed peat soils (range: 0.8-15.6 g P m(-)2(,) n=30), but four to 10-fold higher than diffusive net P fluxes at the interface between soil and surface water. Accordingly, helophytes are able to compensate for the high P mobilisation in degraded peat soils during the growing season, by incorporating this P into biomass. On the other hand a large part of the plant-P stock is released after die back through leaching and mineralisation, which increases the P load of these newly formed shallow lakes and possibly also of adjacent water courses. We estimated that it would still take 20-50 years to exhaust the large pool of plant-available Pin highly decomposed peat soils if aboveground biomass was removed. Without any further management apart from fen rewetting it is unlikely that the fens will return to low nutrient levels within a human life time. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Impact of atmospheric pressure variations on methane ebullition and lake turbidity during ice-cover	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Methane ebullition (bubbling) from lake sediments is an important methane flux into the atmosphere. Previous studies have focused on the open-water season, showing that temperature variations, pressure fluctuations, and wind-induced currents can affect ebullition. However, ebullition surveys during the ice-cover are rare despite the prevalence of seasonally ice-covered lakes, and the factors controlling ebullition are poorly understood. Here, we present a month-long, high frequency record of acoustic ebullition data from an ice-covered lake. The record shows that ebullition occurs almost exclusively when atmospheric pressure drops below a threshold that is approximately equal to the long-term average pressure. The intensity of ebullition is proportional to the amount by which the pressure drops below this threshold. In addition, field measurements of turbidity, in conjunction with laboratory experiments, provide evidence that ebullition is responsible for previously unexplained elevated levels of turbidity during ice-cover.

Extension was episodic and triggered widespread halokinesis in the underlying Zechstein Group halite, particularly during the Early and Late Triassic Hardegsen and Cimmerian I tectonic events. These movements created a tortuous basin topography which temporarily inhibited fluvial sand dispersal and resulted in a dominance of floodbasin fines. Halokinesis also exerted a particularly strong control on stratigraphic preservation on the basin margins by conveying shallow-buried successions, which were vulnerable to erosion, into long-term preservation space below the truncation level of subsequent Jurassic unconformities. During periods of relative fault quiescence and reduced aridity Skagerrak Formation terminal fluvial systems were able to expand across the basin as large transverse Fennoscandian fluvial fans which interacted with both axial and transverse systems draining off the Scottish Highlands. These systems, driven by the Tethyan monsoon, ultimately flowed southward into the northern margin of the Southern Permian Basin to terminate in widespread playa and coastal sabkha. Expansion of these terminal fluvial systems probably took place during pluvial climate episodes and the prevalence of vegetation and burrowing activity on the Skagerrak Formation floodplain suggests an availability of year-round soil moisture, indicating that monsoonal flooding was augmented by intermittent to perennial, dry season, flow. The pluvial episodes potentially to correspond to episodes of warming in the Tethys region, which may have resulted in enhanced evaporation, increased thermal convection and monsoon intensification. The consequent reduction in temperature gradients may also have weakened north-easterly trade winds, allowing more frequent impingement of moist Tethyan air masses into the region during the dry season. In addition to such regional climatic changes, flooding of the Southern Permian Basin by the Muschelkalk Sea during a period of widespread Anisian aridity briefly altered the local climate, allowing the maintenance of marshes and floodplain lakes adjacent to this interior seaway. Contraction of the Skagerrak Formation terminal fluvial systems apparently occurred during cooling, as the climate reverted to the prevailing Pangaean aridity and resulted in the deposition of basin-wide playa. By the Middle Triassic, such playa facies had blanketed much of north-west Europe as the Keuper Formation and Mercia Mudstone Group and the contemporaneous Skagerrak Formation fluvial systems stand in marked contrast to these arid, mud-dominated, basin-fills due to their access to runoff from large Fennoscandian catchments located outwith the arid rift interior.																			2054-6610		978-1-118-92044-2; 978-1-118-92046-6				2014	46						19	57																WOS:000370616900002

Higher environmental levels are expected in view of the increasing consumption of these food additives. In this study, an isotope-dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for quantifying the four artificial sweeteners in boreal lakes (n = 3) and rivers (n = 12). The highest concentrations of ACS, SAC, CYC and SCL were 9,600, 490, 210 and 1000 ng/L, respectively. ACS and SAC were detected in all studied samples, and CYC and SCL in 98% and 56% of the samples. Seasonal trends of ACS and SAC were observed in some rivers. ACS and SCL concentrations in rivers correlated linearly with population equivalents of the wastewater treatment plants in the catchment areas, whereas SAC and CYC concentrations depend more on the source.

Hydrochemical assessment of the Beeshazar and associated lakes in Central Nepal	SN APPLIED SCIENCES												Water quality deterioration has threatened aquatic life around the world including Nepal, which has been a serious issue for environmental sustainability and economic development. This study evaluated and interpreted hydrochemical parameters of the Beeshazar and associated lakes in Central Himalaya, Nepal. The study revealed that the water in the lake was slightly alkaline as the average pH was 7.52. The correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) identified both geogenic and anthropogenic processes as the controlling factors of hydrochemistry whereas the cluster analysis (CA) showed relatively more pollution in the associated Laxmi Lake. Also, the water quality index (WQI) classified the water as "good"for drinking purposes (i.e., WQI= 33.90), while the pollution index (PI) values were characterized as sub-cleanness and slightly polluted. In general, both the WQI and PI signify that water in the lake complex is currently safe for drinking purposes. It is further confirmed from the comparative analysis of chemical variables with other lakes in the region, WHO and national water quality guidelines for aqua culture that the most of the analyzed water parameters exhibited relatively low concentrations and were within the prescribed guidelines. However, the elevated concentrations of NO3- and PO43- may pose serious problems for retaining water quality in the future. The results could be considered for future planning and management of the Ramsar Lakes of the lowland areas in the Himalaya and also as a valuable reference for the freshwater researchers at the national and international levels.

Assessing the seasonal dynamics of inundation, turbidity, and aquatic vegetation in the Australian wetdry tropics using optical remote sensing	ECOHYDROLOGY												Floodplain wetlands in the wetdry tropics are under increasing pressure from water resource development, and there is a need for methods to assess the biophysical dynamics of these extensive and often remote ecosystems. This study assessed the capacity of optical remote sensing methods to monitor the seasonal dynamics of inundation, turbidity, and aquatic vegetation cover for a northern Australian savanna catchment. MODIS data were used to map seasonal flood inundation patterns, and Landsat 5 TM data were used to map dry-season waterbody dynamics. A network of water-depth loggers and temperature sensors provided ground observations of surface inundation dynamics, and was used to validate the inundation mapping. Post-flood waterbody surface area declined by 89% over the dry season, with 70% of the decline occurring for Palustrine (floodplain) waterbodies. All aquatic systems became increasingly disconnected as the dry season progressed. Statistical relationships were developed between seasonal measurements of turbidity, aquatic vegetation cover, and Landsat spectral data. Catchment wide predictions showed that turbidity increased and macrophyte cover decreased for the Palustrine and Lacustrine (lake) systems, while the Riverine systems became less turbid over the dry season. These results show that, for open savanna landscapes where cloud cover does not limit waterbody detection, optical remote sensing methods can be effectively applied to assess seasonal patterns of inundation and accompanying biophysical dynamics. This provides an effective tool to evaluate the impact of river flow regime changes from water resource use or climate change in these regions. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Six heavy metals: arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) were determined by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Relative enrichment factors and potential ecological risk indexes were used to study the pollution status of heavy metals in sediments and assess their potential ecological risk to the environment. Sediment enrichment factors of heavy metals were found in the following order Cr > As > Cd > Zn > Cu > Pb. Potential ecological risk indices for heavy metals were: Cd > As > Cr > Cu > Pb > Zn. The calculated potential ecological risk indices showed that the lake was polluted by heavy metals. Cd had moderate potential ecological risk to the ecological environment and was the main contributor to potential toxicity response indices for various heavy metals in Lake Donghu. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to establish the significance of variations in heavy metals. The mean seasonal concentrations of metals showed that there were significant differences among seasons and sampling sites (P<0.05). The cause of pollution in Lake Donghu could be associated with industrial and human activities. We proposed strategies that can be applied in order to prevent accumulation of heavy metals in the lake.

J	Rengefors, K; Weyhenmeyer, GA; Bloch, I				Rengefors, Karin; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa A.; Bloch, Ina			Temperature as a driver for the expansion of the microalga Gonyostomum semen in Swedish lakes	HARMFUL ALGAE												Gonyostomum semen (Ehrenb) Diesing is a bloom-forming and noxious phytoplankton species, that usually occurs in brown-water lakes and which is often referred to as an invasive species. The aim of our study was to analyze changes over time in the occurrence and distribution of blooms, and to find possible drivers of this change. We also performed spatial analyses to identify environmental factors coupled to Gonyostomum's distribution. The effect of temperature on key processes in the Gonyostomum life cycle was further investigated experimentally to determine potential mechanistic causes. Our results show that G. semen has expanded in Swedish lakes since 1988. At the turn of the Millennium it was present in more than a quarter of the lakes included in the Swedish national lake monitoring program. Gonyostomum-lakes have significantly higher DOC, higher nutrient levels, and lower pH than non-Gonyostomum lakes. Trend analyses show a significant increase in the number of lakes with Gonyostomum, as well as in biomass and occurrence in samples. One explanation is that we more often find water temperatures exceeding 6 degrees C, which is also the threshold for positive growth in our laboratory experiments. Moreover, according to our partial least square regression model (PLS) analysis in one lake, we find that the increase in biomass is a function of temperature in combination with other factors. Thus, we conclude that an increase in water temperature resulting in longer growth season may be a driver of the expansion of Gonyostomum. However, temperature alone cannot explain why the species has expanded to new lakes within the same climatic region. Possibly an interplay between DOC and temperature can explain the patterns observed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The importance of nutrient supply by fish excretion and watershed streams to a eutrophic lake varies with temporal scale over 19years	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Animals transform and translocate nutrients at ecologically relevant rates, contributing to eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems by mobilizing otherwise unavailable nutrients. Yet we know little about how animal-mediated nutrient cycling compares with external abiotic nutrient sources over long periods (years-decades) and at multiple timescales. To address this, we conducted a 19-year study in a eutrophic reservoir examining nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs from watershed streams versus excretion by an abundant fish (gizzard shad, Dorosoma cepedianum) at weekly, monthly and seasonal timescales. Over the entire time period, watershed N and P loading was 33- and 3-fold greater than fish N and P excretion, respectively. However, fish N excretion exceeded watershed nutrient loading in 36% of weeks and 43% of months, and fish P excretion in 68% of weeks and 58% of months during the growing season. Fish excretion had lower temporal variability in both supply rate and N:P ratio than watershed loading. Fish excretion also supplied nutrients at a much lower molar N:P ratio than the watershed (mean of daily N:P supply ratios were 15 and 723, respectively). In eutrophic lakes with high fish biomass, fish excretion can strongly influence algal biomass and community composition. Eutrophication management efforts should consider removal of benthivorous fish, like gizzard shad, in addition to other watershed management practices to improve water quality. Future climate change will modulate the interplay between fish- and watershed-mediated nutrient dynamics by altering the geographic distribution of detritivorous fish and the frequency and severity of storm and drought events.

The presence of these metabolites greatly boosts the ecological dominance of eg. Cladophora, which creates large surface mats. The main goal of our work was to quantify the phenol and polyphenols (allelopathic substances) secreted by the macroalgae as a result of exposure to biotic stress caused by competition. The research was carried out on the Cladophora glomerata biomass collected from two freshwater ecosystems located in Wielkopolska Region (Poland, Fig. 1): Oporzynskie Lake (N52 degrees 55', E 17 degrees 9') and Nielba River (N52 degrees 48', E 17 degrees 12'). Seasonal variability (May-October 2015) in the properties of C. glomerata mats in the river and lake ecosystem was also analyzed in relation to the physicochemical parameters of water. In addition, the content of pigments in the analyzed biomass was determined during the appearance of algae mats in water reservoirs. Biomass extraction was performed to determine the phenolic and carotenoid contents (chlorophyll and carotenoids) by using two extraction methods: microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and supercritical fluid extraction (SFE). After isolation of the phenols from the thalli (mats) and the habitat, they were analyzed using the Folin-Ciocalteu method with some modifications, while the pigment content (chlorophyll and carotenoids) was evaluated by the spectrophotometric method Liechtenthaler (1987) with some variations. Analysis of the content of these components in algae extracts indicates that the tendency of changes in their contents was similar or the same. Growth and decrease of phenolic content (Cladophora T MAE and Cladophora T SFE) and pigments (MAE chlorophyll, SFE and MAE carotenoids) at the same time were independent of the insulation method used. The mats formed by C. glomerata on the surface of Lake Oporzynskie were more stable and larger surface area than those on the Nielba River, which could explain differences in polyphenol concentrations in these two aquatic ecosystems. The results suggest a reduction in the secretion of phenolic compounds with an aging population of algae. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Seasonal Variability of Mineral Formation in Microbial Mats Subjected to Drying and Wetting Cycles in Alkaline and Hypersaline Sedimentary Environments	AQUATIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Interactions of the microbial mat community with the sedimentary environment were evaluated in two shallow, ephemeral lakes with markedly different hydrochemistry and mineralogy. The characterization of growing and decaying microbial mats by light microscopy observations and fluorescence in situ hybridization was complemented with biogeochemical and mineralogical measurements. The lakes studied were Eras and Altillo Chica, both located in Central Spain and representing poly-extreme environments. Lake Eras is a highly alkaline, brackish to saline lake containing a high concentration of chloride, and in which the carbonate concentration exceeds the sulfate concentration. The presence of magnesium is crucial for the precipitation of hydromagnesite in microbialites of this lake. Altillo Chica is a mesosaline to hypersaline playa lake with high concentrations of sulfate and chloride, favoring the formation of gypsum microbialites. Differences in the microbial community composition and mineralogy of the microbialites between the two lakes were primarily controlled by alkalinity and salinity. Lake Eras was dominated by the cyanobacterial genus Oscillatoria, as well as Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes. When the mat decayed, Alphaproteobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria increased and became the dominant heterotrophs, as opposed to Firmicutes. In contrast, Deltaproteobacteria was the most abundant group in Lake Altillo Chica, where desiccation led to mats decay during evaporite formation. In addition to Deltaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria were found in Altillo Chica, mostly during microbial mats growth. At both sites, microbial mats favored the precipitation of sulfate and carbonate minerals. The precipitation of carbonate is higher in the soda lake due to a stronger alkalinity engine and probably a higher degradation rate of exopolymeric substances. Our findings clarify the distribution patterns of microbial community composition in ephemeral lakes at the levels of whole communities, which were subjected to environmental conditions similar to those that may have existed during early Earth.

Among the nitrogen flows into Erhai Lake, shallow groundwater migration is a major pathway. The nitrogen variation and influencing factors in the shallow groundwater of the nearshore vegetable field of Erhai Lake are not well documented. A 2-year field experiment was conducted to determine the concentrations of nitrogen species in the shallow groundwater and their influencing factors in the nearshore vegetable field of Erhai Lake. The results showed that concentrations of TN, NO3--N, and NO2--N gradually increased with increasing elevation and distance from Erhai Lake, but the opposite was observed for NH4+-N in the shallow groundwater. The concentrations of nitrogen species in the rainy season were greater than those in the dry season. NO3--N accounted for more than 79% of total nitrogen in shallow groundwater. Redundancy analysis showed that more than 70% of the temporal and spatial variations of nitrogen concentrations in the shallow groundwater were explained by shallow groundwater depth, and only approximately 10% of variation was explained by the factors of soil porosity, silt clay content of soil, and NH4+-N and NO3--N concentrations of soil (p < 0.05). The shallow groundwater depth had more notable effects on nitrogen concentrations in the shallow groundwater than other factors. This result will strongly support the need for further research regarding the management practices for reducing nitrogen concentrations in shallow groundwater.																			0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2018	25	5					4858	4870		10.1007/s11356-017-0791-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0791-7								29199366					WOS:000425770300076

Samples were collected from traditional wells, boreholes, and a lake in Burkina Faso. A multiresidue analysis was developed for 25 pesticides identified during field surveys. Polar organic chemical integrative samplers (POCIS) were used to confirm trends observed with grab samples. Uptake kinetics of POCIS were assessed by in situ calibration. The proposed use of nonlinear least squares regression proved to be a robust approach for estimating time-weighted average concentration in cases of nonlinear uptake. High sampling rates for triazines in a quasi-stagnant lake were attributed to warm water temperatures (30.8 +/- 1.3 A degrees C). The combination of sampling techniques during a 3-year monitoring period allowed for identifying potential interactions between resources, seasonal patterns, and origins of contaminants. Atrazine, azadirachtin, carbofuran, chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin, dieldrin, imidacloprid, and profenofos exceeded 0.1 mu g L-1, indicating a potential risk for the consumers. Ecological risk assessment was performed using the Pesticide Tool Index for fish, cladocerans, and benthic invertebrates. Peak concentrations of cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos were systematically associated with hazard to the studied taxa.					; de Alencastro, Luiz/G-5202-2013	Lehmann, Edouard/0000-0002-2991-9008; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				FEB	2018	25	4					3681	3694		10.1007/s11356-017-0665-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0665-z								29164468					WOS:000425008900064
J	Weyhenmeyer, GA; Peter, H; Willén, E				Weyhenmeyer, Gesa A.; Peter, Hannes; Willen, Eva			Shifts in phytoplankton species richness and biomass along a latitudinal gradient consequences for relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Analysing phytoplankton community data from 205 small, mainly oligotrophic Swedish lakes along a 13 degrees latitudinal gradient, we found that the duration of the open-water season (DT>0) was best related to phytoplankton species richness and biomass, probably because DT>0 can be used as a proxy for nutrient concentrations, as well as for light and temperature conditions in lakes. 2. The relationships between DT>0 and phytoplankton species richness and biomass were not linear but showed significant shifts, that is, richness suddenly doubled at DT>0=170days and phytoplankton biomass began to strongly increase at DT>0 around 220days. 3. The doubling in species richness corresponded to a change in the seasonal plankton succession from one to two peaks per year, and the shift in biomass corresponded to a shift in nutrient concentrations. 4. The geographical differences in richness and biomass shifts resulted in an exponential biodiversityecosystem functioning relationship along a DT>0 gradient. 5. We conclude that phytoplankton species richness and biomass are driven by different environmental factors, resulting in a nonlinear biodiversityecosystem functioning relationship. The shape of the diversityfunctioning relationship varies along with variations in environmental drivers, which is of highest importance for ongoing discussions about impacts of global change on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

Additionally, total organic carbon (TOC) and available phosphorus (AP) were also analyzed to infer the biogeochemistry of trace metals and the correlation that exists among them. Five core sediments were collected at the end of the monsoon season from different locations in the study area, representing diverse anthropogenic and agricultural activities. The average concentration of trace metals in sediments followed the order Mn > Pb > Ni > Zn > Cu. The trace metal concentration in the surface sediments was higher and decreased with depth in the vertical profile. Contamination factor (CF), geoaccumulation index (Igeo), enrichment factor (EF), and pollution load index (PLI) were used to evaluate sediment quality and the pollution status of the lake sediments. Cu, Zn, and Ni showed minor to moderate enrichment, and Pb showed a severe level of enrichment in all the core sediment samples. However, the sediment quality guidelines' index indicates that the sediments are moderately polluted with copper, zinc, and nickel and severely polluted with lead. There exists a strong positive correlation among Pb-Ni, Ni-AP, and AP-Pb, and a strong negative correlation among TOC-Ni, TOC-Pb, and TOC-AP for all the sediment samples. Additionally, the principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) suggest that a good similarity exists among Pb, Ni, and Zn. The study indicates that trace metals in wetland sediments have originated from multiple anthropogenic sources like agricultural runoff (fertilizers), direct addition of solid wastes, discharge of untreated wastewater, and long-range transport from the oil refinery in the wetland.

Assemblage patterns and community structure of macro-zoobenthos and temporal dynamics of eco-physiological indices of two wetlands, in lower gangetic plains under varying ecological regimes: A tool for wetland management	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wetlands are rich biological resources and support livelihood and nutritional security to a huge populace globally. In the present study, two ecologically distinct floodplain wetlands viz., Khalsi and Akaipur located in the sub-basin of Jamuna river in lower Gangetic basin, were studied for abundance, species richness and diversity indices of macro-zoobenthic communities across four seasons. The selected wetlands vary in terms of ecological regimes such as, water volume, depth, link channel, agricultural runoffs, macrophyte coverage etc. Khalsi, a seasonally open beel (wetland) that occasionally exchange water with river Jamuna during high flood, while Akaipur is a closed beel with no exchange of water. The studies indicated higher community richness in macrophyte dominated seasonally open Khalsi wetland (22species) as compared to closed Akaipur wetlands (20 species). The community abundance was higher in Khalsi (8496 nos/m(2)) as compared to Akaipur. Average Dominance, Simpson and Shannon diversity indices for Khalsi and Akaipur were calculated as 0.3, 0.7 & 1.5 and 0.2, 0.8 & 1.7, respectively. The community structure of wetlands revealed dominance of a single group, gas-tropoda (99%), followed by bivalvia (0.64%), diptera (0.27%) and oligochaeta (0.09%) in Khalsi, whereas, Akaipur depicted community structure with dominance of gastropoda (46.18%) followed by oligochaeta (41.36%), diptera (11.22%) and bivalvia (1.24%). The trophic state index (TSI) based on chlorophyll a (Chla), Secchi disc transparency and total phosphorus showed significant (p < 0.05) variations in both wetlands between different seasons. The water quality parameters were also significantly (p < 0.05) differ in both the wetlands except dissolved oxygen. The CCA components, CCA1 and CCA2 explained 27.59% and 23.95% and 39.78% and 15.26% of the species environment correlation in Akaipur and Khalsi, respectively. The distribution range of macro-zoobenthos varies 0.30-0.92 and 0.26-0.96 in Khalsi and Akaipur, respectively. The study revealed better ecosystem health of Khalsi beel in sustaining aquatic diversity while Akaipur beel is succeeding towards super eutrophic state. Thus, the present study provides baseline information on assemblage patterns and community structure of macro-zoobenthos in two important wetlands for sustainable management of the aquatic bioresources.

Systemic, early-season Microcystis blooms in western Lake Erie and two of its major agricultural tributaries (Maumee and Sandusky rivers)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Recurrent, massive cyanobacterial blooms composed mainly of the genus Micro cystis indicate a broad-scale re-eutrophication of Lake Erie. In the past, ameliorating eutrophication relied on intentionally decreasing point-source tributary nutrient, especially phosphorus, loads to the lake. However, recent research has shown that tributaries load not only nutrients but also bloom-levels of phytoplankton, including Microcystis. We built on this previous work by sampling earlier in the year and in much smaller tributaries in both the Maumee and Sandusky systems. We found Microcystis wet biomasses in these tributaries averaged 3.16 mg/L (+/- 0.59 mg/L, one standard error of the mean) in 2009 and 3.42 mg/L (+/- 0.55 mg/L) in 2010. Importantly, we found Microcystis in small ditches in March, much earlier than previously observed. Micro cystis biomass did not directly correspond to measured phosphorus, chlorophyll, or phycocyanin concentrations likely reflecting complexities associated with lagged physiological responses and/or non-linear growth relationships. Consequently, our findings emphasize that Microcystis blooms form a more broad-scale problem than previously documented, occurring far upstream much earlier in the year.

These data were used to reconstruct the Mid to Late Holocene history of this currently hyper-arid region, in order to address the question of whether the Mid Holocene environmental transition from a humid to a dry Sahara was progressive or abrupt. This study involved a suite of analyses, including petrographic and scanning electron microscope examination of thin sections, X-ray diffraction, X-radiography, granulometry, loss on ignition and magnetic susceptibility. The potential of micro-X-ray fluorescence core scanning was tested at very high resolution. Detailed microscopic investigation revealed the sedimentary processes responsible for the formation of the fine laminations, identified the season during which they were formed, and confirmed their annually rhythmic nature. High-resolution X-ray fluorescence core scanning allowed the distinction of each individual lamination over the entire record, opening new perspectives for the study of finely laminated sediment sequences. Geochemical and mineralogical data reveal that, due to decreasing monsoon rainfall combined with continuous and strong evaporation, the hydrologically open and fresh Mid Holocene Lake Yoa slowly evolved into the present-day hypersaline brine depleted in calcium, which has existed for about the past 1050years. During the oldest part of the investigated period, Lake Yoa probably contained a permanently stratified lower water column that was nevertheless disrupted relatively frequently by mixing events. Deep-water anoxia became more stable because of increased salinity-driven density stratification. In parallel, the sediment grain-size proxies record a progressive increase of aeolian input in the course of the last 6100years. Altogether, all geochemical and sedimentological indicators point to a progressive drying of the eastern Central Sahara, strengthening previous conclusions based on palaeoecological indicators.					; Dietze, Michael/JWO-8944-2024; Donner, Reik/F-4400-2017	Bouchard, Frederic/0000-0001-9687-3356; Donner, Reik/0000-0001-7023-6375; Francus, Pierre/0000-0001-5465-1966													0037-0746	1365-3091				JUN	2013	60	4					911	934		10.1111/j.1365-3091.2012.01370.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2012.01370.x													WOS:000319068300002

Satellite Microwave remote sensing of contrasting surface water inundation changes within the Arctic-Boreal Region	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Surface water inundation in the Arctic-Boreal region is dynamic and strongly influences land-atmosphere water, energy and carbon (CO2, CH4) fluxes, and potential feedbacks to climate change. Here we report on recent (2003-2010) surface inundation patterns across the Arctic-Boreal region (>= 50 degrees N) and within major permafrost (PF) zones detected using satellite passive microwave remote sensing retrievals of daily fractional open water (Fw) cover from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E). The AMSR-E Fw (25-km resolution) maps reflect strong microwave sensitivity to sub-grid scale open water variability and compare favorably (0.71 <= R-2 <= 0.84) with alternative, static Fw maps derived from finer scale (30-m to 250-m resolution) Landsat, MODIS and SRTM radar (MOD44W) data. The AMSR-E retrievals show dynamic seasonal and annual variability in surface inundation that is unresolved in the static Fw maps. The AMSR-E Fw record also corresponds strongly (0.71 <= R <= 0.87) with regional wet/dry cycles inferred from basin discharge records. An AMSR-E algorithm sensitivity analysis shows a conservative estimate of Fw retrieval uncertainty (RMSE) within +/- 4.1% for effective resolution of regional inundation patterns and seasonal to annual variability. A regional trend analysis of the 8-year AMSR-E record shows no significant Arctic-Boreal region wide Fw trend for the period, and instead reveals contrasting inundation changes within different PF zones. Widespread Fw wetting is detected within continuous (92% of grid cells with significant trend; p<0.1) and discontinuous (82%) PF zones, while sporadic/isolated PF areas show widespread (71%) Fw drying trends. These results are consistent with previous studies showing evidence of contrasting regional inundation patterns linked to PF degradation and associated changes to surface hydrology under recent climate warming.

Integration of altimetric lake levels and GRACE gravimetry over Africa: Inferences for terrestrial water storage change 2003-2011	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Terrestrial water storage (TWS) change for 2003-2011 is estimated over Africa from GRACE gravimetric data. The signatures from change in water of the major lakes are removed by utilizing kernel functions with lake heights recovered from retracked ENVISAT satellite altimetry. In addition, the contribution of gravimetric change due to soil moisture and biomass is removed from the total GRACE signal by utilizing the GLDAS land surface model. The residual TWS time series, namely groundwater and the surface waters in rivers, wetlands, and small lakes, are investigated for trends and the seasonal cycle using linear regression. Typically, such analyses assume that the data are temporally uncorrelated but this has been shown to lead to erroneous inferences in related studies concerning the linear rate and acceleration. In this study, we utilize autocorrelation and investigate the appropriate stochastic model. The results show the proper distribution of TWS change and identify the spatial distribution of significant rates and accelerations. The effect of surface water in the major lakes is shown to contribute significantly to the trend and seasonal variation in TWS in the lake basin. Lake Volta, a managed reservoir in Ghana, is seen to have a contribution to the linear trend that is a factor of three greater than that of Lake Victoria despite having a surface area one-eighth of that of Lake Victoria. Analysis also shows the confidence levels of the deterministic trend and acceleration identifying areas where the signatures are most likely due to a physical deterministic cause and not simply stochastic variations.					; Williams, Simon/C-7214-2011	Williams, Simon/0000-0003-4123-4973; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				DEC	2014	50	12					9696	9720		10.1002/2014WR015506	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014WR015506													WOS:000347921100033
J	Liu, Y; Liu, RG; Shang, R				Liu, Yang; Liu, Ronggao; Shang, Rong			GLOBMAP SWF: a global annual surface water cover frequency dataset during 2000-2020	EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA												The extent of surface water has been changing significantly due to climatic change and human activities. However, it is challenging to capture the interannual changes of inland water bodies due to their high seasonal variation and abrupt change. In this paper, a global annual surface water cover frequency dataset (GLOBMAP SWF) was generated from the MODIS land surface reflectance products during 2000-2020 to describe the seasonal and interannual dynamics of surface water. Surface water cover frequency (SWF) was proposed as the percentage of the time period when a pixel is covered by water in a year. Instead of determination of the water directly, the SWF was estimated indirectly by identifying land observations among annual clear-sky observations to reduce the influence of clouds and variability of water bodies and surface background characteristics, which helps to improve the applicability of the algorithm for different regions across the globe. The generated dataset shows better performances for frozen water, saline lakes, bright surfaces and regions with frequent cloud cover compared with the two high-frequency surface water datasets derived from MODIS data, and it captures more intermittent surface water but may underestimate small water bodies when compared with two high-resolution datasets derived from Landsat data. Compared with the high-resolution SWF maps extracted from Sentinel-1 data in eight regions that cover lakes, rivers and wetlands, the R-2 reaches 0.46 to 0.97, RMSE ranges from 7.24% to 22.62 %, and MAE is between 2.07% and 7.15 %. In 2020, the area of global maximum surface water extent is 3:38 x 10(6) km(2), of which the permanent surface water accounts for approximately 54% (1:83 x 106 km2), and the other 46% is intermittent surface water (1:55 x 10(6) km(2)). The area of global maximum and permanent surface water has been shrinking since 2001, with a change rate of 7577 and 4315 km(2) yr(-1) ( p < 0 :05), respectively, while the intermittent surface water with the SWF above 50% has been expanding (1368 km(2) yr(-1), p < 0 :01). This dataset can be used to analyze the interannual variation and change trend of highly dynamic inland waters extent with consideration of its seasonal variation.

Valli			Bacterial biofilm or biofouling networks with numerous resilience factors from real water supplies of Chennai and their enhanced susceptibility to biocompatible nanoparticles	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION												In the present investigation, enhanced susceptibility of bacterial biofilm networks associated with water repositories of Chennai to silver and silica nanoparticles has been proposed. A total of 120 water samples were collected amid four seasons according to the standard methods and the collected samples were investigated for heterotrophic microorganisms, fecal coliforms and biofilm or biofouling. Bacterial strains segregated from the separate lake were assessed for biofilm or biofouling forming efficacy and their resilience to substantial metal, salt, various antibiotics. Dominant part of the bacterial strains confined from the respective reservoir showed biofilm development and high rate of biofilm framing adequacy was seen in Poondi Lake. E.coli (30-40%),Proteus sp (20-25%), Salmonella sp (10-20%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5-10%) and Lactobacillus (5%) sp were the major bacterial strains associated with biofilm of all the tested reservoirs. Bacterial strains related with biofilm of particular tried supplies demonstrated high resilience to heavy metal, salt and various antibiotics. High rate of multiple drug resistance was recorded in Poondi lake isolates (90%) followed by Porur (85%) and Chembarambakkam (81%). Vulnerability of the biofilm networks to nanoparticles like silver and silica was studied. Silver nanoparticles were orchestrated from leaf extrcat of Vitex negundo and silica from block powder separately which yield high stable, monodispersed particles. Both the nanoparticles realized viable restraint of the biofilm as concentration dependent manner. Be that as it may, noteworthy impact was recorded in silver nano-particles treatment. Nanoparticles susceptibility testing against E.coli- Predominant member (65%) of the biofilm of all the reservior suggest that silver nanoparticles brought about distinct effect on biofilm networks which exhibited 99.0% of biofilm inhibition and improved spillage of protein, nucleic acid content. The study will give awareness about the sanitation and safety of water in the respective reservoirs and the enhanced susceptibility of the biofouling to the nanoparticles would suggest the possible utilization of nanotechnology principles as an effective green strategy in water treatment process (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Laing, AG; Carbone, RE; Levizzani, V				Laing, Arlene G.; Carbone, Richard E.; Levizzani, Vincenzo			Cycles and Propagation of Deep Convection over Equatorial Africa	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Long-term statistics of organized convection are vital to improved understanding of the hydrologic cycle at various scales. Satellite observations are used to understand the timing, duration, and frequency of deep convection in equatorial Africa, a region with some of the most intense thunderstorms. Yet little has been published about the propagation characteristics of mesoscale convection in that region. Diurnal, subseasonal, and seasonal cycles of cold cloud (proxy for convective precipitation) are examined on a continental scale. Organized deep convection consists of coherent structures that are characteristic of systems propagating under a broad range of atmospheric conditions. Convection is triggered by heating of elevated terrain, sea/land breezes, and lake breezes. Coherent episodes of convection result from regeneration of convection through multiple diurnal cycles while propagating westward. They have an average 17.6-h duration and 673-km span; most have zonal phase speeds of 8-16 m s(-1). Propagating convection occurs in the presence of moderate low-level shear that is associated with the southwesterly monsoonal flow and midlevel easterly jets. Convection is also modulated by eastward-moving equatorially trapped Kelvin waves, which have phase speeds of 12-22 m s(-1) over equatorial Africa. Westward propagation of mesoscale convection is interrupted by the dry phase of convectively coupled Kelvin waves. During the wet phase, daily initiation and westward propagation continues within the Kelvin wave and the cold cloud shields are larger. Mesoscale convection is more widespread during the active phase of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) but with limited westward propagation.

In the tropical waters, this is a permanent feature, but in the Mediterranean and other temperate waters, the DCM is a seasonal phenomenon. The metagenome from a single sample of a mature Mediterranean DCM community has been 454 pyrosequenced both directly and after cloning in fosmids. This study is the first to be carried out at this sequencing depth (ca. 600 Mb combining direct and fosmid sequencing) at any DCM. Our results indicate a microbial community massively dominated by the high-light-adapted Prochlorococcus marinus subsp. pastoris, Synechococcus sp., and the heterotroph Candidatus Pelagibacter. The sequences retrieved were remarkably similar to the existing genome of P. marinus subsp. pastoris with a nucleotide identity over 98%. Besides, we found a large number of cyanophages that could prey on this microbe, although sequence conservation was much lower. The high abundance of phage sequences in the cellular size fraction indicated a remarkably high proportion of cells suffering phage lytic attack. In addition, several fosmids clearly belonging to Group II Euryarchaeota were retrieved and recruited many fragments from the total direct DNA sequencing suggesting that this group might be quite abundant in this habitat. The comparison between the direct and fosmids sequencing revealed a bias in the fosmid libraries against low-GC DNA and specifically against the two most dominant members of the community, Candidatus Pelagibacter and P. marinus subsp. pastoris, thus unexpectedly providing a feasible method to obtain large genomic fragments from other less prevalent members of this community.

The chemical characteristics of acid mine drainage with particular reference to sources, distribution and remediation: The Witwatersrand Basin, South Africa as a case study	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Water quality in the immediate vicinity of mine tailings in and around Johannesburg, South Africa was investigated. Pollution is derived primarily from Au mine tailings dumps that are disused or are undergoing retreatment to extract remaining Au, and is dispersed by way of groundwater plumes. These discharge into perennial streams in the area. Pollution manifests itself in the form of low pH (>2) and high SO(4)(2-) concentrations (exceeding 7,000 mg L(-1) in some cases). Water quality improves away from the tailings area. Pollution loads were found to be higher at the end of the rainy season, due to a rise in the water table and hence increased groundwater seepage. Polluted groundwater usually has low Eh (300 mV) and pH (2-3), and high EC (up to 8 mS cm(-1) in some instances). Oxidation of Fe occurs as the groundwater emerges on surface, further lowering pH, and establishing an Fe(III)-Fe(OH)3 redox equilibrium, which operates for many kilometres downstream. Various processes that occur increase compositional heterogeneity in the water, amongst which are evaporation, dissolution of efflorescent crusts and dilution by unpolluted water. Wetland environments are characterised by high pH and low Eh, and appear to be influenced by a sulfide-sulfate redox system, under which SO(4)(2-) and metals are removed, and pH increased. Lakes in the mining area have normal Water quality, which arises from a combination of metal removal by wetlands (most lakes have wetlands at their inlets) and dilution by rain and unpolluted groundwater. They offer a potential method for passively treating polluted water arising from tailings dumps. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The anthropogenic context is constrained in a coherently dated stratigraphic deposit which adds new information about the mobility, subsistence strategies, and settlement of the early hunter-gatherers of southern South America. The age model constructed, as well as radiocarbon dates obtained directly from a combustion structure, indicate that the human occupation occurred over a brief time span around 12,440-12,550 cal yr BP. Considering taphonomic, geoarchaeological, lithic, archaeobotanical, and zooarchaeological evidence, as well as the spatial distribution combined with ethnographic data, we interpret Taguatagua 3 as a logistic and temporary camp associated mainly with gomphothere hunting and butchering. Nevertheless, several other activities were carried out here as well, such as hide and/or bone preparation, small vertebrate and plant processing and consumption, and red ochre grinding. Botanical and eggshell remains suggest that the anthropic occupation occurred during the dry season. Considering the contemporaneous sites recorded in the basin, we conclude that the ancient Tagua Tagua lake was a key location along the region's early hunter-gatherer mobility circuits. In this context, it acted as a recurrent hunting/scavenging place during the Late Pleistocene due to its abundant, diverse, and predictable resources.

Comparison of eDNA and visual surveys for rare and cryptic bromeliad-dwelling frogs	HERPETOLOGICAL JOURNAL												Surveys of rare or cryptic species may miss individuals or populations that are actually present. Despite the increasing use of environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis to survey species in ponds, rivers, and lakes, very few studies have attempted to use eDNA for the detection of species using very small water bodies such as those accumulated within plants. Our aim was to investigate the feasibility of an eDNA sampling method for detecting Crossodactylodes itambe, an endemic bromeliad-dwelling frog from a remote location in Brazil. We collected water samples from 19 bromeliads for which we had observational data from direct visual surveys. We compared occupancy estimated from direct observations with the results from quantitative real-time PCR based eDNA assays. For observational surveys, we used a single season occupancy model. We applied a novel Bayesian occupancy model to estimate occupancy from eDNA samples, as well as false positives and false negatives at different stages of the workflow. eDNA from bromeliad tanks provided reliable estimates, with very low error levels and improved detection when compared to detectability from direct observation. Estimated occupancies using eDNA and visual survey methods were similar. The method is feasible for species restricted to small water bodies and exposed to direct UV radiation, and particularly useful to survey remote locations and confirm species presence. eDNA analysis provides a viable alternative to destructive sampling of bromeliads or direct observation methods that require logistically challenging repeated observations. Therefore, eDNA methods may be widely applicable to sampling programmes of other amphibians that live in plants.					; Fogell, Deborah/AFP-1915-2022	Barata, Izabela/0000-0002-8955-2607; 													0268-0130					JAN	2021	31	1					1	9		10.33256/hj31.1.19	http://dx.doi.org/10.33256/hj31.1.19													WOS:000605268400001

WRF Simulations of the 20-22 January 2007 Snow Events over Eastern Canada: Comparison with In Situ and Satellite Observations	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												One of the grand challenges of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission is to improve cold-season precipitation measurements in mid-and high latitudes through the use of high-frequency passive microwave radiometry. For this purpose, the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) with the Goddard microphysics scheme is coupled with a Satellite Data Simulation Unit (WRF-SDSU) to facilitate snowfall retrieval algorithms over land by providing a virtual cloud library and corresponding microwave brightness temperature measurements consistent with the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI). When this study was initiated, there were no prior published results using WRF at cloud-resolving resolution (1 km or finer) for high-latitude snow events. This study tested the Goddard cloud microphysics scheme in WRF for two different snowstorm events (a lake-effect event and a synoptic event between 20 and 22 January 2007) that took place over the Canadian CloudSat/Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Validation Project (C3VP) site in Ontario, Canada. The 24-h-accumulated snowfall predicted by WRF with the Goddard microphysics was comparable to that observed by the ground-based radar for both events. The model correctly predicted the onset and termination of both snow events at the Centre for Atmospheric Research Experiments site. The WRF simulations captured the basic cloud patterns as seen by the ground-based radar and satellite [i.e., CloudSat and Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit B (AMSU-B)] observations, including the snowband featured in the lake event. The results reveal that WRF was able to capture the cloud macrostructure reasonably well. Sensitivity tests utilizing both the "2ICE'' (ice and snow) and "3ICE" (ice, snow, and graupel) options in the Goddard microphysical scheme were also conducted. The domain-and time-averaged cloud species profiles from the WRF simulations with both microphysical options show identical results (due to weak vertical velocities and therefore the absence of large precipitating liquid or high-density ice particles like graupel). Both microphysics options produced an appreciable amount of liquid water, and the model cloud liquid water profiles compared well to the in situ C3VP aircraft measurements when only grid points in the vicinity of the flight paths were considered. However, statistical comparisons between observed and simulated radar echoes show that the model tended to have a high bias of several reflectivity decibels (dBZ), which shows that additional research is needed to improve the current cloud microphysics scheme for the extremely cold environment in high latitudes, despite the fact that the simulated ice/liquid water contents may have been reasonable for both events. Future aircraft observations are also needed to verify the existence of graupel in high-latitude continental snow events.

Atacama Database: a platform of the microbiome of the Atacama Desert	ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY												The Atacama Desert is one of the oldest and driest places on Earth. In the last decade, microbial richness and diversity has been acknowledged as an important biological resource of this region. Owing to the value of the microbial diversity apparent in potential biotechnology applications and conservation purposes, it is necessary to catalogue these microbial communities to promote research activities and help to preserve the wide range of ecological niches of the Atacama region. A prototype Atacama Database has been designed and it provides a description of the rich microbial diversity of the Atacama Desert, and helps to visualise available literature resources. Data has been collected, curated, and organised into several categories to generate a single record for each organism in the database that covers classification, isolation metadata, morphology, physiology, genome and metabolism information. The current version of Atacama Database contains 2302 microorganisms and includes cultured and uncultured organisms retrieved from different environments within the desert between 1984 and 2016. These organisms are distributed in bacterial, archaeal or eukaryotic domains, along with those that are unclassified taxonomically. The initial prototype of the Atacama Database includes a basic search and taxonomic and advanced search tools to allow identification and comparison of microbial populations, and space distribution within this biome. A geolocation search was implemented to visualise the microbial diversity of the ecological niches defined by sectors and extract general information of the sampling sites. This effort will aid understanding of the microbial ecology of the desert, microbial population dynamics, seasonal behaviour, impact of climate change over time, and reveal further biotechnological applications of these microorganisms.

We investigated seasonal and spatial variations of the five heavy metals and evaluated their health risk in the Liaohe River, Northeast China. A total of 324 surface water samples collected from 2009 to 2010 were analyzed. Levels (high to low) of heavy metals in the Liaohe River were: zinc (Zn) > chromium (Cr) > copper (Cu) > cadmium (Cd) > mercury (Hg). Spatial and seasonal changes impacting concentrations of Cu and Zn were significant, but not significant for Cr, Cd and Hg. The highest concentrations of heavy metals were: Hg at Liuheqiao, Cu at Fudedian, Zn at Tongjiangkou, Cr at Mahushan, and Cd at Shenglitang. The highest concentrations of Hg and Cr were found in the wet period, Cu and Cd in the level period, and Zn in the dry period. The surface water of a tributary was an important accumulation site for heavy metals. Health risks from carcinogens and non-carcinogens increased from upstream to downstream in the mainstream of the Liaohe River. The total health risk for one person in the Liaohe River exceeded acceptable levels. The total health risk was the greatest during the wet period and least in the dry period. Among the five heavy metals in the Liaohe River, Cr posed the greatest single health risk.

Structure and vulnerability of the multi-interaction network in macrophyte-dominated lakes	OIKOS												The network approach is crucial to understand how ecosystems are structured and how they will respond to the disturbances (e.g. the current global change). We have recreated the multi-interaction network of a shallow freshwater lake dominated by submerged macrophytes (Charophytes), a known system very vulnerable to environmental changes, considering both trophic and non-trophic relationships among its elements. To minimize the environmental variability, we established it in an experimental mesocosm, including three habitats: the pelagic, the habitat around the meadow and the periphytic community living on macrophytes. We aimed to study the structure of this network and the roles of its elements, as well as the response of this system to a foreseeable decrease in charophytes due to the global change. Thus, we tested whether there are species in the system that, due to the connections they establish, have central or connecting roles and if the reduction of charophytes affects more the elements that live intimately associated with them. Our results confirm that charophytes are the most central node in the network and that the high-mobility large planktonic herbivores living within the meadow are acting as bridges between the conformant compartments. This suggests a structurally crucial tandem macrophytes-herbivores with the former playing a foundation role (i.e. basal and abundant species centralizing non-trophic interactions) and the latter being connectors in this network. Interestingly, we found that the periphytic elements where those with the highest capacity to affect the other elements of the network when being disturbed. Furthermore, an eventual decrease in the abundance of charophytes will cause a major direct damage to the meadow and periphyton, compartments to which they provide refuge and life support, respectively. Our study highlights the need of approaches encompassing the complex structure of the ecological networks to identify crucial species (such as foundation or connecting species) for their topology and vulnerability geared towards conservation biology.

Review: the Antarctic Chlamydomonas raudensis: an emerging model for cold adaptation of photosynthesis	EXTREMOPHILES												Permanently cold habitats dominate our planet and psychrophilic microorganisms thrive in cold environments. Environmental adaptations unique to psychrophilic microorganisms have been thoroughly described; however, the vast majority of studies to date have focused on cold-adapted bacteria. The combination of low temperatures in the presence of light is one of the most damaging environmental stresses for a photosynthetic organism: in order to survive, photopsychrophiles (i.e. photosynthetic organisms adapted to low temperatures) balance temperature-independent reactions of light energy capture/transduction with downstream temperature-dependent metabolic processes such as carbon fixation. Here, we review research on photopsychrophiles with a focus on an emerging model organism, Chlamydomonas raudensis UWO241 (UWO241). UWO241 is a psychrophilic green algal species and is a member of the photosynthetic microbial eukaryote community that provides the majority of fixed carbon for ice-covered lake ecosystems located in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. The water column exerts a range of environmental stressors on the phytoplankton community that inhabits this aquatic ecosystem, including low temperatures, extreme shade of an unusual spectral range (blue-green), high salinity, nutrient deprivation and extremes in seasonal photoperiod. More than two decades of work on UWO241 have produced one of our most comprehensive views of environmental adaptation in a cold-adapted, photosynthetic microbial eukaryote.

Molybdenum limitation of microbial nitrogen assimilation in aquatic ecosystems and pure cultures	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Molybdenum (Mo) is an essential m cronutrient for biological assimilation of nitrogen gas and nitrate because it is present in the cofactors of nitrogenase and nitrate reductase enzymes. Although Mo is the most abundant transition metal in seawater (107 nM), it is present in low concentrations in most freshwaters, typically <20 nM. In 1960, it was discovered that primary productivity was limited by Mo scarcity (2-4 nM) in Castle Lake, a small, meso-oligotrophic lake in northern California. Follow up studies demonstrated that Mo also limited primary productivity in lakes in New Zealand, Alaska, and the Sierra Nevada. Research in the 1970s and 1980s showed that Mo limited primary productivity and nitrate uptake in Castle Lake only during periods of the growing season when nitrate concentrations were relatively high because ammonium assimilation does not require Mo. In the years since, research has shifted to investigate whether Mo limitation also occurs in marine and soil environments. Here we review studies of Mo limitation of nitrogen assimilation in natural microbial communities and pure cultures. We also summarize new data showing that the simultaneous addition of Mo and nitrate causes increased activity of proteins involved in nitrogen assimilation in the hypolimnion of Castle Lake when ammonium is scarce. Furthermore, we suggest that meter-scale Mo and oxygen depth profiles from Castle Lake are consistent with the hypothesis that nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria in freshwater periphyton communities have higher Mo requirements than other microbial communities. Finally, we present topics for future research related to Mo bioavailability through time and with changing oxidation state.

Consequently, this study investigated the presence of ten (10) antibiotics in sediment and water samples collected from two farms in the lower Volta Lake in Ghana. From April-November 2021, 32 samples were collected and analyzed using Liquid Chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Antibiotic concentrations were found to vary from the limit of detection (LOD) to 9.14 & MNPLUS; 0.34 & mu;g/L and from the LOD to 7.11 & MNPLUS; 0.25 & mu;g/kg for water and sediment samples, respectively. Sulfamethoxazole, with a detection frequency of 85%, was the most prevalent antibiotic found in water samples from fish farm A, while tetracycline was the most encountered, with a detection frequency of 80% in the sediment from fish farm B. The analysis revealed an abundance of these antibiotics, perhaps due to their widespread use in cage aquaculture farms. The risk quotients for the detected antibiotics were very low (RQ < 0.01). Therefore, the living organisms of Volta Lake were unlikely to be at risk, according to the risk assessment of antibiotics in the study. It is necessary to conduct routine monitoring of antibiotics and other contaminants in various matrices to mitigate the adverse effects on human health.

As a consequence of increasing global mean surface air temperatures, these lakes have been predicted to expand further inland and to affect larger areas of the ice sheet. However, as contemporary dynamics of such supraglacial lake expansion are not well studied, any assessment of their future implications remains afflicted with uncertainty. Here, recent changes in supraglacial lake distribution and expansion, and in their drainage behavior and frequency, are presented for Ryder Glacier, Northern Greenland, as concluded from a remote sensing based analysis. The 35-year time span covered in the analysis allows for the detection of trends in lake processes and ice velocity, which otherwise were found to exhibit large inter-annual variability. It also reveals the first occurrence of a coupled lake drainage event in 2002. By linking supraglacial lake expansion, drainage modes, and drainage frequency to the efficiency of the subglacial drainage system and ice flow on seasonal and decadal timescales, a contribution is made to better understand the complexity of coupled glacio-hydrological processes, and to help reduce uncertainties in predictions of future mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet.

Characterization of Sea Lamprey Stream Entry Using Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Effective methods to control invasive Sea Lampreys Petromyzon marinus in the Laurentian Great Lakes often rely on knowledge of the timing of the Sea Lamprey spawning migration, which has previously been characterized using data gathered from traps. Most assessment traps are located many kilometers upstream from the river mouth, so less is known about when Sea Lampreys enter spawning streams and which environmental cues trigger their transition from lakes to rivers. To decide how to develop barriers and traps that target Sea Lampreys when they enter a stream, the stream entry of Sea Lampreys into a Lake Huron tributary during 2years was assessed using dual-frequency identification sonar (DIDSON). Sea Lampreys entered the stream in low densities when temperatures first reached 4 degrees C, which was up to 6weeks and a mean of 4weeks earlier than when they were first captured in traps located upstream. The probability of stream entry was significantly affected by stream temperature and discharge, and stream entry timing peaked when stream temperatures rose to 12 degrees C and discharge was high. Examination of the entry at a finer temporal resolution (i.e., minutes) indicated that Sea Lampreys did not exhibit social behavior (e.g., shoaling) during stream entry. Our findings indicate that Sea Lampreys may be vulnerable to alternative trap types near river mouths and hydraulic challenges associated with traditional traps. Also, seasonal migration barriers near stream mouths may need to be installed soon after ice-out to effectively block the entire adult Sea Lamprey cohort from upstream spawning habitat.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	2018	147	3					514	524		10.1002/tafs.10052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10052													WOS:000434180500007

David			Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs play important roles in nutrient cycling within cyanobacterial Microcystis bloom microbiomes	MICROBIOME												Background During the bloom season, the colonial cyanobacterium Microcystis forms complex aggregates which include a diverse microbiome within an exopolymer matrix. Early research postulated a simple mutualism existing with bacteria benefitting from the rich source of fixed carbon and Microcystis receiving recycled nutrients. Researchers have since hypothesized that Microcystis aggregates represent a community of synergistic and interacting species, an interactome, each with unique metabolic capabilities that are critical to the growth, maintenance, and demise of Microcystis blooms. Research has also shown that aggregate-associated bacteria are taxonomically different from free-living bacteria in the surrounding water. Moreover, research has identified little overlap in functional potential between Microcystis and members of its microbiome, further supporting the interactome concept. However, we still lack verification of general interaction and know little about the taxa and metabolic pathways supporting nutrient and metabolite cycling within Microcystis aggregates. Results During a 7-month study of bacterial communities comparing free-living and aggregate-associated bacteria in Lake Taihu, China, we found that aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic (AAP) bacteria were significantly more abundant within Microcystis aggregates than in free-living samples, suggesting a possible functional role for AAP bacteria in overall aggregate community function. We then analyzed gene composition in 102 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of bloom-microbiome bacteria from 10 lakes spanning four continents, compared with 12 complete Microcystis genomes which revealed that microbiome bacteria and Microcystis possessed complementary biochemical pathways that could serve in C, N, S, and P cycling. Mapping published transcripts from Microcystis blooms onto a comprehensive AAP and non-AAP bacteria MAG database (226 MAGs) indicated that observed high levels of expression of genes involved in nutrient cycling pathways were in AAP bacteria. Conclusions Our results provide strong corroboration of the hypothesized Microcystis interactome and the first evidence that AAP bacteria may play an important role in nutrient cycling within Microcystis aggregate microbiomes.

Seasonal Patterns of Mixing and Arsenic Distribution in a Shallow Urban Lake	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Arsenic, a neurotoxin and carcinogen, is a legacy contaminant in the sediments of many urban lakes and poses health risks to aquatic ecosystems and lake users. Arsenic uptake into the aquatic food web is enhanced in shallow, polymictic lakes compared to deep, seasonally stratified lakes. We present the results of a 17-month field study in Lake Killarney, a shallow, urban lake in Federal Way, Washington, USA, which examines the physical and biogeochemical mechanisms controlling arsenic mobilization and transport from sediment into lake waters, a prerequisite for arsenic uptake into the food web. In Lake Killarney, arsenic mobilization and transport into bottom waters occurred only when stratified conditions and elevated temperatures facilitated deoxygenation of bottom waters. Frequency of lake mixing varied seasonally and controlled the vertical distribution of arsenic in the water column. Convective mixing was the main contributor to elevated vertical turbulent intensity in the water column during periods of high arsenic mobilization, and thus to the upwards transport of arsenic from bottom waters. Maximum near-surface arsenic occurred when the lakebed sediment temperature was elevated and the water column was overturning frequently. This work clarifies the mechanisms that contribute to vertical arsenic transport in shallow lakes and provides a basis for identifying contaminated systems with the physical and biogeochemical conditions that promote transport of arsenic into near-surface water.

Season, Vegetation Proximity and Building Age Shape the Indoor Fungal Communities' Composition at City-Scale	JOURNAL OF FUNGI												Exposure to particular microbiome compositions in the built environment can affect human health and well-being. Identifying the drivers of these indoor microbial assemblages is key to controlling the microbiota of the built environment. In the present study, we used culture and metabarcoding of the fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer ribosomal RNA region to assess whether small-scale variation in the built environment influences the diversity, composition and structure of indoor air fungal communities between a heating and an unheated season. Passive dust collectors were used to collect airborne fungi from 259 dwellings representative of three major building periods and five building environments in one city-Lausanne (Vaud, Switzerland)-over a heating and an unheated period. A homogenous population (one or two people with an average age of 75 years) inhabited the households. Geographic information systems were used to assess detailed site characteristics (altitude, proximity to forest, fields and parks, proximity to the lake, and density of buildings and roads) for each building. Our analysis indicated that season was the factor that explained most of the variation in colonies forming unit (CFU) concentration and indoor mycobiome composition, followed by the period of building construction. Fungal assemblages were more diverse during the heating season than during the unheated season. Buildings with effective insulation had distinct mycobiome compositions from those built before 1975 - regardless of whether they were constructed with pre-1945 technology and materials or 1945 - 1974 ones. The urban landscape-as a whole-was a significant predictor of cultivable Penicillium load-the closer the building was to the lake, the higher the Penicillium load-but not of fungal community composition. Nevertheless, the relative abundance of eleven fungal taxa detected by metabarcoding decreased significantly with the urbanization gradient. When urban landscape descriptors were analyzed separately, the explanatory power of proximity to vegetation in shaping fungal assemblages become significant, indicating that land cover type had an influence on fungal community structure that was obscured by the effects of building age and sampling season. In conclusion, indoor mycobiomes are strongly modulated by season, and their assemblages are shaped by the effectiveness of building insulation, but are weakly influenced by the urban landscape.

Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (brGDGT) lipids are a valuable tool in such pursuits due to their empirical correlation with temperature and near ubiquity in nature. However, the relative contributions of terrestrial and lacustrine sources of brGDGTs to lake sediments is site-dependent and difficult to constrain. Here, we explored the potential for intact brGDGTs-the complete lipids with polar head groups (HGs) still attached-to provide insight into the sources of brGDGTs on the landscape and their contributions to the sedimentary record in a set of Arctic lakes. We measured core and intact brGDGTs in soils, surface and downcore sediments, water filtrates, and sediment traps across five lake catchments in the Eastern Canadian Arctic, with an emphasis on Lake Qaupat (QPT), Baffin Island. Soils were dominated by brGDGTs with a monoglycosyl (1G) HG, while lacustrine samples contained more phosphohexose (PH) brGDGTs, providing evidence for in situ brGDGT production in both settings. Core- and PH-brGDGT-IIIa were more abundant in sediments than in the soils or water column, implying an additional post-depositional source of brGDGTs. A hierarchical clustering analysis indicated that core brGDGTs in Lake QPT sediments were largely lacustrine in origin, while 1G-brGDGTs were primarily soil-derived. Additionally, we found evidence for preservation of intact brGDGTs-especially 1G-brGDGTs-downcore on thousand-year timespans, though in situ production deeper in the sediment column cannot be ruled out. Finally, we explored the possibility of reconstructing 1G-brGDGT-derived soil temperatures and core-brGDGT-derived lake temperatures in tandem from sedimentary archives.					; Geirsdottir, Aslaug/L-3267-2015; Geirsdóttir, Áslaug/L-3267-2015; Sepúlveda, Julio/AAC-9956-2020	Flores Rafael, Edgart Elvis/0000-0002-9606-4142; Miller, G H/0000-0002-8225-2740; Geirsdottir, Aslaug/0000-0003-3125-0195; Raberg, Jonathan/0000-0003-2959-3631; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				OCT	2022	127	10							e2022JG006969	10.1029/2022JG006969	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JG006969													WOS:000861217100001

Microbiological quality of shellfish harvesting areas in the Ashtamudi and Vembanad estuaries (India): Environmental influences and compliance with international standards	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												The sources of microbiological contamination in shellfish harvesting areas in the Ashtamudi and Vembanad estuaries were identified through a sanitary survey. Samples of shellfish and waters were tested for faecal indicator bacteria. Both estuaries receive high levels of contamination from septic tank discharges and areas with high numbers of birds and livestock. An assessment to illustrate the classification status of the harvesting areas indicated that 64% of oyster and 58% of clam samples from Ashtamudi and 54% of mussel samples from Vembanad would comply with the lower class B standard of the EU classification system. Most water results would comply with the faecal coliform standard for 'Prohibited' areas under the US classification system. None of the water samples from Ashtamudi were below the standard for 'Approved' areas. Pollution reduction measures and implementation of a sanitation programme according to international best practice would improve consumer health protection.					; Campos, Carlos/AAP-6897-2020; Mohamed, Kolliyil/AAU-5142-2021; Geethalakshmi, V./L-3152-2019	S, Chinnadurai/0000-0002-5385-7361; Mohamed, Kolliyil/0000-0002-7720-4090; Campos, Carlos/0000-0002-2070-8618; 													0025-326X	1879-3363				JUL	2020	156								111255	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111255	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2020.111255								32510397					WOS:000539160000042

The lake, behind 83- to 103-m-high landslide dam, has a storage capacity of 260 million m(3). The Hongshiyan hydropower station, situated just upstream of the landslide dam, was submerged by the lake water. The rescue actions include building an 8-m-deep drainage channel in the flood season, draining the lake water via a water release tunnel and rebuilding the landslide dam as a permanent structure. This paper presents the considerations and processes in deciding on the emergency actions. One major consideration is to minimize the hazards caused by a possible dam break flood induced by Hongshiyan barrier lake in the flood season. It was found that the barrier lake is classified as "grade I: extremely high risk" in which the 5- and 20-year floods should be used for design and check purposes of emergency works, respectively. The dam break flood evaluations indicated that an 8-m-deep diversion channel should be constructed in order to reduce the total amount of the released reservoir storage and to prevent possible overtopping of the downstream Huangjiaoshu rockfill dam. This study was based on an improved analytical approach to dam break flood modeling and a handy spread sheet developed by the authors. The considerations on various risks and the key analytical technology for dam break flood predictions described in this paper may be useful for other similar cases.																			0921-030X	1573-0840				DEC	2015	79	3					1933	1959		10.1007/s11069-015-1940-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-015-1940-2													WOS:000365016300026
J	Hardy, A; Palmer, P; Oakes, G				Hardy, Andy; Palmer, Paul, I; Oakes, Gregory			Satellite data reveal how Sudd wetland dynamics are linked with globally-significant methane emissions	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Recent work has highlighted the large role of methane emissions from the Sudd wetland and surrounding ecosystems on the global atmospheric growth rate of methane since 2010. These emissions are driven by high rainfall over basin catchments linked with the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole. We reconstruct flood inundation for the Sudd wetland over a 38-year period at a spatial resolution of 30 m using a new satellite Earth Observation (EO) wetland mapping tool. We reveal considerable changes in the wet season extent of the wetland, including an increase >300% since 2019 compared to the median 1984-2022 extent. We report major increases in flood extent within grassland-dominated floodplains outside of the area currently defined Sudd wetland region. These year-to-year changes in wetland extent are corroborated with total water storage anomalies inferred from satellite data (Pearson correlation R = 0.92), Lake Victoria levels (R = 0.73), and anomalies in reported annual mean global methane growth rates since 2009 (R = 0.88). Our analysis shows that flood water inundation is dominated by inundated vegetation and aquatic vegetation, accounting for an average of 40% and 50% of total extent, respectively, compared to open water that accounted for just 9% of inundation in a typical year. This is consistent with recent studies that report wetland methane emissions are focused on areas with inundated vegetation. Our findings also support recent studies that highlight the significant role of the Sudd wetland in driving anomalously large global atmospheric annual growth rates, 2020-2022. By capturing high resolution information on inundated vegetation, our EO wetland mapping tool has significant potential for improved wetland emission estimates of methane. Vascular plants common in the Sudd wetland, e.g. macrophytes including Phragmites Australis and Cyperus Papyrus, seem to play a key role in methane emissions and we recommend they should be the focus of future research.

Study focus: The long-term water level and storage variations of the upper Brahmaputra River (UBR) are not yet clear due to the low accessibility of gauged data in high-altitude and harsh environments. The main objective of this study is to facilitate investigations of long-term river water level and storage variations over the UBR. Here we developed a hypsometric method to reconstruct temporally resolved long-term river water level observations based on remote sensing-derived accumulative water inundation area information and short-term altimetric water level data at 24 virtual stations (VSs) of the UBR. We further analyzed the intra-annual and inter annual variations of the water level (storage) changes of the studied river reaches. New hydrological insights: The results reveal that the reconstructed water levels of the UBR are quite consistent with the water levels from the Hydroweb with an average R-2 of 0.79 and the reconstructed water levels are generally consistent with the variation of the gauged runoff. The ascending amplitudes of the annual water level cycle of VSs were observed from upstream to downstream of the UBR, varying from 0.58 m to 6.92 m. Additionally, we find that the seasonal change in river water storage approximately accounted for one-tenth of the net mass seasonal amplitude of the UBR basin, as revealed from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data.					; Ke, Linghong/NVM-2414-2025; Xu, Jiahui/IRY-9313-2023; Liu, Kai/HWQ-3608-2023	Ke, Linghong/0000-0001-9374-943X; Liu, Kai/0000-0002-5500-0644														2214-5818				APR	2022	40								101020	10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101020		FEB 2022											WOS:000783262500003

Effects of reservoir stratification and watershed hydrology on manganese and iron in a dam-regulated river	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The presence of metals, including manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe), adversely impacts water quality. In seasonally stratified reservoirs, Mn and Fe can accumulate in the water column due to reducing conditions in sediments and be released to downstream rivers through dam discharge. In addition to reservoir stratification influences, the release of metals downstream is influenced by hydrologic conditions in the river. We examined the seasonal and spatial variability of Mn and Fe concentrations in a eutrophic, hydropower reservoir and the downstream river over a two-year period. Overall, we found that reservoir stratification was a strong predictor of tailrace Mn and Fe concentrations but that tailrace Fe concentrations were also influenced by dam discharge. Downgradient of the tailrace, river discharge and suspended sediment were the dominant predictors of both Mn and Fe concentrations. Using our data, we develop a conceptual model of seasonal and hydrologic drivers of metal concentrations. The model can be modified for other systems aiding drinking water utilities and other water users in forecasting under what seasonal and hydrologic conditions that Mn and Fe concentrations in river systems are likely to be elevated.

Sequential extraction of different forms of phosphorus in the surface sediments of Chilika Lake	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												Sequential chemical extractions were used to study the spatial and temporal distribution of different forms of phosphorus (P) in the surface sediments of Chilika, the largest brackish water lake in Indian subcontinent. Sediments were analyzed for different forms of phosphorus along with some sedimentary parameters such as sand, mud, and organic carbon. The lake sediments are found to be mostly sandy near outer channel, whereas other parts of the lake are muddy sand type. Among the inorganic phosphorous fractions, calciumbound P (Ca-P) emerged as the most dominant fraction contributing 55 and 37 % of the total phosphorous (TP) respectively in pre-and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. Contribution of loosely bound phosphorus (Lo-P) to the TP in lake system was the lowest (< 1 %) in both the seasons. TP concentration of the lake sediment ranged from 291.9 to 1653.4 mg/kg with an average of 1047.71 mg/kg in premonsoon and 243.97-2150.55 mg/kg with an average of 1100.81 mg/kg in post-monsoon seasons. The bioavailable fraction contributes 1.4-26.7 % with average of 23.8 % in pre-monsoon whereas it contributes 32.1-34.32 % with an average of 35.72 % of TP in post-monsoon. The order of abundance of the major forms of P in the surface sediments of Chilika Lake was as follows: Lo-P<Al-P<Fe-P<O-P<CaP for both the seasons. Correlation matrix and factor analysis were used for result interpretation.					; barik, Saroja/F-7652-2019; BRAMHA, SATYANARAYAN/AAB-9771-2021	Bramha, Satyanarayan/0000-0002-8160-8530; Mohanty, Ajit/0000-0002-0333-0588													1866-7511	1866-7538				FEB	2016	9	2							135	10.1007/s12517-015-2217-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12517-015-2217-5													WOS:000371380500053

Stable-isotope (H, O, and Si) evidence for seasonal variations in hydrology and Si cycling from modern waters in the Nile Basin: implications for interpreting the Quaternary record	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Seasonal variations in hydrology and Si cycling in the Nile Basin were investigated using stable-isotope (H, O, and Si) compositions and dissolved Si (DSi) concentrations of surface waters, as a basis for interpreting lacustrine diatom sequences. delta O-18 ranged from -4.7 to +8.0 parts per thousand in the wet season and +0.6 to +8.8 parts per thousand. in the dry season (through 2009-2011). Higher delta O-18 values during the dry season reflected increased evapotranspiration and open water evaporation under conditions of lower humidity. Progressive downstream enrichment in the heavy isotope O-18 also occurred in response to cumulative evaporative losses from open water bodies and swamps. delta Si-30 values of DSi ranged from +0.48 to +3.45 parts per thousand. during the wet season and +1.54 to +4.66 parts per thousand during the dry season, increasing the previously reported global upper limit for delta Si-30 values in natural waters by 1 parts per thousand. Si-isotope fractionation was most intense during the thy season when demand for DSi by aquatic ecosystems exceeded supply. Progressive downstream enrichment in the heavy isotope Si-30, coupled with decreasing DSi concentrations, represented cumulative Si uptake by diatoms, macrophytes and other Si-accumulating aquatic organisms. The pronounced seasonal variations in DSi concentrations and Si-isotope compositions in the River Nile suggest that its DSi flux to the ocean may have varied significantly on a glacial/interglacial time scale, with important consequences for the marine Si budget and consequently the global C cycle. Anthropogenic impacts were evident in both the water- and Si-isotope datasets, especially during the dry season and along the Main Nile, where water management is most intensive.

J	Terry, J; Davies, JM; Lindenschmidt, KE				Terry, Julie; Davies, John-Mark; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich			Buffalo Pound Lake-Modelling Water Resource Management Scenarios of a Large Multi-Purpose Prairie Reservoir	WATER												Water quality models are an emerging tool in water management to understand and inform decisions related to eutrophication. This study tested flow scenario effects on the water quality of Buffalo Pound Lake-a eutrophic reservoir supplying water for approximately 25% of Saskatchewan's population. The model CE-QUAL-W2 was applied to assess the impact of inter-basin water diversion after the impounded lake received high inflows from local runoff. Three water diversion scenarios were tested: continuous flow, immediate release after nutrient loading increased, and a timed release initiated when water levels returned to normal operating range. Each scenario was tested at three different transfer flow rates. The transfers had a dilution effect but did not affect the timing of the nutrient peaks in the upstream portion of the lake. In the lake's downstream section, nutrients peaked at similar concentrations as the base model, but peaks arrived earlier in the season and attenuated rapidly. Results showed greater variation among scenarios in wet years compared to dry years. Dependent on the timing and quantity of water transferred, some but not all water quality parameters are predicted to improve along with the water diversion flows over the period tested. The results suggest that it is optimal to transfer water while local watershed runoff is minimal.

J	Zhang, X; Wang, KC; Kirillin, G				Zhang, Xin; Wang, Kaicun; Kirillin, Georgiy			An Automatic Method to Detect Lake Ice Phenology Using MODIS Daily Temperature Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												Lake ice phenology is a climate-sensitive indicator. However, ground-based monitoring suffers from the limitations of human vision and the difficulty of its implementation in harsh environments. Remote sensing provides great potential to detect lake ice phenology. In this study, a new automated method was developed to extract lake ice phenology parameters by capturing the temporal pattern of the transitional water/ice phase using a parameterized time function. The method is based on Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily temperature products, which have unique potential for monitoring lake ice cover as a result of providing four observations per day at 1 km spatial resolution from 2002 to 2016. Three seasonally ice-covered lakes with different characteristics in different climate regions were selected to test the method during the period of 2002-2016. The temporal pattern of water/ice transition phase was determined on the basis of unfrozen water cover fraction extracted from the MODIS daily temperature data, and was compared with the MODIS snow and reflectance products and Landsat images. A good agreement with an R-2 of above 0.8 was found when compared with the MODIS snow product. The annual variation of extracted ice phenology dates showed good consistency with the MODIS reflectance and AMSR-E/2 products. The approach was then applied to nine seasonally ice-covered lakes in northern China from 2002 to 2016. The strongest tendency towards a later freeze-up start date was revealed in Lake Qinghai (6.31 days/10 yr) among the lakes in Tibetan plateau, and the break-up start and end dates rapidly shifted towards earlier dates in Lake Hulun (-3.73 days/10 yr; -5.02 days/10 yr). The method is suitable for estimating and monitoring ice phenology on different types of lakes over large scales and has a strong potential to provide valuable information on the responses of ice processes to climate change.					; Wang, Kaicun/F-7813-2012; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010	, xin/0000-0001-6789-1926; Wang, Kaicun/0000-0002-7414-5400; Kirillin, Georgiy/0000-0001-7337-3586														2072-4292				JUL	2021	13	14							2711	10.3390/rs13142711	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13142711													WOS:000676951300001

Vegetation and hydrogeomorphic features of a large lowland river: NDVI patterns summarizing fluvial dynamics and supporting interpretations of ecological patterns	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												The interactions among hydrogeomorphic features of large lowland rivers regulate the spatio-temporal fluvial dynamics and influence the occurrence and understanding of the ecological patterns in these systems. We studied the hydrogeomorphic features that explain the fluvial dynamics of the Parana River floodplain and investigated the usefulness of NDVI patterns in summarizing these dynamics. Information layers related to elevation, drainage network, geomorphic units, runoff dynamics, and NDVI patterns of the study area were generated from multi-source remote sensing data and fieldwork measurements. All these layers were integrated and analysed in a GIS environment, and the statistical association among them was corroborated. In our study area, the interaction among hydrogeomorphic features determined a centrifugal flooding pattern through which inundation occurs when water from remote courses, fluvial lakes, and secondary tributaries reaches the main channel. The areas closest to the main channel are flooded only when it overflows. Five NDVI patterns statistically different in terms of their means and standard deviations were identified and characterized. These NDVI patterns were significantly associated with elevation, geomorphic units, and runoff dynamics, highlighting their usefulness to characterize the fluvial dynamics and support understanding of the ecological patterns.

The highest particulate-metal concentrations were found in low-salinity regions of all the estuaries, in the wet season (e.g. in the Terekhol River, the averages in ppm were Co: 53, Ni: 197, Cu: 208, Zn: 212 and Pb: 65) compared to the dry season averages (Co: 27, Ni: 76, Cu: 105, Zn: 164 and Pb: 13 ppm). The estuarine-mixing diagrams showed non-conservative behaviour in both seasons. The Sal River had the highest particulate-metal concentration (Co: 106, Ni: 300 and Zn: 323 ppm), suggesting an anthropogenic input. The enrichment factor for suspended matter was higher than bottom sediments with extremely high enrichment for Mn (>10). The Geo-accumulation index displayed unpolluted to polluted class for all metals. The study highlights the important role played by small estuaries in seasonal metal release and accumulation along the coastal region.																			0262-6667	2150-3435				SEP 10	2019	64	12					1519	1534		10.1080/02626667.2019.1655147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2019.1655147		AUG 2019											WOS:000484636300001

Heterosis in invasive F1 cattail hybrids (Typha x glauca)	AQUATIC BOTANY												Rapid evolution following interspecific hybridization can facilitate biological invasions. Around the Great Lakes in North America, the hybrid cattail Typha x glauca is dominating wetlands and displacing both parental species. We measured water depth and height of T. x glauca and its parental species (Typha angustifolia and Typha latifolia) throughout the growing season at a site near Lake Ontario that harbors both parental species plus hybrids. We found no evidence of niche partitioning by water depth, nor was there evidence that water depth was influencing plant height. At the beginning of the growing season, T. latifolia comprised the tallest plants, but this potential advantage was short-lived, and for most of the growing season, F-1 hybrids were taller than all or most other taxa (T. angustifolia, T. latifolia, and advanced-generation/backcrossed hybrids). Heterosis, inferred from height, is therefore evident in F-1 hybrids, but not in advanced-generation/backcrossed hybrids. Typha stands often achieve high densities, and the competitive advantage of superior height is likely contributing to the invasive success of T. x glauca F-1 hybrids in the Great Lakes region.

Multi-proxy analytical results constrained by high-resolution geochronological methods (Pb-210, radiocarbon, Cs-137) in concert with historical observations capture a record of Holocene paleoenvironmental variability. Our results suggest early and middle Holocene (>7022-2815 cal. [calibrated] yr B.P.) retreated glacial positions and seasonally open marine conditions with increased primary productivity. Climatic cooling increased sea ice coverage and decreased primary productivity during the Neoglacial (2815 to cal. 730 cal. yr B.P.). This climatic cooling culminated with glacial advance to maximum Holocene positions and expansion of a fjord-wide ice shelf during the Little Ice Age (LIA) (ca. 730-82 cal. yr B.P.). Seasonally open marine conditions were achieved and remnant ice shelves decayed within the context of recent rapid regional warming (82 cal. yr B.P. to present). Our findings agree with previously observed late Holocene cooling and glacial advance across the Antarctic Peninsula, suggesting that the LIA was a regionally significant event with few disparities in timing and magnitude. Comparison of the LIA Antarctic Peninsula record to the rest of the Southern Hemisphere demonstrates close synchronicity in the southeast Pacific and southern most Atlantic region but less coherence for the southwest Pacific and Indian Oceans. Comparisons with the Northern Hemisphere demonstrate that the LIA Antarctic Peninsula record was contemporaneous with pre-LIA cooling and sea ice expansion in the North Atlantic-Arctic, suggesting a global reach for these events.					; Christ, Andrew/AAA-7777-2020; King, Matt/B-4622-2008; De Batist, Marc/F-5722-2012	Brachfeld, Stefanie/0000-0003-4612-2866; SCAMBOS, Ted A./0000-0003-4268-6322; Christ, Andrew/0000-0003-0989-6491; Leventer, Amy/0000-0001-9401-0987; Yoo, Kyu-Cheul/0000-0002-6186-7535; Huber, Bruce/0000-0001-6413-1614; McCormick, Michael/0000-0002-7403-7186; King, Matt/0000-0001-5611-9498; De Batist, Marc/0000-0002-1625-2080; Pettit, Erin Christine/0000-0002-6765-9841													0016-7606	1943-2674				JAN-FEB	2015	127	1-2					297	315		10.1130/B31035.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B31035.1													WOS:000352212200018

Evaluation of fatty acid and antioxidant variation in a complex pasture system as compared to standard cattle feed in the Great Lakes region	FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS												As the demand for grass-fed ruminant products keeps increasing, more data are needed to assess the nutritional value of feedstuffs, especially pastures. In addition, global climate change adds another challenge to the management of grasslands with projections of changing temperature and precipitation patterns. Consequently, the variations in bioactive compounds such as fatty acids and antioxidants in feeds will be harder to predict. Therefore, it is critical to report region and time-specific results of the nutritional value of feeds intended for ruminant nutrition. The objectives of this study were to compare the antioxidant and fatty acid content of commonly used feedstuffs including a complex pasture mixture from the Great Lakes Region and a traditional grain-based diet, and to assess the variations of these bioactive compounds in the pasture over the course of two grazing seasons. Weather parameters including temperature and rainfall were recorded for the length of the study. Feed samples were collected between June and September 2019 and 2020 and analyzed for nutrient composition, chlorophyll A and B, carotenoids, and total phenols. Fatty acids were analyzed by GC-MS. Correlations were reported to analyze the relationship between individual plant species, antioxidants, and fatty acids. We observed higher antioxidant parameters in the pasture compared to the grain diet. Total polyunsaturated fatty acids were higher in the pasture including alpha-linolenic acid while the grain diet was higher in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids including linoleic acid. The n-6:n-3 ratio was more beneficial in the pasture and was 50-90 times higher in the grain diet. Variations in the fatty acid profile of the pasture were observed and varied between 2019 and 2020. Plant growth cycles, climatic conditions, and grazing methods were hypothesized to cause these changes. Altogether, this study increased our knowledge about the nutritional value of feedstuffs and will help ranchers and researchers to better understand the variations of bioactive content based on region, season, and climatic conditions.

The results of these models can be very different when parameterised to different species of host snail, which have varying temperature preferences. Currently, the experimental data needed by these models are available for only a few species of snail. The choice of density-dependent functions can also affect model results, but the effects of increasing densities on Biomphalaria populations have only previously been investigated in artificial aquariums. Methods: Laboratory experiments were conducted to estimate Biomphalaria sudanica mortality, fecundity and growth rates at ten different constant water temperatures, ranging from 13-32 degrees C. Snail cages were used to determine the effects of snail densities on B. sudanica and B. stanleyi mortality and fecundity rates in semi-natural conditions in Lake Albert. Results: B. sudanica survival and fecundity were highest at 20 degrees C and 22 degrees C respectively. Growth in shell diameter was estimated to be highest at 23 degrees C in small and medium sized snails, but the relationship between temperature and growth was not clear. The fecundity of both B. sudanica and B. stanleyi decreased by 72-75% with a four-fold increase in population density. Increasing densities four-fold also doubled B. stanleyi mortality rates, but had no effect on the survival of B. sudanica. Conclusions: The optimum temperature for fecundity was lower for B. sudanica than for previously studied species of Biomphalaria. In contrast to other Biomphalaria species, B. sudanica have a distinct peak temperature for survival, as opposed to a plateau of highly suitable temperatures. For both B. stanleyi and B. sudanica, fecundity decreased with increasing population densities. This means that snail populations may experience large fluctuations in numbers, even in the absence of any external factors such as seasonal temperature changes. Survival also decreased with increasing density for B. stanleyi, in contrast to B. sudanica and other studied Biomphalaria species where only fecundity has been shown to decrease.					; McCreesh, Nicky/C-1709-2013; Booth, Mark/D-2266-2011	Arinaitwe, Moses/0000-0001-6340-465X; Booth, Mark/0000-0002-5507-888X; McCreesh, Nicky/0000-0003-1409-8531													1756-3305					NOV 12	2014	7								503	10.1186/s13071-014-0503-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-014-0503-9								25388819					WOS:000348550000002

Observed meltwater-induced flexure and fracture at a doline on George VI Ice Shelf, Antarctica	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations and ground-based timelapse photography obtained over the record-high 2019/2020 melt season are combined to characterise the flexure and fracture behaviour of a previously formed doline on George VI Ice Shelf, Antarctica. The GNSS timeseries shows a downward vertical displacement of the doline centre with respect to the doline rim of similar to 60 cm in response to loading from a central meltwater lake. The GNSS data also show a tens-of-days episode of rapid-onset, exponentially decaying horizontal displacement, where the horizontal distance between the doline rim and its centre increases by similar to 70 cm. We interpret this event as the initiation and/or widening of a fracture, aided by stress perturbations associated with meltwater loading in the doline basin. Viscous flexure modelling indicates that the meltwater loading generates tensile surface stresses exceeding 75 kPa. This, together with our timelapse photos of circular fractures around the doline, suggests the first such documentation of meltwater-loading-induced 'ring fracture' formation on an ice shelf, equivalent to the fracture type proposed as part of the chain-reaction lake drainage process involved in the 2002 breakup of the Larsen B Ice Shelf.					; Dell, Rebecca/MXM-0655-2025; Banwell, Alison/W-8180-2018	Willis, Ian/0000-0002-0750-7088; Stevens, Laura A./0000-0003-0480-8018; MacAyeal, Douglas/0000-0003-0647-6176; Banwell, Alison/0000-0001-9545-829X; Dell, Rebecca/0000-0001-6617-3906													0022-1430	1727-5652				MAY 3	2024	70									10.1017/jog.2024.31	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2024.31		MAY 2024											WOS:001217317000001

Interannual variability of snowmelt in the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains, United States: Examples from two alpine watersheds	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The distribution of snow and the energy flux components of snowmelt are intrinsic characteristics of the alpine water cycle controlling the location of source waters and the effect of climate on streamflow. Interannual variability of these characteristics is relevant to the effect of climate change on alpine hydrology. Our objective is to characterize the interannual variability in the spatial distribution of snow and energy fluxes of snowmelt in watersheds of a maritime setting, Tokopah Basin (TOK) in California's southern Sierra Nevada, and a continental setting, Green Lake 4 Valley (GLV4) in Colorado's Front Range, using a 12 year database (1996-2007) of hydrometeorological observations and satellite-derived snow cover. Snowpacks observed in GLV4 exhibit substantially greater spatial variability than in TOK (0.75 versus 0.28 spatial coefficient of variation). In addition, modeling results indicate that the net turbulent energy flux contribution to snowmelt in GLV4 is, on average, 3 times greater in magnitude (mean 29% versus 10%) and interannual variability (standard deviation 17% versus 6%) than in TOK. These energy flux values exhibit strong seasonality, increasing as the melt season progresses to times later in the year (R-2 = 0.54-0.77). This seasonality of energy flux appears to be associated with snowmelt rates that generally increase with onset date of melt (0.02 cm d(-2)). This seasonality in snowmelt rate, coupled to differences in hydrogeology, may account for the observed differences in correspondence between the timing of snowmelt and timing of streamflow in these watersheds.

J	Gill, D; Rowe, M; Joshi, SJ				Gill, Devin; Rowe, Mark; Joshi, Sonia Joseph			Fishing in greener waters: Understanding the impact of harmful algal blooms on Lake Erie anglers and the potential for adoption of a forecast model	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Harmful algal blooms (HABs) pose public health risks worldwide, because of the toxins that they can produce. Researchers have explored the impact of HABs on local economies, but know relatively little about the decision making that informs these behaviors that lead to financial losses. Understanding the factors that inform this decision-making is critical to developing mitigative solutions. This study seeks to understand how HABs in Western Lake Erie affect angler decision-making, before evaluating a possible decision-support tool a harmful algal bloom forecast known as the Experimental Lake Erie HAB Tracker. The HAB Tracker provides a nowcast and five-day forecast of the spatial distribution and transport of Microcystis, the predominant species of harmful algae in Western Lake Erie. Data collected using focus groups and surveys were coded to identify key themes that influence angler decision-making. The theory of the diffusion of innovations provides an analytical framework to evaluate the potential for widespread adoption of the HAB forecast among Lake Erie anglers. Analysis of emerging themes revealed that Lake Erie anglers face three key decision-points when fishing in HABs: whether to fish, where to fish, and whether to eat the fish. Five primary variables factored into angler decisions on where and whether to fish including 1) perceptions of HAB aesthetics, 2) perceptions of the impact of HABs on angler health, 3) perceptions of the impact of HABs on fish, 4) communication methods, 5) perceptions of HABs by customers of charter captains. Most participants in this study sought to avoid fishing in HABs primarily for aesthetic reasons. Recreational anglers are more likely than charter captains to adopt the HAS Tracker as a decision-support tool, because it is compatible with their information needs and provides a relative advantage over existing sources of information. Charter captains are less likely to adopt the HAB Tracker, because they rely on their existing knowledge and social network for HAB information. If researchers can reduce the complexity of forecast information while increasing its accessibility and reliability, then all anglers will be more likely to adopt a HAS forecast as a decision-support tool while fishing in Lake Erie during bloom season.					; Gill, Devin/HNC-5303-2023	Gill, Devin/0000-0001-5062-7969; Rowe, Mark/0000-0002-0852-3346													0301-4797	1095-8630				DEC 1	2018	227						248	255		10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.08.074	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.08.074								30199720					WOS:000447570400025

Effects of water pH on the uptake and elimination of the piscicide, 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM), by larval sea lamprey	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY C-TOXICOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY												Invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinas) populations in the Great Lakes are controlled by applying the piscicide, 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM), to infested streams with larval sea lamprey (ammocoetes). While treatment mortality is > 90%, surviving lamprey, called residuals, can undermine control efforts. A key determinant of TFM effectiveness is water pH, which can fluctuate daily and seasonally in surface waters. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the influence of pH on the uptake, elimination, and accumulation of TFM by larval sea lamprey using radio-labeled TFM (C-14-TFM), when exposed to a nominal concentration of 4.6 mg TFM L-1 or 7.6 mg TFM L-1, 3 h or 1 h, respectively. TFM uptake rates were approximately 5.5-fold greater at low pH (6.86) compared to the high pH (8.78), most likely due to the unionized, lipophilic form of TFM existing in greater amounts at a lower pH. In contrast, elimination rates following the injection of 85 nmol TFM g(-1) body mass were 1.7-1.8 fold greater at pH 8.96 than at pH 6.43 during 2-4 h of depuration in TFM-free water. Greater initial excretion rates at pH 8.96 were presumably due to predicted increases in outward concentration gradients of un-ionized TFM. The present findings suggest that TFM is mainly taken-up in its unionized form, more lipophilic form, but there is also significant uptake of the ionized form of TFM via an unknown mechanism.

J	Li, XZ; Liu, WG				Li, Xiangzhong; Liu, Weiguo			Lake evolution and hydroclimate variation at Lake Qinghai (China) over the past 32 ka inferred from ostracods and their stable isotope composition	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We used ostracod species assemblages and their delta O-18 values in a 32-m sediment core from Lake Qinghai, China, along with information from cores collected at other sites in the lake, to infer lake evolution and hydroclimate changes since the last glacial. Dominant ostracod species Ilyocypris bradyi and its low delta O-18 values showed that Lake Qinghai was small in size or even consisted of several playa lakes, and the 1F core site could have even been in a wetland setting, under cold and dry climate conditions before 15.0 ka. Presence of Limnocythere inopinata with low delta O-18 values, and absence of I. bradyi after 15.0 ka, indicate the lake area increased or that the playas merged. The decrease or disappearance of ostracods with high delta O-18 values showed that the lake shrunk under dry climate from 12.0 to 11.6 ka. After 11.6 ka, hydroclimate shifts inferred from ostracod species changes (Eucypris mareotica and L. inopinata) and their delta O-18 values were as follows: (1) 11.6-7.4 kalarger, but still small lake area with greater moisture availability under primarily dry climate conditions, (2) 7.4 to 3.2 ka-increasing lake level under a warmer and wetter climate, and (3) 3.2 ka to present-stable, large, brackish lake. The low ratio of lake water volume to runoff, and close proximity of the core site to freshwater input from the river mouth would have resulted in relatively lower ostracod delta O-18 values when Lake Qinghai was small in area during the interval from 32.0 to 15.0 ka. Lower ostracod delta O-18 values during interstadials and throughout the entire Last Glacial Maximum and early deglacial (ca. 24.0-16.0 ka) were caused by a greater contribution of seasonal meltwater from ice or snow and low incoming precipitation delta O-18 values related to cold climate conditions in the region at that time.

Lagrangian Detection of Moisture Sources for the Southern Patagonia Icefield (1979-2017)	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												The origin of moisture for the Southern Patagonia Icefield and the transport of moisture toward it are not yet fully understood. These quantities have a large impact on the stable isotope composition of the icefield, adjacent lakes, and nearby vegetation, and is hard to quantify fromobservations. Clearly identified moisture sources help to interpret anomalies in the stable isotope compositions and contribute to paleoclimatological records from the icefield and the close surrounding. This study detects the moisture sources of the icefield with a Lagrangian moisture source method. The kinematic 18-day backward trajectory calculations use reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA-Interim) from January 1979 to January 2017. The dominant moisture sources are found in the South Pacific Ocean from 80 to 160 degrees W and 30 to 60 degrees S. A persistent anticyclone in the subtropics and advection of moist air by the prevailing westerlies are the principal flow patterns. Most of the moisture travels less than 10 days to reach the icefield. The majority of the trajectories originate from above the planetary boundary layer but enter the Pacific boundary layer to reach the maximum moisture uptake 2 days before arrival. During the last day trajectories rise as they encounter topography. The location of the moisture sources are influenced by seasons, Antarctic Oscillation, El-Nino Southern Oscillation, and the amount of monthly precipitation, which can be explained by variations in the location and strength of the westerly wind belt."					sauter, tobias/HSD-8208-2023; Mayr, Georg/P-1680-2018	Sauter, Tobias/0000-0002-2232-8096; Langhamer, Lukas/0000-0002-5020-5966														2296-6463				NOV 30	2018	6								219	10.3389/feart.2018.00219	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2018.00219													WOS:000454098800001

The ice lid limits the penetration of photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) to the sediment layer, since the ice attenuates up to 99% of incoming radiation. This suite of field and laboratory experiments demonstrates that PAR is an important control on primary production in cryoconite and cryolake ecosystems. Increased light intensity increased efficiency of primary production in controlled laboratory incubations of debris from the surface of Joyce Glacier, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. However, when light intensity was increased to levels near that received on the ice surface, without the protection of an ice lid, efficiency decreased and measurements of photophysiology showed that the communities suffered light stress. The communities are therefore well adapted to low light levels. Comparison with Arctic cryoconite communities, which are typically not covered by an ice lid for the majority of the ablation season, showed that these organisms were also stressed by high light, so they must employ strategies to protect against photodamage.					; Wadham, Jemma/G-3138-2014; Morgan, Alistair/KHT-1903-2024; Tranter, Martyn/E-3722-2010	Williamson, Christopher/0000-0002-8239-7368; Morgan, Alistair/0009-0009-8934-7388; Bagshaw, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8392-1750; Tranter, Martyn/0000-0003-2071-3094													0168-6496	1574-6941				JUN	2016	92	6							fiw076	10.1093/femsec/fiw076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsec/fiw076								27095815					WOS:000377473600010

Biomarker records of palaeoenvironmental variations in subtropical Southern Africa since the late Pleistocene: Evidences from a coastal peatland	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Southern Africa's unique global position has given rise to a dynamic climate influenced by large sea surface temperature gradients and seasonal fluctuations in the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone. Due to the semi-arid climate of the region, terrestrial palaeorecords are rare and our understanding of the long-term sensitivity of Southern African terrestrial ecosystems to climatic drivers is ambiguous. A 810 cm continuous peat core was extracted from the Mfabeni peatland with a C-14 basal age of c. 47 thousand years calibrated before present (kcal yr BP), positioning it as one of the oldest known sub-tropical coastal peatlands in Southern Africa. This peat core provides an opportunity to investigate palaeoenvironmental changes in subtropical Southern Africa since the late Pleistocene. Biomarker (n-alkane, n-alkanoic acid and n-alkanol) analysis, in conjunction with previously published bulk geochemical data, was employed to reconstruct organic matter (OM) sources, rates of OM remineralisation and peatland hydrology. Our results showed that the principal OM source into the peatland was emergent and terrestrial plants with exception of shallow lake conditions when submerged macrophytes dominated (c. 44.5-42.6, 29.7, 26.1-23.1, 16.7-7.1 and 2.2 kcal yr BP). n-Alkane proxies suggest that local plant assemblages were predominantly influenced by peatland hydrology. By incorporating temperature sensitive n-alkanoic acid and n-alkanol proxies, it was possible to disentangle the local temperature and precipitation changes. We report large variations in precipitation intensities, but subdued temperature fluctuations during the late Pleistocene. The Holocene period was characterised by overall elevated temperatures and precipitation compared to the preceding glacial period, interspersed with a millennial scale cooling event. A close link between the Mfabeni archive and adjacent Indian Ocean marine core records was observed, suggesting the regional ocean surface temperatures to be the dominant climate driver in this region since the late Pleistocene.

This study evaluated water quality characteristics immediately after dam construction in the target area with aquatic environmental values and important water quality parameters using classification schemes. The drastic formation of new lentic systems in the upstream dammed pool presented exponential algal growth and high potential availability of nitrogenous compounds depending on seasonally. The results of the river system analyzed with the water quality index focused on eutrophication (WQI(EUT)) and trophic state index of the Republic of Korea (TSIKO) provided adequate complementary information for specific water quality background within the extensive basin for future management. From the results, inflow and accumulation of anthropogenic organic matter as potential eutrophic factors in the upstream dammed pool were significant in the short-term period. However, the downstream lotic systems adjacent to the dam presented the temporary disturbance by physical factors. Furthermore, potential microbial factors were significant in the outlet in the basin depending on seasonally. These results using classification schemes can aid accessible decision-making for water quality management to prevent eutrophication in the dammed pool of upstream or best management practices (BMP) with microbial source tracking (MST) approaches in the downstream area.

This paper represents the ionic composition of discharge from Bilare Banga glacier by carrying out hydro-geochemical analysis of water samples of melting season of 2017. The pH and EC were measured on-site in field, and others parameters were examined in the laboratory. The abundance of the ions observed in meltwater has been arranged in decreasing order for cations as Ca2+>Mg2+>Na+>K+ and for anions as HCO3->SO42->Cl->NO3-, respectively. Analysis suggests that the meltwater is mostly dominated by Ca2+ and HCO3-. It has been observed that the ionic concentration HCO3- is dominant and Cl- is the least in the catchment. Piper plot analysis suggests that the chemical composition of the glacier discharge not only has natural origin but also has some anthropogenic input. Hydro-geochemical heterogeneity reflected the carbonate-dominated features (Ca2+-HCO3-) in the catchment. The carbonate weathering was found as the regulatory factor to control the chemistry of the glacial meltwater due to the high enrichment ratio of (Ca2++Mg2+) against TZ(+) and (Na++K+). In statistical approach, PCA analysis suggests that geogenic weathering dynamics in the catchment is associated with carbonate-dominant lithology.					; Bhardwaj, Anshuman/KZV-1140-2024; Kumari, Anupma/AAH-5870-2021; Singh, Shaktiman/AAC-9256-2020; kumar, Ramesh/AEM-2672-2022; SINGH, ATAR/ISU-7138-2023; Kumar, Rajesh/JCO-6049-2023	Singh, Shaktiman/0000-0003-4304-388X; Bhardwaj, Anshuman/0000-0002-2502-6384; SINGH, ATAR/0000-0002-0258-7429; Kumar, Ramesh/0000-0001-5093-5080													1895-6572	1895-7455				APR	2019	67	2					651	660		10.1007/s11600-019-00262-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11600-019-00262-w													WOS:000463780000017

Analyses including organic matter and carbonate content, granulometry, mineralogical composition, charcoal counting and high-resolution scanning of magnetic susceptibility and elemental geochemistry resulted in a detailed sedimentological and compositional characterization of lacustrine deposits in the three lake basins and on the two sills separating them. Thesepalaeolimnological data were supplemented with information on present-day sedimentation conditions based on seasonal sampling of settling particles and on measurement of physicochemical profiles through the water column. A new age model based on Pb-210, Cs-137 and C-14 dating captures the sediment chronology of this hydrochemically complex and geothermally fed lake. An extensive set of chronological tie points between the equivalent high-resolution proxy time series of the five sediment sequences allowed transfer of radiometric dates between the basins, enabling interbasin comparison of sedimentation dynamics through time. The resulting reconstruction demonstrates considerable moisture-balance variability through time, reflecting regional hydroclimate dynamics over the past 1300years. Between ca 690 and 950AD, the central and southern basins of Lake Bogoria were reduced to shallow and separated brine pools. In the former, occasional near-complete desiccation triggered massive trona precipitation. Between ca 950 and 1100AD, slightly higher water levels allowed the build-up of high pCO(2) leading to precipitation of nahcolite still under strongly evaporative conditions. Lake Bogoria experienced a pronounced highstand between ca 1100 and 1350AD, only to recede again afterwards. For a substantial part of the time between ca 1350 and 1800AD, the northern basin was probably disconnected from the united central and southern basins. Throughout the last two centuries, lake level has been relatively high compared to the rest of the past millennium. Evidence for increased terrestrial sediment supply in recent decades, due to anthropogenic soil erosion in the wider Bogoria catchment, is a reason for concern about possible adverse impacts on the unique ecosystem of Lake Bogoria.

Observations on sandbar behaviour along a man-made curved coast	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Sandbars, submerged ridges of sand parallel to the shoreline, affect surfzone circulation, beach topography and beach width. Under time-varying wave forcing, sandbars may migrate onshore and offshore, referred to as two-dimensional (2D) behaviour, and vary in planshape from alongshore uniform ridges to alongshore non-uniform ridges through the growth and decay of three-dimensional (3D) patterns, referred to as 3D behaviour. Although 2D and 3D sandbar behaviour is reasonably well understood along straight coasts, this is not the case for curved coasts, where the curvature can invoke spatial variability in wave forcing. Here, we analyse sandbar behaviour along the approximate to 3000 m man-made curved coastline of the Sand Engine, Netherlands, and determine the wave conditions governing this behaviour. 2D and 3D behaviour was quantified within a box north and west of the Sand Engine's tip, respectively, using a 2.4-year dataset of daily low-tide video images and a sparser bathymetric dataset. The northern and western sides behaved similarly in terms of 2D behaviour, with seasonal onshore and offshore migration, resulting in a stable position on inter-annual timescales. However, both sandbar geometry and 3D behaviour differed substantially between both sides. The geometric differences (bar shape, bar crest depth and wavelength of 3D patterns) are consistent with computed alongshore differences in breaker height due to refraction. The differences in the timing in growth, decay and morphological coupling of 3D patterns in the sandbar and shoreline are likely related to differences in the local wave angle, imposed by the curved coast. Similar dependency of bar behaviour on local wave height and angle may be expected elsewhere along curved coasts, e.g. shoreline sandwaves, cuspate forelands or embayed beaches.

Headwater Mires Constitute a Major Source of Nitrogen (N) to Surface Waters in the Boreal Landscape	ECOSYSTEMS												Nutrient exports from soils have important implications for long-term patterns of nutrient limitation on land and resource delivery to aquatic environments. While plant-soil systems are notably efficient at retaining limiting nutrients, spatial and temporal mismatches in resource supply and demand may create opportunities for hydrologic losses to occur. Spatial mismatches may be particularly important in peat-forming landscapes, where the development of a two-layer vertical structure can isolate plant communities on the surface from resource pools that accumulate at depth. Our objectives were to test this idea in northern Sweden, where nitrogen (N) limitation of terrestrial plants is widespread, and where peat-forming, mire ecosystems are dominant features of the landscape. We quantified vertical patterns of N chemistry in a minerogenic mire, estimated the seasonal and annual hydrologic export of organic and inorganic N from this system, and evaluated the broader influence of mire cover on N chemistry across a stream network. Relatively high concentrations of ammonium (up to 2 mg l(-1)) were observed in groundwater several meters below the peat surface, and N was routed to the outlet stream along deep, preferential flowpaths. Areal estimates of inorganic N export from the mire were several times greater than from an adjacent, forested catchment, with markedly higher loss rates during the growing season, when plant N demand is ostensibly greatest. At broader scales, mire cover was positively correlated with long-term concentrations of inorganic and organic N in streams across the drainage network. This study provides an example of how mire formation and peat accumulation can create broad-scale heterogeneity in nutrient supply and demand across boreal landscapes. This mismatch allows for hydrologic losses of reactive N that are independent of annual plant demand and potentially important to receiving lakes and streams.

The study sought to analyse the wetland fragmentation and loss at the site. The specific objectives of the study were to assess the changes in the wetland classes, analyse the landscape configuration of the wetland classes and finally examine the composition of the wetland landscape. The wetland classes were categorised by employing the Ramsar classification system for wetland types. The validation results were established to be satisfactory after employing standardised accuracy assessment measures and comparison with ground truth data. Eight (8) landscape metrics were selected based on the literature and the potential of each metric to best describe wetland fragmentation. Interview surveys were used to complement data produced by Geographic Information System (GIS) application. During the 25-year period, lagoon/lake and inter-tidal forested wetland experienced a positive change while seasonal/intermittent and permanent marshes experienced a negative change. Further analysis using landscape metrics revealed that the configuration of the wetland types, especially inter-tidal forested wetland, has been fragmented and their ecosystem composition has reduced considerably.

Bioaccumulation by plankton is the first step for HOCs to enter aquatic food webs. Trophic status is considered to dominate variations in bioaccumulation of HOCs in plankton in temperate and frigid deep oligotrophic waters. However, long-term driving factors for bioaccumulation of HOCs in planktonic food webs of subtropical shallow eutrophic waters have not been well investigated. China has the largest subtropical lake density in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to limited field data, long-term variations in the bioaccumulation of HOCs in these lakes are almost unknown. Here we take Lake Xuanwu as an example to investigate long-term variations in the bioaccumulation, and biomagnification of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) in planktonic food webs of subtropical shallow eutrophic lakes in China, and elucidate the driving factors. Our results indicate that temperature rather than nutrients dominates long-term dynamics of planktonic biomass in this lake. Precipitation significantly enhances the concentrations of the PAHs, and total suspended particles, and consequently affects the distribution of the PAHs in the water column. Biomass dilution induced by temperature dominates bioaccumulation of the PAHs by both phytoplankton and zooplankton (copepods and cladocerans). Biomagnification of the PAHs from phytoplankton to zooplankton is positively correlated with temperature. Our study suggests that temperature and precipitation drive long-term variations in the bioaccumulation of the PAHs in the planktonic food webs of this subtropical shallow eutrophic lake. Lake Xuanwu has a similar mean annual temperature, annual precipitation, sunshine duration, and nutrient levels as other subtropical shallow eutrophic lakes in China. This study may also help to understand the bioaccumulation of HOCs in planktonic food webs of other subtropical shallow eutrophic lakes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There is no information about occurrence and impact of Cryptosporidium and Giardia on the aquatic ecosystem. 61 surface water samples from 23 monitoring sites and 5 treated effluent samples were collected and analyzed. Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts were found, respectively, in 86.4% and 65.2% of a total of 66 water samples, with high concentrations in treated effluent. The mean percent recovery was 29.14% for oocysts and 34.86% for cysts. A seasonal pattern was observed, with positive samples for Cryptosporidium more frequent in flood period and positive samples for Giardia more frequent in impounding period. Counts of enterococci, fecal coliforms and total coliforms, and turbidity were significantly associated with Cryptosporidium concentration in backwater (water in a main river which is backed up by the Three Gorges Dam) areas of tributaries but not Giardia. High associations were also found between oocyst and cyst in backwater areas of tributaries and cities. The risks of infection and illness due to water consumption in four different exposure routes were estimated. The results showed that swimming in the TGR has the highest infection risk with 1.39 x 10(-)3 per time (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05 -600.3 x 10(-5)) for Cryptosporidiurn and 2.08 x 10(-4) per time (95% CI: 0.05-878.87 x 10(-6)) for Giardia, while directly drinking unboiled tap water treated with the conventional process has the highest morbidity with 524.98 per 100,000 population per year (95% CI: 10.35 -2040.26) for Cryptosporidium and 5.89 per 100,000 population per year (95% CI: 0.08-22.67) for Giardia. This study provides new useful information for drinking water plants, health care workers and managers to improve the safety of tap water and deduce the risk of surface water contamination in China.

J	Fu, Q; Zheng, BH; Zhao, XR; Wang, LJ; Liu, CM				Fu, Qing; Zheng, Binghui; Zhao, Xingru; Wang, Lijing; Liu, Changming			Ammonia pollution characteristics of centralized drinking water sources in China	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES												The characteristics of ammonia in drinking water sources in China were evaluated during 2005-2009. The spatial distribution and seasonal changes of ammonia in different types of drinking water sources of 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions and 4 municipalities were investigated. The levels of ammonia in drinking water sources follow the order of river > lake/reservoir > groundwater. The levels of ammonia concentration in river sources gradually decreased from 2005 to 2008, while no obvious change was observed in the lakes/reservoirs and groundwater drinking water sources. The proportion of the type of drinking water sources is different in different regions. In river drinking water sources, the ammonia level was varied in different regions and changed seasonally. The highest value and wide range of annual ammonia was found in South East region, while the lowest value was found in Southwest region. In lake/reservoir drinking water sources, the ammonia levels were not varied obviously in different regions. In underground drinking water sources, the ammonia levels were varied obviously in different regions due to the geological permeability and the natural features of regions. In the drinking water sources with higher ammonia levels, there are enterprises and wastewater drainages in the protected areas of the drinking water sources.																			1001-0742	1878-7320					2012	24	10					1739	1743		10.1016/S1001-0742(11)61011-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1001-0742(11)61011-5								23520842					WOS:000310408700003
J	Stacke, T; Hagemann, S				Stacke, T.; Hagemann, S.			Development and evaluation of a global dynamical wetlands extent scheme	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												In this study we present the development of the dynamical wetland extent scheme (DWES) and evaluate its skill to represent the global wetland distribution. The DWES is a simple, global scale hydrological scheme that solves the water balance of wetlands and estimates their extent dynamically. The extent depends on the balance of water flows in the wetlands and the slope distribution within the grid cells. In contrast to most models, the DWES is not directly calibrated against wetland extent observations. Instead, wetland affected river discharge data are used to optimise global parameters of the model. The DWES is not a complete hydrological model by itself but implemented into the Max Planck Institute - Hydrology Model (MPI-HM). However, it can be transferred into other models as well. For present climate, the model evaluation reveals a good agreement for the spatial distribution of simulated wetlands compared to different observations on the global scale. The best results are achieved for the Northern Hemisphere where not only the wetland distribution pattern but also their extent is simulated reasonably well by the DWES. However, the wetland fraction in the tropical parts of South America and Central Africa is strongly overestimated. The simulated extent dynamics correlate well with monthly inundation variations obtained from satellites for most locations. Also, the simulated river discharge is affected by wetlands resulting in a delay and mitigation of peak flows. Compared to simulations without wetlands, we find locally increased evaporation and decreased river flow into the oceans due to the implemented wetland processes. In summary, the evaluation demonstrates the DWES' ability to simulate the distribution of wetlands and their seasonal variations for most regions. Thus, the DWES can provide hydrological boundary conditions for wetland related studies. In future applications, the DWES may be implemented into an Earth system model to study feedbacks between wetlands and climate.

J	de Fleury, M; Kergoat, L; Grippa, M				de Fleury, Mathilde; Kergoat, Laurent; Grippa, Manuela			Hydrological regime of Sahelian small waterbodies from combined Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter data	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												In the Sahelian semi-arid region, water resources, especially small waterbodies such as ponds, small lakes, and reservoirs in rural areas are of vital importance. However, because of their high number and the scarce in situ monitoring networks, these resources and their spatiotemporal variability are not well known at the regional scale. This study investigates the hydrological regime of 37 small waterbodies, located in Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso in central Sahel. We propose a method based on remote sensing data only, which consists of combining water height data from Sentinel3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter (SRAL) with water area data obtained with the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) to create a dense water height time series. Water height variations are then compared to the evaporation estimated by the Penman-Monteith method, using ERA5 reanalysis by the European Centre for Medium-RangeWeather Forecasts (ECMWF) to infer water regimes during the dry season. Three main regimes stand out, namely a net water loss, mainly resulting from anthropogenic withdrawals, a net water supply occurring after the end of the rainy season through river network or water table exchange, and a balanced behaviour, where water losses during the dry season closely correspond to evaporation rates. Spatial patterns have been identified; in central Burkina Faso, most of the reservoirs show a net dry season water loss, which is explained by frequent irrigation, while reservoirs in northern Burkina Faso, generally show little water loss, indicating that water withdrawal is not significant in this area. Lakes located in the Inner Niger Delta in Mali and connected to the Niger River network generally show an important water supply, particularly at the beginning of the dry season. Lakes in Niger tend to show a weak signal toward water inflow that could be explained by exchange processes with the groundwater. These results show that satellite data are effective at estimating hydrological regimes and the anthropogenic impact on water resources at the large scale, including resources found in small waterbodies.						de Fleury, Mathilde/0000-0002-4593-9594													1027-5606	1607-7938				JUN 14	2023	27	11					2189	2204		10.5194/hess-27-2189-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2189-2023													WOS:001009283100001

Here, we carried out archeological investigation on the lake basin, and a total of 256 pieces of stone artifacts were collected from the surface of the DJCN 3-2-2 site on the northern shore terraces of the lake. In addition, AMS(14)C and OSL dating were performed on hearths and section (DJCN 3-2-2), respectively; meanwhile environmental proxies, including grain size, charcoal, magnetic susceptibility, fungal spore, and pollen, were analyzed. The results indicate that the AMS(14)C ages of the charcoal range between 5.4 and 5.0 cal. ka BP, consistent with OSL dating from the charcoal layers in the DJCN 3-2-2 section (5.5 ka BP). The functional analysis of the stone artifacts and dating results showed that the site was a seasonal, relative long-term, and central camp which was used for processing of stone artifacts, cutting and consuming food and the production of daily necessities. Charcoal, magnetic susceptibility, and fungal spores from the DJCN 3-2-2 section revealed that prehistoric human activities began at 5.8 ka BP and significantly intensified during the period of 5.6-5.5 ka BP and then gradually weakened. Pollen assemblages indicated that the vegetation was dominated by alpine steppe during the period of 5.8-5.0 ka BP, indicative of a relatively warmer and wetter climatic condition during this period. Taken together, we infer that under the impact of the Neolithic culture in lower altitude of upper Yellow River valley and Microlithic culture in the higher altitude inner Plateau, a Neolithic-Zongri culture had emerged in the transitional region between these two cultures during middle Holocene.

A comparison of the mission results with in situ water levels validated the accuracy of the ICESat-2 with R varying from 0.957 to 0.995, MAE 0.03 m-0.10 m and RMSE 0.04 m-0.13 m; however, larger bias occurred in GEDI results with R spanning from 0.560 to 0.952, MAE 0.31 m-0.38 m and RMSE 0.35 m-0.46 m. Before the lake levels were combined, GEDI bias correction was carried out. The correlation coefficients and annual change rate differences between the combined and the in situ data were 0.964 and 0.06 m/yr, 0.852 and 0.05 m/yr, 0.888 and 0.05 m/yr, and 0.899 and 0.02 m/yr for Lake Chaohu, Hongze, Gaoyou and Taihu, respectively. Except for individual months and seasonal differences caused by GEDI estimations, the general trend of monthly, seasonal, and annual dynamics of inland lake water levels captured by combined GEDI and ICESat-2 missions were consistent with measurements from hydrological stations. These encouraging results demonstrate that combining the two missions has great potential for frequent and accurate lake level monitoring and could be a valuable resource for the study of hydrological and climatic change.

J	Fenchel, T; Finlay, B				Fenchel, Tom; Finlay, Bland			Oxygen and the Spatial Structure of Microbial Communities	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												Oxygen has two faces. On one side it is the terminal electron acceptor of aerobic respiration - the most efficient engine of energy metabolism. On the other hand, oxygen is toxic because the reduction of molecular O-2 creates reactive oxygen species such as the superoxide anion, peroxide, and the hydroxyl radical. Probably most prokaryotes, and virtually all eukaryotes, depend on oxygen respiration, and we show that the ambiguous relation to oxygen is both an evolutionary force and a dominating factor driving functional interactions and the spatial structure of microbial communities.We focus on microbial communities that are specialised for life in concentration gradients of oxygen, where they acquire the full panoply of specific requirements from limited ranges of PO2 , which also support the spatial organisation of microbial communities. Marine and lake sediments provide examples of steep O-2 gradients, which arise because consumption or production of oxygen exceeds transport rates of molecular diffusion. Deep lakes undergo thermal stratification in warm waters, resulting in seasonal anaerobiosis below the thermocline, and lakes with a permanent pycnocline often have permanent anoxic deep water. The oxycline is here biologically similar to sediments, and it harbours similar microbial biota, the main difference being the spatial scale. In sediments, transport is dominated by molecular diffusion, and in the water column, turbulent mixing dominates vertical transport.Cell size determines the minimum requirement of aerobic organisms. For bacteria (and mitochondria), the half-saturation constant for oxygen uptake ranges within 0.05 - 0.1% atmospheric saturation; for the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii it is 0.2%, and for two ciliate species measuring around 150 mu m, it is 1-2 % atmospheric saturation. Protection against O-2 toxicity has an energetic cost that increases with increasing ambient O-2 tension. Oxygen sensing seems universal in aquatic organisms. Many aspects of oxygen sensing are incompletely understood, but the mechanisms seem to be evolutionarily conserved. A simple method of studying oxygen preference in microbes is to identify the preferred oxygen tension accumulating in O-2 gradients. Microorganisms cannot sense the direction of a chemical gradient directly, so they use other devices to orient themselves. Different mechanisms in different prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes are described. In O-2 gradients, many bacteria and protozoa are vertically distributed according to oxygen tension and they show a very limited range of preferred PO2. In some pigmented protists the required PO2 is contingent on light due to photochemically generated reactive oxygen species. In protists that harbour endosymbiotic phototrophs, orientation towards light is mediated through the oxygen production of their photosynthetic symbionts. Oxygen plays a similar role for the distribution of small metazoans (meiofauna) in sediments, but there is little experimental evidence for this. Thus the oxygenated sediments surrounding ventilated animal burrows provide a special habitat for metazoan meiofauna as well as unicellular organisms.

High-resolution modelling of the seasonal evolution of surface water storage on the Greenland Ice Sheet	CRYOSPHERE												Seasonal meltwater lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet form when surface runoff is temporarily trapped in surface topographic depressions. The development of such lakes affects both the surface energy balance and dynamics of the ice sheet. Although areal extents, depths and lifespan of lakes can be inferred from satellite imagery, such observational studies have a limited temporal resolution. Here, we adopt a modelling-based strategy to estimate the seasonal evolution of surface water storage for the similar to 3600 km(2) Paakitsoq region of W. Greenland. We use a high-resolution time-dependent surface mass balance model to calculate surface melt, a supraglacial water routing model to calculate lake filling and a prescribed water-volume-based threshold to predict rapid lake drainage events. This threshold assumes that drainage will occur through a fracture if V = F-a . H, where V is lake volume, H is the local ice thickness and F-a is the potential fracture area. The model shows good agreement between modelled lake locations and volumes and those observed in nine Landsat 7 ETM images from 2001, 2002 and 2005. We use the model to investigate the lake water volume required to trigger drainage, and the impact that varying this threshold volume has on the proportion of meltwater that is stored in surface lakes and enters the subglacial drainage system. Model performance is maximised with values of F-a between 4000 and 7500 m(2). For these thresholds, lakes transiently store < 40% of available meltwater at the beginning of the melt season, decreasing to similar to 5 to 10% by the middle of the melt season; over the course of a melt season, 40 to 50% of total meltwater production enters the subglacial drainage system through moulins at the bottom of drained lakes.					; Arnold, Neil/AAI-2272-2021; Banwell, Alison/W-8180-2018	Arnold, Neil/0000-0001-7538-3999; Willis, Ian/0000-0002-0750-7088; Banwell, Alison/0000-0001-9545-829X													1994-0416	1994-0424					2014	8	4					1149	1160		10.5194/tc-8-1149-2014	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-8-1149-2014													WOS:000341622700003

Thermal characterization of the active layer at the Limnopolar Lake CALM-S site on Byers Peninsula (Livingston Island), Antarctica	SOLID EARTH												The Limnopolar Lake site (A25), of the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring -South network (CALM-S), is located on Byers Peninsula, where the active layer thickness is monitored systematically (by mechanical probing during the thawing season and by temperature devices continuously since 2009). Air, surface, snow and ground temperature devices have been installed to monitor ground thermal behavior, which is presented and characterized here. We use the air and ground mean daily temperature values to define the following parameters: maximum, minimum and mean temperatures, the zero annual thermal amplitude, and the depth and position of the top of the permafrost table. The freezing and thawing seasons (defining their starting dates as well as their length) and the existence of zero curtain periods have also been established. We also derive apparent thermal diffusivity and plot thermograms to study the thermal behavior of the ground at different depths and seasons. After this complete thermal characterization of the active layer, we propose the potential existence of a permafrost table at approximately 130 cm in depth as well as a former transitional layer above it, and discuss the role of water in connection with the thermal behavior of the ground during the study period.

Evolution of supra-glacial lakes across the Greenland Ice Sheet	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We used 268 cloud-free Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images from 2003 and 2005-2007 to study the seasonal evolution of supra-glacial lakes in three different regions of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Lake area estimates were obtained by developing an automated classification method for their identification based on 250 m resolution MODIS surface reflectance observations. Widespread supra-glacial lake formation and drainage is observed across the ice sheet, with a 2-3 week delay in the evolution of total supra-glacial lake area in the northern areas compared to the south-west. The onset of lake growth varies by up to one month inter-annually, and lakes form and drain at progressively higher altitudes during the melt season. A positive correlation was found between the annual peak in total lake area and modelled annual runoff. High runoff and lake extent years are generally characterised by low accumulation and high melt season temperatures, and vice versa. Our results indicate that, in a future warmer climate [Meehl, G.

J	Castro-Parada, A; Sobrino, CM				Castro-Parada, Alberto; Sobrino, Castor Munoz			Variations in modern pollen distribution in sediments from nearby upland lakes: implications for the interpretation of paleoecological data	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												To determine whether modern pollen content in sediments from upland lake systems reflects the factual regional and extra-local vegetation composition, we analysed twenty-five samples focusing on aspects such as pond size and morphology, relative position in the catchment, local vegetation, canopy configuration and seasonality of the water table. The average pollen percentages of all sediment samples studied allows a fairly good reconstruction of the main vegetation units in the area, but major differences between the average samples obtained in each sed-imentary system, and also between some samples taken from the same system are found. The main factors explaining those differences are the size of the pond, its tree canopy and the seasonality of the water table, which strongly determines the Ericaceae and Pinus percentages. A high-resolution multiproxy palaeoecological record from a small upland lake is re-evaluated in light of the new experimental evidence, and it is concluded that the interpretation of the importance of heathland and pinewoods in the Late Glacial landscape using pollen data may be magnified by the transport of both pollen types through water flows and their accumulation in the basin. Furthermore, anomalous Pinus pollen peaks occur in dry periods when the water table remains low. The sediment can also be depleted of some high-buoyancy pollen types (tetrads and saccate) when the water level is high and effluents are active. These effects may also be important in fluvio-marine systems in which Ericaceae and Pinus pollen are often overrepresented.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In the Azores, eutrophication is a major concern, mainly in lakes where fertilizers and organic matter discharges have increased nutrient concentration. In this study, we focused on understanding the influence of environmental factors and lake characteristics on (i) cyanobacteria diversity and biomass and (ii) the presence of toxic strains and microcystin, saxitoxin, anatoxin-a, and cylindrospermopsin cyanotoxin-producing genes. Fifteen lakes from the Azores Archipelago were sampled seasonally, environmental variables were recorded in situ, cyanobacteria were analyzed with microscopic techniques, and cyanotoxin-producing genes were targeted through conventional PCR. Statistical analysis (DistLM) showed that lake typology-associated variables (lake's depth, area, and altitude) were the most explanatory variables of cyanobacteria biomass and cyanotoxin-producing genes presence, although trophic variables (chlorophyll a and total phosphorus) influence species distribution in each lake type. Our main results revealed higher cyanobacteria biomass/diversity, and higher toxicity risk in lakes located at lower altitudes, associated with deep anthropogenic pressures and eutrophication scenarios. These results emphasize the need for cyanobacteria blooms control measures, mainly by decreasing anthropogenic pressures surrounding these lakes, thus decreasing eutrophication. We also highlight the potential for microcystin, saxitoxin, and anatoxin-a production in these lakes, hence the necessity to implement continuous mitigation protocols to avoid environmental and public health toxicity events.

J	Rust, F; Bodmer, P; Del Giorgio, P				Rust, Felipe; Bodmer, Pascal; Del Giorgio, Paul			Modeling the spatial and temporal variability in surface water CO2 and CH4 concentrations in a newly created complex of boreal hydroelectric reservoirs	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Hydroelectric reservoirs emit carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, yet there is still much uncertainty concerning the magnitude and drivers of these greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This uncertainty is particularly large over the initial years after flooding and in complex cascade reservoir systems where studies are rare. We assessed the spatial and temporal patterns of CO2 and CH4 concentrations in the newly created La Romaine complex, which is composed of three consecutive reservoirs (RO1, RO2, RO3) along the La Romaine River. Dissolved CO2 and CH4 concentrations were intensively measured over three seasons for four years. Results show elevated CH4 and especially CO2 concentrations in surface waters of all three reservoirs upon flooding, with strong seasonality and high spatial heterogeneity within reservoirs. There was a strong seasonal dccoupling of surface water CO2 and CH4 concentrations. Contrary to expectations, surface water CO2 and CH4 concentrations were relatively stable over the initial years of flooding, with exception of the decrease in CO2 concentrations in the shallower RO1 reservoir. Further, individual reservoir characteristics, notably reservoir morphomctry and pre-flood land cover, together with climatic factors were the main drivers of CO2 and CH4 concentrations, and the reservoir position in the cascade played a minor role. Models differed for CO2 and CH4, and also between reservoirs highlighting the need to capture these specificities in reservoir functioning. We establish a modeling framework to effectively fill the spatial and temporal gaps that inevitably exist in the sampling coverage of large and heterogeneous reservoirs, which combined with appropriately modeled gas transfer velocities, will serve as a platform to derive robust estimates of diffusive fluxes. This modeling framework can be transposed to other reservoirs, and will contribute to more accurate and representative estimates of diffusive carbon emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs.

Future river flows and flood extent in the Upper Niger and Inner Niger Delta: GCM-related uncertainty using the CMIP5 ensemble	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL												A semi-distributed hydrological model of the Upper Niger and the Inner Niger Delta is used to investigate the RCP 4.5 scenario for 41 CMIP5 GCMs in the 2050s and 2080s. In percentage terms, the range of change in precipitation is around four times as large as for potential evapotranspiration, which increases for most GCMs over most sub-catchments. Almost equal numbers of subcatchment-GCM combinations experience positive and negative precipitation change. River discharge changes are equally uncertain. Inter-GCM range in mean discharge exceeds that of precipitation by three times in percentage terms. Declining seasonal flooding within the Inner Delta is dominant; 78 and 68% of GCMs project declines in October and November for the 2050s and 2080s, respectively. The 10- and 90-percentile changes in mean annual peak inundation range from -6136 km(2) (-43%) to + 987 km(2) (+7%) for the 2050s and -6176 km(2) (-43%) to +1165 km(2) (+8.2%) for the 2080s.

J	Zeybek, M				Zeybek, Melek			Macroinvertebrate-based biotic indices for evaluating the water quality of Kargi Stream (Antalya, Turkey)	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The aim of this study was to determine the water quality of Kargi Stream, Antalya, Turkey, in terms of physical and chemical parameters and biotic indices. For this purpose, macrozoobenthic invertebrates and water samples were taken from each of the selected seven stations seasonally. The Belgian Biotic Index, BMWP and ASPT indices, and species diversity indices were applied for determining the water quality by using the ASTERICS software program. With the identification of the collected organisms, a total of 126 taxa including 4 taxa from Gastropoda, 5 taxa from Oligochaeta, 1 taxon from Malacostraca, 84 taxa from Insecta, and 32 taxa from Arachnida were detected. Stations were clustered by using UPGMA, based on organisms. Station 7 in the estuarine zone was the most different one for the macrozoobenthic invertebrates. The lowest species diversity values were also found at this station. The water quality of Kargi Stream was unpolluted/slightly polluted. Considering the physical and chemical parameters, biotic indices revealed changes in the pollution load of the study area with some deviations. It is thought that the reason for these deviations was not taking into account the geomorphological and ecological characteristics of Turkey in the biotic indices used in the current study.																			1300-0179	1303-6114					2017	41	3					476	486		10.3906/zoo-1602-10	http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/zoo-1602-10													WOS:000402034800011
J	Hites, RA				Hites, Ronald A.			Statistical Approach for Assessing the Stockholm Convention's Effectiveness: Great Lakes Atmospheric Data	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The implementation of the Stockholm Convention (SC) in 2004 should become evident in decreases in environmental concentrations of various pollutants even in countries that not have ratified the SC. However, in some cases, there may be no decreases at all. This paper develops a statistical strategy for investigating time-series measurements such that the rate of change of a pollutant's concentrations at any time can be compared to those at an earlier or later time and thus determine the effectiveness of the SC at any location. The general approach is to modify a first-order regression to include a second order time term: ln(C-t)= a(0) + a(1) t + a(2) t(2), where C, is the concentration at time t. Thus, the rate constant at any time is k(t) = a(1) + 2 a(2) t. Given that the errors associated with a(1) and a(2) can be calculated, one can compare the rate constants at different times with statistical rigor to determine if the rates at which the concentrations are changing are significantly different. As examples of this approach, this paper uses vapor and particle phase atmospheric concentrations of several organic pollutants measured at six sites around the North American Great Lakes every 12 days since about 1992. After correcting for the population near the sampling sites, for seasonality, and for the different numbers of samples collected on the same date, up to 830 data were used in this second-order regression. In general, the loss rates of vapor phase chlorinated pesticides have slowed by about a factor of 2 between 1995 and 2015, which is not SC-like behavior. The exceptions are the endosulfans, the vapor and particle phase concentrations of which were both doubling in 1995 but were both decreasing in 2015, probably because of the greatly diminished use of this insecticide in the United States over the last 20-25 years. The loss rates of vapor phase polychlorinated biphenyls became more rapid between 1995 and 2015, which is SC-like behavior.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				AUG 6	2019	53	15					8585	8590		10.1021/acs.est.9b02190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.9b02190								31329422					WOS:000480370600013

Samples were taken under farm cages (study site) and reference (control) sites at different seasons and productive periods. Families associated with phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant, representing on average 50.7% of the total bacterial community. Flavobacteriaceae was the single family observed in all samples and also the most abundant. Bacterial diversity and richness indices (Chao1, Shannon and PD) at the study sites during productive periods showed a broader range of values than those measured in control or resting stage samples. Also, a very low number of shared families (2/54), compared with those taken at control (13/31) and resting stages (13/45), was observed. Bray-Curtis clustering of libraries resulted in two main clades, one mainly represented by samples of the study site and productive states, dominated by Sulfurovum with low values for bacterial diversity and richness indices and a community structure related to sulphidic sediments, while the other clades, mainly composed by control and resting samples, resulted dominated by Flavobacteriaceae and exhibited higher values of diversity and richness.

Here, the mechanisms influencing water situation via induced mixing were systematically explored using a combination of multi-water-environment assessment methods including trophic level index (TLI), water quality index (WQI), and minimum WQI (WQImin) based on long-term field data (i.e., non-operational and operational years of WLAs). The results showed that induced mixing after WLA deactivation improved the levels of eutrophication and water quality (into "light-eutrophic" and "good" status) with a decrease in TLI values (56.0-56.2) and increase in WQI (79.0-79.9) and WQImin (81.5-89.3) values, compared to mixing of the non-operational year (TLI: 69.6, WQI: 73.4, WQImin: 76.1). Induced mixing was launched by deactivating the WLAs in cooling seasons (i.e., in late September within a subtropical monsoon climate zone), which advanced and prolonged the periods of naturally complete mixing by 2-3 months. Water temperature (WT), Dissolved oxygen (DO), relative water column stability (RWCS) and inflow were primary drivers for the water situation succession in the study years. Induced mixing extended the well-oxygenated and mixed conditions (temperature difference <1.0 <degrees>C, DO > 8.5 mg/L, RWCS< 20) following artificial mixing to improve the water status from single index level (improvement of 18.8%-73.7% than mixing before the operational years) to integrated evaluation results by changing WT, DO, and RWCS. This study presents a successful case for energysaving pollution control using mixing systems.					; LI, Kai/JYO-4263-2024; wen, chengcheng/JHU-6859-2023	Wen, Chengcheng/0009-0001-9424-5118; Li, Kai/0000-0002-5505-7974													0301-4797	1095-8630				NOV 15	2022	322								116048	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.116048		SEP 2022						36067671					WOS:000858341100002

Pregnant women and infants as sentinel populations to monitor prevalence of malaria: results of pilot study in Lake Zone of Tanzania	MALARIA JOURNAL												Background: As malaria control interventions are scaled-up, rational approaches are needed for monitoring impact over time. One proposed approach includes monitoring the prevalence of malaria infection among pregnant women and children at the time of routine preventive health facility (HF) visits. This pilot explored the feasibility and utility of tracking the prevalence of malaria infection in pregnant women attending their first antenatal care (ANC) visit and infants presenting at 9-12 months of age for measles vaccination. Methods: Pregnant women attending first ANC and infants nine to 12 months old presenting for measles vaccination at a non-probability sample of 54 HFs in Tanzania's Lake Zone (Mara, Mwanza and Kagera Regions) were screened for malaria infection using a malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) from December 2012 to November 2013, regardless of symptoms. Participants who tested positive were treated for malaria per national guidelines. Data were collected monthly. Results: Overall 89.9 and 78.1 % of expected monthly reports on malaria infection prevalence were received for pregnant women and infants, respectively. Among 51,467 pregnant women and 35,155 infants attending routine preventive HF visits, 41.2 and 37.3 % were tested with RDT, respectively. Malaria infection prevalence was 12.8 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 11.3-14.3] among pregnant women and 11.0 % (95 % CI 9.5-12.5) among infants, and varied by month. There was good correlation of the prevalence of malaria among pregnant women and infants at the HF level (Spearman rho = 0.6; p < 0.001). This approach is estimated to cost $1.28 for every person tested, with the RDT accounting for 72 % of the cost. Conclusions: Malaria infection was common and well correlated among pregnant women and infants attending routine health services. Routine screening of these readily accessible populations may offer a practical strategy for continuously tracking malaria trends, particularly seasonal variation. Positivity rates among afebrile individuals presenting for routine care offer an advantage as they are unaffected by the prevalence of other causes of febrile illness, which could influence positivity rates among febrile patients presenting to outpatient clinics. The data presented here suggest that in addition to contributing to clinical management, ongoing screening of pregnant women could be used for routine surveillance and detection of hotspots.					; Colaco, Rajeev/LLL-6223-2024; Ngondi, Jeremiah/ADJ-1929-2022	Reithinger, Richard/0000-0001-5710-1556; Colaco, Rajeev/0000-0001-8516-9865; Ngondi, Jeremiah/0000-0003-4357-4816; 														1475-2875				JUL 29	2016	15								392	10.1186/s12936-016-1441-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12936-016-1441-0								27473039					WOS:000380656200001

In this region, >15,000 shallowlakes are likely to contribute an enormous quantity of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere, but the diversity of the biogeochemical scenarios and their variability in time and space is a major challenge to estimate the regional contribution. From 4 selected alkaline lakes, we compiled measurements of the physico-chemical characteristics ofwater and sediments, gas fluxes in floating chambers, and sedimentation rates to illustrate this diversity. Although these lakes have a similar chemical composition, the results confirm a difference between the black-water and green-water alkaline lakes, corresponding to distinct biogeochemical functioning. This difference does not appear to affect lake sedimentation rates, but is reflected in gas emissions. Black-water lakes are CO2 and CH4 sources, with fairly constant emissions throughout the seasons. Annual carbon dioxide and methane emissions approach 0.86 mol m(-2) y(-1) and 0.07 mol m(-2) y(-1), respectively, and no clear trend towards N2O capture or emissionwas observed. By contrast, green-water lakes are CO2 and N2O sinks but important CH4 sources with fluxes varying significantly throughout the seasons, depending on the magnitude of the phytoplankton bloom. The results highlight important daily and seasonal variations in gas fluxes, and in particular a hot moments for methane emissions, when the O-2(-) supersaturation is reached during the afternoon under extreme bloom and sunny weather conditions, provoking an abrupt O-2 purging of the lakes. Taking into account the seasonal variability, annual methane emissions are around 10.2 mol m(-2) y(-1), i. e., much higher than reported in previous studies for alkaline lakes in Nhecolandia. Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide consumption is estimated about 1.9 mol m(-2) y(-1) and 0.73 mmol m(-2) y(-1), respectively. However, these balances must be better constrained with systematic and targeted measurements throughout the seasons. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

J	Jackson, B; Nicholson, SE; Klotter, D				Jackson, Brian; Nicholson, Sharon E.; Klotter, Douglas			Mesoscale Convective Systems over Western Equatorial Africa and Their Relationship to Large-Scale Circulation	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												This study examines mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) over western equatorial Africa using data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. This region experiences some of the world's most intense thunderstorms and highest lightning frequency, but has low rainfall relative to other equatorial regions. The analyses of MCS activity include the frequency of occurrence, diurnal and annual cycles, and associated volumetric and convective rainfall. Also evaluated is the lightning activity associated with the MCSs. Emphasis is placed on the diurnal cycle and on the continental-scale motion fields in this region. The diurnal cycle shows a maximum in MCS count around 1500-1800 LT, a morning minimum, and substantial activity during the night; there is little seasonal variation in the diurnal cycle, suggesting stationary influences such as orography. Our analysis shows four maxima in MCS activity, three of which are related to local geography (two orographic and one over Lake Victoria). The fourth coincides with a midtropospheric convergence maximum in the right entrance quadrant of the African easterly jet of the Southern Hemisphere (AEJ-S). This maximum is substantially stronger in the September-November rainy season, when the jet is well developed, than in the March-May rainy season, when the jet is absent. Lightning frequency and flashes per MCS are also greatest during September-November; maxima occur in the right entrance quadrant of the AEJ-S. The lightning maximum is somewhat south of the MCS maximum and coincides with the low-lying areas of central Africa. Overall, the results of this study suggest that large-scale topography plays a critical role in the spatial and diurnal patterns of convection, lightning, and rainfall in this region. More speculative is the role of the AEJ-S, but this preliminary analysis suggests that it does play a role in the anomalous intensity of convection in western equatorial Africa.																			0027-0644	1520-0493				APR	2009	137	4					1272	1294		10.1175/2008MWR2525.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2008MWR2525.1													WOS:000266834100006

During floods, the water flows into the surrounding channels, ponds and lakes, creating an integrated dynamic system characterized by a mosaic of lotic and lentic habitats and by the exchange of nutrients and inhabiting organisms between the main river and its floodplain. This study included a total of 14 sampling sites in a floodplain of the Danube River, designated as a Ramsar site. Seven study sites were in near natural condition, while seven others were separated from the Danube floodplain by an embankment and thus were anthropogenically disturbed (e.g. by hydro-morphological alterations and pollution from agricultural fields). Odonata nymphs were sampled over a two-year period in each season using a benthos hand net. A total of 20 Odonata species were recorded. Some of the documented species are of national and/or international conservation concern, which confirms the conservation value of the habitats studied. Species richness, abundance, taxonomic and functional diversity of Odonata were significantly higher at the anthropogenically disturbed sites than at the near natural sites within the studied floodplain area and correlated positively with macrophyte assemblage metrics (species richness, abundance, diversity). The macrophyte assemblage metrics, water transparency, copper and nitrate concentrations and oxygen saturation in the water were key environmental factors shaping Odonata assemblages in the studied floodplain. As Odonata are used as bioindicators of freshwater status worldwide, the presented results could be used in the protection of endangered wetland ecosystems and their biota. The importance of aquatic macrophytes for the conservation of the local Odonata diversity should be considered in the management of anthropogenically disturbed habitats in protected areas.

J	He, XC; Wang, H; Fan, LL; Liang, DF; Ao, YH; Zhuang, W				He, Xinchen; Wang, Hua; Fan, Lili; Liang, Dongfang; Ao, Yanhui; Zhuang, Wei			Quantifying physical transport and local proliferation of phytoplankton downstream of an eutrophicated lake	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Eutrophication in a freshwater system has mainly been studied in lakes and their upstream rivers, which are responsible to bring pollutants into the lakes. However, the influence of lakes on downstream rivers suffered massive algae from upstream lakes has not been fully studied. Our study area is Liangxi river, downstream of Taihu Lake, which is highly eutrophicated. The algae in Liangxi river has two origins: the physical transport from Taihu Lake and the in-situ proliferation. This paper aims to apply a numerical model to quantify these two processes. The model is calibrated against the measured data in 2018. This computational condition that includes both algal processes is termed as Scheme A. Then, we regarded phytoplankton as a conservative substance by turning off the phytoplankton biological process and term it as Scheme E. We selected the chl-a concentration in Hongqiao (LX2) section to represent the amount of algae in Liangxi river. The average chl-a difference in this section between Schemes A and E, Delta(ae), can be used to quantify the magnitude of in-situ proliferation. The Delta(ae) varies seasonally, and the annual average Delta(ae) is 7.22 mg/m3, which is 44.7% of the amount attributed to the physical transport. Liangxi river lies in an urban area which might encounter extreme events to facilitate the in-situ proliferation, such as increased temperature and or excessive nutrient load. To quantify the level of algae under extreme situations, we design Schemes B, C and D which eliminated the limitation on algal growth by temperature, nitrogen and phosphorus respectively. Compared with the Scheme A, Schemes B, C and D observe 21.8%, 65.7%and 61.2% respectively, increase in the average algal concentration. In the vertical direction, the chl-a concentration varies between 0.8 mg/m(3) and 2 mg/m(3) in Scheme A, while the vertical concentration variances of chl-a in schemes B, C and D are found to be 5.56 mg/m(3), 12.11 mg/m(3) and 3.30 mg/m(3), respectively.

Temporal and spatial pattern of thermokarst lake area changes at Yukon Flats, Alaska	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												To better understand the linkage between lake area change, permafrost conditions and intra-annual and inter-annual variability in climate, we explored the temporal and spatial patterns of lake area changes for a 422382-ha study area within Yukon Flats, Alaska using Landsat images of 17 dates between 1984 and 2009. Only closed basin lakes were used in this study. Among the 3529 lakes greater than 1 ha, closed basin lakes accounted for 65% by number and 50% by area. A multiple linear regression model was built to quantify the temporal change in total lake area with consideration of its intra-annual and inter-annual variability. The results showed that 80.7% of lake area variability was attributed to intra-annual and inter-annual variability in local water balance and mean temperature since snowmelt (interpreted as a proxy for seasonal thaw depth). Another 14.3% was associated with long-term change. Among 2280 lakes, 350 lakes shrank, and 103 lakes expanded. The lakes with similar change trends formed distinct clusters, so did the lakes with similar short term intra-annual and inter-annual variability. By analysing potential factors driving lake area changes including evaporation, precipitation, indicators for regional permafrost change, and flooding, we found that ice-jam flooding events were the most likely explanation for the observed temporal pattern. In addition to changes in the frequency of ice jam flooding events, the observed changes of individual lakes may be influenced by local variability in permafrost distributions and/or degradation.

J	Cloern, JE				Cloern, JE			Our evolving conceptual model of the coastal eutrophication problem	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												A primary focus of coastal science during the past 3 decades has been the question: How does anthropogenic nutrient enrichment cause change in the structure or function of nearshore coastal ecosystems? This theme of environmental science is recent, so our conceptual model of the coastal eutrophication problem continues to change rapidly. In this review, I suggest that the early (Phase I) conceptual model was strongly influenced by Limnologists, who began intense study of lake eutrophication by the 1960s. The Phase I model emphasized changing nutrient input as a signal. and responses to that signal as increased phytoplankton biomass and primary production, decomposition of phytoplankton-derived organic matter, and enhanced depletion of oxygen from bottom waters. Coastal research in recent decades has identified key differences in the responses of lakes and coastal-estuarine ecosystems to nutrient enrichment, The contemporary (Phase II) conceptual model reflects those differences and includes explicit recognition of (1) system-specific attributes that act as a filter to modulate the responses to enrichment (leading to large differences among estuarine-coastal systems in their sensitivity to nutrient enrichment); and (2) a complex suite of direct and indirect responses including linked changes in: water transparency, distribution of vascular plants and biomass of macroalgae, sediment biogeochemistry and nutrient cycling, nutrient ratios and their regulation of phytoplankton community composition, frequency of toxic/harmful algal blooms, habitat quality for metazoans, reproduction/growth/survival of pelagic and benthic invertebrates, and subtle changes such as shifts in the seasonality of ecosystem functions. Each aspect of the Phase II model is illustrated here with examples from coastal ecosystems around the world. In the last section of this review I present one vision of the next (Phase III) stage in the evolution of our conceptual model, organized around 5 questions that will guide coastal science in the early 21st century: (1) How do system-specific attributes constrain or amplify the responses of coastal ecosystems to nutrient enrichment? (2) How does nutrient enrichment interact with other stressors (toxic contaminants, fishing harvest, aquaculture, nonindigenous species, habitat loss, climate change, hydrologic manipulations) to change coastal ecosystems? (3) How are responses to multiple stressors linked? (4) How does human-induced change in the coastal zone impact the Earth system as habitat for humanity and other species? (5) How can a deeper scientific understanding of the coastal eutrophication problem be applied to develop tools for building strategies at ecosystem restoration or rehabilitation?

Compared to marine environments, freshwater environments are under studied with respect to DMS cycling. The goal of this study was to assess the formation pathways of DMS in a freshwater lake using natural stable isotopes of sulfur. Our results provide unique sulfur isotopic evidence for the multiple DMS sources and dynamics that are linked to the various biogeochemical processes that occur in freshwater lake water columns and sediments. Abstract The volatile methylated sulfur compound, dimethylsulfide (DMS), plays a major role in the global sulfur cycle by transferring sulfur from aquatic environments to the atmosphere. The main precursor of DMS in saline environments is dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a common osmolyte in algae. The goal of this study was to assess the formation pathways of DMS in the water column and sediments of a monomictic freshwater lake based on seasonal profiles of the concentrations and isotopic signatures of DMS and DMSP. Profiles of DMS in the epilimnion during March and June 2014 in Lake Kinneret showed sulfur isotope (S-34) values of +15.8 +/- 2.0 per mille (parts per thousand), which were enriched by up to 4.8 parts per thousand compared with DMSP S-34 values in the epilimnion at that time. During the stratified period, the S-34 values of DMS in the hypolimnion decreased to -7.0 parts per thousand, close to the S-34 values of coexisting H2S derived from dissimilatory sulfate reduction in the reduced bottom water and sediments. This suggests that H2S was methylated by unknown microbial processes to form DMS. In the hypolimnion during the stratified period DMSP was significantly S-34 enriched relative to DMS reflecting its different S source, which was mostly from sulfate assimilation. In the sediments, S-34 values of DMS were depleted by 2-4 parts per thousand relative to porewater (HCl-extracted) DMSP and enriched relative to H2S. This observation suggests two main formation pathways for DMS in the sediment, one from the degradation of DMSP and one from methylation of H2S. The present study provides isotopic evidence for multiple sources of DMS in stratified water bodies and complex DMSP-DMS dynamics that are linked to the various biogeochemical processes within the sulfur cycle.

Landslide-dammed lake at Tangjiashan, Sichuan province, China (triggered by the Wenchuan Earthquake, May 12, 2008): risk assessment, mitigation strategy, and lessons learned	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Landslides and rock avalanches triggered by the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake produced 257 landslide dams, mainly situated along the eastern boundary of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau where rivers descend approximately 3,000 m into the Sichuan Basin. The largest of these dams blocked the Tongkou River (a tributary of the Fujiang River) at Tangjiashan. The blockage, consisting of 2.04 x 10(7) m(3) of landslide debris, impounded a lake with a projected maximum volume of 3.15 x 10(8) m(3), potentially inundating 8.92 km(2) of terrain. Its creation during the rainy season and the possibility of an uncontrolled release posed a serious, impending threat to at least 1.3 million people downstream that could add substantially to the total of 69,200 individuals directly killed by the earthquake. Risk assessment of the blockage indicated that it was unlikely to collapse suddenly, and that eventual overtopping could be mitigated by notching the structure in order to create an engineered breach and achieve safe drainage of the lake. In addition to the installation of monitoring and warning instrumentation, for emergency planning we estimated several outburst scenarios equivalent to 20, 25, 33, and 50% of the dam failing suddenly, creating, respectively, 3.35, 3.84, 4.22, and 4.65 km(2) of flooded area, and overbank water depths of 4.6, 5.1, 5.7, and 6.2 m, respectively, in Mianyang, the second largest city in Sichuan Province, 48 km downstream from the blockage. Based on these scenarios, recommendations and plans for excavating a sluiceway, draining the lake, and downstream evacuation were proposed and later were implemented successfully, with the blockage breached by overtopping on June 10, less than a month after dam emplacement. The peak discharge of the release only slightly exceeded the flood of record at Mianyang City. No lives were lost, and significant property damage was avoided. Post-breaching evaluation reveals how future similar mitigation can be improved. Although initial breach erosion was slow, later erosion was judged uncontrollably rapid; increased slope of the engineered channel and adoption of a compound, trapezoid-triangular cross-section can be considered, as can other measures to control the rate of breach incision. Evacuees from Mianyang City spent an unnecessarily long time (12 days) in temporary settlements; more precise risk management planning can reduce this time in the future.

We investigated a Holocene lacustrine sediment archive from Lake Garba Guracha, Bale Mountains, Ethiopia, (3,950 m asl), and reconstructed high-altitude lake evaporation history using delta O-18 records derived from the analysis of compound-specific sugar biomarkers and diatoms. The delta O-18(diatom) and delta O-18(fuc) records are clearly correlated and reveal similar ranges (7.9 parts per thousand and 7.1 parts per thousand, respectively). The lowest delta O-18 values occurred between 10-7 cal ka BP and were followed by a continuous shift towards more positive delta O-18 values. Due to the aquatic origin of the sugar biomarker and similar trends of delta O-18(diatom), we suggest that our lacustrine delta O-18(fuc) record reflects delta O-18(lake water). Therefore, without completely excluding the influence of the 'amount-effect' and the 'source-effect', we interpret our record to reflect primarily the precipitation-to-evaporation ratio (P/E). We conclude that precipitation increased at the beginning of the Holocene, leading to an overflowing lake between ca. 10 and ca. 8 cal ka BP, indicated by low delta O-18(lake water) values, which are interpreted as reduced evaporative enrichment. This is followed by a continuous trend towards drier conditions, indicating at least a seasonally closed lake system.					; Glaser, Bruno/ABC-1676-2021; Meyer, Hanno/E-2870-2016; Gil-Romera, Graciela/C-9262-2016; Zech, Michael/F-8026-2018; Bromm, Tobias/JOZ-2309-2023	Bittner, Lucas/0000-0003-2521-5596; Meyer, Hanno/0000-0003-4129-4706; Gil-Romera, Graciela/0000-0001-5726-2536; Lamb, Henry Francis/0000-0003-0025-0766; Zech, Michael/0000-0002-9586-0390; 													0033-5894	1096-0287				JAN	2022	105						23	36		10.1017/qua.2021.26	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2021.26													WOS:000749708100003

In this way, the evaluation of total carbon and its components, chlorophyll, and chemical and physical parameters is of fundamental importance to deepen the dynamics of these peculiar natural areas. Commercial interests linked to the biological resources of these areas are often not well exploited in relation to their sustainability, due to lack of knowledge. In this study, we investigated the distribution of total organic carbon, chlorophyll, and other related physical and chemical parameters in the natural Lagoon of Capo Peloro (Eastern Sicily), to deepen the knowledge on the carbon equilibrium of these transitional basins. Collected data showed different trends for all parameters, mainly related to different seasons and water exchanges with sea. The influences of primary production sources and farmed molluscs were not negligible and deserve to be further investigated in the future. The results obtained reveal good margins for the possibility of environmentally sustainable exploitation of natural resources in both basins, but at the same time, there is a need for a more detailed knowledge of anthropogenic impacts on the area.

Metal levels in two fish species from a waterbody impacted by metallurgic industries and acid mine drainage from coal mining in South Africa	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART A-TOXIC/HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES & ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING												The Loskop Dam in South Africa is the most contaminated waterbody in the Olifants River which is a transboundary river that flows into Mozambique. The present study measured selected metal concentrations in the muscle of Labeo rosae and Oreochromis mossambicus from Loskop Dam, and assessed the human health risks associated with consumption of these fish species. Trace metals were below detection level in the surface water whereas bottom sediment exhibited relatively higher concentrations. A significant seasonal variations (p < 0.05) as well as inter-species difference (p < 0.05) of metal concentrations were observed in the fish muscle. Selenium concentration showed to have increase over the recent few years. Concentrations exceeding permissible level for human consumption was recorded for As, Se and Sb in both species. Other metals which THQ > 1 was Cr for L. rosae and Co for O. mossambicus. The current study shows that there could be some serious health and environmental implications for rural communities making use of Loskop Dam fish as food source. These findings add to knowledge in Africa, particularly South Africa, where other fish species have been identified as being potentially dangerous for human consumption in terms of Se, Sb, As, Co and Cr levels.					; Lebepe, Jeffrey/LMO-3813-2024	Lebepe, Jeffrey/0000-0001-9802-2846; 													1093-4529	1532-4117				MAR 20	2020	55	4					421	432		10.1080/10934529.2019.1704604	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2019.1704604		DEC 2019						31868083					WOS:000503937900001
J	Bolpagni, R; Piotti, A				Bolpagni, Rossano; Piotti, Andrea			Hydro-hygrophilous vegetation diversity and distribution patterns in riverine wetlands in an agricultural landscape: a case study from the Oglio River (Po Plain, Northern Italy)	PHYTOCOENOLOGIA												In the European plains, up to eighty percent of riverine wetlands have been lost due to alteration of hydrological regime and catchment exploitation. This condition is expected to be further negatively exacerbated by climate change. To better understand the observed change in distribution patterns of hydro-hygrophilous vegetation in temperate and Mediterranean floodplains, a vegetation survey was conducted within the lower Oglio River reach in Northern Italy. This river is a mid-size, altered and nutrient-rich left tributary of the Po River. During the 2008 growing season, a total of 60 marginal aquatic habitats were investigated. Overall, 37 vegetation communities were detected, showing a clear predominance of hygrophilous herbaceous plant communities both in terms of representativeness (55.1%) and diversity (54.1%) with respect to woody (22.9% and 10.8%, respectively), and obligate aquatic vegetation (22.0% and 35.1%, respectively). Our main findings were (1) the widespread presence of highly opportunistic, non-native and invasive hygrophilous plant communities (largely dominated by Amorpha fruticosa, Phragmites australis s.l., Amaranthus spp., Bidens spp., and Cyperus spp.), and (2) the limited distribution of hydrophyte vegetation usually dominated by pleustophytes (e.g., Spirodela polyrhiza and Lemna spp.). The present study confirms the dominance of secondary plant communities characterized by the widespread presence of alien species in lowland over-exploited riverscapes, coupled with a low local representativeness of native willow (Salix alba, S. cinerea) communities and anchored macrophyte (batrachid, ceratophyllid, elodeid, myriophyllid) meadows. Total vegetation diversity is consistent with previous studies in similar ecological contexts; on the other hand, at the site scale, the diversity values were extremely low. This is especially true for the aquatic vegetation, and can be related to the high water turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentrations that prevent the establishment and colonization of submerged and rooted hydrophytes. Consequently, we stress the need for metabolic and biogeochemical indicators to assess the actual trophic status of lowland wetlands in order to clarify their potential to be restored.

Climate change plays a crucial role in affecting the hydrologic processes of Abayya-Chamo lake basin in Ethiopia's Rift Valley, resulting into a distributed actual evapotranspiration (DAET) system. Various studies have already been undertaken on the effects of climate change (CC) on AET but forecasted precipitation and temperature to determine space-time distribution of AET across the basin have not been studied yet. Estimates for precipitation and temperature were acquired from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) Africa platform, using RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, during 1986-2015, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100 periods. WetSpass-M model was employed to investigate seasonal and annual DAET under varied climate amplitude and distribution. For the baseline period (1986-2015), the maximum annual AET was predicted to be 2815.8 mm/yr. For 2041-2070, and 2071-2100 periods, the estimated maximum annual AET for RCP4.5 scenarios was 3019.2 and 3212.1 mm/yr, respectively, while for RCP8.5 scenarios, it was 3116 and 3352.2 mm/yr, respectively. The baseline annual AET was 516.6 mm/yr, while the mid-term (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and long-term (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) models predicted mean annual AETs of 423.8 and 432 mm/yr and 429.6, and 438.5 mm/yr, respectively. Between 2041 and 2070, the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios predicted a 92.8 and 84.6 mm/yr decrease in mean annual AET, respectively. The model predicted a decline in mean annual AET of 87 and 78.2 mm/yr for both scenarios in 2071 and 2100, respectively. With the exception of the basin's maximum AET, the mean annual AET for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios may decline during 2041-2070 and 2071-2100. As rainfall declines and temperature rises and the projected AET in the basin gets disrupted in the future decades. This research may add information to the water management and utilization, and a better knowledge of how climate change directly affects AET systems.					; Lohani, Tarun/AAK-1392-2021	Atlabachew Eshete, Abunu/0000-0002-8617-8488; Nannawo, Dr. Abera S./0000-0002-7397-0951; LOHANI, TARUN KUMAR/0000-0003-4804-9711														2405-8440				AUG	2022	8	8							e10368	10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10368	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e10368		AUG 2022						36060990					WOS:000859345900012

Microrefuges from drying for invertebrates in a seasonal wetland	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												<list list-type="1" id="fwb12451-list-0001"> Seasonally intermittent freshwater environments show large temporal changes in area and environmental conditions (which may be harsh). We investigated whether microhabitats that retain moisture could provide a refuge during drying in a seasonal wetland. We investigated occupancy by invertebrates of three potential microrefuge types: surface depressions, shallow cracks and deeper fissures in the sediment of a wetland in Western Australia. Our aims were to determine whether the assemblages occupying these microrefuges differed and whether they changed as the wetland dried and reflooded. Ten microrefuges of each type were sampled for invertebrates, sediment and temperature during each of three hydrological phases: the damp phase (surface water absent but sediment moist), the dry phase (groundwater at its lowest level) and the reflooded phase (surface water present). Sediment samples taken from each microrefuge in the damp and dry phases were reflooded in the laboratory to reveal species aestivating or present as eggs, and sediment organic matter content was measured. Sediment organic matter content did not change between wetland phases. The invertebrate assemblage in the microrefuges showed almost complete species turnover between phases. Invertebrate composition differed between microrefuges, and temperature in the deeper fissures was on average >10 degrees C lower than in surface depressions and shallow cracks. Microcrustaceans and gastropods survived the drier months as resting stages in the microrefuges and either emerged or hatched from eggs upon reflooding. Several species, including isopods and caddisflies, were collected only from cracks and fissures as the wetland dried. During drying, a high diversity of carnivorous species was observed in the microrefuges. Sediment microrefuges apparently underpin resistance to drought by invertebrates in South Lake. Those species that depend on sediment fissures to survive may be threatened by the declining groundwater table in the region. Changes to wetland hydrology and other human activities that affect wetland sediment or vegetation will affect the range of microrefuges available to invertebrates to survive drying and may thus alter wetland biodiversity. <doi origin="wiley" registered="yes">10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2427</doi					; Robson, Belinda/G-4694-2010	Robson, Belinda/0000-0002-9215-3666; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2014	59	12					2528	2538		10.1111/fwb.12451	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12451													WOS:000344778800008

However, it is now generally accepted that this approach needs to be established in order to find sustainable solutions for development and is actively promoted by the Water Ministry, especially in environmentally fragile regions, such as the Lake Poopo basin. The Lake Poopo basin is one of the poorest regions in the Bolivian Altiplano. It is confronted with severe water scarcity during the dry season, leading to low water quality, a high water-poverty index and low values of the watershed sustainability index. Furthermore, salinization and environmental degradation of soil and water are forcing people to migrate to urban areas. These are some of the factors underlying an ever-increasing complexity in integrated water resources management in the region. This paper proposes and develops a Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) in the Lake Poopo basin, based on economic, social and environmental criteria in an uncertain decision environment in order to support stakeholders in managing their water resources. Saaty's analytical hierarchy process (AHP) theory is applied here to solve the MCDA and to identify the alternatives using the highest expected utility value. The paper identifies the best solutions for existing conflicts, while promoting interaction with stakeholders and instruments in order to reach a sustainable strategy for water resources management in this water-scarce region.					; Berndtsson, Ronny/C-7449-2015; Meixner, Oliver/AAD-6219-2021	Berndtsson, Ronny/0000-0003-1473-0138; Meixner, Oliver/0000-0002-8505-3130; 													0920-4741	1573-1650				AUG	2010	24	10					2267	2289		10.1007/s11269-009-9551-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-009-9551-x													WOS:000280242500019

The net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) were negative during the daytime and positive at night, and the minimum value appeared around noon. The peak CO2 uptake in the flourishing period was approximately 1.5 times the values observed in the tillering and ripening stages. Frequent alternation of wetting and drying in paddy fields with water-saving irrigation resulted in larger NEE for the typical day before soil rewatering than that for the day after soil rewatering in the early growth stage. These alterations had a minimal effect on diurnal variation of NEE in the late rice growth stage. The average NEE for the typical days after soil rewatering in July and August were 2.30 and 1.38 times that before soil rewatering, respectively. CO2 exchange in paddy field ecosystem under water-saving irrigation displayed seasonal variation with the change of rice plant growth. The total ecosystem respiration (Re.), NEE and gross primary productivity (GPP) were 1996.88, -1284.15 and 3281.03 g m(-2), respectively, throughout the growth stage. These results showed that the paddy field ecosystem under water-saving irrigation was a sink for atmospheric CO2. Frequent alternation of wetting and drying processes increased the ecosystem reparation of paddy fields under water-saving irrigation and produced smaller net CO2 absorption compared to that of flooding irrigation. The net CO2 absorption because of plant photosynthesis during the daytime and the net CO2 release at night measured by static transparent chamber method were larger than those measured by eddy covariance method (P < 0.05). The nighttime respiration of paddy field ecosystem under water-saving irrigation increased exponentially with temperature. Additionally, a larger temperature sensitivity coefficient (Q(10)) was observed for paddy fields under water-saving irrigation compared to that under flooding irrigation. The photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) was the most important factor for regulating daytime GPP. And the light saturation point during the heading-flowering and milk stages of paddy field ecosystem with water-saving irrigation (1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) was higher than that of fields with flooding irrigation in previous studies. A significant positive correlation was found between the leaf area index (LAI) and the daily GPP. ((C)) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First we evaluate the water balance using the three products over areas with limited annual streamflow to eliminate the influence of runoff in the analysis. We observe more frequent and better closure and consistency in the water balance from the three components over the central part of Western Australia, where low precipitation, high elevation and low relief exist. The data are more coherent at seasonal and annual scales compared to the monthly scale. Application of the three products in Lake Eyre Basin (an internal drainage system) suggests a maximum 6.2 mm/year groundwater inflow to the basin, which is consistent with the regional groundwater flow direction in the area. This result also indicates that the absolute integrated error of the combination of three products should be smaller than 6.2 mm/year, which is about 2.1% of annual precipitation in the basin. If this relative error is assumed for the whole continent, water balance calculation using the three products over the whole Australian continent results in 144.7 +/- 11.3 mm/year estimated total runoff to the surrounding oceans during the study period. We found that this estimate is comparable to the estimates of 50-150 mm/year from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and National Water Commission. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

There is a lack of the understanding of sediment nutrient release fluxes and their responses to various environmental factors in plateau lakes. In this study, nutrient contents in the water and sediment, sediment nutrient release rates, and their responses to various influential factors in a steppe shallow plateau lake, Lake Hulun, China, were investigated. Sediment is a large store of nutrients, with bioavailable phosphorus of 555 mg kg(-1) in surface lake sediments. If water became anoxic, sediments will release appreciable amounts of phosphate (2.1 mg P m(-2) d(-1)) and ammonia (40.0 mg N m(-2) d(-1)), three times greater than those in oxic conditions. Raised temperatures greatly increased sediment phosphate release rates, while the highest temperature (23 degrees C) slightly decreased ammonia release rates due to strong nitrification. Assuming a whole year of internal loading, ammonia and dissolved reactive phosphorus concentrations in water column would increase by an estimated 0.22 mg N L-1 and 0.01 mg P L-1, respectively, which is equal to 2 and 0.5 times of their ambient concentrations. A pH increase from 8.4 to 9.4 significantly decreased internal nitrogen and phosphorus release rates by around three times. Overall, dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH had a greater impact on sediment nutrient release from lake sediments compared to temperature, and further increased the eutrophic status in the overlying water when these three parameters varied within the normal seasonal range (temperature: 1.9-23.1 degrees C, DO: oxic and anoxic; pH: 7.5-9.4). With the periodic low DO and frequency of drought in the future, lake management strategies that mitigate water eutrophication, such as water diversion, may need to be considered.					; Liu, Bo/M-1151-2015	Zhu, Senlin/0000-0003-2803-5419; 														2071-1050				MAY 26	2023	15	11							8680	10.3390/su15118680	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15118680													WOS:001005024900001

Exploring Mid-Holocene African Temperatures Using Proxy System Modeling	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Climate models predict Africa will warm by up to 5 degrees C in the coming century, stressing African societies. To provide independent constraints on model predictions, this study compares two notable reconstructions of East African temperatures to those predicted by Paleoclimate Model Intercomparison Project (PMIP3) and transient TraCE (Transient Climate Evolution) simulations, focusing on the Mid-Holocene (MH, 5-8 kyr B.P.). Reconstructions of tropical African temperature derived from lake sedimentary archives indicate 1-2.5 degrees C of warming during the MH relative to the 20th century, but most climate models do not replicate the warming observed in these paleoclimate data. We investigate this discrepancy using a new lake proxy system model, with attention to the (potentially non-stationary) relationship between lake temperature and air temperature. We find amplified lake surface temperature changes compared to air temperature during the MH due to heightened seasonality and precessional forcing. Lacustrine processes account for some of the warming, and highlight how the lake heat budget leads to a rectification of the seasonal cycle; however, the simulated lake heating bias is insufficient to reconcile the full discrepancy between the models and the proxy-derived MH warming. We find further evidence of changes in mixing depth over time, potentially driven by changes in cloud cover and shortwave radiative fluxes penetrating the lake surface. This may confound interpretation for glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGT) compounds which exist in the mixed layer, and suggests a need for independent constraints on mixed layer depth. This work provides a new interpretive framework for invaluable paleoclimate records of temperature changes over the African continent.

Chemical characterization of polysaccharides from Gracilaria gracilis from Bizerte (Tunisia)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES												Polysaccharides were extracted from Gracilaria gracilis collected from Manzel Jemil Lake in Bizerte Tunisia, with two different solvents (water and NaOH 0.3 M). Different assays were performed on samples (total sugars, neutral sugars, uronic acids, anhydrogalactose, proteins, sulphates, pyruvates), followed by high performance anionexchange chromatography (HPAEC) to observe the monosaccharide composition, high pressure size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle laser light scattering (HPSEC-MALS) to obtain the molecular mass, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to access to structural data. Results have shown that the polysaccharide extracted from Gracilaria gracilis collected from Manzel Jemil Lake in Bizerte Tunisia, is of agar type but with high molecular mass and some original structural features. Hence, the sample was found to contain 9 % of pyruvate groups and is partly sulphated at the C4 of beta-D-galactose and methylated on C2 of anhydro-alpha-L-galactose. The polymer from G. gracilis from Bizerte thus presents a never described structure that could be interesting for further rheological or biological activities applications.

Probing environmental and tectonic changes underneath Mexico City with the urban seismic field	SOLID EARTH												The sediments underneath Mexico City have unique mechanical properties that give rise to strong site effects. We investigated temporal changes in the seismic velocity at strong-motion and broadband seismic stations throughout Mexico City, including sites with different geologic characteristics ranging from city center locations situated on lacustrine clay to hillside locations on volcanic bedrock. We used autocorrelations of urban seismic noise, enhanced by waveform clustering, to extract subtle seismic velocity changes by coda wave interferometry. We observed and modeled seasonal, co- and post-seismic changes, as well as a long-term linear trend in seismic velocity. Seasonal variations can be explained by self-consistent models of thermoelastic and poroelastic changes in the subsurface shear wave velocity. Overall, sites on lacustrine clay-rich sediments appear to be more sensitive to seasonal surface temperature changes, whereas sites on alluvial and volcaniclastic sediments and on bedrock are sensitive to precipitation. The 2017 M-w 7.1 Puebla and 2020 M-w 7.4 Oaxaca earthquakes both caused a clear drop in seismic velocity, followed by a time-logarithmic recovery that may still be ongoing for the 2017 event at several sites or that may remain incomplete. The slope of the linear trend in seismic velocity is correlated with the downward vertical displacement of the ground measured by interferometric synthetic aperture radar, suggesting a causative relationship and supporting earlier studies on changes in the resonance frequency of sites in the Mexico City basin due to groundwater extraction. Our findings show how sensitively shallow seismic velocity and, in consequence, site effects react to environmental, tectonic and anthropogenic processes. They also demonstrate that urban strong-motion stations provide useful data for coda wave monitoring given sufficiently high-amplitude urban seismic noise.					; Ermert, Laura/AAW-1145-2020	Denolle, Marine/0000-0002-1610-2250; Ermert, Laura/0000-0001-9862-2710													1869-9510	1869-9529				MAY 23	2023	14	5					529	549		10.5194/se-14-529-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/se-14-529-2023													WOS:000993740800001

Subsequent introduction to aqueous environments via atmospheric deposition or overland flow re-sults in the formation of a dissolved fraction, called dissolved black carbon (DBC). As wildfire frequency and intensity increases along with a changing climate, it becomes imperative to understand the impact a concurrent increase in DBC load might have to aquatic ecosystems. In the atmosphere BC stimulates warming by absorbing solar radiation, and similar processes may occur with surface waters that contain DBC. In this work we investigated whether the addition of environmentally relevant levels of DBC could impact surface water heating dynamics in experimental settings. DBC was quantified at multiple locations and depths in Pyramid Lake (NV, USA) during peak fire season while two large, proximal wildfires burned. DBC was detected in Pyramid Lake water at all sampled locations at concentrations (3.6-18 ppb) significantly higher than those reported for other large inland lakes. DBC was positively correlated (R2 = 0.84) with chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) but not bulk dissolved or total organic carbon (DOC, TOC), suggesting that DBC is a significant component of the optically active organics in the lake. Subsequent lab-based experiments were conducted by adding environmentally relevant levels of DBC standards to pure water, ex-posing the system to solar spectrum radiation, and creating a numerical model of heat transfer based on observed tem-peratures. The addition of DBC at environmentally relevant orders of magnitude caused reductions to shortwave albedo when exposed to the solar spectrum, which resulted in 5-8 % more incident radiation being absorbed by water and changes to water heating dynamics. In environmental settings, this increase in energy absorption could translate to increased heating of the epilimnion in Pyramid Lake and other wildfire-impacted surface waters.

However, tracking N & P loss and transport at a watershed scale is challenging especially in lowland artificial watersheds (polders) with complex hydrological processes. To address this challenge, this study selected 171 polders in lower reach of Yangtze River in China as the study area, and investigated the response of N & P loss to both natural and anthropogenic drivers using two process-based models (PDP & NDP) specifically developed for polders. Our modelling practices revealed that these polders had a high N & P loss intensity of 38.37 and 1.75 kg/ha/yr, respectively. Rainy-season precipitation and TN & TP concentrations in connected-rivers were characterized as sensitive factors determining polder N & P loss with a threshold value of 950 mm/yr, 0.2 and 0.02 mg/L, respectively. Compared with annual precipitation, rainyseason precipitation more highly (P < 0.001, R2 >0.8) determined polder N & P loss, with a loss-intensity increase of 6.05 and 0.28 kg/ha/yr for 100 mm increase of rainy-season precipitation. Polder N & P loss was highly related (P < 0.001) to the area of farmland and surface water within these polders. This study can potentially improve our understanding of N & P cycling for lowland polders, and can thus support N & P control in water management practices.

Permafrost thaw lakes and ponds as habitats for abundant rotifer populations	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Thermokarst lakes and ponds were sampled across a range of permafrost landscapes in subarctic Quebec (Nunavik, Canada) to compare their rotifer and other zooplankton characteristics with a set of rock-basin lakes and ponds in the region. A total of 24 rotifer species were identified, with an average of seven taxa per waterbody. Rotifer abundance was an order of magnitude higher in the thaw ponds than in rock-basin waters. In some thaw ponds, rotifers accounted for >50% of the total zooplankton biomass, but for <10% in all of the rock-basin waters. Neither alpha- nor beta-diversity was significantly different between the two waterbody types. Grazing experiments with microspheres (0.5-6 mu m diameter) showed that medium-sized particles (2-3 mu m) were preferred to smaller and larger particles; clearance rates were <0.05% of the water column per day, implying that the rotifer populations were unlikely to be bottom-up limited by food availability. Rotifer abundance was negatively correlated with cladoceran densities, suggesting possible interference effects. Chaoborus larvae were also present and may exert a top-down control. Thermokarst ponds are currently favorable environments for rotifers, but the rapid change they have begun to experience brings uncertainty about their ongoing capacity to sustain these prolific communities.

This study aimed to describe the fish species that prefers macrophytes covered areas and to evaluate how macrophytes complexities and a flood pulse influence the structure of fish assemblages and selected attributes (viz. fish species density, species richness and evenness). Sampling was performed with seining nets in five floodplain lakes associated with the Baia River, before (November to December 2011) and after (February to July 2012) a flood, considering different degrees of macrophyte complexity (Absent, intermediate, and high). A total of 48 fish species was recorded, with Characiformes the most dominant. Eight species were indicators of high complexities (seven before the flood and only one after). Significant differences among the different degrees of macrophyte complexity and before and after the flood were found for assemblage structure, species density and richness. Fish assemblage attributes were high in higher habitat heterogeneity provided by macrophytes, but all before the flood. Nevertheless, macrophyte stands with high and intermediate complexity were less affected by the flood, suggesting that the structure propitiated by macrophytes favors the persistence of the fish assemblage in floodplain lakes. Therefore, any action towards conservation of fish assemblages in macrophytes should consider dam operation upstream, to ensure seasonality of flood pulses.

Future climate change may threaten drybean production and jeopardize smallholder farmers' food security. We estimated yield changes in drybeans due to changing climate in these countries using downscaled data from global circulation models (GCMs) in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. We generated daily weather data, which we used in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) drybean submodel. We compared different cultivars, soils, and fertilizer options in three planting seasons. We analyzed the simulated yields to spatially classify high-impact spots of climate change across the four countries. The results show a corridor of reduced yields from Lake Nicaragua to central Honduras (10-38 % decrease). Yields increased in the Guatemalan highlands, towards the Atlantic coast, and in southern Nicaragua (10-41 % increase). Some farmers will be able to adapt to climate change, but others will have to change crops, which will require external support. Research institutions will need to devise technologies that allow farmers to adapt and provide policy makers with feasible strategies to implement them.

We studied the Wanzhou draw-down zones in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region via field investigations and soil seed bank (SSB) germination experiments. The composition and spatial distribution of the SSB in the planted and natural restored sites revealed the effects of restoration modes on seed bank development and demonstrated responses of SSB composition and structure to water fluctuation. The SSB of planted sites contained 43 species of plants, with a mean seed bank density of 9418.79 seeds/m(2), where annual herb species accounted for 57.34%. The SSB at natural restored sites had 38 species of plants, with a mean seed bank density of 6090.09 seeds/m(2), where annual herb species accounted for 52.57% of the species. Species diversity was low and annual plants dominated the two restoration sites. SSB species diversity was the highest in mid to upper levels of the draw-down zones. Plantation has increased co-occurrence species of SSB and standing vegetation, and increased their similarity. The number of co-occurrence dominant species of SSB and standing vegetation in planted areas was greater than in natural restored areas. However, the stability of plant communities naturally restored was greater than artificial plant communities as there was a higher proportion of perennials in the SSB with more dominant species similar to standing plant communities. In conclusion, the reverse water-level fluctuation simplified the species composition and shaped the spatial distribution of the SSB at the two restoration sites, and plantation promotes the development both of SSB and vegetation. However, plant communities of the two restoration areas, influenced by water-level fluctuations, will be mainly grasslands dominated by annual plants. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the long-term effects of hypolimnetic redox conditions and trophic state on sedimentary P fraction retention in deep lakes are not clear yet. Hypolimnetic withdrawal of P-rich water is predicted to diminish sedimentary P and seasonal P recycling from the lake hypolimnion. Nevertheless, there is a lack of evidence from well-dated sediment cores, in particular from deep lakes, about the long-term impact of hypolimnetic withdrawal on sedimentary P retention. In this study, long-term sedimentary P fraction data since the early 1900s from Lake Burgaschi provide information on benthic P retention under the influence of increasing lake primary productivity (sedimentary green-pigment proxy), variable hypolimnion oxygenation regimes (Fe/Mn ratio proxy), and hypolimnetic withdrawal since 1977. Results show that before hypolimnetic withdrawal (during the early 1900s to 1977), the redox-sensitive Fe/Mn-P fraction comprised similar to 50% of total P (TP) in the sediment profile. Meanwhile, long-term retention of total P and labile P fractions in sediments was predominantly affected by past hypolimnetic redox conditions, and P retention increased in sedimentary Fe- and Mn-enriched layers when the sediment-overlaying water was seasonally oxic. However, from 1977 to 2017, due to eutrophication-induced persistent anoxic conditions in the hypolimnion and to hypolimnetic water withdrawal increasing the P export out of the lake, net burial rates of total and labile P fractions decreased considerably in surface sediments. By contrast, refractory Ca-P fraction retention was primarily related to lake primary production. Due to lake restoration since 1977, the Ca-P fraction became the primary P fraction in sediments (representing similar to 39% of total P), indicating a lower P bioavailability of surface sediments. Our study implies that in seasonally stratified eutrophic deep lakes (like Lake Burgaschi), hypolimnetic withdrawal can effectively reduce P retention in sediments and potential for sediment P release (internal P loads). However, after more than 40 years of hypolimnetic syphoning, the lake trophic state has not improved nor has lake productivity decreased. Furthermore, this restoration has not enhanced water column mixing and oxygenation in hypolimnetic waters. The findings of this study are relevant regarding the management of deep eutrophic lakes with mixing regimes typical for temperate zones.

The temporal variations and spatial extent of the plume and its effect on the presence of 39 pharmaceuticals and other micropollutants in the Vidy Bay were assessed over a 10 month period. A pronounced plume was observed from April to October, leading to locally elevated (up to 70-fold) pharmaceutical concentrations compared to the surrounding water column. For three of the measured substances, these plume-associated concentrations were sufficiently high to pose an ecotoxicological risk. The plume depth followed the thermal lake stratification, which moved to lower depths over the course of the warm seasons. Pharmaceutical hotspots associated with the plume were detected as far as 1.5 km downstream of the effluent wastewater outfall, but concentrations typically decreased with increasing distance from the wastewater outfall as a result of dilution and photodegradation. From November to January, when uniform temperature prevailed throughout the water column, no micropollutant plumes were detected. In contrast to pharmaceuticals, most pesticides showed homogeneous concentrations throughout the Vidy Bay during the whole study period, indicating that the effluent wastewater was not their dominant source. A strong linear correlation between electrical conductivity and concentrations of wastewater-derived micropollutants was identified. This relation will allow future estimates of wastewater-derived micropollutant concentrations via simple conductivity measurements.					; Kohn, Tamar/H-1430-2011	Halder, Janine/0000-0003-3390-886X; Kohn, Tamar/0000-0003-0395-6561; 													0013-936X					JUN 1	2011	45	11					4702	4709		10.1021/es2003588	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es2003588								21545098					WOS:000291128700009

Seasonal hydrological loading in the Great Lakes region detected by GNSS: a comparison with hydrological models	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												Crustal deformation caused by hydrological processes has long been detected using space geodetic techniques, yet questions remain about the relative contributions of surface water and groundwater to the geodetic signals in different regions. Here, we investigate forward models of elastic loading deformation caused by a variety of water-storage changes within the Great Lakes region, including fluctuations in lake-water volume, soil moisture and snow load. We use lake-level data from the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, soil-moisture content from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS), snow load from the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) and background hydrological load at the global scale from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). We compare the modelled surface deformation with estimates of hydrological loading deformation inferred from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. We find that seasonal deformation measured by GNSS is dominated by regional-scale hydrological loading based on strong correlations with the modelled loading displacements. The mean correlation coefficient for the study network is 0.56. The correlation coefficients vary spatially within the study region and exceed 0.9 at some stations near to the Great Lakes. We assess the relative contribution of each individual hydrological component to the total integrated hydrological load. We find that soil moisture consistently explains the largest percentage (27-69 per cent) of the total vertical loading deformation for 87 per cent of GNSS stations in the Great Lakes region. Snow loading and soil moisture contribute relatively equally in the northern reaches of the study area (e.g. Canadian shield, northern Superior basin). Lake loading accounts for about 10-25 per cent of the total loading signal in the immediate vicinity of the lakes. We also investigate the sensitivities of the surface loading displacements to three different Earth models, including two with lateral variations in structure. The structural variations considered here have limited impact (<0.2 mm) on the predicted hydrological loading displacements and could be neglected at the current level of observational precision.

J	Duque, C; Haider, K; Sebok, E; Sonnenborg, TO; Engesgaard, P				Duque, Carlos; Haider, Kinza; Sebok, Eva; Sonnenborg, Torben O.; Engesgaard, Peter			A conceptual model for groundwater discharge to a coastal brackish lagoon based on seepage measurements (Ringkobing Fjord, Denmark)	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Groundwater discharge to a brackish lagoon (RingkObing Fjord) was quantified with seepage meters along four transects perpendicular to the shore during four seasons in 1year. The objectives were to develop a conceptual model of the spatiotemporal variability of seepage and how landscape characteristics and saltwater intrusion affect seepage fluxes. The electrical conductivity of the groundwater was measured in vertical sediment profiles up to 3m below the lagoon bed to assess the effects of the freshwater-saltwater interface location on flux distribution. The main differences compared with existing theoretical models are a lower discharge near the shore line (0-5m) and two discharge peaks more offshore (15-20 and >25m), which allowed the development of a conceptual model that is different from the classical concepts introduced for marine or lake environments and which can be representative of other similar areas. These differences are explained by the vegetation and organic material deposition in the near-shore environment reducing discharge, the presence of the saline wedge leading to upward flow, and the increase of recirculation of brackish water due to wave pumping in areas offshore most exposed to the wind. The seasonal variability in discharge is smaller than the spatial variability between and within transects along the shoreline. Based on the conceptual model, fresh water discharge in a 20-m-wide fringe was calculated to be between 66 and 388Lday(-1).m(-1) shore line, corresponding to a difference of a factor of six due to the variations in coast morphology and local characteristics of the area. The seasonal changes were responsible for changes of only 8% to 75% depending on the location.

This is more sensitive in the Upper Blue Nile (UBN) basin, where precipitation uncertainty and hydrological droughts often overshadow the effectiveness of these irrigation schemes, challenging the water-food security efforts in general. To explore this issue, we developed a numerical framework, based on a groundwater model using MODFLOW-NWT, coupled with the outputs of the crop model DSSAT. The framework was implemented in an irrigated site namely, the Koga irrigation scheme, located within in the UBN Basin, Ethiopia. The coupling of groundwater modelling with crop water modelling in data scarce environments is a key contribution of this work. The groundwater model was calibrated with in situ data collected via a Citizen Science Initiative (CSI) for hydraulic head (H) and soil moisture(0); and against a distributed hydrological model (CREST) simulated evapotranspiration (ET). Normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) values of 0.047, 0.05, and 0.06 were obtained through calibration for H, 0, and ET, respectively. The model was specifically used to simulate the vadose zone water availability due to irrigation, and water-food security aspects associated with extremely dry years. We investigated the hydrologic effect of three irrigation scenarios (non-regulated: NREG, regulated: REG, and regulated with groundwater pumping: REG+GW) aimed at reducing crop water stress derived by one-way coupling of MODFLOW with the crop model Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT).

Biogeochemistry of carbon, major and trace elements in watersheds of northern Eurasia drained to the Arctic Ocean: The change of fluxes, sources and mechanisms under the climate warming prospective	COMPTES RENDUS GEOSCIENCE												Warming of the permafrost accompanied by the release of ancient soil organic carbon is one of the most significant environmental threats within the global climate change scenario. While the main sites of permafrost carbon processing and its release to the atmosphere are thermokarst (thaw) lakes and ponds, the main carriers of carbon and related major and trace elements from the land to the Arctic ocean are Russian subarctic rivers. The source of carbon in these rivers is atmospheric C consumed by chemical weathering of rocks and amplified by plant uptake and litter decomposition. This multidisciplinary study describes results of more than a decade of observations and measurements of elements fluxes, stocks and mechanisms in the Russian boreal and subarctic zone, from Karelia region to the Kamchatka peninsula, along the gradient of permafrost-free terrain to continuous permafrost settings, developed on various lithology and vegetation types. We offer a comprehensive, geochemically-based view on the functioning of aquatic boreal systems which quantifies the role of the following factors on riverine element fluxes: (1) the specificity of lithological substrate; (2) the importance of organic and organo-mineral colloidal forms, notably during the snowmelt season; (3) the phenomenon of lakes seasonal overturn; (4) the role of permafrost within the small and large watersheds; and (5) the governing role of terrestrial vegetation in element mobilization from rock substrate to the river. Care of such a multiple approach, a first order prediction of the evolution of element stocks and fluxes under scenario of progressive warming in high latitudes becomes possible. It follows the increase of frozen peat thawing in western Siberia will increase the stocks of elements in surface waters by a factor of 3 to 10 whereas the increase of the thickness of active layer, the biomass and the primary productivity all over permafrost-affected zone will bring about a short-term increase of elements stocks in labile reservoir (plant litter) and riverine fluxes by a factor of 2. The change of the plant productivity and community composition under climate warming in central Siberia will be the most important factor of major and trace element fluxes increase (probably a factor of 2) from the soil to the river and, finally, to the Arctic Ocean.

The seasonal variability in water and sediment input has significant impacts on the ecosystem influencing the rate of CO2 sequestration. We have assessed the impact of seasonal variability on CO2 sequestration using foraminiferal analysis and grain size data end member modeling. Lake floor sediment samples were collected seasonally, besides in situ measurements of physicochemical parameters of the lake bottom water at fixed stations influenced by seasonally variable fresh and saline water influx. Low electrical conductivity, pH of bottom water and absence of calcareous foraminifera suggest that the region proximal to the river mouth has fresh water ecosystem and has very limited role in CO2 sequestration. The region near to the sea mouth experiences high energy condition and seasonally changes from brackish to marine water ecosystem are ideal for diversification and opportunistic populations of foraminifera, but not ideal for flourishing (high population) of calcareous foraminifera. Inter-mixing of fresh and saline sea water develops fresh to brackish water conditions with medium energy condition in the interior region. These locations are away from the river and sea mouths and have high calcareous foraminifera abundances, but low diversity along with high bottom water pH suggesting seasonal variations in the sinking of CO2. Like other shallow coastal areas, Ammonia beccarii and Ammonia tepida are the dominant calcareous species, but their smaller size suggests a seasonal stressed condition. The opening of new and artificial sea mouth has increased the inflow of sea water into the lagoon that maintains its brackish water conditions, suggested by significant increase in calcareous foraminifera abundance. The sinking of these calcareous foraminifera may enhance the rate of CO2 sequestration and reduce degassing of dissolved carbon carried by the fresh water to the atmosphere.					; Jena, Partha Sarathi/HNS-7989-2023; Prusty, Pintu/GSO-1779-2022; SINGH, RAJ/HGE-7393-2022; SINGH, RAJ Kumar/HGE-7393-2022	Jena, Partha Sarathi/0000-0002-2232-4212; Prusty, Pintu/0000-0001-9706-7401; SINGH, RAJ Kumar/0000-0003-2900-7145													0377-8398	1872-6186				MAR	2019	147						43	56		10.1016/j.marmicro.2019.02.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marmicro.2019.02.003													WOS:000462802400005

Here, we study how functional redundancy of phytoplankton taxa (within group richness) contribute to the species diversity of assemblages in an oxbow lake in the CarpathianBasin. We found that although the observed functional redundancy was similar among several FGs, the shape of the species accumulation curves of these groups was considerably different, implying that the observed species numbers alone do not represent the real functional redundancy of the groups. We demonstrated that FGs that showed asymptotes in species richness estimates in small spatial scale, exhibited steady increase in large spatial, and temporal scales. The contribution of FGs to species richness depended strongly on the relative biomass of each FG. Species accumulation curves of those groups of which elements dominated in the phytoplankton, appeared to be approaching asymptotes. Since the shapes of species accumulation curves refer to the strengths of within-group competition among constituent species, our results imply that functional redundancy of phytoplankton is influenced by the role that the elements play within the assemblages.					; T-Krasznai, Eniko/AAM-7663-2021; B-Beres, Viktoria/AAI-2055-2019; Tóthmérész, Béla/A-5114-2009; Varbiro, Gabor/G-9416-2011; Varbiro, Gabor/AAH-5587-2021; Nagy-László PhD, Zsolt/ABF-1526-2021; Abonyi, Andras/F-1849-2013	T-Krasznai, Eniko/0000-0002-0012-1422; B-Beres, Viktoria/0000-0002-9632-2703; Varbiro, Gabor/0000-0001-5907-3472; Abonyi, Andras/0000-0003-0593-5932													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR	2019	830	1					287	301		10.1007/s10750-018-3878-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3878-3													WOS:000457403000019

Latest Methodological Improvements to Characterize Surface Temperatures Behavior of Thermal Anomaly Areas	REMOTE SENSING												In this technical paper, the state-of-art of automated procedures to process thermal infrared (TIR) scenes acquired by a permanent ground-based surveillance system, is discussed. TIR scenes regard diffuse degassing areas at Campi Flegrei and Vesuvio in the Neapolitan volcanic district (Italy). The processing system was developed in-house by using the flexible and fast processing Matlab (c) environment. The multi-step procedure, starting from raw infrared (IR) frames, generates a final product consisting mainly of de-seasoned temperatures and heat fluxes time-series as well as maps of yearly rates of temperature change of the IR frames. Accurate descriptions of all operational phases and of the procedures of analysis are illustrated; a Matlab (c) code (Natick, MA, USA) is provided as supplementary material. This product is ordinarily addressed to study volcanic dynamics and improve the forecasting of the volcanic activity. Nevertheless, it can be a useful tool to investigate the surface temperature field of any areas subjected to thermal anomalies, both of natural and anthropic origin.

Reconstructions of the southern annular mode (SAM) during the last millennium	PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT												The leading mode of atmospheric variability in the Southern Hemisphere is the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), which affects the atmosphere and ocean from the mid-latitudes to the Antarctic. However, the short instrumental record of the SAM does not adequately represent its multi-decadal to centennial-scale variability. Long palaeoclimatic reconstructions of the SAM would improve our understanding of its low frequency behavior and its effects on regional temperature, rainfall, sea ice, and ecosystem processes. In this progress report, we review three published palaeoclimatic reconstructions available for understanding multi-decadal to centennial-scale variability of the SAM. Reconstructions reviewed here show similar patterns of decadal SAM variability during the last two centuries, but earlier centuries are less coherent. Reconstructions clearly maintain similar trends towards more positive SAM states since the onset of significant anthropogenic climate forcing from rising greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and ozone depletion and these excursions appear unprecedented over at least the last 500 years. We describe how new multi-proxy reconstructions of the SAM could further improve our understanding of its long-term variability and effects across all geographic sectors of the Southern Hemisphere. Here, we recommend careful selection and development of proxies in SAM-sensitive regions and seasons. In particular, proxies related to cool-season conditions and from the poorly-sampled Indian Ocean sector would allow for a true circumpolar and year-round reconstruction of past SAM variability.

Trace metal concentrations in euryhaline fish species from Chilika lagoon: human health risk assessment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Five trace metals, viz. copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), mercury (Hg) and zinc (Zn), in three organs (muscle, gills and liver) of four selected fish species (Mugil cephalus, Eleutheronema tetradactylum, Etroplus suratensis and Daysciaena albida) from Chilika lagoon were studied monthly to assess the concentration level and human health risk via consumption. The average and range of metal concentrations (mu g g(-1)) in flesh of the fish species were found to be: Cu (4.15, 3.47-5.03), Cr (0.25, 0.04-0.63), Fe (19.72, 14.51-27.30), Hg (0.07, 0.05-0.08) and Zn (8.09, 4.41-11.36). The metal concentrations measured in the edible muscles of all fish species were found lower as compared to the contents in liver and gill. Analysis of variance revealed a significant difference in trace metal accumulation among the organs (p < 0.001), but the difference among the seasons and fish species was insignificant (p > 0.05), with the exception of Zn accumulation (p < 0.05). The estimated daily intake (EDI) of the trace metals through the consumption of fish as a dietary component varied widely from 0.48 to 21.33% with respect to the corresponding permissible tolerable daily intake (PTDI). The target hazard quotients (THQs) calculated considering these EDIs for individual metals indicated that the Cr and Cu metals dominantly contributed (avg. THQ = 0.198) to represent the hazard index (HI) than other metals (avg. THQ = 0.029). The average HI determined for all the species was < 1 (0.484, ranged 0.255-0.605), indicating that these fish species of Chilika are safe for human consumption.

In this study, water quality and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption and fluorescence were investigated in different seasons to elucidate how hydraulic connectivity and evaporation may affect the water quality and variability of CDOM in the lake. Mean suspended solids and turbidity were significantly higher in the upstream tributaries than in the lake, the difference being notably more pronounced in the wet than in the dry season. A markedly higher mean first principal component (PC1) score, which was significantly positively related to protein-like components, and a considerably lower fluorescence peak integration ratio -I-C:I-T, indicative, of the terrestrial humic-like CDOM contribution percentage, were observed in the lake than in the upstream tributaries. Correspondingly, notably higher contribution percentages of terrestrial humiclike components were observed in the river mouth areas than in the remaining lake regions. Furthermore, significantly higher mean turbidity, and notably lower mean conductivity and salinity, were recorded in the southwestern Kaidu river mouth than. in the remaining lake regions in the wet season. Notably higher mean salinity is recorded in Lake Bosten than in upstream tributaries. Autochthonous protein-like associated amino-acids and also PC1 scores increased significantly with increasing salinity. We conclude that the dynamics of water quality and CDOM composition in remote arid Lake Bosten are strongly driven by evaporation and also the hydraulic connectivity between the upstream tributaries and the downstream lake.

Monthly ET in the Poyang Lake wetland during 2008-2017 was estimated by the remote sensing ET retrieval model based on a Nonparametric approach (RS-NP). And the spatio-temporal variation of ET and the influencing factors were analyzed. New hydrological insights for the region: The validation revealed the usefulness of the RS-NP model in a moist region and yielded a relative error of 6 % (12 %) in the wet (dry) season. Temporally, the average yearly ET was 884 mm with ET/P (precipitation) of 55 %-65 %. The monthly ET/P ratio increased significantly from 40 %-50 % from January to May to 90 %-130 % from July to October. ET in June was lower by over 20 % than that in May and July with the lowest ET/P value (33 %). Spatially, relatively larger and lower ET occurred in the northern and southern parts, respectively. The main factors affecting ET variability were downwelling shortwave radiation (similar to 2/3 contribution) and water area (similar to 1/3 contribution) at the monthly scale. Precipitation and surface temperature dominantly controlled the hysteresis effects with a lag of one month and regulated LE monthly variations.

This paper examines streamflow datasets at four hydrological stations and meteorological observations at 79 weather stations to reveal the streamflow changes and underlying drivers in four typical watersheds (Meigang, Saitang, Gaosha, and Xiashan) within Poyang Lake Basin from 1961 to 2000. Most of the less than 90th percentile of daily streamflow in each watershed increases significantly at different rates. As an important indicator of the seasonal changes in the streamflow, CT (the timing of the mass center of the streamflow) in each watershed shows a negligible change. The annual streamflow in each watershed increases at different rates, with a statistically significant trend (at the 5 % level) of 9.87 and 7.72 mm year(-1), respectively, in Meigang and Gaosha watersheds. Given the existence of interactions between precipitation and PE, the original climate elasticity of streamflow can not reflect the relationship of streamflow with precipitation and PE effectively. We modify this method and find the modified climate elasticity to be more accurate and reasonable using the correlation analysis. The analyses from the modified climate elasticity in the four watersheds show that a 10 % increase (decrease) in precipitation will increase (decrease) the annual streamflow by 14.1-16.3 %, while a 10 % increase (decrease) in PE will decrease (increase) the annual streamflow by -10.2 to -2.1 %. In addition, the modified climate elasticity is applied to estimate the contribution of annual precipitation and PE to the increasing annual streamflow in each watershed over the past 40 years. Our result suggests that the percentage attribution of the increasing precipitation is more than 59 % and the decreasing in PE is less than 41 %, indicating that the increasing precipitation is the major driving factor for the annual streamflow increase for each watershed.

We use sediment records from four lakes to develop a 2000-yr fire and vegetation history in a highly flammable tundra region and compare this history with previously published fire records to examine spatial and temporal variability of tundra burning across Arctic Alaska. The four sites span a modern climatic gradient in the Noatak National Preserve, from warmer, drier down-valley locations to cooler, generally moister up-valley locations. Modern vegetation varies from herb-to shrub-dominated tundra from down-to up-valley sites, and pollen data suggest that this spatial pattern in vegetation persisted over the past two millennia. Peaks in macroscopic charcoal accumulation provide estimates of fire-event return intervals (FRIs), which did not vary significantly at millennial time scales but did vary across space. Down-valley sites burned relatively frequently over the past two millennia, with median FRIs of 150 years (95% CI 101-150) and FRI distributions statistically similar to those from ancient shrub tundra and modern boreal forest. At up-valley sites FRIs were significantly longer than those at down-valley sites, with a median FRI of 218 years (95% CI 128-285). These differences likely reflect the cooler growing-season temperatures and lower evaporative demand at up-valley sites, but local-scale variability in vegetation may have also shaped tundra fire regimes. Comparisons with other long-term fire records in Alaska reveal that the tundra biome can sustain a wide range of burning, with individual FRIs from as low as 30 years to more than 5000 years. These records together indicate that frequent tundra burning has occurred under a range of climatic and vegetation scenarios. The variety of tundra fire histories within Alaska suggests that the ecological impacts of tundra burning likewise vary widely, with important implications for wildlife-habitat maintenance and for the responses of tundra biophysical and biogeochemical processes to climatic change.

THE EPIPHYTIC MICROBIOTA OF THE GLOBALLY WIDESPREAD MACROALGA CLADOPHORA GLOMERATA (CHLOROPHYTA, CLADOPHORALES)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise of the study: The filamentous chlorophyte Cladophora produces abundant nearshore populations in marine and freshwaters worldwide, often dominating periphyton communities and producing nuisance growths under eutrophic conditions. High surface area and environmental persistence foster such high functional and taxonomic diversity of epiphytic microfauna and microalgae that Cladophora has been labeled an ecological engineer. We tested the hypotheses that (1) Cladophora supports a structurally and functionally diverse epiphytic prokaryotic microbiota that influences materials cycling and (2) mutualistic host-microbe interactions occur. Because previous molecular sequencing-based analyses of the microbiota of C. glomerata found as western Lake Michigan beach drift had identified pathogenic associates such as Escherichia coli, we also asked if actively growing lentic C. glomerata harbors known pathogens. Methods: We used 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing to examine the microbiota of C. glomerata of Lake Mendota, Dane, Wisconsin, United States, during the growing season of 2011, at the genus-or species-level to infer functional phenotypes. We used correlative scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy to describe major prokaryotic morphotypes. Key results: We found microscopic evidence for diverse bacterial morphotypes, and molecular evidence for ca. 100 distinct sequence types classifiable to genus at the 80% confidence level or species at the 96-97% level within nine bacterial phyla, but not E. coli or related human pathogens. Conclusions: We inferred that bacterial epiphytes of lentic C. glomerata have diverse functions in materials cycling, with traits that indicate the occurrence of mutualistic interactions with the algal host.					; Zulkifly, Shahrizim/AFD-1423-2022	Zulkifly, Shahrizim/0000-0001-7809-6469; 													0002-9122	1537-2197				SEP	2012	99	9					1541	1552		10.3732/ajb.1200161	http://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1200161								22947483					WOS:000308689800024

Seasonality of biological and physical systems as indicators of climatic variation and change	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Evidence-based responses to climate change by society require operational and sustained information including biophysical indicator systems that provide up-to-date measures of trends and patterns against historical baselines. Two key components linking anthropogenic climate change to impacts on socio-ecological systems are the periodic inter- and intra-annual variations in physical climate systems (seasonality) and in plant and animal life cycles (phenology). We describe a set of national indicators that reflect sub-seasonal to seasonal drivers and responses of terrestrial physical and biological systems to climate change and variability at the national scale. Proposed indicators and metrics include seasonality of surface climate conditions (e.g., frost and freeze dates and durations), seasonality of freeze/thaw in freshwater systems (e.g., timing of stream runoff and durations of lake/river ice), seasonality in ecosystem disturbances (e.g., wildfire season timing and duration), seasonality in vegetated land surfaces (e.g., green-up and brown-down of landscapes), and seasonality of organismal life-history stages (e.g., timings of bird migration). Recommended indicators have strong linkages to variable and changing climates, include abiotic and biotic responses and feedback mechanisms, and are sufficiently simple to facilitate communication to broad audiences and stakeholders interested in understanding and adapting to climate change.

Paleoenvironmental changes in the Hiwegi Formation (lower Miocene) of Rusinga Island, Lake Victoria, Kenya	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The lower Miocene of Rusinga Island (Lake Victoria, Kenya) is best known for its vertebrate fossil assemblage but the multiple stratigraphic intervals with well-preserved fossil leaves have received much less attention. The Hiwegi Formation has three fossil leaf-rich intervals, which span the entire formation from oldest to youngest: Kiahera Hill, R5, and R3. Here, we describe new fossil collections from Kiahera Hill and R3 and compared these floras to previous work from R5, as well as modern African floras. The oldest flora at Kiahera Hill was most similar to modern tropical rainforests or tropical seasonal forests and reconstructed as a warm and wet, closed forest. This was followed by a relatively dry and open environment at R5, which was reconstructed as a woodland to open tropical seasonal forest. The youngest flora at R3 was most similar to modern tropical seasonal forests and was reconstructed as a warm and wet spatially heterogenous forest. Floral composition of all three floras differed, but the Kiahera Hill and R3 floras were more similar to each other than either flora was to the R5 flora. The Kiahera Hill flora had few monocots or herbaceous taxa, was dominated by large leaves, and had higher species richness and greater evenness than the R3 flora. Our work, coupled with previous studies, suggests that the R3 landscape consisted of both closed forest areas and open areas with seasonal ponding. The absence of morphotypes from the R5 flora that were present in the Kiahera Hill and R3 floras provides evidence for local extirpation during the R5 time interval. Thus, this work indicates that the Hiwegi Formation on Rusinga Island samples multiple environments ranging from more closed tropical forests to more open woodlands in the Early Miocene and provides important context for the evolution and habitat preference of early apes.

To understand underlying issues about extreme rainfall occurrence and its key drivers, the present study investigated two distinct extreme rainfall events that caused massive losses in the western part of Burundi on November 11th, 2009 and February 9th, 2014. Different datasets have been used to depict which one captured reliable information of the two extreme rainfall events investigated. Analysis of different weather parameters was conducted using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) datasets. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model was also employed to analyse different parameters over different periods, thus prior, during, and after the occurrence of an extreme rainfall event. It was found that the two distinct rainfall events were induced by the combination of local convection enhanced by moist air from the Congo basin and abnormal conditions in the mid-upper layer. Instabilities in the lower and mid-upper layers mainly emanated from the changes in geopotential height and wind circulation. Local physical factors especially the topography and the presence of the Lake Tanganyika localized in the Western Rift Valley of Africa enhanced local convection which triggered rapid condensation that induced a heavy rainfall over the western part of Burundi. Weather conditions vary depending on the time or season of occurrence of the extreme rainfall events. This study will propel future studies on historical diagnosis and forecasting of extreme weather events over Burundi. It will also guide policy-makers to mitigate negative impacts expected from future occurrences of extreme weather events.

In this study we quantify the fate of riverine carbon within the Wuding River catchment on the Chinese Loess Plateau. Export of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC) exhibited pronounced spatial and temporal variability. While DOC concentration first presented a downward trend along the river course and then increased in the main-stem river, it showed no significant seasonal differences and was not sensitive to flow dynamics. This likely reflects the predominance of groundwater input over the entire year and its highly stable DOC. DIC concentration in the loess subcatchment is significantly higher than that in the sandy subcatchment, due largely to dissolution of carbonates that are abundant in loess. In addition, bulk particulate organic carbon content (POC%) showed strong seasonal variability with low values in the wet season owing to input of deeper soils by gully erosion. The downstream carbon flux was (7.0 +/- 1.9) x 10(10) g Cyr(-1) and dominated by DIC and POC. Total CO2 emissions from water surface were (3.7 +/- 0.6) x 10(10) g Cyr(-1). Radiocarbon analysis revealed that the degassed CO2 was 810-1890 years old, indicating the release of old carbon previously stored in soil horizons. Riverine carbon export in the Wuding River catchment has been greatly modified by check dams. Our estimate shows that carbon burial through sediment storage was (7.8 +/- 4.1) x 10(10) g Cyr(-1), representing 42% of the total riverine carbon export from terrestrial ecosystems on an annual basis ((18.5 +/- 4.5) x 10(10) g Cyr(-1)). Moreover, the riverine carbon export accounted for 16% of the catchment's net ecosystem production (NEP). It appears that a significant fraction of terrestrial NEP in this arid to semiarid catchment is laterally transported from the terrestrial biosphere to the drainage network.

J	Leisenring, M; Moradkhani, H				Leisenring, Marc; Moradkhani, Hamid			Analyzing the uncertainty of suspended sediment load prediction using sequential data assimilation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A first step in understanding the impacts of sediment and controlling the sources of sediment is to quantify the mass loading. Since mass loading is the product of flow and concentration, the quantification of loads first requires the quantification of runoff volume. Using the National Weather Service's SNOW-17 and the Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) models, this study employed particle filter based Bayesian data assimilation methods to predict seasonal snow water equivalent (SWE) and runoff within a small watershed in the Lake Tahoe Basin located in California, USA. A procedure was developed to scale the variance multipliers (a.k.a hyperparameters) for model parameters and predictions based on the accuracy of the mean predictions relative to the ensemble spread. In addition, an online bias correction algorithm based on the lagged average bias was implemented to detect and correct for systematic bias in model forecasts prior to updating with the particle filter. Both of these methods significantly improved the performance of the particle filter without requiring excessively wide prediction bounds. The flow ensemble was linked to a non-linear regression model that was used to predict suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) based on runoff rate and time of year. Runoff volumes and SSC were then combined to produce an ensemble of suspended sediment load estimates. Annual suspended sediment loads for the 5 years of simulation were finally computed along with 95% prediction intervals that account for uncertainty in both the SSC regression model and flow rate estimates. Understanding the uncertainty associated with annual suspended sediment load predictions is critical for making sound watershed management decisions aimed at maintaining the exceptional clarity of Lake Tahoe. The computational methods developed and applied in this research could assist with similar studies where it is important to quantify the predictive uncertainty of pollutant load estimates.

The examples discussed here illustrate how recent progress in the field of comparative physiology may provide a better mechanistic understanding of the ecological concepts of the fundamental and realized niches and thus provide insights into the impacts of anthropogenic disturbance. Here we argue that, as a link between physiological and ecological indicators of organismal performance, the mechanisms shaping aerobic scope and passive tolerance set the dimensions of an animal's niche, here defined as its capacity to survive, grow, behave, and interact with other species. We demonstrate how comparative studies of cod or killifish populations in a latitudinal cline have unraveled mitochondrial mechanisms involved in establishing a species' niche, performance, and energy budget. Riverine fish exemplify how the performance windows of various developmental stages follow the dynamic regimes of both seasonal temperatures and river hydrodynamics, as synergistic challenges. Finally, studies of species in extreme environments, such as the tilapia of Lake Magadi, illustrate how on evolutionary timescales functional and morphological shifts can occur, associated with new specializations. We conclude that research on the processes and time course of adaptations suitable to overcome current niche limits is urgently needed to assess the resilience of species and ecosystems to human impact, including the challenges of global climate change.

This has revealed consistent seasonal development of efficient subglacial drainage in the lower ablation area. While some hydrological models show qualitative agreement with field data, conflicting evidence (both field- and model-based) maintains uncertainty in the extent and rate of efficient drainage development under thick (similar to 1 km) ice. Here, we present the first simultaneous time series of directly-observed subglacial drainage evolution, supraglacial hydrology and ice dynamics over 11 weeks in a large GrIS catchment. We demonstrate development of a fast/efficient subglacial drainage system extending from the margin to beneath ice >900 m thick, which then persisted with little response to highly variable moulin inputs including extreme melt events and extended periods (2 weeks) of low melt input. This efficient system evolved within similar to 3 weeks at a moulin initiated when a fracture intersected a supraglacial river (rather than hydrofracture and lake drainage). Ice flow response to surface melt inputs at this site follows a pattern commonly observed in the lower GrIS ablation area, and by assuming a strong relationship between ice dynamics and subglacial hydrology, we infer that efficient subglacial drainage evolution is widespread under 900 m-thick ice in west Greenland. This time series of tracer transit characteristics through a developing and then persistent efficient drainage system provides a unique data set with which to validate and constrain existing numerical drainage system models, extending their capability for simulating drainage system evolution under current and future conditions.

J	Singha, P; Pal, S				Singha, Pankaj; Pal, Swades			Influence of hydrological state on trophic state in dam induced seasonally inundated flood plain wetland	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												A Good many research works focused on investigating wetland habitat state and trophic state (TS) but as far the knowledge is concerned, very little attention was paid to the hy-drological state (HS) modelling of wetlands, and no such attention was paid on exploring the linkage between HS and TS. But it is very essential to explore the role of hydrological characters on TS in order to frame hydrological management strategies. Considering this, the present study intended to build HS models using image-driven hydrological compo-nents like water presence frequency, hydro-period, water depth; to estimate trophic state index (TSI) using field-driven water samples and, finally linking HS and TSI of the wetland. Successful results can open up a new approach to improve the strategies for water quality and ecological efficiency management. Machine learning models were applied for building the HS model and Carlson's TSI method was applied to explore water quality and ecolog-ical state. The ordinary least square regression was applied for linking HS and TSI. Results showed that hydrological modification and associated causes obliterated 32.32 km2 of wet-land between the pre-dam and post-dam periods. The support vector machine model was found as the best-suited HS model to all the applied models. TSI was found poor over a wider part of the wetland, especially over the hydrologically poor patches of the wetland. The hydrological worsening is a cause for the worsening of TS. So, it can be stated that managing hydrological components is a good way to manage TS.(c) 2023 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Results indicated the average lake area in the dry seasons was 1,015 km(2). There was a considerable inter-annual variation of the minimum lake area that varied from 702.8 km(2) to 1,259.7 km(2). Poyang Lake experienced the most severe dryness in the 2000s, resulting in an average lake area during 2001 to 2010 of 124 km(2) less than that of the preceding period. During the dry seasons, the catchment of the river discharge is likely the primary cause of the changes in lake area. This study evaluated the inter-annual variations of the Poyang Lake over a period of 50 years. Our results may provide support for an integrated management of the lake-catchment system, securing the water supply.					; Li, Mengfan/JDM-5034-2023; ZHANG, Qi/MFJ-8647-2025	Li, Yunliang/0000-0002-0708-9138; 													0029-1277	2224-7955				DEC	2016	47			1			40	50		10.2166/nh.2016.308	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2016.308													WOS:000391003300004

Taphonomy of the fossil insects of the middle Eocene Kishenehn Formation	ACTA PALAEONTOLOGICA POLONICA												The lacustrine oil shales of the Coal Creek Member of the Kishenehn Formation in northwestern Montana comprise a relatively unstudied middle Eocene fossil insect locality. Herein, we detail the stratigraphic position of the fossiliferous unit, describe the insect fauna of the Coal Creek locality and document its bias towards very small but remarkably preserved insects. In addition, the depositional environment is examined and the mineral constituents of the laminations that comprise the varves of the Kishenehn oil shale are defined. Fifteen orders of insects have been recorded with the majority of all insects identified as aquatic with the families Chironomidae (Diptera) and Corixidae (Hemiptera) dominant. The presence of small aquatic insects, many of which are immature, the intact nature of >90% of the fossil insects and the presence of Daphnia ephippia, all indicate that the depositional environment was the shallow margin of a large freshwater lake. The fossil insects occur within fossilized microbial mat layers that comprise the bedding planes of the oil shale. Unlike the fossiliferous shales of the Florissant and Okanagan Highlands, the mats are not a product of diatomaceous algae nor are diatom frustules a component of the sediments or the varve structure. Instead, the varves are composed of very fine eolian siliciclastic silt grains overlaid with non-diatomaceous, possibly cyanobacteria-derived microbial mats which contain distinct traces of polyaromatic hydrocarbons. A distinct third layer composed of essentially pure calcite is present in the shale of some exposures and is presumably derived from the seasonal warming-induced precipitation of carbonate from the lake's waters. The Coal Creek locality presents a unique opportunity to study both very small middle Eocene insects not often preserved as compression fossils in most Konservat-Lagerstatte and the processes that led to their preservation.

J	Wallace, J; Corr, D; Kanaroglou, P				Wallace, Julie; Corr, Denis; Kanaroglou, Pavlos			Topographic and spatial impacts of temperature inversions on air quality using mobile air pollution surveys	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												We investigated the spatial and topographic effects of temperature inversions on air quality in the industrial city of Hamilton, located at the western tip of Lake Ontario, Canada. The city is divided by a 90-m high topographic scarp, the Niagara Escarpment, and dissected by valleys which open towards Lake Ontario. Temperature inversions occur frequently in the cooler seasons, exacerbating the impact of emissions from industry and traffic. This study used pollution data gathered from mobile monitoring surveys conducted over a 3-year period, to investigate whether the effects of the inversions varied across the city. Temperature inversions were identified with vertical temperature data from a meteorological tower located within the study area. We divided the study area into an upper and lower zone separated by the Escarpment and further into six zones, based on location with respect to the Escarpment and industrial and residential areas, to explore variations across the city. The results identified clear differences in the responses of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) to temperature inversions, based on the topographic and spatial criteria. We found that pollution levels increased as the inversion strengthened, in the lower city. However, the results also suggested that temperature inversions identified in the lower city were not necessarily experienced in the upper city with the same intensity. Further, pollution levels in the upper city appeared to decrease as the inversion deepened in the lower city, probably because of an associated change in prevailing wind direction and lower wind speeds, leading to decreased long-range transport of pollutants.

Sinninghe; Schouten, Stefan			Influence of lake water pH and alkalinity on the distribution of core and intact polar branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) in lakes	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) are bacterial membrane lipids, ubiquitously present in soils and peat bogs, as well as in rivers, lakes and lake sediments. Their distribution in soil is controlled mainly by pH and mean annual air temperature, but the controls on their distribution in lake sediments are less well understood. Several studies have found a relationship between the distribution of branched GDGTs in lake sediments and average lake water pH, suggesting an aquatic source for them, besides that for soil transported to the lake via erosion. We sampled the surface water suspended particulate matter (SPM) from 23 lakes in Minnesota and Iowa (USA), that vary widely in pH, alkalinity and trophic state. The SPM was analyzed for the concentration and distributions of core lipid (presumed fossil origin) and intact polar lipid (IPL, presumed to derive from living cells) branched GDGTs. The presence of substantial amounts (18-48%) of IPL-derived branched GDGTs suggests that branched GDGTs are likely of autochthonous origin. Temperature estimates based on their distribution using lake-specific calibrations agree reasonably with water temperature at time of sampling and average air temperature of the season of sampling. Importantly, a strong correlation between the distribution of branched GDGTs and lake water pH was found (r(2) 0.72), in agreement with a predominant in situ production. An stronger correlation was found with lake water alkalinity (r(2) 0.83), although the underlying mechanism that controls the relationship is not understood. Our results raise the potential for reconstructing pH/alkalinity of past lake environments, which could provide important knowledge on past developments in lake water chemistry.

Studies have shown sustained populations of enterococci within sediments of beaches but comprehensive surveys of multiple tidal zones on beaches in a regional area and their relationship to beach management decisions are limited. We sampled three tidal zones on eight South Florida beaches in Miami-Dade and Broward counties and found that enterococci were ubiquitous within South Florida beach sands although their levels varied greatly both among the beaches and between the supratidal, intertidal and subtidal zones. The supratidal sands consistently had significantly higher (p < 0.003) levels of enterococci (average 40 CFU/g dry sand) than the other two zones. Levels of enterococci within the subtidal sand correlated with the average level of enterococci in the water (CFU/100mL) for the season during which samples were collected (r(s) = 0.73). The average sand enterococci content over all the zones on each beach correlated with the average water enterococci levels of the year prior to sand samplings (r(s) = 0.64) as well as the average water enterococci levels for the month after sand samplings (r(s) = 0.54). Results indicate a connection between levels of enterococci in beach water and sands throughout South Florida's beaches and suggest that the sands are one of the predominant reservoirs of enterococci impacting beach water quality. As a result, beaches with lower levels of enterococci in the sand had fewer exceedences relative to beaches with higher levels of sand enterococci. More research should focus on evaluating beach sand quality as a means to predict and regulate marine recreational water quality. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kellner, E				Kellner, Elke			Social Acceptance of a Multi-Purpose Reservoir in a Recently Deglaciated Landscape in the Swiss Alps	SUSTAINABILITY												Climate change impacts such as shrinking glaciers and decreasing snow cover are expected to cause changes in the water balance throughout the 21st century. New proglacial lakes in recently deglaciated areas could be used for mitigation measures such as hydropower production and adaptation measures to temporarily retain water and transfer it seasonally to compensate for seasonal water scarcity. Such multi-purpose reservoirs could counterbalance the water currently provided by glaciers and the seasonal snowpack. However, new dam projects often face various conflicts due to their impact on nature, biodiversity, and the landscape. This article presents the determinants for social acceptance of the first reservoir in a recently deglaciated landscape in the Swiss Alps. Three main determinants were identified: (1) the forthcoming popular vote on the national Swiss Energy Strategy 2050; (2) the participatory process, which contains a polycentric design; and (3) the project area, which does not yet have protected status. The three determinants facilitate social acceptance of the dam project, but lead to less attention on using the stored water for multiple services. These findings have implications on sustainable development, because dams in recently deglaciated areas support the transition to renewable energy sources, but transform a natural resource system into a hydroelectric landscape.

To address this issue, we use the hydro-climatic data from five sub-basins in Poyang Lake basin in the southeast China over the past 50 years, to investigate the annual and seasonal trends of streamflow and the correlations between streamflow and climatic variables. The Theil-Sen Approach and the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test are applied to identify the trends in the annual and seasonal streamflow, precipitation and evapotranspiration series. It was found that annual and seasonal streamflow of all the stations had increasing trends except Lijiadu station in wet season. Only 37.5% hydro-stations in annual streamflow increased significantly, while most stations increased at 95% significance level in dry season. Trends in annual and seasonal precipitation during the whole period were generally not as significant as those in evapotranspiration. The correlations between streamflow and climate variables (precipitation and evapotranspiration) were detected by the Pearson's test. The results showed that streamflow in the Poyang Lake basin are more sensitive to changes in precipitation than potential evapotranspiration.

This is potentially more complex for omnivores whose diets span a wide range of food resources. We conducted seasonal field samplings in Patagonian lakes and analyzed the relationship between seston (SES) quality parameters and the delta N-15 and N-15 of an omnivorous copepod, Boeckella gracilipes (Bg). We also performed a 7-day laboratory starvation experiment, an extreme form of nutritional stress, to investigate if lack of food led to changes in delta N-15(Bg) values. Our field results showed that increasing values of the seston carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N-SES), chlorophyll a (Chl a), and delta N-15(SES) were related to higher delta N-15(Bg) values. C:N-SES and Chl a were also positively related to N-15; yet, C:N-SES alone explained 70% of the variation. C:N-SES values correlated with the presence of mixotrophic algae and ciliates that are key food resources for B. gracilipes. In our laboratory starvation experiment, the delta N-15(Bg) values increased significantly, pointing to use of internal N sources; yet, the change associated with starvation was less pronounced than that related to C:N-SES changes in the field, suggesting depletion of the substrate pool in the former. We found that N-15 values of omnivorous species consuming a low-quality diet would be higher than that from a conspecific with a high-quality diet; though fasting animals would show intermediate values.

J	Malik, RN; Hashmi, MZ; Huma, Y				Malik, Riffat Naseem; Hashmi, Muhammad Zaffar; Huma, Yasmin			Heavy metal accumulation in edible fish species from Rawal Lake Reservoir, Pakistan	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The aim of the present study was to describe the accumulation of trace metals in the liver, kidney, gills, muscles, and skin of four edible fish species (Tor putitora, Cirrhinus mrigala, Labeo calbasu, and Channa punctatus) of Rawal Lake Reservoir, Pakistan. The fish samples were collected in the pre-monsoon (May 2008) and post-monsoon (October 2007) seasons and were analyzed for heavy metals by using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Kidney and liver showed relatively high concentrations of heavy metals. The accumulation of metals in the different organs of the fish (skin, muscles, and gills) in post-monsoon was higher than in pre-monsoon. In pre-monsoon, the metals followed the trend Zn > Pb > Fe > Cr > Ni > Mn > Co > Cu > Cd > Li, while in the post-monsoon season, the trend was Fe > Pb > Cr > Ni > Zn > Cu > Co > Mn > Cd > Li. The concentrations of Ni, Cr, and Pb in the muscle of all fish species were higher than the WHO guideline values of heavy metals in fishes for human consumption except in T. putitora. Cu level was nearly equal to the WHO maximum levels in C. mrigala and L. calbasu, while it was lower in T. putitora and C. punctatus. It is strongly advocated that risk assessment studies should be conducted and there is an urgent need for water quality restoration and management of Rawal Lake Reservoir.					; Hashmi, Muhammad Zaffar/F-3427-2015; Malik, Riffat/ABF-4886-2020	Malik, Riffat Naseem/0000-0003-4345-6000; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2014	21	2					1188	1196		10.1007/s11356-013-1992-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-1992-3								23884877					WOS:000329243700037
J	Girdner, S; Mack, J; Buktenica, M				Girdner, Scott; Mack, Jeremy; Buktenica, Mark			Impact of nutrients on photoacclimation of phytoplankton in an oligotrophic lake measured with long-term and high-frequency data: implications for chlorophyll as an estimate of phytoplankton biomass	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Chlorophyll measurements are commonly used to estimate phytoplankton biomass. However, phytoplankton readily acclimate to variations in light through a range of phenotypic responses, including major adjustments in chlorophyll pigmentation at the cellular level. The ratio of pigment chlorophyll to carbon concentration (Chl:C) is a commonly used metric in the oceanographic community to explore photoacclimation responses to varied light levels, yet is relatively rare in freshwater studies. Here we explore how nutrient variability impacted summertime Chl:C ratios of a natural phytoplankton community throughout the water column of a stratified oligotrophic lake. We utilized both long-term (18-24 years) and high-frequency (daily) data from Crater Lake, Oregon, a deep mountain lake with little anthropogenic disturbance. As expected, fluctuation in nutrients had a strong impact on phytoplankton particle density, primary productivity, light penetration, and water clarity. However, chlorophyll concentration did not register predictable changes even though the vertical location of the deep chlorophyll maximum was responsive to the overlying algal density. The impact of elevated nutrients on the Chl:C ratio was further complicated by upward shifts in chlorophyll distribution. The muted response of chlorophyll concentration to nutrients may be partially explained by variations in phytoplankton community composition or iron stress.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2020	847	8					1817	1830		10.1007/s10750-020-04213-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04213-1													WOS:000527934500002

An improved methodology to estimate river stage and discharge using Jason-2 satellite data	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Satellite altimetry over inland water bodies is a technique to estimate water level of rivers, lakes and reservoirs. In this study river flow characteristics such as water level and discharge is estimated using Jason-2, 20 Hz waveform data. An improved approach is adopted to retrieve the water level information over the braided reaches of the Brahmaputra river. The morphological dynamics of braided rivers often makes it difficult to retrieve water level accurately. In the proposed methodology, supplementary information from microwave and optical images of monsoon and non-monsoon seasons is used to establish the virtual stations over the main channel of the river. A nested approach is adopted to create dynamic virtual stations to address the frequent channel shifting phenomena over the braided reaches of the river. The results indicate that, there is high variation in backscattering coefficient, which ranges from mean value of 35 dB during the non-monsoon season to 48 dB during the monsoon season. It clearly highlights the seasonal variability of river flow in the Brahmaputra. The water level retrieval is done using Ice-1 retracking algorithm. The statistical analysis of retrieved water level have shown good agreement with in situ (observed) water levels when compared for Jason-2 satellite tracks 53, 166, 231 and 242 passing over the Brahmaputra river. The water level information is converted into discharge time series for the satellite 166 using the rating curve of Guwahati gauge station. The root mean square error of retrieved water levels is in the range of 50-55 cm. Water level retrieved using proposed methodology are compared with Hydroweb and DAHITI water level product. It was found that proposed methodology has enhanced the altimeter derived water level accuracy for the different reaches of the braided Brahmaputra river. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

When such changes occur, soil moisture under disturbed canopy may become either drier or wetter, depending on the interplay between small-scale hydrological processes, tree-scale vegetation function, and meteorological forcing. Understanding the contributing factors that impact small-scale soil water dynamics is vital for predicting long-term and larger-scale changes of forest hydrology following disturbances, succession, and management processes. In this study, we initiated half-hourly, three-meter deep measurements of soil moisture at four plots in a northern temperate mixed forest near the University of Michigan Biological Station. Two of the plots (one aspen- and the other oak-dominated) are located near the AmeriFlux tower; this forest area represents an undisturbed control site. Two other plots are located near the Forest Accelerated Succession Experiment (FASET) flux tower. An intermediate disturbance was prescribed in this area through stem girdling of all canopy-dominant, early successional aspen and birch trees to simulate the anticipated large-scale succession process in the Upper Great Lakes area. The data collected at the four plots provide observational evidence of changes in hydrological dynamics that were induced by species-specific crown-scale disturbances of the canopy structure. Data analysis reveals that the soil water storage under the girdled aspen was persistently higher, as compared to the undisturbed plots over the observational period of 2009-2011. The study argues that the larger water storage resulted from increased net precipitation and reduced transpiration during growing seasons following the girdling operation. These processes "outcompeted" the presumably enhanced interception and transpiration by understory plants as well as increased soil evaporation. Additionally, surface soil layer at the disturbed plot exhibited highest temporal variability among all monitored plots. The moisture profiles at the four plots were different, with the disturbed plot exhibiting relatively wetter shallow soil layers. Furthermore, water loss at the disturbed plot was concentrated in shallower soil layers, signifying a shift of uptake and/or change of dominant processes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Along with the rise of cattle farming in the region, tanneries are becoming more common and threatening environmental quality, since the effluents from this activity are rich in Cr. The objective of this study was to evaluate the seasonal and spatial dynamics of Cr in fish with different feeding habits from Puruzinho Lake, located in the Madeira River basin, also determining the daily intake of Cr associated with the consumption of these fish by the population that lives around the lake. Seasonality and feeding habits directly affected Cr dynamics in fish (p < 0.0001), with medians of Cr concentration ranging between 0.07 mg kg(-1) in the species Cichla pleiozona, a carnivorous fish, and 0.62 mg kg(-1) in Mylossoma duriventre, a herbivorous fish. The high Cr concentrations in M. duriventre were related to the biodilution effect of Cr in the trophic chain (R-2 = 0.14, p < 0.0001). The consumption of M. duriventre by the population was associated with the highest daily intake of Cr (55.5 mu g center dot day(-1)), exceeding the recommended limits of Cr intake (35 mu g center dot day(-1)).

Influence of the source of spawners? origin on oocyte maturity stages and suitability for artificial reproduction of wild pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) females during spawning season	ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE												Pikeperch is one of the major new fish species in freshwater aquaculture. Artificial reproduction is difficult in this species, and many aspects require further study. These include synchronization of female maturation, latency time, gamete quality and spawner survival rate. For these reasons, many fish farmers must constantly replenish their spawning pikeperch stock, often with wild fish. Data on the suitability for the reproduction of wild fish obtained in several lakes during the reproduction period were collected in this study. The findings indicated that larger fish (> 1.5 kg BW) and those obtained in larger and deeper lakes (> 12.0 m mean depth vs. < 5.0 m mean depth, respectively, for deep and shallow lakes) were more valuable to fish farmers during the spawning season when they were obtained because a higher percentage of suitability for artificial reproduction and a higher embryo survival rate was observed for them. The mean embryo survival rate was high and was 84.5 +/- 3.9 % on the 3rd day after fertilization and 79.7 +/- 3.4 % at hatching. Among the group of the smallest females (< 1.5 kg), the highest percentage of nonsynchronous oocyte maturation occurred. This result demonstrated the successful procedure of both artificial reproduction and a successful method for selecting females for spawning.

Density and temperature were determined in the field and all samples were analyzed for their major and a few minor solutes. The activity of H2O (a(H2O)) in the brines was calculated, and the degree of evaporation (DE) was established using Sr2+ as a conservative solute. The relations between density and water activity were obtained by polynomial regression, and the relation between the lake's volume and level was established using Hall's (1996) hypsographic model for the Dead Sea basin. Relating the results to the modern, long-term relative humidity (RH) over the basin shows that (a) The lowermost attainable level of a terminal lake undergoing evaporation with no inflow is dictated by the median RH; this level represents equilibrium between the brine's aH2O and RH; (b) Small, saline water bodies with high surface to volume ratios (A/V), such as the hypersaline brines in the sinkholes, are very sensitive to short term changes in RH; in these, the brines' a(H2O) closely follows the seasonal changes; (c) the level decline of the Dead Sea due to evaporation under present climatic conditions and assuming no inflow to the lake may continue down to 516-537 m below mean sea level (bmsl), corresponding to a water activity range of 0.46-0.39 in its brine, in equilibrium with the overlying relative air humidity; this suggests that the lake level cannot drop more than similar to 100 m from its present level; and (d) The maximum RH values that existed over the precursor lake of the Dead Sea (Lake Lisan) during geologically reconstructed minima levels can be similarly calculated.

Multi-Dimensional Remote Sensing Analysis Documents Beaver-Induced Permafrost Degradation, Seward Peninsula, Alaska	REMOTE SENSING												Beavers have established themselves as a key component of low arctic ecosystems over the past several decades. Beavers are widely recognized as ecosystem engineers, but their effects on permafrost-dominated landscapes in the Arctic remain unclear. In this study, we document the occurrence, reconstruct the timing, and highlight the effects of beaver activity on a small creek valley confined by ice-rich permafrost on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska using multi-dimensional remote sensing analysis of satellite (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, Planet CubeSat, and DigitalGlobe Inc./MAXAR) and unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) imagery. Beaver activity along the study reach of Swan Lake Creek appeared between 2006 and 2011 with the construction of three dams. Between 2011 and 2017, beaver dam numbers increased, with the peak occurring in 2017 (n = 9). Between 2017 and 2019, the number of dams decreased (n = 6), while the average length of the dams increased from 20 to 33 m. Between 4 and 20 August 2019, following a nine-day period of record rainfall (>125 mm), the well-established dam system failed, triggering the formation of a beaver-induced permafrost degradation feature. During the decade of beaver occupation between 2011 and 2021, the creek valley widened from 33 to 180 m (~450% increase) and the length of the stream channel network increased from ~0.6 km to more than 1.9 km (220% increase) as a result of beaver engineering and beaver-induced permafrost degradation. Comparing vegetation (NDVI) and snow (NDSI) derived indices from Sentinel-2 time-series data acquired between 2017 and 2021 for the beaver-induced permafrost degradation feature and a nearby unaffected control site, showed that peak growing season NDVI was lowered by 23% and that it extended the length of the snow-cover period by 19 days following the permafrost disturbance. Our analysis of multi-dimensional remote sensing data highlights several unique aspects of beaver engineering impacts on ice-rich permafrost landscapes. Our detailed reconstruction of the beaver-induced permafrost degradation event may also prove useful for identifying degradation of ice-rich permafrost in optical time-series datasets across regional scales. Future field- and remote sensing-based observations of this site, and others like it, will provide valuable information for the NSF-funded Arctic Beaver Observation Network (A-BON) and the third phase of the NASA Arctic-Boreal Vulnerability Experiment (ABoVE) Field Campaign.					; witharana, chandi/C-9074-2015; Miller, Charles/G-7854-2017	Miller, Charles/0000-0002-9380-4838; Clark, Jason/0000-0002-4810-5261; Ward Jones, Melissa/0000-0002-3401-2515; Tape, Ken/0000-0002-1039-6868; Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711														2072-4292				DEC	2021	13	23							4863	10.3390/rs13234863	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13234863													WOS:000735102800001
J	Dai, X; Yu, ZB; Yang, GS; Xu, CY; Wan, RR				Dai, Xue; Yu, Zhongbo; Yang, Guishan; Xu, Chong-Yu; Wan, Rongrong			Investigation of inner-basin variation: Impact of large reservoirs on water regimes of downstream water bodies	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Large dams and reservoirs alter not only the natural flow regimes of streams and rivers but also their flooding cycles and flood magnitudes. Although the effect of dams and reservoirs has been reported for some vulnerable locations, the understanding of the inner-basin variation with respect to the effects remains limited. In this study, we analyse the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) built on the Changjiang mainstream (Yangtze River) to investigate the dam effect variations in the system of interconnected water bodies located downstream. We investigated the effect of flow alterations along the downstream river network using discharge time series at different gauging stations. The river-lake interactions (referring to the interactions between the Changjiang mainstream and its tributary lakes i.e. the Dongting and Poyang lakes) and their roles in modifying the TGD effect intensity were also investigated in the large-scale river-lake system. The results show that the water storage of the tributary lakes decreased after the activation of the TGD. Severe droughts occurred in the lakes, weakening their ability to recharge the Changjiang mainstream. As a consequence, the effect of the TGD on the Changjiang flow increase during the dry season diminished quickly downstream of the dam, whereas its impact on the flow decrease during the wet season gradually exacerbated along the mainstream, especially at sites located downstream of the lake outlets. Therefore, when assessing dam-induced hydrological changes, special attention should be paid to the changes in the storage of tributary lakes and the associated effects in the mainstream. This is of high importance for managing the water resource trade-offs between different water bodies in dam-affected riverine systems.

In Indus basin which forms in GB, there is a need to manage water in a sustainable way for the livelihood and economic activities of the downstream population. It is important to monitor water resources that include glaciers, snow-covered area, lakes, etc., besides traditional hydrological (point-based measurements by using the gauging station) and remote sensing-based studies (traditional satellite-based observations provide terrestrial water storage (TWS) change within few centimeters from the earth's surface); the TWS anomalies (TWSA) for the GB region are not investigated. In this study, the TWSA in GB region is considered for the period of 13 years (from January 2003 to December 2016). Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) level 2 monthly data from three processing centers, namely Centre for Space Research (CSR), German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ), and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), System Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)-driven Noah model, and in situ precipitation data from weather stations, were used for the study investigation. GRACE can help to forecast the possible trends of increasing or decreasing TWS with high accuracy as compared to the past studies, which do not use satellite gravity data. Our results indicate that TWS shows a decreasing trend estimated by GRACE (CSR, GFZ, and JPL) and GLDAS-Noah model, but the trend is not significant statistically. The annual amplitude of GLDAS-Noah is greater than GRACE signal. Mean monthly analysis of TWSA indicates that TWS reaches its maximum in April, while it reaches its minimum in October. Furthermore, Spearman's rank correlation is determined between GRACE estimated TWS with precipitation, soil moisture (SM) and snow water equivalent (SWE). We also assess the factors, SM and SWE which are the most efficient parameters producing GRACE TWS signal in the study area. In future, our results with the support of more in situ data can be helpful for conservation of natural resources and to manage flood hazards, droughts, and water distribution for the mountain regions.

In monsoon Asia, rice paddies provide habitats for aquatic species, but how their associated irrigation systems can affect downstream ecosystems is poorly understood. Here, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to estimate seasonal variations in benthic macroinvertebrate diversity and environments and quantified indirect effects of land use, especially of rice paddy areas, on benthic macroinvertebrate diversity through local environmental alteration. Our study site was the Yasu River tributary of Lake Biwa, Japan, and we performed our investigation during both irrigation and nonirrigation periods, representing different seasons. Seasonal variations in physical and chemical variables and diversity were observed. Seasonal particulate phosphorus concentrations to a large extent determined the abundance and community composition of benthic macroinvertebrates. SEM revealed that the proportions of forest, urban, and rice paddy areas in the catchment had significant indirect effects on biodiversity indices of local benthic macroinvertebrate communities. The proportion of forest area had robust negative effects on water temperature, but the overall indirect effects on the macroinvertebrate diversity contrasted between the two seasonal periods. The proportion of rice paddy area had a strongly negative indirect effect on the diversity through increased particulate phosphorous loading during the irrigation period, while the proportion of urban area had a significantly negative indirect effect during the nonirrigation period only. The seasonal negative impacts of rice paddy irrigation on benthic macroinvertebrate communities were possibly due to siltation arising from rice paddy soils. Our results have implications for environmental restoration and biodiversity conservation in catchment management.

The efficiency of using inputs for fish production in a hypereutrophic fishpond (Dehtar), was evaluated using organic carbon (OC), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) balances and measurement of ecosystem metabolism rates in 2015. Primary production and feeds were the main inputs of OC and contributed 82% and 13% to the total OC input, respectively. Feeds and manure were the major inputs of nutrients and contributed 73% and 86% of the total inputs of N and P, respectively. Ecosystem respiration, accumulation in water and accumulation in sediment were the main fates of OC, N and P, respectively. They accounted for 79%, 52% and 61% of OC, N and P inputs. The efficiency of using OC, N and P inputs to produce fish biomass was very low and represented 0.9%, 25% and 23% of total OC, N, and P inputs, indicating an excessive phytoplankton production and overdosing of fish feeds and manure. Dehtar pond was slightly autotrophic and phosphorus availability did not limit the phytoplankton growth. The low efficiency of using inputs was attributed to the low digestibility of raw cereals grain used as feed and the inability of planktonic food webs to transfer the primary production to fish due to high predatory pressure of fish stock on zooplankton. The primary production is an important input of OC in semi-intensive fishponds and should be considered in evaluations of fish production efficiency.

Water balance modeling of Upper Blue Nile catchments using a top-down approach	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The water balances of twenty catchments in the Upper Blue Nile basin have been analyzed using a top-down modeling approach based on Budyko's hypotheses. The objective of this study is to obtain better understanding of water balance dynamics of upper Blue Nile catchments on annual and monthly time scales and on a spatial scale of meso scale to large scale. The water balance analysis using a Budyko-type curve at annual scale reveals that the aridity index does not exert a first order control in most of the catchments. This implies the need to increase model complexity to monthly time scale to include the effects of seasonal soil moisture dynamics. The dynamic water balance model used in this study predicts the direct runoff and other processes based on the limit concept; i.e. for dry environments since rainfall amount is small, the aridity index approaches to infinity or equivalently evaporation approaches rainfall and for wet environments where the rainfall amount is large, the aridity index approaches to zero and actual evaporation approaches the potential evaporation. The uncertainty of model parameters has been assessed using the GLUE (Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation) methodology. The results show that the majority of the parameters are reasonably well identifiable. However, the baseflow recession constant was poorly identifiable. Parameter uncertainty and model structural errors could be the reason for the poorly identifiable parameter. Moreover, a multi-objective model calibration strategy has been employed to emphasize the different aspects of the hydrographs on low and high flows. The model has been calibrated and validated against observed streamflow time series and it shows good performance for the twenty study catchments in the upper Blue Nile. During the calibration period (1995-2000) the Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency (ENS) for monthly flow prediction varied between 0.52 to 0.93 (dominated by high flows), while it varied between 0.32 to 0.90 using logarithms of flow series (indicating the goodness of low flow simulations). The model is parsimonious and it is suggested that the calibrated parameters could be used after some more regionalization efforts to predict monthly stream flows in ungauged catchments of the Upper Blue Nile basin, which is the vast majority of catchments in that region.					; Mohamed, Yasir/J-1921-2012; Wenninger, Jochen/C-9977-2009; Mohamed, Yasir/LZE-4068-2025; Savenije, H/AAS-1883-2020; Uhlenbrook, Stefan/C-7468-2009	Savenije, Hubert/0000-0002-2234-7203; Mohamed, Yasir/0000-0002-3276-350X; Wenninger, Jochen/0000-0002-9242-3232; Uhlenbrook, Stefan/0000-0002-3926-2599													1027-5606	1607-7938					2011	15	7					2179	2193		10.5194/hess-15-2179-2011	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-15-2179-2011													WOS:000293268200009

Traditional dihe resulted to be a food of high nutritional quality, with an elevated content of high biological quality proteins, rich in mineral elements, with an interesting quantity of lipids containing essential unsaturated fatty acids, a generally sufficient and often very high content of folates, a good content of phenols and of vitamin E and an elevated content of carotenoid pigments, especially beta carotene. The dihe characteristics varied with the site and the season. Samples of dihe produced with a new experimental technique that allows to obtain a sand-free, microbiologically safer product, were also analysed. The comparison between traditional and improved dihe revealed that the improved technique is less protective of photosensitive and thermolabile nutrients, like folates, phenols, vitamin E and carotenoids. This study also revealed the presence, in both the traditional and the improved product, of heavy metals and other elements of toxicological interest.

Annual resolution fire scar histories provide data on fire frequency, extent, and severity, but also can be used to understand fire-climate-human interactions. This study used tree-ring dated fire scars from red pines (Pinus resinosa) at four sites in the Northern Sands Ecological Landscapes of Wisconsin to quantify the interactions among fire occurrence and seasonality, drought, and humans. New methods for assessing the influence of human ignitions on fire regimes were developed. A temporal and spatial index of wildland fire was significantly correlated (r = 0.48) with drought indices (Palmer Drought Severity Index, PDSI). Fire intervals varied through time with human activities that included early French Jesuit missions, European trade (fur), diseases, war, and land use. Comparisons of historical fire records suggest that annual climate in this region has a broad influence on the occurrence of fire years in the Great Lakes region.																			1999-4907					SEP	2016	7	9							189	10.3390/f7090189	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f7090189													WOS:000385428900007

Increased blubber cortisol in ice-entrapped beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas)	POLAR BIOLOGY												Entrapments of whales in sea ice occur occasionally in the Arctic and often last several weeks or months, resulting in emaciation or death of whales. These events provide a unique opportunity for investigating the physiological response to a prolonged or chronic stress in an otherwise healthy population of marine mammals. By measuring cortisol in blubber, a peripheral tissue, we expect to see a reflection of long-term or chronic stress rather than short-term or acute stress. Adipose tissue should be less subject to rapid changes compared to blood cortisol, reflecting stressors experienced over a longer period of time, and should not be affected by potential stress associated with sampling. We measured blubber cortisol of 29 beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) entrapped in November 2006 in Husky Lakes basin and 26 whales from the same population (Eastern Beaufort Sea) during regular seasonal harvests in July of 2006 and 2007. Mean cortisol concentrations (+/- SEM) were seven times higher in blubber from entrapped whales (1.76 +/- 0.32 ng/g wet weight) compared to whales from regular seasonal harvests (0.26 +/- 0.042 ng/g wet weight) and appeared to increase with whale age. Our results provide a measure of blubber cortisol from a prolonged stress and demonstrate blubber cortisol as a useful indicator of longer-term exposure to stress in beluga whales.

For decades this paradigm guided forestry in the Great Lakes region, where small harvest gaps were used to promote shade-tolerant species. However, recent attempts to regenerate a more diverse forest community, by varying harvest gap size, have been less successful, bringing the predominance of light into question. Here, we investigate the influence of light availability along with local seed production potential [Sigma(diameter(2)/distance(2))] (SPP), substrate availability, site quality, and nontree vegetation (NTV) on 8 tree species' initial density and survival in 19 stands located throughout the Northern Lower and Eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Larger-seeded, shade-tolerant to mid-tolerant sugar maple, red maple, and white ash seedlings were at least twice as abundant as those of any other species. Light availability was not a strong factor predicting seedling density, except for sugar maple, which showed a negative response to increasing light. In contrast, SPP had a strong positive influence on yellow birch, eastern hemlock, black cherry, and white ash seedling density, with evidence of local and regional seed source limitations. Substrate availability was an important factor influencing white pine and paper birch seedling density, as each species was significantly more abundant in plots dominated by bare mineral soil than in plots dominated by leaf litter. Collectively, these results suggest that from seed through two growing seasons, SPP and substrate availability can exert a stronger influence on seedling layer diversity than light availability created by harvest gaps.																			0015-749X	1938-3738				AUG 30	2016	62	4					440	448		10.5849/forsci.15-143	http://dx.doi.org/10.5849/forsci.15-143													WOS:000383399800010
J	Pein, J; Staneva, J				Pein, Johannes; Staneva, Joanna			Eutrophication hotspots, nitrogen fluxes and climate impacts in estuarine ecosystems: A model study of the Odra estuary system	OCEAN DYNAMICS												The Odra estuary in the southern Baltic Sea comprises the Odra (Szczecin) Lagoon, the Pomeranian Bay and a number of other shallow water areas and channels. Known for its abundance of fish, eutrophication in the Odra Lagoon is a pressing issue for science and environmental management representing a global problem: What determines the seasonal variability of nitrogen and nitrogen turnover in shallow water areas, and how does seasonal variability change due to climatic changes such as warming and sea level rise? How do such changes affect nutrient exports to the regional ocean? This study employs a high-resolution unstructured model system to investigate physical-biogeochemical interactions, nitrogen turnover, and conditions leading to nitrogen export to the Baltic Sea within the Odra estuary. The research comprises hindcast and a climatic experiment with modified water level and temperature inputs. The model reproduces the thermohaline dynamics of brackish shallow water areas, phytoplankton blooms and the variability of inorganic nitrogen. The simulations identify the dynamic partitioning of the Odra Lagoon into the highly eutrophic, lake-like Small Lagoon and more frequently flushed, zooplankton-rich Great Lagoon. Although the two years of the hindcast simulation feature very different boundary conditions in terms of river forcing, comparable patterns of seasonal nitrogen export emerge. In a climate change experiment with increased sea levels and global temperatures, the system appears sensitive, but remains stable with regard to nutrient transport and is therefore predictable. The climate change experiment reveals enhanced primary producer biomass concentrations, suggesting heightened eutrophication. While in the shallow waters of Odra Lagoon oxygen concentration remains relatively stable, oxygen depletion intensifies as the lagoon outflows enter the Pomeranian Bay. This phenomenon is linked to increased denitrification within the stratified Odra plume. Deeper, meandering channels, such as Swina, demonstrate resilience to oxygen reduction, influenced by sea level rise and enhanced currents. Based on the temporal-spatial high-resolution coupled, validated simulations, it is possible to develop tailor-made management solutions without having to run expensive and complicated observation campaigns in the shallow waters with complex topography.

Unfortunately, there is a lack of knowledge on the groundwater recharge and flow systems in the area. Multiple environmental tracers (delta O-18, ED, Cl-, CFCs and SF6) and a yearly record of rainfall, surface waters and groundwater were employed to characterize the recharge mechanism of the shallow groundwater seeping in the fractured rock of the Lake Nyos catchment (LNC). The delta O-18-delta D relationship of the rainfall events gave the Nyos Meteoric Water Line: delta D = 8.28 delta O-18 + 11.87. Inland moisture vapor may have impacted the isotopic composition of original vapor masses from Gulf of Guinea prior to precipitation. Shallow groundwater in the LNC shows a similar trend of enrichment in O-18 and D as surface waters indicating a well-mixed aquifer. The proportions of surface waters and rainfall in the groundwater reservoir were 87% and 13%, respectively. The high annual recharge rate (941 mm/yr) and the seasonal variability in the isotopic signatures of groundwater indicate a renewable aquifer system. CFCs apparent ages-based piston flow model revealed a young age (average of 24 a.) of the groundwater in the LNC. SF6-based ages were biased young as compared to relatively younger than CFCs-based ages, implying an additional terrigenic production of SF6. The conceptual model for groundwater flow suggests that three main flow regimes, mainly controlled by the physical properties of the rock heterogeneities govern the movement of water in the aquifer. The piston flow model appears, however, to be the better model to explain the flow regime in the highly faulted and fissured area where recharge occurs (similar to 1200-1600 masl). The rapid circulation and the low solubility lead to low mineralization. In the middle-lower area where waters circulate more in the weathered layer, exponential mixing model dominates, yielding more mineralized water. Downward to the valley, with prevailing gentle slope, interaction between surface and recently infiltrated groundwater better explain the observed similarity in the isotopic compositions and the mineralization of water.

Seasonal variations in local distribution of the animal, as well as fish presence, sand dredging, ship navigation, and bridges were examined as potential factors affecting the occurrence of the animals. Passive acoustic surveys were performed regularly from May 2007 to August 2010, near the conjunction of the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake. The distribution of the porpoises was seasonally site-specific. In May and August, the animals were detected more often at river junctions than in the lake, but vice versa from November to February. The rate of the porpoise detection was significantly higher in areas of fish presence than in areas of absence. The number of porpoises detected did not differ significantly between the sand dredging operation and the prohibition period (in 2008), although the number of vessels obviously declined in 2008. Ship traffic and bridges also did not appear to affect the presence of porpoises. These results showed the relative importance of the various environmental factors, which is important for conservation of not only Yangtze finless porpoise but also endangered isolated cetaceans.

Last 1000 years of environmental history in Southern Bucovina, Romania: A high resolution multi-proxy lacustrine archive	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Geo-ecological and landscape change studies at a local scale are scarce in Central-Eastern Europe and particularly in Romania. However, this focus is directly relevant to ecosystems and humans as both are dependent on local environmental changes. We perform a high-resolution, multi-proxy analysis of physical and geochemical sediment properties, coupled to plant macrofossil, pollen and charcoal analysis at Iezerul Sadovei Lake and present the first palaeoenvironmental reconstruction from Bucovina Mountains, the north-eastern Romania. The sedimentary record, spanning the last 950 years, is laminated throughout and reveals high intensity catchment responses to changes in hydrological conditions and human impact. Results show major landscape disturbances 950 years ago and during the last 200 years. The enhanced catchment instability from the onset of sedimentation to 1400 CE was characterised by landsliding and subsequent erosion and related mainly to natural factors. However, the most recent (since c. 1800 CE) environmental changes, i.e., deforestation, enhanced channel and slope erosion and lake in-filling are a consequence of direct human interventions. Changes in the composition and extent of forest cover were also driven by the combination of natural disturbances, climate variability and anthropogenic activities. From 1400 CE, and more clearly over the last 200 years, early successional and disturbed habitat taxa appeared to respond primarily to anthropogenic drivers, including forest management. The higher proportion of Abies alba (30%) and Fagus sylvatica (20%) in the local forest, and their dramatic decline, was recorded earlier (i.e., 1150 CE and 1400 CE respectively) than reported in other parts of the Romanian Carpathians. Using this palaeoenvironmental evidence as an analogue, projected climate changes, i.e., increased seasonal heavy precipitation and more frequent extreme events, superimposed on increasing human pressure are likely to lead to the destabilisation of the catchment through erosion and possible reactivation of landslides.

J	Liu, ZJ; Guo, SL; Guo, JL; Liu, P				Liu, Zhangjun; Guo, Shenglian; Guo, Jiali; Liu, Pan			The impact of Three Gorges Reservoir refill operation on water levels in Poyang Lake, China	STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT												The refill operation of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in the end of flood season significantly alters the water level regimes in Poyang Lake by reducing Yangtze River flow discharge. This study aims to investigate the impact of TGR refill operation on water level probability distribution of the Poyang Lake. The multiple linear regression model was established to estimate the water level with catchment inflow and Yangtze River flow as explanatory variables. A probability distribution of water level was derived and the refill operation effects were quantified by comparing the water level distribution at Xingzi station in the Poyang Lake before and after TGR. It is revealed that Yangtze River flow, rather than the catchment inflow is the dominant factor affecting the water level of Poyang Lake during TGR refill operation period. Results also show that the water level distribution estimated by the derived distribution method can be accepted as a theoretical distribution and has a comparable accuracy as the directly fitted distribution method before TGR. The derived method can be adapted to the environment change, thus is well suited for estimating the water level distribution after TGR. It is observed that Xingzi water levels with different design frequencies have been reduced due to the TGR refill operation. The water level reductions induced by TGR refill operation are 1.28, 0.87, and 0.50 m corresponding with design frequencies of 50, 90 and 99 %, respectively. The results from this work would improve the understanding of the TGR effects on the downstream river-lake system and provide scientific evidences for formulating better scheme for water resources management in this region.

Seasonal hypoxia was a natural feature of the coastal zone in the Little Belt, Denmark, during the past 8 ka	MARINE GEOLOGY												The extent of the hypoxic area in the Baltic Sea has rapidly expanded over the past century. Two previous phases of widespread hypoxia, coinciding with the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM; 8-4 ka before present; BP) and the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 2-0.8 ka BP), have been identified. Relatively little is known about bottom water redox conditions in the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea during the Holocene, however. Here we studied the geochemical composition of a sediment sequence from a currently seasonally hypoxic site in the Danish coastal zone, the Little Belt, retrieved during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 347 (Site M0059). The base of the studied sediment sequence consists of clays low in organic carbon (C-org), molybdenum (Mo) and iron sulfides (Fe-sulfides), and rich in iron oxides (Fe-oxides), indicative of a well-oxygenated, oligotrophic (glacial) meltwater lake. An erosional unconformity separates the glacial lake sediments from sediments that are rich in C-org. The absence of Mo, in combination with high C-org/S values, indicates that these sediments were deposited in a highly productive, well-oxygenated freshwater lake. The transition to modern brackish/marine conditions was very rapid, and subsequent continuous sequestration of Mo in the sediment and high ratios of reactive iron (Fe-HR) over total Fe (Fe-TOT) suggest (seasonal) hypoxia occurred over the last similar to 8 ka. Maxima in sediment Core, Mo and Fe-HR/Fe-TOT ratios during the HTM and MCA suggest that the hypoxia intensified. Our results demonstrate that the Little Belt is naturally susceptible to the development of seasonal hypoxia. While periods of climatic warming led to increased deoxygenation of bottom waters, high nutrient availability in combination with density stratification were likely the main drivers of hypoxia in this part of the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea during the Holocene.

Much of this warming occurred abruptly in 1987/1988. For brown trout populations, the warming resulted in an upward shift in thermal habitat that was accelerated by an increase in the incidence of temperature-dependent Proliferative Kidney Disease at the habitat's lower boundary. Because physical barriers restrict longitudinal migration in mountain regions, an upward habitat shift in effect implies habitat reduction, suggesting the likelihood of an overall population decrease. Extensive brown trout catch data documenting an altitudinally dependent decline indicate that such a climate-related population decrease has in fact occurred. Our analysis employs a quantitatively defined reference optimum temperature range for brown trout, based on the sinusoidal regression of seasonally varying field data.																			1354-1013	1365-2486				JAN	2006	12	1					10	26		10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.001051.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.001051.x													WOS:000234527600002

While recommended plant lists abound, there is limited research on which plant species support the greatest bee abundance and diversity. In many farm settings, drought-tolerant plant species adapted to well-drained sandy soils are needed, since wildflower plantings are typically not irrigated. We used a common garden experimental design to evaluate 51 drought-tolerant native perennial plant species, and 2 non-native plant species in three regions of Michigan for their ability to support honey bees (Apis mellifera L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae)) and wild bees. 1,996 honey bees and 2,496 wild bees were recorded visiting study plants. The wild bee community visiting plant species was dominated by Bombus spp. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) (25%), Halictus spp. (Hymenoptera: Halictidae) (23%), and Lasioglossum spp. (Hymenoptera: Halictidae) (16%). The number of honey bees and wild bees visiting study plants varied considerably, suggesting that bee groups have distinct preferences for plant species. Of the plant species assessed, Asclepias syriaca L. (Gentianales: Apocynaceae) (early season), Monarda fistulosa L. (Lamiales: Lamiaceae) (middle season), and Solidago speciosa Nutt. (Asterales: Asteraceae) (late season) were the three most attractive plant species to the entire bee community. Many other plants consistently attracted a high abundance of wild bees, honey bees, or both. Our results inform plant selection to support managed and wild bees as part of pollinator conservation programs in the Great Lakes region of the United States.

The dual-satellite configuration of Sentinel-3 makes it possible to monitor water level changes with great coverage and short time intervals. However, the potential of Sentinel-3's Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimetry (SRAL) data to enable operational monitoring of water levels across Jiangsu Province on a monthly basis has not yet been fully explored. This study demonstrated and validated the use of Sentinel-3's SRAL to generate accurate monthly water level estimations needed to inform water management strategies. The monthly water levels of lakes and reservoirs from 2017 to 2021 were produced using Sentinel-3 level-2 land products. Results showed that, compared with in situ data across eight studied lakes, all lakes presented R (Pearson correlation coefficient) values greater than 0.5 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values less than 1 m. Notably, water level estimates for Tai Lake, Gaoyou Lake, and Luoma Lake were particularly accurate, with R above 0.9 and RMSE below 0.5 m. Furthermore, the monthly water level estimates derived from the Sentinel-3 data showed consistent seasonal trends over the multi-year study period. The annual water level of all lakes did not change significantly, except for Shijiu Lake, of which the difference between the highest and lowest water level was up to about 5 m. Our findings confirmed the water level observation ability of Sentinel-3. The accuracy of water level monitoring could be influenced by internal water level differences, terrain features, as well as the area and shape of the lake. Larger lakes with more altimetry sampling points tended to yield higher accuracy estimates of water level fluctuations. These results demonstrate that the frequent, wide-area coverage offered by this satellite platform provides valuable hydrological information, especially across remote regions lacking in situ data. Sentinel-3 has immense potential to support improved water security in data-scarce regions.					wang, dongmei/R-8987-2018; Ferreira, Vagner/G-7486-2012; Xu, Jia/AAU-5779-2020	Liu, Chongbin/0000-0002-7922-4474; 														2072-4292				MAR	2024	16	5							808	10.3390/rs16050808	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16050808													WOS:001183030600001

However, there is no routine monitoring of water quality in the lake due to financial and institutional constraints in the surrounding countries. A combination of satellite data and a semi-analytical algorithm can provide an alternative for routine monitoring of water quality, especially in developing countries. In this study, we first compared the performance of two semi-analytical algorithms, Doron11 and Lee15, which can estimate Secchi disk depth (SD) from satellite data in Lake Malawi. Our results showed that even though the SD estimations from the two algorithms were very highly correlated, the Lee15 outperformed the Doron11 in Lake Malawi with high estimation accuracy (RMSE = 1.17 m, MAPE = 18.7%, R = 0.66, p < 0.05). We then evaluated water transparency in Lake Malawi using the SD values estimated from nine years of Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) data (2003-2011) with the Lee15 algorithm. Results showed that Lake Malawi maintained four water transparency levels throughout the study period (i.e., level 1: SD > 12 m; level 2: SD between 6-12 m; level 3: SD between 3-6 m; level 4: SD between 1.5-3 m). The level 1 and 2 water areas tended to shift or trade places depending on year or season. In contrast, level 3 and 4 water areas were relatively stable and constantly distributed along the southwestern and southern lakeshores. In general, Lake Malawi is dominated by waters with SD values larger than 6 m (>95%). This study represents the first overall and comprehensive analysis of water transparency status and spatiotemporal variation in Lake Malawi.					; Setiawan, Fajar/AAV-7115-2021; Matsushita, Bunkei/E-1036-2014; Fukushima, Takehiko/S-9801-2019	Setiawan, Fajar/0000-0002-7863-0067; Jiang, Dalin/0000-0001-5676-5860; Matsushita, Bunkei/0000-0001-6397-1144; Fukushima, Takehiko/0000-0003-2494-309X													2072-4292					FEB 1	2019	11	3							279	10.3390/rs11030279	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11030279													WOS:000459944400067

Water contamination through heavy metals and metalloids causes wide environmental and public discontent which makes it a global concern. With this view, 20 km stretch of Gomti River encompassing 5-locations was selected for determination of 16-physicochemical parameters and 11-heavy metals in water and bed-sediment samples during two consecutive years 2019-2020 covering three seasons supplemented by indices and statistics. Bed-sediment characterization was done through scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-rays and attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared analysis. River is significantly contaminated with Fe, Mg, Mn, Zn, Pb, Cu, Ni, Cr, Co, Cd, Hg having corresponding mean values 10.1 +/- 1.8, 36.1 +/- 10.6, 23.4 +/- 8, 16.7 +/- 5.9, 8.4 +/- 3.2, 8.2 +/- 3.3, 0.002 +/- 0.001 lg/g in bed-sediment, respectively. Corresponding order of heavy metals concentration was Mg > Fe > Mn > Zn > Cr > Co > Cd > Ni > Pb > Cu > Hg and Fe > Mg > Mn > Zn > Pb > Cu > Ni > Cr > Co > Cd > Hg, respectively. Higher values of indices for risk quantification; geo-accumulation index (5.0), contamination factor (1191.8), enrichment factor (46.5) and potential ecological risk index (393.8) were found for Cd in bed-sediment samples. Principal component analysis (? > 1) scored 3-factors having 65%, 19% and 11% variance for water and 75%, 10% and 7% variance for bed-sediment samples.

In particular, how extreme conditions of low temperature, dryness, and high radiation select the microorganisms involved in the cycle is not yet understood. Denitrification is an important step in the nitrogen cycle in which nitrate is reduced stepwise to the gases NO, N2O, and N-2. Denitrification is carried out by a wide group of microorganisms spread in the phylogenetic tree. The aim of this work was to isolate and characterize denitrifying bacteria present in different cold environments from Antarctica. Bacterial isolates were obtained from lake, meltwater, sea, glacier ice, ornithogenic soil, and penguin feces samples from King George Island, Fildes peninsula in the Antarctic. Samples were taken during the deicing season in five sampling campaigns. From all the samples we were able to isolate denitrifying strains. A total of 199 bacterial isolates with the capacity to grow in anaerobic mineral media reducing nitrate at 4 degrees C were obtained. The characterization of the isolates by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed a high predominance of the genus Pseudomonas, followed by Janthinobacterium, Flavobacterium, Psychrobacter, and Yersinia. Other minor genera detected were Cryobacterium, Iodobacter, Kaistella, and Carnobacterium. The capacity to denitrify was not previously described for most of the bacteria related to our isolates and in many of them denitrifying genes were not present suggesting the presence of new genes in this extreme environment. Our work demonstrates the ubiquity of denitrification in the Maritime Antarctica and gives important information linking denitrification at cold temperature with taxa in an unequivocal way.					; Cabezas, Angela/IST-7180-2023; Azziz, Gastón/AAE-4878-2019; Bovio-Winkler, Patricia/ABD-2624-2020	Etchebehere, Claudia/0000-0003-2495-205X; Braga Nan, Lucia/0000-0002-9881-6213; Cabezas, Angela/0000-0001-5460-019X; Bovio Winkler, Patricia/0000-0002-4004-0416; 														1664-302X				JUL 18	2022	13								827228	10.3389/fmicb.2022.827228	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.827228								35923392					WOS:000837860300001

The lake plays an important role in modulating regional climate. Its thermodynamics and hydrodynamics are also influenced by prevailing climatic and weather conditions on diel, seasonal and annual scales. However, information on water temperature and circulation in the lake is limited in space and time. We use a Regional Oceanographic Model System (ROMS) to simulate these processes from 1st January 2000 to 31st December 2014. The model is based on real bathymetry, river runoff and atmospheric forcing data using the bulk flux algorithm. Simulations show that the water column exhibits annual cycles of thermo-stratification (September-May) and mixing (June-August). Surface water currents take different patterns ranging from a lake-wide northward flow to gyres that vary in size and number. An under flow exists that leads to the formation of upwelling and downwelling regions. Current velocities are highest at the center of the lake and on the western inshore waters indicating enhanced water circulation in those areas. However, there is little exchange of water between the major gulfs (especially Nyanza) and the open lake, a factor that could be responsible for the different water quality reported in those regions. Findings of the present study enhance understanding of the physical processes (temperature and currents) that have an effect on diel, seasonal, and annual variations in stratification, vertical mixing, inshore-offshore exchanges and fluxes of nutrients that ultimately influence the biotic distribution and trophic structure. For instance information on areas/timing of upwelling and vertical mixing obtained from this study will help predict locations/seasons of high primary production and ultimately fisheries productivity in Lake Victoria.

Humans affect mortality risk in large carnivores such as wolves (Canis lupus), but spatiotemporally varying density dependence can significantly influence the landscape of survival. This potentially occurs when density varies spatially and risk is unevenly distributed. We quantified spatiotemporal sources of variation in survival rates of gray wolves (C.lupus) during a 21-year period of population recovery in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, USA. We focused on mapping risk across time using Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) models with time-dependent covariates, thus exploring a shifting mosaic of survival. Extended CPH models and time-dependent covariates revealed influences of seasonality, density dependence and experience, as well as individual-level factors and landscape predictors of risk. We used results to predict the shifting landscape of risk at the beginning, middle, and end of the wolf recovery time series. Survival rates varied spatially and declined over time. Long-term change was density-dependent, with landscape predictors such as agricultural land cover and edge densities contributing negatively to survival. Survival also varied seasonally and depended on individual experience, sex, and resident versus transient status. The shifting landscape of survival suggested that increasing density contributed to greater potential for human conflict and wolf mortality risk. Long-term spatial variation in key population vital rates is largely unquantified in many threatened, endangered, and recovering species. Variation in risk may indicate potential for source-sink population dynamics, especially where individuals preemptively occupy suitable territories, which forces new individuals into riskier habitat types as density increases. We encourage managers to explore relationships between adult survival and localized changes in population density. Density-dependent risk maps can identify increasing conflict areas or potential habitat sinks which may persist due to high recruitment in adjacent habitats.					; Beyer, Dean/HTM-6783-2023	Beyer, Jr., Dean/0009-0000-1708-4958; O'Neil, Shawn/0000-0002-0899-5220; 													2045-7758					NOV	2017	7	22					9518	9530		10.1002/ece3.3463	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3463								29187986					WOS:000415900800026

Locally adapted populations (ecotypes) have been identified across the geographical distribution of E.vaginatum; however, little is known about how their growth and phenology differ over the course of a growing season. The growing season is short in the Arctic and therefore exerts a strong selection pressure on tundra species. This raises the hypothesis that the phenology of arctic species may be poorly adapted if the timing and length of the growing season change. Mature E.vaginatum tussocks from across a latitudinal gradient (65-70 degrees N) were transplanted into a common garden at a central location (Toolik Lake, 68 degrees 38N, 149 degrees 36W) where half were warmed using open-top chambers. Over two growing seasons (2015 and 2016), leaf length was measured weekly to track growth rates, timing of senescence, and biomass accumulation. Growth rates were similar across ecotypes and between years and were not affected by warming. However, southern populations accumulated significantly more biomass, largely because they started to senesce later. In 2016, peak biomass and senescence of most populations occurred later than in 2015, probably induced by colder weather at the beginning of the growing season in 2016, which caused a delayed start to growth. The finish was delayed as well. Differences in phenology between populations were largely retained between years, suggesting that the amount of time that these ecotypes grow has been selected by the length of the growing seasons at their respective home sites. As potential growing seasons lengthen, E.vaginatum may be unable to respond appropriately as a result of genetic control and may have reduced fitness in the rapidly warming Arctic tundra.

This is especially true for the Russian Arctic where recently increased optical and SAR satellite imagery (Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel 1/2) and digital elevation models (TanDEM-X, ArcticDEM) are becoming available. These datasets offer new possibilities to create high-quality glacier inventories. Here, we present a new glacier inventory derived from a fusion of multi-source satellite data for Novaya Zemlya in the Russian Arctic. We mainly used Landsat 8 OLI data to automatically map glaciers with the band ratio method. Missing debris-covered glacier parts and misclassified lakes were manually corrected. Whereas perennial snow fields were a major obstacle in glacier identification, seasonal snow was identified and removed using Landsat 5 TM scenes from the year 1998. Drainage basins were derived semi-automatically using the ArcticDEM (gap-filled by the ASTER GDEM V2) and manually corrected using fringes from ALOS PALSAR. The new glacier inventory gives a glacierized area of 22,379 +/- 246.2 km(2) with 1474 glacier entities >0.05 km(2). The region is dominated by large glaciers, as 909 glaciers <0.5 km(2) (62% by number) cover only 156 +/- 1.7 km(2) or 0.7% of the area, whereas 49 glaciers >100 km(2) (3.3% by number) cover 18,724 +/- 205.9 km(2) or 84%. In total, 41 glaciers are marine terminating covering an area of 16,063.7 +/- 118.8 km(2). The mean elevation is 596 m for all glaciers in the study region (528 m in the northern part, 641 in the southern part). South-east (north-west) facing glaciers cover >35% (20%) of the area. For the smaller glaciers in the southern part we calculated an area loss of 3.4% (-52.5 +/- 3.1 km(2)) from 2001 to 2016.

The conversion of mangroves to aquaculture generates substantial loss of carbon stocks and reduces carbon storage capacity. Here, we present total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) effluxes obtained from mangrove forests (fringe and interior mangroves), silvofishery aquaculture ponds (dense and sparse mangroves), and non-silvofishery aquaculture ponds in Sawah Luhur, Banten, Indonesia. We found no significant difference in TECS across five land uses, ranging from 261 +/- 14 Mg C ha-1 in non-silvofishery ponds to 574 +/- 119 Mg C ha-1 in fringe mangroves. Most of these stocks were found in the soil carbon pool (87%) in fringe and interior mangroves. However, the conversion of mangroves to aquaculture ponds resulted in soil carbon loss from -6% to 60%. The highest soil CO2 effluxes during dry and wet seasons were observed in interior mangroves (151 +/- 12 mg CO2 m-2 h-1). The highest soil CH4 effluxes were found in fringe mangroves with 0.13 +/- 0.04 mg CH4 m-2 h-1. The highest aquatic CO2 and CH4 effluxes were found in dense silvofishery ponds, at 118 +/- 7 mg CO2 m-2 h-1 and 0.38 +/- 0.04 mg CH4 m-2 h-1, respectively. Our findings suggest that land use that includes mangroves (i.e., mangrove forest and/or silvofishery ponds) tends to have higher carbon stocks, soil, and aquatic CO2 and CH4 effluxes, compared to aquaculture ponds without mangroves. It is therefore crucial to maintain mangroves for natural carbon capture and storage through carbon stock enhancement.

Deglacial temperature controls on no-analog community establishment in the Great Lakes Region	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Understanding the drivers of vegetation dynamics and no-analog communities in eastern North America is hampered by a scarcity of independent temperature indicators. We present a new branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (brGDGT) temperature record from Bonnet Lake, Ohio (18-8 ka) and report uncertainty estimates based on Bayesian linear regression and bootstrapping. We also reanalyze a previously published brGDGT record from Silver Lake, Ohio, using improved chromatographic methods. All pollen- and brGDGT-based temperature reconstructions showed qualitatively similar deglacial trends but varying magnitudes. Separating 5- and 6- methyl brGDGTs resulted in substantially lower estimates of deglacial temperature variations (6.4 degrees C) than inferred from earlier brGDGT methods and pollen (11.8 degrees C, 12.0 C respectively). Similar trends among proxies suggest good fidelity of brGDGTs to temperature, despite calibration uncertainties. At both sites, the rise and decline of no-analog communities closely track brGDGT-inferred temperatures, with a lag of 0-150 years. The timing of temperature and ecological events varies between Bonnet and Silver Lakes, likely due to age model uncertainties. Climate sensitivity analyses indicate a linear sensitivity of vegetation composition to temperature variations, albeit noisy and significant only with a 500-year bin. The formation of no-analog plant communities in the upper Midwest is closely linked to late-glacial warming, but other factors, such as temperature seasonality or end-Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions, remain viable.

Carbon biogeochemistry of a flooded Pantanal forest over three annual flood cycles	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The Pantanal is the largest wetland in the world and yet little is known about the variability in carbon (C) dynamics across its flood seasons. We examined the effect of inundation on the C cycle in the 2013-2015 flood cycles illustrated by dissolved CO2, CH4, organic C (DOC) concentration measurements, and optical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) evaluated by absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). During the 2015 flood cycle, pCO(2) varied between 5973 and 14,292 mu atm, with pCH(4) concentrations ranging between 2956 and 51,675 mu atm respectively, with high temporal variability for both gases. The supersaturation of CO2 and CH4 in relation to the atmospheric equilibrium caused the system to behave as a net source of CO2 and CH4 to the atmosphere with evasion rates of 320 mg CO2 m(-2) d(-1) and 20 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Mean DOC concentration was 7.0 +/- 0.4 mg L-1 and did not differ between flood cycles. Higher concentrations of DOC were measured at the start (rising floodwaters) and at the end (receding floodwaters) of flood cycles, while lower DOC concentrations were observed during the peak flood. The PARAFAC analysis indicated the presence of five DOM components: humic (C1 and C2) and fulvic type material (C3) showed the highest relative abundance (68.5% of the total PARAFAC component fluorescence), as well as protein-like material (C4 and C5) derived from microorganisms. Our measured diffusive flux levels were below the range of emissions found for wetlands and floodplains for CO2, but were slightly higher for CH4 relative to other studies in lakes and seasonally flooded areas of the Pantanal. The large variations in concentrations of CO2, CH4 and DOC and the optical properties of DOM during the course of each flood cycle suggest a close relationship between carbon and water cycles in this tropical wetland.

Rivers to reservoirs: hydrological drivers control reservoir function by affecting the abundance of submerged and floating macrophytes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lakes and reservoirs are important sites for biogeochemical cycling on both regional and global scales. Shallow lakes often have higher coverage of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) because of increased light penetration to the sediment as well as stronger interactions between the sediment and the water column. These biotic and abiotic interactions can strongly affect nutrient cycling. This study evaluated how hydrologically driven changes in SAV coverage affected nutrient processing within a relatively shallow reservoir. To assess these effects, a comprehensive water quality sampling network was established that quantified nutrient concentrations in the inflows and outflow of the lake. Annual vegetation surveys quantified the spatial coverage of SAV. Annual inflow was significantly lower in the first year of the study compared to the following 2 years. Consequently, SAV coverage was also highest during the lowest flows in the first year and was lower in the following 2 years when flows were greater. NO3-N concentrations were also lowest within Hydrilla beds and in the outflow during the growing season of the first year. Our results suggest that hydrological variation was the main driving variable of SAV coverage, and that the extent of SAV coverage strongly controlled nutrient processing at the whole-reservoir scale.						, Stephen/0000-0002-4208-0630; Waters, Matthew/0000-0003-1702-3973; Wilde, Susan/0000-0002-5388-9582													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2018	815	1					21	35		10.1007/s10750-018-3532-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-018-3532-0													WOS:000428815800002
J	Haile, AT; Yan, F; Habib, E				Haile, Alemseged Tamiru; Yan, Fang; Habib, Emad			Accuracy of the CMORPH satellite-rainfall product over Lake Tana Basin in Eastern Africa	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												In this study, we assessed the accuracy of rainfall occurrence, amount and distribution over the Lake Tana basin in Ethiopia, Eastern Africa, as represented in the NOAA satellite-based Climate Prediction Center Morphing technique (CMORPH) rainfall product. This analysis is carried out at high spatial and temporal resolutions (8 x 8 km(2) and daily) using observations from rain gauges as a reference for the period covering January 2003 to December 2006. Graphical comparisons and several statistical metrics such as bias, correlation coefficient, and standard deviation of rainfall differences are used to perform the evaluation analysis. Spatial maps of these statistical metrics were developed to assess the spatial dependency in the CMORPH accuracy. The bias is decomposed into different components, hit, missed, and false, in order to gain additional insight into the possible sources of systematic deviations in CMORPH. Overall, CMORPH was able to capture the seasonal and spatial patterns of rainfall over the basin, but with varying degrees of accuracy that depend on topography, latitude and lake-versus-land conditions within the basin. The results show that CMORPH captured rain occurrence relatively well in both wet and dry seasons over the southern part of the basin but it significantly overestimated those over the lake and its southern shore. The bias of CMORPH in the study area is characterized by seasonal and spatial variations (-25 to 30% in wet season and -40 to 60% in dry season). False as well as missed rains contribute significantly to the total rainfall amounts over the basin. Significant levels of the differences are observed at the daily resolution of CMORPH. The relation between CMORPH and gauge rainfall amounts is stronger (correlation mostly >0.4) in the wet season than in the dry (mostly <0.4). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In stream waters, CO2 degassing drives the increase in calcite saturation to maximum values of approximately 10-fold, independent from the initial Ca2+ /alkalinity ratio. For the cyanobacteria of tufa biofilms, a culture-independent molecular approach showed that microscopy of resinembedded biofilm thin sections underestimated the actual diversity of cyanobacteria, i.e. the six cyanobacteria morphotypes were opposed to nine different lineages of the 16S rDNA phylogeny. The same morphotype may even represent two genetically distant cyanobacteria and the closest relatives of tufa biofilm cyanobacteria may be from quite different habitats. Diatom diversity was even higher in the biofilm at the studied exemplar site than that of the cyanobacteria, i.e. 13 diatom species opposed to 9 cyanobacterial lineages. The non-phototrophic prokaryotic biofilm community is clearly different from the soil-derived community of the stream waters, and largely composed of flavobacteria, firmicutes, proteobacteria and actinobacteria. The exopolymeric biofilm matrix can be divided into three structural domains by fluorescence lectin-binding analysis. Seasonal and spatial variability of these structural EPS domains is low in the investigated streams. As indicated by microsensor data, biofilm photosynthesis is the driving mechanism in tufa stromatolite formation. However, photosynthesis-induced biofilm calcification accounts for only 10-20% of the total Ca2+ loss in the streams, and occurs in parallel to inorganic precipitation driven by CO2-degassing within the water column and on biofilm-free surfaces. Annual stromatolite laminae reflect seasonal changes in temperature and light supply. The stable carbon isotope composition of the laminae is not affected by photosynthesis-induced microgradients, but mirrors that of the bulk water body only reflecting climate fluctuations. Tufa stromatolites with their cyanobacterial-photosynthesis-related calcification fabrics form an analogue to porostromate cyanobacterial stromatolites in fossil settings high in CaCO3 mineral supersaturation but comparatively low in dissolved inorganic carbon. Here, the sum-effect of heterotrophic exopolymer-degradation and secondary Ca2+ -release rather decreases calcite saturation, contrary to settings high in dissolved inorganic carbon such as soda lakes.					; Neu, Thomas/KFB-6812-2024; Friedl, Thomas/AAQ-4606-2021; de Beer, Dirk/L-4840-2013; Bissett, Andrew/AFR-3887-2022; Shiraishi, Fumito/Q-3060-2017	Stackebrandt, Erko/0000-0002-6130-760X; Neu, Thomas/0000-0001-6990-8787; de Beer, Dirk/0000-0001-5274-1781; Friedl, Thomas/0000-0002-4070-776X; Shiraishi, Fumito/0000-0003-4715-6654													0305-8719		978-1-86239-301-1				2010	336						83	118		10.1144/SP336.6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1144/SP336.6													WOS:000288434900006

Reduced dry season fish biomass and depleted carnivorous fish assemblages in unprotected tropical oxbow lakes	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The effectiveness of protected areas in maintaining biodiversity is increasingly under debate. Specifically, the responses of animal populations in freshwater ecosystems to disturbances outside protected areas are not well understood. Fish assemblages can serve as an indicator of such responses. We used dry season oxbow lake fish occurrence data implemented within a Measurement of Biodiversity framework to examine the influence of extractive activities on the richness, structure and abundance of fish assemblages. We compared oxbow lakes in protected areas with lakes subject to artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) and other human activities. The main components of fish biodiversity maintained by lake protection were abundance and biomass. The strongest predictors of community structure were fishing intensity and water transparency. As variation in these factors are likely a consequence of ASGM, our results may indicate indirect impacts of ASGM on freshwater ecosystems. Our analysis of fish trophic guilds also suggested that carnivores dominated fish assemblages in protected lakes, whereas in disturbed lakes detritivores were more frequent, suggesting a trophic downgrading of freshwater ecosystems subject to ASGM. Taken together, our results indicate responses of fish assemblages to human activity associated with ASGM. In the western Amazon, protected and isolated areas appear to be successful at maintaining the integrity of fish assemblages. Given the vulnerability of freshwater habitats and their high value for ecosystem services, we recommend local community engagement and resource allocation to prevent the degradation of oxbow lake habitats and the depletion of local aquatic biodiversity in unprotected areas.					; Swaisgood, Ronald/AAL-3198-2020	araujo, julio/0000-0002-8989-0278; Swaisgood, Ronald/0000-0001-5353-2148; 													0006-3207	1873-2917				MAY	2021	257								109090	10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2021.109090		APR 2021											WOS:000663301900015

Hominin homelands of East Java: Revised stratigraphy and landscape reconstructions for Plio-Pleistocene Trinil	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Trinil (Java, Indonesia) yielded the type fossils of Homo erectus and the world?s oldest hominin-made engraving. As such, the site is of iconic relevance for paleoanthropology. However, our understanding of its larger geological context is unsatisfactory. Previous sedimentological studies are around 100 years old and their interpretations sometimes contradictory. Moreover, the existing stratigraphic framework is based on regional correlations, which obscure differences in local depositional dynamics. Therefore, a new and more local framework is urgently needed. We carried out a comprehensive geological study of the Trinil area. Using a Digital Elevation Model, we identified seven fluvial terraces. Terrace deposits were described and OSL-dated and fluvial behaviour was reconstructed. The terraces were correlated with terraces of the Kendeng Hills (e.g. the hominin-bearing Ngandong terrace) and date back to the past -350 ka. Thus far, most of the Trinil terraces and their deposits had remained unidentified, confounding sedimentological and stratigraphic interpretations. The exposed pre-terrace series has a thickness of -230 m. Together with the terraces, it forms a -3 Ma record of tectonism, volcanism, climate change and sea-level fluctuations. We subdivided the series into five new and/or revised stratigraphic units, representing different depositional environments: Kalibeng Formation, Padas Malang Formation, Batu Gajah Formation, Trinil Formation and Solo Formation. Special attention was paid to erosional contacts and weathering profiles, forming hiatuses in the depositional series, and offering insight into paleoclimate and base-level change. The Trinil Formation provides a new landscape context of Homo erectus. Between -550 and 350 ka, the area was part of a lake basin (Ngawi Lake Basin), separated from the marine base level by a volcanic barrier, under dry, seasonal conditions and a regular supply of volcanic ash. An expanding and retreating lake provided favourable living conditions for hominin populations. After 350 ka, this role was taken over by the perennial Solo River. Landscape reconstructions suggest that the Solo formed by headward erosion and stream piracy, re-connecting the Ngawi Lake Basin to the plains in the west. Our study offers a local framework, but its Pleistocene landscape record has regional significance. Most of all, it forms a much-needed basis for future, detailed studies on the build-up of the hominin site of Trinil, its fossil assemblages and numerical ages. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

It detached at similar to 10 ka from the northeastern flank of the Kabir-Kuh anticline (Zagros Mountains, Iran) creating a natural dam responsible for the formation of a lake system that persisted for similar to 3 kyr during the early and mid-Holocene before its emptying phase caused by overflow. The chronology of its demise and connection to the Holocene climate variations have been barely studied. To reconstruct the influence of local vs. regional environmental changes upon the lake history and unravel their contribution on the lake overflowing phase, we analyzed 13 samples extracted from a 30-m-thick lacustrine succession belonging to Seymareh Lake. We performed grain size analysis, carbon and oxygen stable isotopes of carbonate-bearing sediments, and X-ray diffraction analysis of clay minerals, in addition to the geomorphological analysis to reconstruct the lake system morphoevolution. Main results highlight that the lake infilling phase was characterized by a first period (from 9.73 +/- 0.13 to 7.37 +/- 0.73 ka) with a median sedimentation rate of similar to 2 cm yr(-1) and a second period (from 7.37 +/- 0.73 to 6.98 +/- 0.39 ka) marked by an increased sedimentation rate up to similar to 10 cm yr(-1). The age of 6.98 +/- 0.39 ka is here considered as the termination of lacustrine sedimentation and the beginning of lake emptying and new valley entrenchment. Stable isotope and X-ray diffraction analyses confirm a stable humid interval after the early-mid Holocene arid to humid transition, consistent with other regions of the Middle East. During this transition, rainfall seasonality and its inter-annual irregularity may have prevented the development of a widespread vegetation cover that likely favored the increase of denudation rates on hillslopes and sediment supply along connected channels network. Therefore, the sedimentation rate increased within the downstream lake basin. However, in the late infilling phase from similar to 7.6-7.32 ka, local high energy hydroclimatic events, characterized by high sand content and low delta O-18 concentration, were recorded more frequently. This could justify a sudden increase in the tributaries' discharge that culminated at similar to 7.3 ka because of the complete overflow of Jaidar Lake into Seymareh Lake likely causing the overflowing of the entire Seymareh landslide-dam lake system.					delchiaro, michele/HFZ-8000-2022; Della Seta, Marta/D-2295-2009; Troiani, Francesco/B-7436-2008; Ballato, Paolo/AAH-2680-2021	Iacobucci, Giulia/0000-0002-1419-1536; 													0169-555X	1872-695X				SEP 15	2022	413								108367	10.1016/j.geomorph.2022.108367	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2022.108367		JUL 2022											WOS:000831581800002

The thermal interactions among air, water, and sediment were simulated by a one-dimensional differential equation using hourly observations of meteorological and limnological parameters. The validated model showed good performance (i.e., <1 degrees CRMSE for the daily averaged WT) for 2012, 2013, and 2015, respectively, in both upper and lower water layers, which were attained by incorporating a physical sub-model regarding the surface water temperature (surface WT). The good description of seasonal, daily, and hourly changes in surface WT obtained with the sub-model was confirmed by the observed and simulated time series. We then quantified and evaluated the trends of the meteorological and limnological parameters influencing WT changes from 1979 to 2015 based on their effects on WT by using the prediction model with the increases in air temperature (AT), solar radiation (SR), wind velocity (WV), and turbidity during that period; then, WT in the former period (1979) was predicted according to the trends and compared with the measured WT. The observed WT changes during the period were quantitatively explained by the compound effects of the parameters' changes, i.e., the AT and SR raising the WT, and the WV and turbidity lowering the WT.					; Sugita, Michiaki/L-2155-2013; Matsushita, Bunkei/E-1036-2014; Fukushima, Takehiko/S-9801-2019	Fukushima, Takehiko/0000-0003-2494-309X; Sugita, Michiaki/0000-0002-2241-9334; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 1	2022	845								157247	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157247	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157247		JUL 2022						35817108					WOS:000852732300007

Wetlands in China are diverse in type and abundant in quantity and differ greatly in spatial distribution, environmental conditions, and GHG fluxes. However, few studies focused on the differences in GHG emissions from different types of natural wetlands. Here, we adopted strict data collection criteria to create comprehensive and detailed datasets of fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from the marsh, coastal, lake, and river wetlands in China, and relevant environmental variables. Our study synthesized 265 field observations on GHGs that lasted at least one year (covering both the growing season and non-growing season) from 109 studies, among which CO2 measurements using the opaque chamber method were not included for eliminating the influence of absence of photosynthesis on net CO2 accounting. We found that CH4 contributed the largest warming effect among the three types of GHGs, and coastal and river wetlands respectively acted as the mitigators and motivators of global warming among the four types of wetlands. Correlation and regression analyses suggested that geographic location, soil moisture and organic carbon, and contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, and dissolved oxygen jointly drove wetland GHG fluxes. The comprehensive global warming potential of Chinese natural wetlands was estimated as 427 Tg CO2-equivalents year(-1), which might result from increased wetland drainage, reclamation, and external nutrient inputs. This study highlights the incorporation of the full year-round GHG monitoring data without using opaque chambers to measure CO2 flux when extrapolating net GHG emissions and gives implications for natural wetland management and global warming mitigation strategies.

Variation in dissolved organic matter controls bacterial production and community composition	ECOLOGY												An ongoing debate in ecology revolves around how species composition and ecosystem function are related. To address the mechanistic controls of this relationship, we manipulated the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) fed to aquatic bacteria to determine effects on both bacterial activity and community composition. Sites along terrestrial to aquatic flow paths were chosen to simulate movement of DOM through catchments, and DOM was fed to downslope and control bacterial communities. Bacterial production was measured, and DOM chemistry and bacterial community composition ( using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rRNA genes) were characterized following incubations. Bacterial production, dissolved organic carbon (DOC)-specific bacterial production, and DOC consumption were greatest in mesocosms fed soil water DOM; soil water DOM enhanced lake and stream bacterial production by 320-670% relative to lake and stream controls. Stream DOM added to lake bacteria depressed bacterial production relative to lake controls in the early season (-78%) but not the mid-season experiment. Addition of upslope DOM to stream and lake bacterial communities resulted in significant changes in bacterial community composition relative to controls. In four of five DOM treatments, the bacterial community composition converged to the DOM source community regardless of the initial inoculum. These results demonstrate that shifts in the supply of natural DOM were followed by changes in both bacterial production and community composition, suggesting that changes in function are likely predicated on at least an initial change in the community composition. The results indicate that variation in DOM composition of soil and surface waters influences bacterial community dynamics and controls rates of carbon processing in set patterns across the landscape.

However, different types of metrics perform with considerable variation and provide various information involved in ecosystem conditions. Taxonomic distinctness (TD) indices have been recommended as desirable measures for assessing environmental degradation, but their utility based on lake macroinvertebrates is still largely unknown. Here, we evaluated the response of traditional and taxonomic distinctness diversity indices (the average taxonomic distinctness, Delta(+), and variation in taxonomic distinctness, ?(+)) of benthic macroinvertebrates to environmental degradation gradient in Lake Taihu, the third largest freshwater lake in China. Benthic assemblages responded markedly to human disturbances, with significance among-region differences in community composition throughout four seasons. The traditional biodiversity indices (Shannon-Wiener diversity and Pielou's evenness) showed high sensitivity in discriminating anthropogenic impacts, with highest values in macrophytic region but lowest values in eutrophic region. In contrast, Delta(+) and ?(+) did not perform well in distinguishing sites subjected to different disturbance levels. The Pearson correlation and multiple regression analysis both indicated that traditional biodiversity metrics (Shannon-Wiener diversity, taxon richness, and Pielou's evenness) responded more readily to water quality variables (Secchi depth, electrical conductivity, and comprehensive trophic level index) than Delta(+) and ?(+). Despite the weak correlations between TD indices of benthic macroinvertebrates and water quality in the present study, we suggest that the TD indices should still be considered in bioassessment programs because they provide useful complementary information on traditional diversity indices.					xu, ziyi/KHX-6506-2024; Wang, Jinhui/GSD-9243-2022; Jiang, Xiaoming/H-8324-2019														0944-1344	1614-7499				JUN	2020	27	17					21804	21815		10.1007/s11356-020-08610-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-08610-w		APR 2020						32281066					WOS:000525336200005

Comparison of 15 evaporation methods applied to a small mountain lake in the northeastern USA	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Few detailed evaporation studies exist for small takes or reservoirs in mountainous settings. A detailed evaporation study was conducted at Mirror Lake, a 0.15 km(2) take in New Hampshire, northeastern USA, as part of a long-term investigation of take hydrology. Evaporation was determined using 14 alternate evaporation methods during six open-water seasons and compared with values from the Bowen-ratio energy-budget (BREB) method, considered the standard. Values from the Priestley-Taylor, deBruin-Keijman, and Penman methods compared most favorably with BREB-determined values. Differences from BREB values averaged 0.19, 0.27, and 0.20 mm d(-1), respectively, and results were within 20% of BREB values during more than 90% of the 37 monthly comparison periods. All three methods require measurement of net radiation, air temperature, change in heat stored in the take, and vapor pressure, making them relatively data intensive. Several of the methods had substantial bias when compared with BREB values and were subsequently modified to eliminate bias. Methods that rely only on measurement of air temperature, or air temperature and solar radiation, were relatively cost-effective options for measuring evaporation at this small. New England take, outperforming some methods that require measurement of a greater number of variables. It is likely that the atmosphere above Mirror Lake was affected by occasional formation of separation eddies on the Lee side of nearby high terrain, although those influences do not appear to be significant to measured evaporation from the Lake when averaged over monthly periods.

Using OLI/Landsat-8 images as data sources, shortwave infrared bands (SWIR1, SWIR2) are introduced to the traditional vegetation and salinity indices, and the enhanced indices are put forward to obtain an improved inversion effect. After enhancement, the correlation coefficient between the indices and soil salt content increased by 0.01-0.44, and the multicollinearity between indices significantly decreased. The prediction ability of the support vector machine salt inversion model improved from general to fairly good, and the predicted and measured values were close to a linear distribution. The predicted and measured values ranged from 0.39-36.38 g center dot kg(-1) and 0.35-38.09 g center dot kg(-1), respectively, and 63.25% of the regional salt status could be accurately predicted. The results showed that the accuracy of soil salinity inversion can be effectively enhanced by introducing shortwave infrared bands.

Results from the Zhalong Nature Reserve, China	REMOTE SENSING												Ecological water replenishment (EWR) has been increasingly applied to the restoration and maintenance of wetland hydrological conditions across China since the beginning of the 21st century. However, little is known about whether EWR projects help protect and/or restore wetland ecohydrology. As one of the earliest and longest-running EWR projects in China, water has been released from the Nenjiang River into the Zhalong wetland since 2001. It is important to examine the ecohydrological effects of this EWR project. In this study, long time series remote sensing data were used to extract the water area, inundation frequency, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to explore how eco-hydrological conditions changed during the pre- (1984-2000) and post-EWR (2001-2018) periods in the Zhalong wetland. Results show that the inundation area decreased due to the reduced surface water inflow during the pre-EWR period. Similarly, monthly vegetation NDVI in the growing season generally exhibited a decreasing and an increasing trend during the pre- and post-EWR periods, respectively. In the post-EWR period, NDVI increased by 19%, 73%, 45%, 28%, 13% for the months of May through September, respectively. Due to EWR, vegetation growth in areas with low inundation frequency was better than in areas with high inundation frequency. We found that the EWR project, runoff, and precipitation contributed 25%, 11%, and 64% to changes in the NDVI, respectively, and 46%, 37%, and 17% to changes in inundation area, respectively. These results indicate that the EWR project has improved hydrological conditions in the Zhalong wetland. For further maximum benefits of EWR in the Zhalong wetlands, we suggest that implementing similar eco-hydrological projects in the future should focus on flood pulse management to increase the inundation area, improve hydrological connectivity, and create new habitats.					; Wu, Yanfeng/I-5630-2017; Liu, Sixin/ABD-2081-2020; Xu, Y./A-7681-2014; Gao, Zongting/N-3649-2013; Xu, Y.

J	Li, XC; Huo, SL; Xi, BD				Li, Xiaochuang; Huo, Shouliang; Xi, Beidou			Updating the resolution for 16S rRNA OTUs clustering reveals the cryptic cyanobacterial genus and species	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												In processing metabarcoding data from the 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, OTUs were commonly binned at 97% similarity, the criteria was once proposed as the limit for species delimitation for prokaryotes. This numeric guide is rather a tunable parameter and has recently been revised and increased up to 99% threshold facilitated with more 16S rRNA sequences available. In the study, we updated 97% identity to 99% in combination with monophyletic species concept rather than OTUs to evaluate cyanobacterial diversity from 11 freshwaters using metabarcoding technique. The cyanobacterial OTUs were first determined by aligning to the SILVA database, and further reassigned through the evolutionary placement algorithm (EPA). Inferred from the EPA, meta-barcoding found diverse cyanobacterial community with at least 70 monophyletic species (113 OTUs) from 18 coccoid, 14 simple filamentous, 10 heterocytous genera, and Prochlorothrix by clustering OTUs at 97% similarity. When updating to 99% similarity, 5 cryptic genera were detected with 3 of them should be revised as new genera for they achieved monophyly in the phylogeny. In addition, updating to 99% similarity also detected 48 cryptic monophyletic species from 9 genera. In conclusion, updating 97% identity to 99% in combination with monophyletic species found cryptic genera and species, and provided a much clearer separation of cyano-bacterial community between lakes and reservoirs and also between seasons. The combined methods improved the use of metabarcoding technique to elucidate field cyanobacterial community.					; Huo, Shouliang/D-1364-2013; Xi, Beidou/KEE-8922-2024	Beidou, Xi/0000-0002-1055-1581; Shouliang, Huo/0000-0003-1491-6741													1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2020	117								106695	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106695	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106695													WOS:000555555100009

Effects of invasive wetland macrophytes on habitat selection and movement by freshwater turtles	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Invasive species can significantly impact native wildlife by structurally altering habitats and access to resources. Understanding how native species respond to habitat modification by invasive species can inform effective habitat restoration, avoiding inadvertent harm to species at risk. The invasive graminoids Phragmites australis australis (hereafter Phragmites) and Typha x glauca are increasingly dominating Nearctic wetlands, often outcompeting native vegetation. Previous research suggests that turtles may avoid invasive Phragmites when moving through their home ranges, but the mechanisms driving avoidance are unclear. We tested two hypotheses that could explain avoidance of invaded habitat: (1) that stands of invasive macrophytes (Phragmites and Typha x glauca) impede movement, and (2) that they provide inadequate thermal conditions for turtles. We quantified active-season movements of E. blandingii (n = 14, 1328 relocations) and spotted turtles (Clemmys guttata; n = 12, 2295 relocations) in a coastal wetland in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Neither hypothesis was supported by the data. Phragmites and mixed-species Typha stands occurred within the home ranges of mature, active E. blandingii and C. guttata, and were used similarly to most other available habitats, regardless of macrophyte stem density. Turtles using stands of invasive macrophytes did not experience restricted movements or cooler shell temperatures compared to other wetland habitat types. Control of invasive macrophytes can restore habitat heterogeneity and benefit native wetland species. However, such restoration work should be informed by the presence of at-risk turtles, as heavy machinery used for control or removal may injure turtles that use these stands as habitat.					; Freeland, Joanna/AAY-3881-2021; Angoh, Jennifer/OLR-7539-2025	Paterson, James/0000-0001-9518-7426; Rupasinghe, Prabha/0000-0002-2289-2332; Angoh, Siow Yan Jennifer/0000-0002-3791-0150; Freeland, Joanna/0000-0002-5251-7680													1387-3547	1573-1464				JUL	2021	23	7					2271	2288		10.1007/s10530-021-02505-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-021-02505-8		APR 2021											WOS:000639047900001

Turbulent transport in the boundary layer determines the ice growth and melting conditions at the ice-water interface, especially in large lakes and marginal seas, where large-scale water circulation can produce highly variable mixing conditions. Since the boundary mixing under ice is difficult to measure, existing models of ice cover dynamics usually neglect or parameterize it in a very simplistic form. We present the first detailed observations on mixing under ice of Lake Baikal, obtained with the help of advanced acoustic methods. The dissipation rate of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) was derived from correlations (structure functions) of current velocities within the boundary layer. The range of the dissipation rate variability covered 2 orders of magnitude, demonstrating strongly turbulent conditions. Intensity of mixing was closely connected to the mean speeds of the large-scale under-ice currents. Mixing developed on the background of stable density (temperature) stratification, which affected the vertical structure of the boundary layer. To account for stratification effects, we propose a model of the turbulent energy budget based on the length scale incorporating the dissipation rate and the buoyancy frequency (Dougherty-Ozmidov scaling). The model agrees well with the observations and yields a scaling relationship for the ice-water heat flux as a function of the shear velocity squared. The ice-water heat fluxes in the field were the largest among all reported in lakes (up to 40 W m(-2)) and scaled well against the proposed relationship. The ultimate finding is that of a strong dependence of the water-ice heat flux on the shear velocity under ice. The result suggests large errors in the heat flux estimations when the traditional "bulk" approach is applied to stratified boundary layers. It also implies that under-ice currents may have much stronger effect on the ice melt than estimated by traditional models.					; Zdorovennov, Roman/L-8294-2013; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010; Aslamov, Ilya/ABI-6146-2020	Aslamov, Ilya/0000-0001-6678-5312; Zdorovennov, Roman/0000-0003-1695-4872; Kirillin, Georgiy/0000-0001-7337-3586; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				APR 8	2020	24	4					1691	1708		10.5194/hess-24-1691-2020	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1691-2020													WOS:000525367500002

Hence, understanding the influence of calanoids on the taxonomic and size structure of the lower plankton food web is crucial for predicting the effects of oligotrophication on energy fluxes in these systems. We studied the effect of an omnivorous calanoid, Eudiaptomus gracilis, on the lower planktonic food web using an in situ incubation approach in large and deep Lake Constance. We show that E. gracilis significantly reduced ciliate, phytoplankton, rotifer, but increased bacteria biovolume. Highest clearance rates were observed for ciliates whose biovolume declines may have caused a release of predation pressure on bacteria. E. gracilis grazing shifted the size structure of the phytoplankton community by reducing mean phytoplankton cell size (directional selection) and simultaneously increasing cell size variance (disruptive selection). Ciliate cell sizes experienced a similar selective regime in one of the experiments, whereas in the other two experiments, no change of size structure was detected. Results suggest strong influences of E. gracilis grazing on the lower plankton food web and a significant shift in phytoplankton size structure. For evaluating detailed effects of omnivorous consumers on plankton size structure, cascading interactions need to be considered.

Methane fluxes from a small boreal lake measured with the eddy covariance method	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Fluxes of methane, CH4, were measured with the eddy covariance (EC) method at a small boreal lake in Sweden. The mean CH4 flux during the growing season of 2013 was 20.1 nmol m(-2) s(-1) and the median flux was 16 nmol m(-2) s(-1) (corresponding to 1.7 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and 1.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Monthly mean values of CH4 flux measured with the EC method were compared with fluxes measured with floating chambers (FC) and were in average 62% higher over the whole study period. The difference was greatest in April partly because EC, but not FC, accounted for fluxes due to ice melt and a subsequent lake mixing event. A footprint analysis revealed that the EC footprint included primarily the shallow side of the lake with a major inlet. This inlet harbors emergent macrophytes that can mediate high CH4 fluxes. The difference between measured EC and FC fluxes can hence be explained by different footprint areas, where the EC system sees the part of the lake presumably releasing higher amounts of CH4. EC also provides more frequent measurements than FC and hence more likely captures ebullition events. This study shows that small lakes have CH4 fluxes that are highly variable in time and space. Based on our findings we suggest to measure CH4 fluxes from lakes as continuously as possible and to aim for covering as much of the lakes surface as possible, independently of the selected measuring technique.					; Kljun, Natascha/B-8467-2008; Balathandayuthabani, Sivakiruthika/M-6669-2019; Natchimuthu, Sivakiruthika/M-6669-2019	Sahlee, Erik/0000-0002-6183-9876; Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152; Kljun, Natascha/0000-0001-9650-2184; Balathandayuthabani, Sivakiruthika/0000-0002-9058-3048; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2016	61			1	SI		S41	S50		10.1002/lno.10245	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10245													WOS:000388560900004
J	Li, JG; Ganti, V; Li, CL; Wei, H				Li, Jiaguang; Ganti, Vamsi; Li, Chenglong; Wei, Hao			Upstream migration of avulsion sites on lowland deltas with river-mouth retreat	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												River deltas are fertile, populous landscapes that grow through river avulsions-episodic channel-jumping events. Historically, avulsions on deltas occurred at persistent locations, causing some of the deadliest recorded floods. Climate change and human activities are threatening to drown deltas but it is unknown how avulsions will respond because they occur infrequently on large, lowland deltas. Here, we use a low-gradient river delta formed on the margin of a lake in the Qaidam Basin, China, as a natural laboratory to explore how lowland deltas will respond to river-mouth retreat from accelerated relative sea-level rise. Using satellite imagery from 1973 to 2010 C.E., we identified and analyzed the response of 6 lobe-scale avulsions on the Sulengguole River delta to the seasonal expansion of the North Huoluxun Lake in the Qaidam Basin. We show that the seasonal lake-water area increase caused punctuated river-mouth retreat. In response, avulsion sites migrated upstream at a commensurate rate such that the avulsion length-streamwise distance of avulsion site to the river mouth-remained consistent and scaled with the backwater lengthscale, similar to large, lowland deltas. Results indicate that the drowning of lowland deltas from accelerated relative sea-level rise will shift avulsion hazards tens-to-hundreds of kilometers upstream, exposing new upstream communities to the risk of catastrophic flooding.

Titan's fluvial valleys: Morphology, distribution, and spectral properties	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE					Titan Through Time-A Workshop on Titans Formation, Evolution and Fate	APR 06-08, 2010	MD					Titan's fluvial channels have been investigated based on data obtained by the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument and the Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft. In this paper, a database of fluvial features is created based on radar-SAR data aiming to unveil the distribution and the morphologic and spectral characteristics of valleys on Titan on a global scale. It will also study the spatial relations between fluvial valleys and Titan's geologic units and spectral surface units which have become accessible thanks to Cassini-VIMS data. Several distinct morphologic types of fluvial valleys can be discerned by SAR-images. Dendritic valley networks appear to have much in common with terrestrial dendritic systems owing to a hierarchical and tree-shaped arrangement of the tributaries which is indicative of an origin from precipitation. Dry valleys constitute another class of valleys resembling terrestrial wadis, an indication of episodic and strong flow events. Other valley types, such as putative canyons, cannot be correlated with rainfall based on their morphology alone, since it cannot be ruled out that they may have originated from volcanic/tectonic action or groundwater sapping. Highly developed and complex fluvial networks with channel lengths of up to 1200 km and widths of up to 10 km are concentrated only at a few locations whereas single valleys are scattered over all latitudes. Fluvial valleys are frequently found in mountainous areas. Some terrains, such as equatorial dune fields and undifferentiated plains at mid-latitudes, are almost entirely free of valleys. Spectrally, fluvial terrains are often characterized by a high reflectance in each of Titan's atmospheric windows, as most of them are located on Titan's bright 'continents'. Nevertheless, valleys are spatially associated with a surface unit appearing blue due to its higher reflection at 1.3 mu m in a VIMS false color RGB composite with R: 1.59/1.27 mu m, G: 2.03/1.27 mu m, and B: 1.27/1.08 mu m: the channels either dissect pure bluish surface units or they are carved into terrain with a mixed spectral signature between bright and bluish surface materials. The global picture of fluvial flows clearly indicates a high diversity of parameters controlling fluvial erosion, such as climatic processes, as well as surface and bedrock types. Recent fluvial activity is very likely in the north polar region in contrast to more arid conditions at lower latitudes and at the south pole of Titan. This divergence is probably an indication of seasonal climatic asymmetries between the hemispheres. However, traces of previous fluvial activity are scattered over all latitudes of Titan, which is indicative of previous climatic conditions with at least episodic rainfall. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental determinants of fish abundance in the littoral zone of gravel pit lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The type and extent of habitats along the shoreline specify the distribution of fish in the littoral zone of lakes, but effects are likely species and size-specific and might be overwhelmed by lake-level environmental factors that drive fish abundance (e.g. trophic state). We applied a replicated transect-sampling design by electrofishing assessing fish abundance and distribution along the banks of 20 gravel pit lakes in Lower Saxony (Germany). Boosted regression trees were used to analyse the impact of different characteristic habitat types (e.g. vegetated, woody or open water zones), shoreline water depth and lake-level environmental variables on species-specific fish abundances. In contrast to earlier studies, lake-level environment and transect-level habitat type similarly influenced the abundances of differently sized fish species in the littoral zone of gravel pit lakes. The abundance of almost all fish species increased with lake productivity and extent of structured littoral habitats, mostly following non-linear relationships. Our work suggests that investments into the quality of littoral habitat, and not merely the control of nutrient inputs or other lake-level environmental factors, can promote abundance of most gravel pit lake fish species, in particular those who depend on the littoral zone for at least part of their life-cycle.					; Wolter, Christian/F-6210-2014; Matern, Sven/KVY-3788-2024; Arlinghaus, Robert/E-3340-2010	Arlinghaus, Robert/0000-0003-2861-527X; Klefoth, Thomas/0000-0003-3659-5336; Matern, Sven/0000-0002-6762-7612; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2021	848	10					2449	2471		10.1007/s10750-021-04563-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04563-4		APR 2021											WOS:000636965700001

Inside the biofilm is the nutrient-rich microenvironment promoted by the accumulation of the nutrient ions such as NH4+ and NO3- from surrounding water. The present study investigated the characteristics of NH4+ and NO3- accumulation into the biofilm of natural microbial consortia collected from Lake Biwa, Japan. The results showed the following: (1) the concentrations of NH4+ and NO3- inside the biofilm were much higher than those in the surrounding water; (2) the nutrient ion concentration inside the biofilm changed in synchrony with those in the surrounding water; (3) biofilm polymers have both positively and negatively charged sites; (4) electrostatic attractive interactions between the charged sites on biofilm polymers and oppositely charged ions outside the biofilm seem to play important roles in the accumulation of nutrient ions into the biofilm from the surrounding water; (5) the bacterial community structure differs between the biofilm and surrounding water. The present study revealed that the accumulation of nutrient ions into the biofilm indicates the removal of these ions from water outside the biofilm. According to the result of this study, accumulation of ions such as NH4+ and NO3- into the biofilm of natural microbial consortia may have implications on nutrients seasonal dynamic in aquatic ecosystems.					; Kurniawan, Andi/AAC-4344-2021	Kurniawan, Andi/0000-0001-6301-0861; 													1687-918X	1687-9198				JUN 2	2019	2019								6473690	10.1155/2019/6473690	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/6473690								31281363					WOS:000493831100001

The water area of Dongting Lake fluctuates significantly daily, which may cause flooding and other relevant disasters. Although remote sensing techniques may provide lake area estimates with reasonable accuracy, they are not available in real-time and may be susceptible to weather conditions. To address this issue, this paper attempted to examine the relationship between lake area and the water levels at the hydrological stations. Multi-temporal water area data were derived through analyzing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery using the Automatic Water Extraction Index (AWEI). Then we analyzed the inter- and intra-annual variations in the water area of the Dongting Lake. Corresponding water level information at hydrological stations of the Dongting Lake were obtained. Simple linear regression (SLR) models and stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) models were constructed using water levels and water level differences from the upstream and downstream hydrological stations. We used the data from 2004 to 2012 and 2012, respectively, to build the model, and applied the data from 2013 to 2015 to evaluate the models. Results suggest that the maximum water area of the Dongting Lake during 2000-2015 has a clear decreasing trend. The variations in the water area were characterized by hydrological seasons, with the annual minimum and maximum water areas occurring in January and September, respectively. The water level at the Chengjingji station, and water level differences between upstream stations and the Chengjingji station, play a major role in estimating the water area. Further, results also show that the SMLR established in 2012 performs the best in estimating water area of the Dongting Lake, especially with high water levels.

Insecticide Resistance in Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae) is Associated with Field Control Failure of Sour Rot Disease in a New York Vineyard	JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY												Sour rot is a complex disease of grapes caused by an interaction of yeast, acetic acid bacteria, and Drosophila spp. Application of insecticides (most commonly zeta-cypermethrin) targeting Drosophila has previously provided substantial control of sour rot in wine grapes of NewYork vineyards. In harvest season of 2018, a control failure of sour rot and high populations of Drosophila, mostly Drosophila melanogaster, were observed in a vineyard in the Finger Lakes region, NY, despite repeated applications of zeta-cypermethrin (Mustang Maxx). To determine if resistance was responsible for the control failure, we quantified the toxicity of zeta-cypermethrin and the four other insecticides registered for Drosophila control in NY vineyards. Diagnostic concentrations (susceptible strain LC95, 4 x LC95, and 16 x LC95) were used to evaluate percentage survival of the field flies relative to the susceptible Canton-S strain. Resistance to zeta-cypermethrin, acetamiprid, and malathion, but not to spinosad and spinetoram, was observed in the field-collected flies. This study provides evidence that insecticide resistance of Drosophila is associated with control failure of sour rot in some vineyards, and directly influencing grape production. The implications of these results to insecticide resistance monitoring and management are discussed.

J	Arkle, RS; Pilliod, DS				Arkle, Robert S.; Pilliod, David S.			Persistence at distributional edges: Columbia spotted frog habitat in the arid Great Basin, USA	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												A common challenge in the conservation of broadly distributed, yet imperiled species is understanding which factors facilitate persistence at distributional edges, locations where populations are often vulnerable to extirpation due to changes in climate, land use, or distributions of other species. For Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) in the Great Basin (USA), a genetically distinct population segment of conservation concern, we approached this problem by examining (1) landscape-scale habitat availability and distribution, (2) water body-scale habitat associations, and (3) resource management-identified threats to persistence. We found that areas with perennial aquatic habitat and suitable climate are extremely limited in the southern portion of the species' range. Within these suitable areas, native and non-native predators (trout and American bullfrogs [Lithobates catesbeianus]) are widespread and may further limit habitat availability in upper- and lower-elevation areas, respectively. At the water body scale, spotted frog occupancy was associated with deeper sites containing abundant emergent vegetation and nontrout fish species. Streams with American beaver (Castor canadensis) frequently had these structural characteristics and were significantly more likely to be occupied than ponds, lakes, streams without beaver, or streams with inactive beaver ponds, highlighting the importance of active manipulation of stream environments by beaver. Native and non-native trout reduced the likelihood of spotted frog occupancy, especially where emergent vegetation cover was sparse. Intensive livestock grazing, low aquatic connectivity, and ephemeral hydroperiods were also negatively associated with spotted frog occupancy. We conclude that persistence of this species at the arid end of its range has been largely facilitated by habitat stability (i.e., permanent hydroperiod), connectivity, predator-free refugia, and a commensalistic interaction with an ecosystem engineer. Beaver-induced changes to habitat quality, stability, and connectivity may increase spotted frog population resistance and resilience to seasonal drought, grazing, non-native predators, and climate change, factors which threaten local or regional persistence.

We developed a logical approach based on remote sensing to monitor the conservation status of P. australis beds in response to environmental gradients and orient future management actions in Lake Garda (northern Italy). During the 2010 growing season we collected data on: (i) the structural and functional status of seven P. australis beds and (ii) land cover in a 50-m buffer around each bed, and we tested four different vegetation indices (VIs) derived from a multi-temporal and multisensor dataset. Double hierarchical clustering based on the VI statistics and environmental variables (morphological, functional and land-use) showed a good consistency between the outputs of the vigor-function analysis and the environmental classification of the P. australis beds considered. Overall, the bed's area was the most influential factor in the data clustering procedures, followed by the descriptors derived from the enhanced vegetation index. Our results confirmed the importance of temporal characteristics of remote sensing data to assess the conservation status of common reed beds and proved the sensitivity of VIs and derived descriptors to local environmental conditions within a homogeneous littoral area. This study supports the utility of remote sensing for monitoring riparian vegetation and analyzing the spatial and temporal response of P. australis populations to human pressure and management actions.

Among more than 90 identified analogues of microcystins, microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is the most abundant and toxic. Our previous investigations indicated that MC-LR displays male reproductive toxicity, but the target of MC-LR in testes remains unclear. To this end, the present study is designed to elucidate whether microcystin-LR could be distributed to testes and explore the target cells in testes. In the in vivo study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intraperitoneally with MC-LR at a dose of 300 mu g/kg per day for 6 days. MC-LR was detected in testes, mainly within seminiferous tubules, which was further validated by Western blot. The concentrations of MC-LR were determined by LC-MS analysis, with a result of 0.0252 +/- A 0.0037 and 0.0056 +/- A 0.0012 mu g/g dry weight in liver and testis respectively. In the in vitro study, Primary cultured spermatogonia, Sertoli cells and Leydig cells were exposed to MC-LR respectively, and MC-LR was observed to enter spermatogonia and Sertoli cells, but not Leydig cells. These results suggested that the reproductive toxicity of MC-LR were induced by its distribution in testis. Spermatogonia and Sertoli cells are important target cells.

Phytoplankton were recorded at two different altitude levels of the river. A total of 35 genera of phytoplankton were recorded with dominated by diatoms. The altitudinal differences reflected comparatively high genus richness in the high-altitude region. Seasonal spectrum of phytoplankton was maximum during post-monsoon (7.67 +/- 13.42 ul(-1)) and pre-monsoon (51.6 +/- 24.52 ul(-1)) in the high-altitude and low-altitude region, respectively. On the whole, the major compositions of phytoplankton are represented as Bacillariophyceae > Cyanophyceae > Chlorophyceae across seasons. The k-dominance curve revealed that there was no remarkable difference in dominance pattern of phytoplankton among the sampling sites with 9 to 15 species accumulated 80% cumulative relative abundance across sites. Negative altitudinal gradient of diversity indices (Shannon and Simpson index) was recorded which implies lower diversity exists at higher altitude. Further, GAM model (R-2 = 0.36) depicted statistically a nonlinear pattern of genus turnover against the altitudinal distance. The significant positive relationship was observed between phytoplankton genus turnover and altitudinal distance in the river. Canonical correspondence analysis reflected that water variables such as total alkalinity, total hardness, sp. conductivity, nitrate, total phosphate and silicate were the influential factors for the distribution of phytoplankton community in both the altitudes of the river Teesta.
