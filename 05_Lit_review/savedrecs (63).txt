J	Kabasiita, JK; Opolot, E; Sande, E; Malinga, GM				Kabasiita, Juliet Kiiza; Opolot, Emmanuel; Sande, Eric; Malinga, Geoffrey Maxwell			Decomposition and nutrient release patterns of municipal solid waste compost in two agro-ecological zones of Uganda	AGRICULTURE & FOOD SECURITY												Background: Deteriorating soil fertility is a major constraint to agricultural production and food security among smallholder farmers in Uganda and throughout sub-Saharan Africa, where the majority of the population relies on subsistence farming for its livelihoods. Unfortunately, inorganic fertiliser used as a significant soil nutrient replenishment is unsustainable, causing adverse environmental effects, including soil acidification and pollution of water bodies. Therefore, finding alternative, more sustainable, low-cost nutrient management systems is vital. This study assessed the decomposition and nutrient release patterns of municipal solid waste compost (MSWC) in a 36 weeks litter bag experiment under field conditions in two agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of Uganda. Results: We found a higher rate of decomposition in the South-western Grass Farmlands (SGF) agro-ecological zone (0.041 week(-1), with 20% of initial compost mass remaining after 36 weeks of decay) compared to Southern and Eastern Lake Kyoga Basin (SEKB) (0.043 week(-1), 32% of initial litter mass remaining). The half-life values were 16 and 17 weeks for SGF and SEKB AEZs, respectively. The nutrient release rates differed between the two study sites. The macronutrient release pattern in both sites followed the order K > P > N. The secondary macronutrients release followed the order Ca > Mg in the SGF, while in SEKB, the order was reversed. The micronutrients followed the order Cu > Mn > Fe > Zn and Cu > Mn > Zn > Fe in SGF and SEKB AEZs, respectively. The MSWC mass loss during decomposition was negatively correlated with rainfall in both AEZs and with temperature in SGF AEZ, while it was positively correlated with temperature in SEKB AEZ. However, the relationship with nutrient release rates was inconsistent in both AEZs. Conclusions: Our results showed consistent release of nutrients in all AEZs throughout the study period, which coincides with the two cropping seasons in Uganda, suggesting that smallholder farmers can use MSWC as a soil amendment to address soil fertility decline and improve crop productivity. However, because most nutrients were released almost right away in both AEZs, planting should be done at the beginning of high rainfall months when soil moisture is high to synchronise nutrient release from MSWC with crop demand and maximise nutrient uptake by crops while minimising losses to the environment. Furthermore, the inconsistent relationships between the climatic variables and nutrient release suggest that other factors, such as site-specific microbial composition, influenced MSWC nutrient release. Therefore, long-term research is needed to examine other factors affecting nutrient release in these AEZs.

In this study, water samples were collected from the Wanggang River in the eastern coastal area of China, and the PFOA and dissolved organic matter (DOM) levels were measured. The results show that the PFOA concentration in the water bodies ranges from 3.2 to 52.9 ng center dot L-1, and the average value is 27.1 +/- 13.4 ng center dot L-1, indicating an intermediate level. Two protein-like (C2, C3) and two humus-like (C1, C4) DOM components in the Wanggang River are attributed to rainfall and human activities. Differences are observed in the DOM components before and after the flood season. The humus-like components are higher in the post-flood season, and are one of the factors affecting PFOA distribution and concentration in the Wanggang River. The results provide data support for monitoring and evaluating PFOA in rivers and help formulate PFOA pollution management strategies. In future research, it might be better to define the interaction between DOM and emerging organic pollutants by using 17 PFASs as subjects.

J	Li, YJ; Wang, LJ; Tian, ZB; Li, H				Li, Yingjie; Wang, Lijing; Tian, Zebin; Li, Hong			Characterization of Water and Total Nitrogen Contributions from the Inflow Rivers to Lake: A Study of West Dongting Lake in China	WATER												The input of pollutants into the lake has ainfluence on the water quality of the lake. Detailing the contribution of water and nutrients from the inflow rivers are essential for lake water management. Major ions Na+ and Cl- were applied to trace contributions of water and total nitrogen (TN) from the inflow rivers to West Dongting Lake. By using the two-source mixing model and the two-component TN mixing model, the results showed that water and TN in West Dongting Lake were mainly contributed by local rivers rather than the three outfalls, in which the contribution of Yuan River was larger than that of Li River. However, the contribution rates of water and TN of the three outfalls to West Dongting Lake during the wet season reached above 20% and 30%, respectively, indicating that the contribution of the three outfalls to West Dongting Lake could not be ignored. Among them, the contributions of Songzi outfall were higher than those from Taiping and Ouchi outfalls. Therefore, we suggest that the relevant departments should identify key river management targets during different water periods, implement refined management over water pollution in West Dongting Lake, and prioritize the pollutant input of Yuran River and Songzi outfall (especially during the wet season). This study demonstrates that major ion tracing is suitable for estimating the contribution rates of different nutrient sources in the river-lake system, which will provide valuable information for protecting the water quality of West Dongting Lake in the future.																				2073-4441				NOV	2022	14	21							3463	10.3390/w14213463	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14213463													WOS:000881517700001

This study aims to better understand its reproductive biology and possible influence of macrophytes on the breeding season. A total of 608 fish were caught monthly from September 2017 to August 2019. The overall sex-ratio showed significant predominance of females in Ono (1:1.37; chi(2) = 7.10; P<0.05) and Kodjoboue (1:1.84; chi(2) = 28.62; P<0.05) lagoons. The sexual maturity recorded in Ono lagoon for males (148.2 mm, SL) and females (145.3 mm) was slightly higher than that of males (144.4 mm, SL) and females (141.8 mm) in Kodjoboue lagoon. March and August-October (Ono lagoon) and February and July-September (Kodjoboue lagoon) were the most intensive spawning months. The absolute fecundity was higher in Ono lagoon (1472-6116 oocytes) than in Kodjoboue lagoon (1676-4210 oocytes), indicating a better food supply due to the high abundance of macrophytes in Ono lagoon. Oocyte size frequency distributions show oocytes of different sizes, indicating more than one spawning within a reproduction season. These findings might facilitate future studies establishing its potential production and its exploitation and management.

Identification of High-Occupancy Areas and Movement Dynamics of Age-0 Lake Sturgeon in the Lower Fox River, Wisconsin	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The lower Fox River (LFR) is a highly urbanized and fragmented system with a legacy of pollution. Benthic dredging and sediment cleanup combined with capping have been implemented with the goal of remediating the polychlorinated biphenyl contamination and improving the health of resident fish and wildlife populations. The LFR hosts a small population of adult Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens that spawns at the base of the first barrier, De Pere Dam. Recent research suggests that larval production is limited and no juveniles have been documented residing within the system, although limited sampling has been conducted. The objectives of this study were to describe age-0 Lake Sturgeon movement patterns, quantify the duration of river residency, and identify areas of congregation in the LFR. To track fish, a total of 38 age-0 and 1 age-1 Lake Sturgeon were obtained from nearby wild populations and hatchery settings, implanted with acoustic transmitters, released below De Pere Dam, and actively tracked, daily, for similar to 40 d (August-October in 2018 and 2019). Sixty-nine percent of the acoustically tracked age-0 Lake Sturgeon remained in the LFR for >50% of the study period, and emigration events appear to be related to increases in river discharge. Individuals residing within the LFR tend to congregate within six areas of the LFR encompassing 6% of total river area. The results suggest that suitable habitat exists in the LFR for age-0 and age-1 Lake Sturgeon, that discharge may cue downstream movement, and that high-occupancy areas (likely areas of preferred habitat) are present in the LFR. Long-term monitoring of larval production, survival, and age-0/juvenile dynamics will continue to help identify recruitment bottlenecks, improve knowledge of juvenile ecology, and guide future restoration goals.

In general, they are relatively small (1.2-6.0 km(2) surface area) and shallow ponds (0.05-0.2 m water depth) and even seasonally dry lakes. The results reveal that the concentration of GDGTs has a good positive correlation with the (nCO(3)(2-) + nHCO(3)(-))/total ions, and the concentration of GDGTs in carbonate-type lake sediments is significantly higher than that in sulfate-type lake sediments. Most GDGT-based indices show no significant differences, and the distributions of GDGTs are similar in the two types of saline lake sediments. The lack of a positive correlation between the content of clay minerals and the concentration of GDGTs may imply that the ability of clay minerals to carry terrigenous organic matter is very limited in arid climates. The branched GDGTS (brGDGTs) in the two saline lake sediments may mainly come from in situ biological production and have low terrestrial inputs. The different weathering level of feldspar minerals in the two types of saline lakes results in the difference in organic matter content, which ultimately affects the concentration of GDGTs.					; Zhang, Xilong/AAA-2666-2022	Zhang, Shengyin/0000-0003-3310-8491; Zhang, Xilong/0000-0002-4949-6794														2075-163X				OCT	2022	12	10							1233	10.3390/min12101233	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/min12101233													WOS:000873285200001

Based on remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques, this study analyzed the changes in the number and area of water bodies along the G109 and G219 highways in the QTP in the past 20 years. The results showed that between 2000 and 2019, the number of water bodies along the two highways increased by 24 and 19%, respectively, and their area increased by 26 and 19%, respectively. The area and the number of water bodies >1 km(2) in the permafrost area and those <1 km(2) in the seasonal permafrost area both changed significantly. The change in the number of water bodies in the permafrost area was positively correlated with annual average temperature, while that in the seasonal permafrost area was significantly positively correlated with annual precipitation. This study provided basic data that could be used in studies on the interrelationship between engineering and water bodies within the context of climate change and will contribute to revealing the mechanisms through which engineering projects affect frozen soils.

J	Mugo, J; Odoli, C; Nyakeya, K				Mugo, James; Odoli, Cyprian; Nyakeya, Kobingi			Protection of fish breeding areas in Lake Baringo and the potential for sustainable resource management	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Lake Baringo (located in Kenya, East Africa) fishery is currently under perturbation with diverse annual fluctuations in the catch landings. In an attempt to remedy the declining fishery, Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, Fisheries Department and Beach Management Units, identified and demarcated three fish breeding areas for protection. To assess the effectiveness of these protected fish breeding areas, three fleets of multifilament gillnets (mesh sizes; 25.4 to 203.2 mm) were set between February and December 2018. One fleet was set inside the breeding area, whereas the other two fleets were set 200m and 400m outsides. Fish species abundance, size structure and maturity stages were analyzed from the catch. Fish species abundance was higher within fish breeding areas (67.8%) than outside (32.2%). Labeobarbus intermedius was the most abundant (55.3 %), followed by Oreochromis niloticus baringoensis (29.9%), Labeo cylindricus (13.2%) and Clarias gariepinus (1.7%). Even though larger fish sizes were recorded outside than inside fish breeding areas, they were not statistically different irrespective of seasons (P>0.05). Majority of the fish (approx. 70%) both inside and outside the breeding areas were in gonad stages 1 and 2. The results indicate that the three areas have great potential to increase fish productivity through fish recruitment and subsequent spillover into fishing grounds. It is recommended that stakeholders, especially Beach Management Units and County Government Department of Fisheries, focus on actualizing the protection of fish breeding areas through enhanced monitoring and surveillance. Fishers should also be sensitized on protected areas concept, coupled with the need to use proper mesh sizes and fishing effort. Beach Management Units should be strengthened as co-management units to guarantee sustainable fisheries resource utilization in Lake Baringo.																			1463-4988	1539-4077				OCT-DEC	2022	25	4					53	59		10.14321/aehm.025.04.53	http://dx.doi.org/10.14321/aehm.025.04.53													WOS:000949414600007
J	Navarre, KL; Warren, JM; Koons, DN				Navarre, Kelsey L.; Warren, Jeffrey M.; Koons, David N.			Hydrology management influences nest survival but not clutch size in Lesser Scaup	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Components of reproductive success such as clutch size and nest survival may greatly affect avian population growth rates. Understanding how environmental conditions influence temporal variation in these demographic parameters could thus provide valuable insight into best management practices for species of concern. One such species that could benefit from a better understanding of such processes is Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis), whose overall abundance in North America has declined since the early 1980s. We used a long-term study (2005-2019) of Lesser Scaup demography at Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Montana, USA, to examine how the management of wetland conditions influenced within- and across-year temporal variation in clutch size and nest survival. Predicted clutch size varied more across nest initiation dates (6.18-10.05 eggs) within years than it did across years (7.51-8.38 eggs), and none of the covariates we examined were significantly related to clutch size across years. Nest daily survival rates varied substantially across days within breeding seasons (e.g., 2018: 0.38-0.985), and annual mean nest survival varied greatly across years (0.27-0.58). Furthermore, seasonal chronology of managed wetland water levels influenced nest survival such that years when water levels gradually rose to a maximum late in the breeding season, relative to mean nest initiation date, resulted in the highest nest survival. These findings collectively suggest that when flows can be manipulated with water control structures, efforts to manage the chronology of water levels at watershed and local wetland scales could improve nest survival, whereas such management efforts will not likely affect clutch sizes.																			1712-6568					OCT	2022	17	2							29	10.5751/ACE-02268-170229	http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ACE-02268-170229													WOS:000880620300001

In this paper, 15 CMIP5 models with precipitation data for the time period of 2006-2019 for which reliable observations are available under the RCP4.5 scenario were evaluated for their applicability, and the models with better simulation results were selected for predicting the precipitation in the Dongting Lake Basin during the flood season (April-September) in the mid-21st century (2020-2049). The results of the study show that (i) most models behaved reasonably consistent with the observation in the Dongting Lake Basin, and predicted an upward trend for the future precipitation while the multi-model ensemble (MME) showed a relatively slow increasing trend of 0.8 mm/year; (ii) the future precipitation in Dongting Lake Basin presented a variation form of "peak-valley-peak-valley", suggesting strong interannual and interdecadal variations; (iii) the interannual variability showed great agreement with large-scale circulation, implying that the rainfall is controlled by the circulation. The analysis of the wind fields at 200 hPa and 850 hPa in the peak and valley years showed that the characteristics of low-level convergence and high-level divergence were significantly stronger in the peak precipitation years than in the weak years; moreover, the teleconnection pattern of "+ - +" from Europe, the Ural Mountains, and East Asia was clearly manifested in the 500 hPa height field of the Dongting Lake Basin, which can influence the intensity of the trough ridge over East Asia and change the low-level water vapor convergence and divergence, thus affecting the source of water vapor in the Dongting Lake Basin.																				2073-4433				OCT	2022	13	10							1571	10.3390/atmos13101571	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13101571													WOS:000872264100001

An understanding of surface water conditions in this region is necessary to study the coastal dynamics, and the implications of pollutants to the marine ecological environment. Here, we report the long-term trends and spatio-temporal variability in chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in the KG basin, and discuss the dynamics of Chl-a patterns from 2002 to 2021. Monthly Chl-a averages from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used for the analysis of trends and seasonal distributions by linear regression fitting. Our results revealed a downward trend in Chl-a concentrations, with a value of -0.000003 mg/m(3) per month. A noticeable decreasing trend in the sediment load was also observed from the major rivers drained into the KG basin. The monthly runoff, precipitation, and wind fields were analysed to understand the Chl-a distribution patterns during the study period. We observed that runoff, precipitation, and wind forcing are the primary drivers controlling Chl-a distributions and dispersion patterns in the study area. The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the potential impacts of Chl-a to marine ecosystem, and provides new tools for assessing long-term trends in satellite-derived Chl-a concentrations in the prospective of climate change scenarios.

A potential benefit of catch-and-release fisheries is higher catches for anglers due to multiple captures of individual fish within a season. We term the measure of this benefit "recycling rate," defined as the total catch in a fishing season divided by the number of individuals caught at least once. Multiple-capture studies are common in the literature, but our recycling rate is a new metric that could be helpful in evaluating recreational fisheries. Estimates of recycling rate will be dependent on several factors, especially the distribution of angling selectivities among individual fish, which is generally unknown. We compared several models that estimated recycling rate based on different assumptions about angling selectivity. Application of the models to Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu data from Lake Mille Lacs, Minnesota, demonstrated that estimates of recycling rate were robust to assumptions about the distribution of angling selectivity.																			0363-2415	1548-8446				DEC	2022	47	12					529	536		10.1002/fsh.10824	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/fsh.10824		SEP 2022											WOS:000851237500001

Chichancanab Lake is one of the most important freshwater ecosystems located in the center of Yucatan peninsula (Mexico) as it is a primary hydrological ecoregion and habitat for endemic fauna species. However, its diversity of freshwater algae is poorly known, including cyanobacteria, a group that is of interest for its potential function as an indicator. Objective. Document the diversity of the cyanobacteria present in this site. Methods. Three samplings were carried out in different seasons of the year. The collection of freshwater algae was carried out directly. The samples were analyzed by light microscopy and diagnostic characteristics were collected depending on the taxa. Species were identified with specialized literature, in some cases the nomenclature was updated, and a review of its regional diversity was carried out. Results. In this study, 29 species of cyanobacteria belonging to different orders are reported, of which Synechococcales and the families Merismopediaceae (Synechococcales) and Oscillatoriaceae (Oscillatoriales) stand out. We report 18 new records for Quintana Roo, of which 11 are for Yucatan Peninsula: Synechococcus ambiguus, Eucapsis aphanocapsoides, E. parallelepippedon, Romeria hieroglyphica, Jaaginema subtilissimum, Komvophoron minimum, Planktolyn-gbya limnetica, Schizothrix tenuis, Spirulina nordstedtii, Phormidium californicum y P. lucidum. The ecological conditions of the site are similar to other tropical water bodies in different Caribbean countries and share at least 31.4% of morphospecies. Conclusions. A greater diversity of cyanobacteria than previously reported in the literature was found. This work intends to lay the foundations for the knowledge of freshwater algae in the lagoon and be a reference for future taxonomic, ecological, and applied works that start from this place.

The purpose of this study was to determine the exact proportions of different water sources absorbed by herbaceous plant species in the wetland of Poyang Lake in an inland humid region. This identified the water sources patterns in wetlands and provide Poyang Lake managers information about the lake water level needed to sustain vegetative life. We analysed the deuterium isotope composition (delta H-2) and oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18) values in the stem water of dominant herbaceous plant during its different growth stages to explore the proportions of water sources in different growth stages by using the Phillips equation, and the results supported the accuracy. The results indicate that the groundwater should not be lower than 0.13 m, otherwise the Carex cinerascens may not be able to absorb it. In previous studies, the lower slopes and intercepts of delta H-2-delta O-18 were attributed to the secondary evaporation under the cloud, but we found that there is a cumulative evaporation effect in rainwater, soil water, and groundwater, which makes the slopes and the intercepts of delta H-2-delta O-1(8) relationship lines become lower from top to bottom. In this study, the final effect of evaporation on the delta H-2 and delta O-18 values of shallow soil water is depleting the delta H-2 and delta O-18 values of shallow soil water, which is different from previous studies. The delta H-2 and delta O-18 values of groundwater varied little with changes of seasons and rainfalls. The delta H-2-delta O-18 relationship lines established by various substances can also reflect the regulation of d-excess by large lakes through secondary sources.

To investigate the effects of oxamide granules (2.00-2.38 mm in diameter) as a single basal fertilizer (180 or 144 kg N ha(-1)) on rice growth, soil properties, and N use efficiency in terms of N recovery efficiency (NRE), we conducted field experiments on two different types of paddy soils over two rice-growing seasons. Results showed that the fertilization effects of oxamide granules varied between the two types of paddy soils. In the red clayey paddy soil, the grain yields for both rice-growing seasons were high with a significantly higher NRE in the oxamide treatment than in the urea treatment. However, in the alluvial sandy paddy soil, the grain yields in the oxamide treatment were slightly lower than those in the urea treatment. Furthermore, oxamide produced little improvement in NRE in the alluvial sandy paddy soil. Soil incubation experiments over 98 d were also carried out to evaluate the factors affecting the N release behavior of oxamide granules in the two types of paddy soils. We found that the amidase activity was higher and, therefore, the oxamide hydrolysis rate was faster in the alluvial sandy paddy soil, which had a higher soil pH value and organic matter content, compared to the red clayey paddy soil. The faster N release and the longer growth period resulted in a mismatch between N supply by oxamide and rice demand, which, in turn, led to little improvement in NRE and a decreased grain yield in the alluvial sandy paddy soil, especially in the reduced oxamide treatment. These results could help select the appropriate size of oxamide granules for use as a slow-release N fertilizer depending on the soil properties and growth period of rice.

Climatic drivers of limnological change in Iqallukvik Lake, Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, Canada	ARCTIC SCIENCE												The Tuktoyaktuk coastlands contain thousands of lakes along an area of the Beaufort Sea in the rapidly changing western Arctic. These lakes may be susceptible to a range of impacts associated with climate warming, including potential increased marine influence changes associatedwith reduced lake ice cover and thawing permafrost. We examined a 210Pb-dated sediment core from Iqallukvik Lake to reconstruct ecosystem changes over the last several hundred years using sediment particle size analysis and diatom subfossils. Changes in sediment texture over the past -200 years were broadly aligned with inferred changes in regional precipitation, known to be an important driver of regional lake level in the Tuktoyaktuk coastlands. Diatoms were functionally absent at the bottom of the sediment core, but increased after -1850, likely in response to early warming, with further floristic changes due to accelerated warming over the last century. Diatoms throughout the core are predominantly freshwater species tolerant of broad salinity concentrations, indicating that Iqallukvik Lake is likely subject to minimal direct marine influence and has not been impacted by notable inundation over the recent past. Overall, this research suggests that climate impacts Iqallukvik Lake mainly on the length of the ice-free season.

Threatened species are sensitive to environmental changes and can be extirpated rapidly due to climatic and anthropogenic effects. Here, we monitor the distribution of the locally critically endangered Urothemis edwardsii in northeastern Algeria where the species has been recovering during the last decade after being restricted to a single locality since the 1990s. During the flight seasons in 2018, 2019, and 2021, we conducted field surveys recording the number of males, females, and breeding pairs across 15 sites in northeast Algeria (El Taref province). We found the species at seven sites; reproduction was confirmed at four. In two of the sites, the species was newly recorded but showed no signs of reproduction. We confirmed the maintenance of the reproductive populations that were recently discovered. While the local conservation status of the species is better than that in the 1990s, there are still different threats that need to be addressed and conservation measures that should be implemented or reinforced to ensure maintenance as well as future expansion of the species.					; Zebsa, Rabah/ABD-4489-2021; Khelifa, Rassim/U-2405-2019; psy, eco/GXV-3091-2022; Moussa, Houhamdi/J-2708-2018	Zebsa, Rabah/0000-0001-8214-9500; Mahdjoub, Hayat/0000-0002-8972-9628; Youcefi, Abdeldjalil/0000-0003-2003-6767; Bensakhri, Zinette/0000-0001-5024-1329; Khelifa, Rassim/0000-0001-6632-8787; Zouaimia, Abdelheq/0000-0002-5652-3148													0037-9271	2168-6351				JUL 4	2022	58	4					366	372		10.1080/00379271.2022.2099972	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00379271.2022.2099972		AUG 2022											WOS:000841817400001
J	Aliagha, UG; Mustafa, FB				Aliagha, Uche Godwin; Mustafa, Firuza Begham			Examining seasonality and vertical variability of heavy metals contamination in Urban Lake Malaysia using discriminant analysis	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The aims of this study are threefold: (1) to determine the seasonal, vertical and lateral variations in heavy metals (Na, K, Al, Fe, Ba, Cu, Ni, Cd) contamination in Varsity Lake Malaysia, (2) if the significant seasonal variation were observed, derive a discriminant function metals contributed or had the greatest effect on the seasonal variation, and (3) assess the extent to which the water quality has degenerated based on three water quality guidelines. The water Sample analysis was performed by an inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Variation in heavy metal concentration was analysed using discriminant analysis method. The results of Wilks' Lambda F-test, canonical discriminant function showed strong significant seasonal variations for the metals with the rainy season having greater concentrations than in the dry season. While rainy season concentrations decreased in the order Na > K > Al > Fe > Ba > Cu > Ni > Cd, the dry season concentrations decreased in the order: Na > K > Fe > Al > Ba and Ni > Cu > Cd. The finding reveals a significant discriminant function and the metals with the most significant discriminant power were Na, Cu, and K, thus made the highest contribution (60%) to the seasonal variability. Though overall concentration was higher at 1.5-m depth, no significant vertical ( depth) variation was observed. Overall, the summative metal concentration is highest in the inlet section of the lake, followed by the outlet sections. None of the metals exceeded the values for the Malaysian Interim National Water Quality Guidelines Class II and the United States Environmental Protection Agency criteria. Although Cd, Al and Fe, did exceed the Canadian Council of Ministers of Environment Guidelines, the water quality is still safe for macro aquatic life, no advanced treatment is required and hence good for recreational purposes.

The total dissolved Hg in the river, lake and groundwater samples ranged from 5 to 1414 ng/L (n = 13). The dissolved Hg concentration increased by two orders of magnitude in the Gomati River due to the untreated effluent inputs from Lucknow urban center and by three fold in the Ganga River due to economic development during the last two decades. The dissolved Hg concentration in water resources was reported several folds high during the monsoon season and above the prescribed drinking water standards of World Health Organization. Atmospheric deposition was predominantly identified as source of Hg in the Karela Lake water (364 ng/L). The present study underscores the significance of monsoon-controlled anthroposphere-to-aquatic Hg transfer in the alluvial plain that acts as the caterer of 7% of the world's population.					; Yadav, Dr. Jitendra/HCH-0919-2022; Upreti, Garima/MIQ-3742-2025	Yadav, Dr. Jitendra Kumar/0000-0002-0825-6903; 													2363-5037	2363-5045				AUG	2022	8	4							105	10.1007/s40899-022-00695-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40899-022-00695-0													WOS:000820642400001
J	Schmalzer, PA; Foster, TE				Schmalzer, Paul A.; Foster, Tammy E.			Effects of repeated fire on Florida oak-saw palmetto scrub	FIRE ECOLOGY												Background The dominant species of Florida oak-saw palmetto scrub sprout after burning from belowground rhizomes or fire-resistant aboveground buds with rapid reestablishment of cover. Responses to single fires are well documented; however, responses to repeated fires may differ. Fire return intervals, differences among sites, and species may influence responses. We used transect data from four sites on Kennedy Space Center/Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge to test whether growth differed through repeated fires. Two sites burned five times in 36 years, one site burned five times in 25 years, and one burned four times in 18 years. We used linear mixed models that account for repeated measures to determine if the number of fires affected height, total cover >= 0.5 m and < 0.5 m, bare ground, and cover of the dominant oak (Quercus) >= 0.5 m and of saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) >= 0.5 m. We compared community composition through repeated fires using nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination. Results Height, total cover >= 0.5 m, and cover of the dominant oak >= 0.5 m and of saw palmetto >= 0.5 m increased with time since burn; total cover < 0.5 m and bare ground decreased. A quadratic term in the growth model was significant except for total cover < 0.5 m. There were site differences for all variables except bare ground. The number of fires decreased height, total cover >= 0.5 m, and cover of the dominant oak >= 0.5 and increased total cover < 0.5 m and bare ground but had no effect on cover of Serenoa repens >= 0.5 m. Community changes after repeated fires were similar in nonmetric multidimensional ordinations with time since burn correlated to the first or second axis. Conclusions Scrub recovered from repeated fires at a range of intervals and seasons, but short return intervals reduced growth with responses differing among species.																			1933-9747					JUL 30	2022	18	1							16	10.1186/s42408-022-00140-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s42408-022-00140-9													WOS:000833506300001

The high CO2 content in these source waters caused the 1986 limnic eruption. The deep inflowing water is denser than the hypolimnetic water and maintains the stability of the water column, which is double-diffusively stratified. During the dry season in Feb 2002, cooling triggered the formation of a double-diffusive (DD) staircase, a sequence of homogeneously mixed layers separated by distinct stable interfaces. The initiation of the staircase was slightly below the permanent chemocline at similar to 50 m depth, from where the staircase expanded vertically in a diffusion-type manner for similar to 750 days to a maximal vertical extension of similar to 37 m. The staircase pattern caused the upward heat fluxes to increase which depleted the driving temperature gradient. Subsequently, the density ratio increased and reduced the upward heat flux divergence until DD progressively weakened and finally the staircase structure eroded. Based on 39 CTD profiles, we describe the DD phenomenon, explain the three distinct phases of this unique DD event, which lasted for similar to 850 days, and discuss the vertical extension of the DD zone in relation to the rates of new layer formation and layer decay. To our knowledge, this is the only observation over the entire lifespan-"from birth to death"-of a DD event in a natural water body. [GRAPHICS] .

Taking Poyang Lake Grassland as an Example	PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY												As one of the basic theories of biodiversity conservation, island biogeography has been widely accepted in the past decades. Originally, island biogeography was put forward and applied in oceanic environments. But later on, it was found out that the application was not only limited to oceanic islands, but also in terrestrial environments with relatively isolated conditions. In terms of biodiversity level, island biogeography generally focuses on a small scale, such as species diversity and genetic diversity. The studies of biodiversity on a large-scale based on island biogeography, such as ecosystem and landscape scales, were seldomly conducted. Taking Poyang Lake, the largest fresh water lake in China as case study area, 30 grasslands were randomly selected to study whether island biogeography can be applied to grasslands at a landscape level from three island attributes (area, distance and shape), and the most important ecological variable (flooding) in Poyang Lake. The results showed that in general, grasslands have the property of an island, and follow the basic principle of island biogeography. We found the area and flooding duration were the two most important determinants of landscape diversity. There was a significant positive correlation between the grassland area and the landscape diversity, which could be well expressed by logarithmic function model (R-2 = 0.73). There was a negative correlation between flooding duration and landscape diversity, which could be described by an inverse model (R-2 = 0.206). The distance to mainland and the shape of grassland were correlated with landscape diversity, but the fitting result of the models was not as good as expected. The possible reason could be that Poyang Lake is a seasonal lake, the water level varies with hydrological conditions, so that the grasslands are not strongly isolated and their shape is not stable enough required by island biogeography. Furthermore, it indicates that besides area, distance and shape attributes, flooding strongly affects the biodiversity of grassland vegetation, and should not be ignored when applying island biogeography theory to Poyang Lake. This study is expected to be a supplement for island biogeography in terrestrial environments, and the results are expected to benefit for the biodiversity conservation in Poyang Lake.																			0031-9457	1851-5657					2023	92	2					455	470		10.32604/phyton.2022.022466	http://dx.doi.org/10.32604/phyton.2022.022466		JUL 2022											WOS:000828086900001

LAWRENCE RIVER, QUEBEC, CANADA	JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY												The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is an invasive species that has become one of the most abundant fish in the St. Lawrence River, Quebec, Canada over the past 15 yr. Since its introduction, the round goby has acquired a number of native parasites, yet little is known about the dynamics of parasite recruitment. To examine this question, young-of-the-year and juvenile round gobies were collected monthly from 2 localities in the river (Iles de la Paix, Ile Dorval) from June through November 2012. At Iles de la Paix, round gobies (n = 180) were infected with 3 species of parasites, all larval stages (Diplostomum spp., Tylodelphys scheuringi, Neoechinorhynchus tenellus). Prevalence of the digenean Diplostomum spp. varied from 3.3 to 13.3%, and mean abundance from 0.03 to 0.53 from June through September, with a maximum in August. The digenean T. scheuringi was seen only in August, at a prevalence of 10.0% and a mean abundance of 0.53. The acanthocephalan N. tenellus was observed in June, August, and September, prevalence ranging from 3.3 to 10.0% and mean abundance from 0.03 to 0.27. Maximum infection for all 3 species occurred in August. All infected fish were >= 44 mm in total length (TL). Fish infected with more than 1 parasite species were >60 mm TL. No round goby (n = 178) was infected at Ile Dorval. This study demonstrated that the invasive round goby starts to acquire parasite infections in the St. Lawrence River in the first year of life and may contribute to the transmission of some parasites within this ecosystem.

Reproductive cycle of the golden carpet shell (Polititapes aureus) in the Ria Formosa lagoon (southern Portugal)	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												The present study described the gametogenesis and assessed the pattern of energy storage throughout the reproductive cycle of the golden carpet shell (Polititapes aureus) from the Ria Formosa lagoon (southern Portugal). Monthly sampling was performed for two years (March 2016-February 2018) and the study was based on gonad histology, complemented by the estimation of the mean gonadal index, body condition index and biochemical composition. The species' reproductive cycle presented a seasonal pattern, with a resting period mainly between October and January and gametogenesis beginning around February-March. The spawning season of P. aureus was shorter in 2016 (June-September) than in 2017 (May-October). Furthermore, ripe individuals were very scarce (1.3%) in 2017 compared with the previous year (11.4%). Mean gonadal index (GI) reflected the species' reproductive cycle and the body condition index (CI) and biochemical composition of the individuals exhibited high variation between years. Regarding the biochemical composition, proteins ranged between 190.6 and 595.2 mu g mg(-1), glycogen from 5.7 to 102.6 mu g mg(-1) and total lipids between 31.6 and 80.7 mu g mg(-1). The reproduction of P. aureus was strongly influenced by fluctuations in both seawater temperature and chlorophyll a, as reflected through the temporal variation in the gonadal cycle, condition index and biochemical composition. Overall, the information gathered in this study is valuable to propose scientifically based harvesting management measures for the long-term sustainable exploitation of this shellfish resource, further reinforcing the importance of implementing adaptive fishery management strategies to cope with global climate change.

J	Gao, X; Zhao, DS				Gao, Xuan; Zhao, Dongsheng			Spatial and Temporal Variability of Key Bio-Temperature Indicators and Their Effects on Vegetation Dynamics in the Great Lakes Region of Central Asia	REMOTE SENSING												Dryland ecosystems are fragile to climate change due to harsh environmental conditions. Climate change affects vegetation growth primarily by altering some key bio-temperature thresholds. Key bio-temperatures are closely related to vegetation growth, and slight changes could produce substantial effects on ecosystem structure and function. Therefore, this study selected the number of days with daily mean temperature above 0 degrees C (DT0), 5 degrees C (DT5), 10 degrees C (DT10), 20 degrees C (DT20), the start of growing season (SGS), the end of growing season (EGS), and the length of growing season (LGS) as bio-temperature indicators to analyze the response of vegetation dynamics to climate change in the Great Lakes Region of Central Asia (GLRCA) for the period 1982-2014. On the regional scale, DT0, DT5, DT10, and DT20 exhibited an overall increasing trend. Spatially, most of the study area showed that the negative correlation between DT0, DT5, DT10, DT20 with the annual Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) increased with increasing bio-temperature thresholds. In particular, more than 88.3% of the study area showed a negative correlation between annual NDVI and DT20, as increased DT20 exacerbated ecosystem drought. Moreover, SGS exhibited a significantly advanced trend at a rate of -0.261 days/year for the regional scale, while EGS experienced a significantly delayed trend at a rate of 0.164 days/year. Because of changes in SGS and EGS, LGS across the GLRCA was extended at a rate of 0.425 days/year, which was mainly attributed to advanced SGS. In addition, our study revealed that about 53.6% of the study area showed a negative correlation between annual NDVI and LGS, especially in the north, indicating a negative effect of climate warming on vegetation growth in the drylands. Overall, the results of this study will help predict the response of vegetation to future climate change in the GLRCA, and support decision-making for implementing effective ecosystem management in arid and semi-arid regions.																				2072-4292				JUN	2022	14	12							2948	10.3390/rs14122948	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14122948													WOS:000817331900001
J	Reid, K; Schneider, K				Reid, Keith; Schneider, Kimberley			Modelling dissolved phosphorus losses from accumulated soil phosphorus and applied fertilizer and manure for a national risk indicator	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												Balancing the weighting of various components of phosphorus loss in models is a critical but often overlooked step in accurate estimation of risk of P loss under field conditions. This study compared the P loss coefficients used to predict dissolved P losses from desorption from accumulated P in the soil, and those incidental to applications of P as fertilizer or manure, with extraction coefficients determined from actual P losses reported in literature for sites in Canada, with the addition of some sites with similar soils and climate from some northern states. The extraction coefficients for dissolved P measured in runoff water were 6.5x greater in year-round edge-of-field (EoF) measurements than in runoff boxes, indicating that models using P extraction coefficients derived from runoff box experiments will be underestimating the magnitude of losses from P accumulation in soil. Differences among the measurement methods (runoff box, rainfall simulator, or EoF) were not evident for incidental losses from applied P, but current models appear to overpredict the losses of applied P. Good agreement between measured and predicted dissolved P (DP) concentrations using the equations in the Annual Phosphorous Loss Estimator model were achieved by applying coefficients of 0.275 to the fertilizer equations and 0.219 to the manure equations, implying that 72.5% of fertilizer P and 78% of manure P are not available for runoff. This study underlines the importance of considering the relative weights of the various components of P loss as new models are developed and validated.					; Reid, Keith/ABA-4114-2021	Reid, Keith/0000-0001-8346-3614; 													0008-4271	1918-1841				JUN	2022	102	2					463	476		10.1139/cjss-2021-0049	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjss-2021-0049													WOS:001000493300006

This study aims to collect basic on the fractions of the populations that colonize two transitional waters in eastern Algeria. We provide here the first information on the composition and variations of the diet of A. Anguilla in Mellah lagoon (ML) and Wadi El Kebir (WEK). During one year (December 2008-November 2009), a total of 1120 eels (N-ML = 625; 24.3 < TL < 75.8 cm; 23 < TW < 842 g; N-WEK = 495; 23.5 < TL < 83 cm; 23 < TW < 1470 g), was sampled. Qualitative and quantitative variations of the diet are looked for in the two sites according to season and development stages. The annual mean values of the coefficient of digestive vacuity were respectively 38.1% and 53.1%. This coefficient varies according to season and development stages. Anguilla anguilla is opportunistic and diversifies its diet between molluscs, teleost fish and Macrophyta, with a preference for crustaceans in the two ecosystems (%IRIML = 89.98%, IRIWEK = 96.15).

Estimating phytoplankton stoichiometry from routinely collected monitoring data	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Accurately estimating the elemental stoichiometry of phytoplankton is critical for understanding biogeochemical cycles. In laboratory experiments, stoichiometric ratios vary among species and with changes in environmental conditions. Field observations of total phosphorus (P) and total nitrogen (N) collected at regional and national scales can supplement and expand insights into factors influencing phytoplankton stoichiometry, but analyses applied to these data can introduce biases that affect interpretations of the observed patterns. We introduce an analytical approach for estimating the ratio between phytoplankton N and P from the particulate fraction of nutrient pools in lake samples. We use Bayesian models to represent observations of particulate P and N as the sum of contributions from nutrients bound within phytoplankton and nutrients associated with non-phytoplankton suspended sediment. Application of this approach to particulate nutrient data collected in Missouri impoundments yields estimates of the mass ratio of N:P in phytoplankton ranging from 8 to 10 across a variety of lakes and seasons. N:P in particulate matter ranged from 6 to 70, a variability driven by differences in nutrients bound to non-phytoplankton suspended sediment. We adapted the Bayesian models to estimate N:P using more commonly available measurements of total P and total N and applied this model to a continental-scale monitoring data set. We compared phytoplankton nutrient content estimated from the two analyses and found that when datasets lack direct measurements of particulate nutrient concentrations, the model estimate of phytoplankton nutrient content includes contributions from nutrients within phytoplankton and dissolved nutrients that are associated with changes in phytoplankton biomass.

However. these protocols always require optimization steps for the analysis of specific types of samples. This study aimed to optimize a molecular protocol to analyze cyanobacterial 16S rRNA in Danube Delta shallows lakes. In this regard. several commercial DNA extraction kits were tested compared to the potassium ethyl xanthogenate extraction method on different matrices. The obtained DNA was further used for 16S rRNA PCR optimization. Finally an optimized protocol is proposed for the molecular analysis of the cyanobacteria group in freshwater samples. The best DNA extraction method was the potassium xanthogenate extraction from dried cyanobacterial biomass. A dynamic in total genomic eDNA ryas observed. reflecting the seasonal difference in phytoplankton biomass from the studied lakes. The PCR protocol optimized by us can be successfully applied for the identification of a broad range of cyanobacterial genetic markers.

Long-Term Hydrologic Sustainability of Calcareous Fens along the Glacial Lake Agassiz Beach Ridges, Northwestern Minnesota, USA	WETLANDS												Calcareous fens are peat-accumulating wetlands fed by calcium-rich groundwater that support several threatened species of plants that thrive in these geochemical conditions. This investigation characterized the hydrology of two calcareous fens in the Glacial Lake Agassiz beach ridge complex in northwestern Minnesota, USA. Sandy surficial beach ridge aquifers and underlying buried glacial aquifers were considered as sources of groundwater to the fen. A combination of the two sources influenced by seasonal hydrology was also considered. Synchronous hydrologic responses to rainfall events and hydraulic gradients indicate the calcareous fens are well-connected to the beach-ridge aquifers. Chemistry of water discharging to the fens is calcium-magnesium-bicarbonate type similar to the beach ridge aquifers, and distinct from buried aquifers that have significant sodium and chloride. High tritium values and oxygen isotope signatures similar to the beach ridge aquifers characterized fen water. Beach ridge aquifer complexes are relatively thin (8-10 m) and overlie thick clay/clay loam till. These beach ridges exhibit high seasonal recharge and have permanent saturated zones, providing a continual source of calcium-rich water for the fens. Electrical resistivity profiles characterized the glacial stratigraphy and highlighted the well-developed physical connection between beach ridge aquifers and calcareous fens. The results of this study allow evaluation of the potential impacts of irrigation and aggregate quarrying on calcareous fens along sand and gravel beach ridges.

These phosphorites are known to be highly concentrated in trace elements. This hysdrosystem receives water inputs mainly from Haho, Zio and Mono Rivers. These rivers discharge their waters in the hydrosystem after leaching agricultural, urban and mining areas. This study aims to assess the contamination level of nine trace elements (Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, Mn, Hg, and As) and their seasonal variability in Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus. Fish and water samples were collected from the lagoon complex during the rainy and dry seasons. These samples were analyzed for trace elements using an atomic absorption spectrometer method associated with a cold vapour and hydride generator. The average concentrations of trace elements in water (in mu g/L) samples ranged from 0.38 for Hg to 141.63 for Pb. The average concentrations (in mg/kg) of Cd: 0.18, Pb: 1.93, Cr: 1.89, Ni: 0.88, Cu: 1.02, As: 0.39 and Mn: 5.06 in the muscles were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than the permissible levels. The average concentrations of trace elements in the other organs (livers, gills and kidneys) were overall higher than the permissible levels (p < 0.0001). Seasonal variation of trace elements was observed in all the organs and was higher in the dry season (0.001 > p < 0.05). The highest contamination factors were as follow: muscle (Cd: 3.23), gills (Cd: 3.57), livers (Cr: 4.13) and kidneys (Cd: 3.69). Bioconcentration factors varied from 5.97 for Cd in the muscle to 8869.99 for Zn in the kidneys. These fishes are likely to cause toxicity effects to potential consumers. Therefore, it is necessary to protect this water ecosystem from further toxic element input.

In this study, the seasonal dynamics of the local dominant midge species was investigated. Phylogenetic trees of this species also were analyzed to discover its evolutionary history. Ultraviolet (UV) light traps were used for surveillance around West Lake in the period from April 2017 to November 2018. External morphological identification was performed using a stereomicroscope. Two genes of adult female midges that encoded the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) were sequenced and aligned online using GenBank nucleotide database and the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software 10.1.7. According to the field surveillance in 2017-2018, Forcipomyia bikanni Chan and LeRoux (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) is the representative dominant species of West Lake, with its activity peaking in August and October. The COI and ITS-1 gene sequences of F. bikanni (XH01-5) were 523 bp and 315 bp, respectively. The final phylogenetic tree of the COI implied that F. bikanni (XH01-5) has 97.9% significant similarity with conspecific F. bikanni (LC015045) from the adjacent Fujian Province, China (E-value <= 0.1%). Furthermore, the ITS-1 sequences with 98% likelihood showed the highest linkage between F. bikanni (XH01-5) and F. townsvillensis (Taylor) (HM775502-HM775504) with different branches. Thus, the final unrooted phylogenetic trees of COI and ITS-1 are essential tools for reconstructing the evolutionary histories of nonbiting midges.

Here, we assessed macroinvertebrate assemblages in relation to environmental conditions in Lake Aheme during the short and long wet seasons (SWS and LWS, respectively). This will help optimise sampling strategies for the future, when sampling only during the SWS or the LWS. A total of 4049 macroinvertebrates from 28 families and 32 genera were collected. Abundance was significantly higher at sites sampled during the SWS. Molluscs were the most dominant taxon and accounted for 92.8% of individuals collected during this study. This was followed by annelids, insects and crustaceans representing 3.7%, 3.2% and 0.3% of the total abundance, respectively. Biodiversity indices showed a significantly higher diversity in the SWS and higher spatial variation in the macroinvertebrate community. The first three axes of the non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed spatial changes in the macroinvertebrate community during the SWS and LWS. These changes were driven by salinity, conductivity, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen and water depth. No taxa could be assigned as indicators in the LWS whereas diverse brackish and freshwater species characterised the SWS. As a result, when considering sampling during the wet seasons, SWS sampling should suffice for a qualitative study whereas an accurate ecological investigation requires both SWS and LWS.

W.; Reynolds, Chevonne			Translocation experiment gives new insights into the navigation capacity of an African duck	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim Movement is integral to the distribution and abundance of wildlife. We undertook an experimental test of the navigation capacity of Egyptian Geese Alopochen aegyptiacus to better understand the movements of moult-migratory waterfowl and the implications of navigation capacity for their ecology. Location Southern Africa. In June 2015, we translocated six post-flightless moult Egyptian Geese 1250 km south, from north-west South Africa (Barberspan) to the south-west coast (Strandfontein). We compared their movements to those of 29 previously tracked resident Egyptian Geese from the source and translocation sites, and three additional sites (Voelvlei; Jozini Dam; Lake Manyame, north-central Zimbabwe). Methods We used solar-powered satellite GPS to track movement patterns and compared the movement paths of different birds using net-squared displacement analysis and multiple regression analysis of different measures of movement paths. Results Over time periods up to 658 days, none of the translocated Egyptian Geese returned to Barberspan and only one appeared to fly towards it. Translocated birds showed some novel and risky behaviours. Longer, searching-type movements were evident with the onset of both the breeding and moulting seasons. Quantitative comparisons suggested that translocated birds retained elements of learned behaviours. Main conclusions Navigation by Egyptian Geese appears to have a strong learned (internal) element, with long-distance movement triggered by internal states such as the need to moult. Translocated animals modified their movement patterns in ways that mostly allowed them to survive. Our results have interesting implications for understanding the dynamics of individual populations; a strong reliance on learned behaviours may explain the unresolved conundrum of why no African duck species has colonized Europe without human assistance. Our analysis demonstrates the complexity of influences on animal movement and highlights the importance of navigation capacity for conservation biogeography.					; Cumming, Graeme/B-6551-2008	Henry, Dominic/0000-0001-7375-141X; Reynolds, Chevonne/0000-0002-2345-7017; Cumming, Graeme/0000-0002-3678-1326													1366-9516	1472-4642				MAY	2022	28	5					1034	1049		10.1111/ddi.13510	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.13510		MAR 2022											WOS:000765444900001

Samplings were done between April and October of each year. A total of 6595 specimens belonging to 113 species, divided into two subfamilies (Syrphinae and Eristalinae) and 39 genera were determined. Eumerus bicornis Grkovic, Vujic et Hayat, 2019; Merodon albidus Sasic Zoric, Acanski et Vujic, 2020; Merodon chrysurus Hurkmans et Vujic, 2020; Merodon defectus Vujic, Likov et Radenkovic, 2020; Merodon longisetus Vujic, Radenkovic et Likov, 2020; Merodon obstipus Vujic, Radenkovic et Likov, 2020 were described as new species for science. Whereas the most abundant species were Sphaerophoria scripta (29.87%) and Syritta pipiens (17.76%), subdominant species were Eristalis tenax, Melanostoma mellinum, Eristalis arbustorum and Eupeodes corollae. The majority of species, 89 out of 113 were recognized as rare (relative contribution 10.72%). Species distribution maps, species richness, abundance, as well as Shannon-Wiener (H') index, species seasonal dynamic, and species sex ratio were calculated to indicate the diversity of Syrphidae species. To obtain present and for the period 2061-2080 species richness patterns and detect areas with the highest richness, we conducted a Species Distribution Modelling procedure. Considering current potential species richness, areas predicted to be most suitable for investigated hoverfly species (potentially having 29-37 species) were central-east and central-west parts of Isparta, as well as southern parts of Afyonkarahisar and northern parts of Burdur provinces. In the period of 2061-2080, it is predicted that the most suitable areas will shift from Isparta to the north and central parts of Burdur and to the western part of the Konya provinces. It is hoped that this study will stimulate further studies on the family Syrphidae in Turkey.					; Uzun Yiğit, Asiye/AGU-6833-2022; Miličić, Marija/V-7392-2019; Hayat, Rüstem/AAG-4523-2021; DEMIROZER, OZAN/HNC-3417-2023; Ačanski, Jelena/S-5383-2017; Vujic, Ante/AAG-2996-2020; Acanski, Jelena/S-5383-2017	Vujic, Ante/0000-0002-8819-8079; Uzun Yigit, Asiye/0000-0002-4822-4762; DEMIROZER, OZAN/0000-0001-7240-8898; Hayat, Rustem/0000-0003-1363-6203; Milicic, Marija/0000-0002-3154-660X; Acanski, Jelena/0000-0003-1745-6410													1742-7584	1742-7592				JUN	2022	42	3					2483	2491		10.1007/s42690-022-00776-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42690-022-00776-9		MAR 2022											WOS:000765007200001

Climate Relationships between Air Temperature and Water Temperatures in the Different Limnetic Zones of Lake Ladoga	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												Based on an extensive database, it is shown that for different limnetic regions of Lake Ladoga a temperature hysteresis phenomenon occurs for the period of open water from May through November. The features of heating and cooling of both the water surface and the integral water column temperature in six different zones of the lake have been revealed, depending on the air temperature of the near-surface layer. The approximation of dependences between these parameters, the second- and third-degree polynomials, has shown that there are stable, meaningful relationships (p < 0.05) between them, with the determination coefficient of 0.8-0.9. Analytical dependencies allowed calculation of the increase in water temperature when the air temperature changes by one degree. On Lake Ladoga, a dependence of the rate of change in water surface temperature on air temperature is found. The biggest changes occur during the heating period. In August, with maximum air temperatures, the rate of increase in water surface temperature, especially in the deep-water area, exceeds the rate of increase in air temperature. Canadian limnologists obtained similar results on Lake Ontario. Two important periods have been distinguished when the lake cooled down: the first one occurs when the surface temperature has a constant value with the minimum spatial dispersion; the second one occurs when the entire water column of the lake has the same water temperature with minimum spatial dispersion. These periods and values of water and air temperatures can serve as climatic norms in climate studies. Climatic changes in air temperature will affect the increase in water temperature in different ways in different seasons and in different areas of a large lake.

J	Molnar, P				Molnar, Peter			Differences between soil and air temperatures: Implications for geological reconstructions of past climate	GEOSPHERE												Among quantities of interest in paleoclimate, the mean annual air tem-perature, T-a, directly over the surface looms prominently. Most geologic estimates of past temperatures from continental regions, however, quantify temperatures of the soil or other material below the surface, T-s, and in general T-a < T-s. Both theory and data from the FLUXNET2015 data set of surface energy balance indicate systematic dependences of temperature differences Delta T = T-s - T-a and also of Bowen ratios-ratios of sensible to latent heat fluxes from surface to the atmosphereon the nature of the land-surface cover. In cold regions, with mean annual temperatures less than or similar to 5 degrees C, latent heat flux tends to be small, and values of Delta T can be large, 3-5 degrees C or larger. Over wet surfaces, latent heat fluxes dominate sensible heat fluxes, and values of both Delta T and Bowen ratios commonly are small. By contrast, over arid surfaces that provide only limited moisture to the overlying atmosphere, the opposite holds. Both theory and observation suggest the following, albeit approximate, mean annual values of Delta T: for wetlands, 1 degrees C; forests, 1 +/- 1 degrees C; shrublands, 3-4 degrees C; savannas, 3.5 degrees C < Delta T < 5.5 degrees C; grasslands, 1 degrees C where wet to 3 degrees C where arid; and deserts, 4-6 degrees C. As geological tools for inferring past land-surface condi-tions improve, these approximate values of Delta T will allow geologic estimates of past mean annual surface temperatures, T-s, to be translated into estimates of past mean annual air temperatures, T-a.																			1553-040X					2022 FEB 4	2022										10.1130/GES02448.1/5540444/ges02448	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/GES02448.1/5540444/ges02448		FEB 2022											WOS:000752327300001

The distribution of Allium altaicum in the East and South Kazakhstan regions is established. Altai onion in the studied region has wide ecological amplitude, grows in mountain-steppe and highmountain regions of Kazakhstan. In ontogeny, 7 age states are identified; the Altai onion populations in the studied region belong to the generative type. In the phenological aspect, in the highlands, there is a shortened growing season (4 months) and a rapid passage of phenophases; in the mountain-steppe regions, a relatively long growing season (6 months) is noted. The main limiting factors for the decline in the number of the species are the collection of leaves by the local population, grazing and forest fires, as well as the recreational effects of the "Ayuda" and the "Sibinsky lakes". The species needs state protection; we consider it necessary to include Allium altaicum in the next edition of the Red Book of Kazakhstan.																			0556-3321	2070-3368				FEB	2022	54	1					205	213		10.30848/PJB2022-1(11)	http://dx.doi.org/10.30848/PJB2022-1(11)													WOS:000740934800025

The assessment on water quality was based on measuring six parameters i.e., DO, BOD, COD, SS, pH and NH3N at seven designated water sampling stations. All parameters were compared against the National Water Quality Standards (NWQS) and Water Quality Index (WQI) for Malaysia introduced by Department of Environment to identify the status and level of water quality in Tasik Embayu. Sampling was carried out twice a month during March, April and May 2018. The methodology was designed as surveying the sampling of water quality and laboratory testing to get the status of water quality in Tasik Embayu. The results showed that the value of Water Quality Index during the period of sampling at 76.53%. In March, the WQI value was at 74.99%, followed by April (76.91%) and May (77.69%) and the result showed that the water quality of Tasik Embayu was at Class II. Meanwhile, water quality parameters indicated a water pollution at Tasik Embayu with SS parameter (Class III) and COD (Class IV). Other parameters recorded reading below the standard to enable water-based recreation activities in Tasik Embayu. The source of water pollutants for Tasik Embayu were due to pollutants from domestic and restaurant wastes which directly flow into the lake. While the clearing activities in the oil palm plantations close to the lake and land opening for residential housing caused the significant increase in SS especially during rainy season. While the results of water quality in Tasik Embayu showed moderately polluted, the water-based recreation activities such as kayaking, fishing and recreation can still be performed.

Due to this aspect, the characteristics of the living environment act as an effective tool for detecting and reducing stress conditions. The present study was undertaken to investigate the density, numerical abundance and frequency of the benthic macro invertebrates in four different sampling points of the Bega River in the area of Timisoara and its surroundings, in order to indirectly evaluate the overall water quality condition and trends in the aquatic environment. A total of 20 water samples from each location were seasonally collected, processed and screened for the presence of benthic communities using the specific determination keys. Overall, ten groups of invertebrates including Oligochaeta subclass, Diptera order (larvae of the family Chironomidae, Ceratopogonidae and Tipulidae), Lamelibranchiata, Hirudinea, Nematoda and Gastropoda classes; and Trichoptera, Isopoda, Coleoptera and Odonata orders were identified, with differences in the monitored parameters according to sampling points and seasons. The recorded values of the monitored parameters demonstrated different effects in urban towards rural environment, and the resulted consequences can be represented by undesired noticeable changes on the natural environment. The self-purification phenomenon of the Bega River is developing, with quite good results observable at the level of the monitored two sampling points located downstream from Timisoara. However, the overall water quality condition, is still not superior, fact proved by the absence of the most sensitive invertebrate groups.					; Morariu, Florica/GZB-2218-2022; Morariu, Sorin/GLR-2466-2022; Horablaga, Adina/ABB-5458-2020; Pet, Ioan/GZG-7912-2022; Imre, Kálmán/A-8155-2012	Pet, Ioan/0000-0003-2157-5009; 													1582-9596	1843-3707				FEB	2022	21	2					309	317																WOS:000779958800014

Hunter-Gatherer Settlement Patterns in the South-Central Mojave Desert: Perspectives from Emerson Lake, San Bernardino County, California	CALIFORNIA ARCHAEOLOGY												This article briefly explores the archaeological signatures of Early through Late Holocene resource use and hunter-gatherer settlement patterns near Emerson Lake aboard the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center. Investigations of 156 localities along a linear belt of probable plant biomass modeled through Normalized Difference Vegetation Index assessments registered larger, richer, and more diverse assemblages containing significantly higher frequencies of resource-processing artifacts, such as flake took and ground stone, nearer this belt than predicted by random distribution, suggesting that hunter-gatherer encampments, reflecting the utilization of recurring abundant seasonal biotic patches, targeted this belt. However, other than upticks in processing artifact numbers and proximity to the belt during the 1,000 years prior to European contact, archaeological assemblage profiles remain comparatively constant, implying little deviation in the way local hunter-gatherers utilized and settled around this landscape throughout the Holocene.

To refine the LWR coefficients for the Baikal omul Coregonus migratorius (Georgi, 1775). Material and Methods. The data set (number of fish, standard length (SL), weight (W), sex and morpho-ecological group (MEG) for the study of the LWR coefficients were taken from the Baikal Omul database. The analysis includes data from 3,091 specimens of Baikal omul, collected in May to June 2003, 2006 and 2007 and in September 2004 in the area adjacent to the delta of the Selenga River. The construction of regression models of LWR was carried out for all data without taking into account gender and MEG. In addition, regression models of LWR data were obtained, grouped by gender and belonging to a certain MEG. Results. Dependencies with close values of the coefficients of the power function are obtained. There were no significant differences between fish of different sexes and MEG, the coefficients differing at the level of statistical error. It is shown that the LWR in fish during feeding periods of different years is quite stable. Conclusion. We offer the equation W=10.9(L-dm)(3.02) that has acceptable coefficients for C. migratorius resource estimations during feeding period without carrying out controlled fishing.

Existing gaps in the availability of absolute information and data on the inland water resources hinder the applicability and implementation of various fisheries development programmes, which in turn impact inland fisheries production. The present study was carried out in the reservoirs viz., Sri Ram Sagar, Kaddam and Swarna from the Godavari Basin, covering the period 2016-2021, as a case study to demonstrate the use of remote sensed data in fisheries stock enhancement planning. The perennial and seasonal water spread area of the reservoirs under study, estimated through composite water maps prepared using Sentinel 2A data ranged between 8 to 19 and 4 to 29%, respectively. Further, the potential area for enclosure fish culture (both cage and pen culture) in these reservoirs were found to range between 14.89% (Sir Ram Sagar) to 48.54% (Kaddam). The field validated results revealed less than 0.1% of the perennial water spread area mapped in these reservoirs is under use for cage culture. This highlights under-utilisation of these reservoirs and demonstrates scope for developing enclosure fish culture or other culture-based fisheries for enhancing the fish production. The study also demonstrates the use of geospatial tools in development planning for expanding enclosure fish culture in the reservoirs and in turn enhancing fisheries production from the reservoirs in India.					; Ganesan, Kantharajan/AAS-2769-2021	Bhargavi, Kanchi/0000-0002-1534-2383; G, Kantharajan/0000-0001-7512-3994													0970-6011						2022	69	4					14	27		10.21077/ijf.2022.69.4.123322-02	http://dx.doi.org/10.21077/ijf.2022.69.4.123322-02													WOS:000992562100002

STOICHIOMETRY AND PLANKTONIC COMMUNITIES STRUCTURE IN LITTORAL AND PELAGIC ZONES OF TWO LAKES WITH DIFFERENT TROPHIC TYPES IN BELARUS	DOKLADY NATSIONALNOI AKADEMII NAUK BELARUSI												Stoichiometric C : N : P ratios were compared between primary producers in littoral and pelagic ecosystems of mesotrophic relatively shallow lake Obsterno and shallow macrophyte covered low trophic lake Nobisto from May to October over the next two years. Elemental seston ratios of lake Obsterno revealed smaller differences between littoral and pelagic zones in comparison with lake Nobisto in 2017. During the studied period, in the both lakes, the seston C : N and C : P ratios were higher than the Redfield ratio (106 : 16 : 1 C : N : P) on most dates and N : P was always more than 16. Pelagic C : P and N : P ratios in lake Obsterno were the highest in May in 2017, July and September in 2018 with significant differences between littoral and pelagic zones. N : P ratios decreased in October but there were no significant differences among habitats. In lake Nobisto in 2018, seston C : P and N : P ratios increased from May to July in littoral and pelagic zones but then decreased in September to October. Our research shows differences in stoichiometric ratios in littoral and pelagic zones of these two lakes, which indicates food quality (seston C : N : P ratios) differences for zooplankton species depending on season and location.					; Frost, Paul/AAT-6633-2021; Razlutsky, Vladimir/G-1544-2017; Сысова, Елена/HME-1043-2023	Maisak, Natallia/0000-0001-8872-1141; Frost, Paul C./0000-0002-8267-1726; Vladimir, Razlutskij, Razlutskii, Razlutski, Razlutskiy, Razlutsky/0000-0001-8612-6955; Myagkova, Kseniya/0009-0009-4746-8472; 													1561-8323	2524-2431					2022	66	6					595	604		10.29235/1561-8323-2022-66-6-595-604	http://dx.doi.org/10.29235/1561-8323-2022-66-6-595-604													WOS:000953161000004

Relationship between structure and chemical composition of fast sea and lake ice in the Cape Marre-Sale area, Western Yamal	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												The texture, structure, ionic and trace element composition of samples of fast (coastal-sea) and lake ice collected in 2014 in the area of Cape Marre-Sale (the North-Western Siberia) were analyzed. The following main types of the ice structure were identified in ice sections: firn ice with randomly oriented small crystals; lake large- and small-crystalline bubble ice; layered fast sea ice with small isometric and vertically elongated crystals. The upper part of the lake ice is formed by recrystallized snow containing marine aerosols and lake water. The coefficient of involvement of the main ions from the solution during the ice formation varies for lake ice from 0.02 to 1.51, for sea ice - from 0.10 to 0.23, and for coastal-marine - from 0.03 to 0.04. The difference in the degree of ion involvement into the lake ice is related to the sources of components entering the process of formation of firn and large ice crystals from lake water. Coastal sea ice has high concentrations of trace elements relative to the darks of sea waters. The income of trace elements into the coastal sea ice is probably determined by continental runoff. It is established that the mineralization of seasonal ice increases with a decrease in the size of crystals. The dependence of the values of the Europium anomaly on the rate of ice formation was revealed. The Europium anomaly in coastal sea ice is inherited from seawater, and the upper part of lake ice is inherited from precipitation.

It is highly appreciated by the Amazonian riverine communities as a source of animal protein. In this study, we analyzed the dietary preferences and abiotic parameters that influence the condition factor of A. surinamensis that inhabit Cujubim Lake during periods of drought and flood. A total of 105 specimens were captured using three batteries of monofilament nylon nets (measuring 20 m long, 2.5 m high, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mm mesh, measured between opposite knots). The nets were arranged in pre-established positions within the lake and inspected at the times of 18:00, 00:00, 06:00 and 12:00 h. This methodology was utilized to obtain the largest range of fish sizes and to avoid the influence of the nictimeral factor. The results of the analysis of the stomach contents of the individuals confirmed that the species is planktivorous and consumes mainly cladocera and bivalves in the Cujubim Lake, which indicates that there is good food availability in the lake. Our results also demonstrate that, among the physicochemical parameters of the water in Cujubim Lake, pH was the one that most affected the condition factor of A. surinamensis.

According to paleohydrological reconstructions, synchronous fluvial activity of the three rivers occurred during the Late Pleistocene. In the Holocene, the right branches of the Syr Darya delta were separated from the Chu-Sarysu confluence by alluvial sediments, be-coming active only intermittently during undated flood events apparently strong enough to establish an ephemeral lake in the region. Geoarchaeological surveys analyzing surface finds indicate the densest occupation during the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age. From medieval to modern times, historical sources attest to the seasonal use of the Telikol region as a pastoral transit between the Syr Darya banks and the steppes of Central Kazakhstan. They are confirmed by ethnographic data about Telikol during its last phase of occupation (1870-1910) illustrating that land use in this area (and, probably, in all semi-desert regions in Kazakhstan) was not governed by property rights but by tribal political compromises between residential and transitory herders, occasionally exposing it to overgrazing.

To understand the reproductive and population dynamics of this species, in 2019 and 2020, experimental fisheries were carried out during periods of flood and low water in the Cujubim Lake in Porto Velho (Rondonia, Brazil). This study aimed to analyze the seasonal pat-tern (flood and low water) for the reproductive period and the population dynamics of the Surinam anchovy in this region, which resulted in the collection of 870 individuals. The specimens showed mean lengths (Ls) of 6.85 +/- 0.51 cm to 9.01 +/- 2.56 cm and mean weight (Wt) of 5.8 +/- 3.37 g to 6.6 +/- 2.72 g between low and flood water periods, respectively. The growth parameters for this species (Wt = 0.0226*Ls2,6635; Natural mortality, M = 1.66 year-1; Growth rate, k = 0.70 year-1; Asymptotic length, L infinity = 16.53 cm; Theoretical maximum weight, W infinity = 42.83 g) and the quantity of individuals in mature stages during periods of flood and low water were also evaluated. The mean values of Gonado-somatic index -GSI (5.41 and 4.96 between females and males) and animal welfare index, Kn (1.009 and 1.010 between low and flood water periods) did not show significant differences. All the popula-tion growth information presented, added to the values of physicochemical parameters of the water (which were suitable for tropical fish) indicates that the Surinam anchovy population is governed by hydrological seasonality and is well adapted to the floodplain lake where it colonizes and reproduces.

Modernized versions of the Ekman-Burgey bottom grab with additional sensor and computing equipment for automating the capture and evaluation of sample quality	MARINE INTELLECTUAL TECHNOLOGIES												The paper discusses the problems of sampling in hydrobiological studies, as well as the existing mechanical means used for this purpose. The ease of operation and reliability of previously developed bottom grabs satisfy specialists, but the low probability of capturing a sample from the first time leads to the need to completely lift the bottom grab from the depth and re-dump. This factor significantly affects the speed of work, especially when mapping water areas with great depths. The description of two variants of modernized Ekman-Burgey bottom grabs is given. The first option has an electronic-mechanical drive system that simulates the arrival of the bottom grab message, as well as a video camera with illumination for visual control of the bottom grab placement on the ground and its characteristics. This option significantly increases the cost of upgrading the bottom grab, and requires additional professional skills from the user. A budget version of a grab without a video camera is described, but with additional sensor and computing equipment, which automatically makes a decision to capture a sample and significantly saves time for specialists by reducing the likelihood of lifting a slammed grab with insufficient volume of bottom soil. Both variants of bottom grabs were successfully operated during two seasons during expeditions on Lake Ladoga.																			2073-7173						2022		4	3				92	99		10.37220/MIT.2022.58.4.068	http://dx.doi.org/10.37220/MIT.2022.58.4.068													WOS:000895955600012

A high temporal coherence in the dynamics of abiotic parameters and biological communities among neighboring lakes evidences a strong extrinsic control operating similarly across lakes, and allows for prediction of ecosystems evolution in the context of global change and intensive land use. The Pampa region (Argentina) encompasses many shallow lakes submitted to different degrees of anthropic influence and showing contrasting alternative states. We studied an eutrophic clear and a hypertrophic turbid shallow lake during an annual cycle in order to evaluate whether they responded similarly to extrinsic factors or these were overridden by the effects of the steady state of each lake. Physical and chemical variables were highly coherent between both lakes, but accounted little for the large disparities among abundances and dynamics of microorganisms. While communities from the clear lake responded to a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors, the turbid lake showed a state less prone to be affected by climatic effects. We hypothesize that clear lakes would perform better as sentinels of climate change in the Pampa wetland.					; Torremorell, Ana/AAS-3083-2021	Perez, Gonzalo Luis/0000-0001-8325-7677; Escaray, Roberto Ulises/0000-0001-5012-6638; Torremorell, Ana/0000-0003-3903-6863; Zagarese, Horacio/0000-0001-6588-5960; Llames, Maria Eugenia/0000-0001-6984-8016; Mataloni, Gabriela/0000-0002-6852-6143													0001-3765	1678-2690					2022	94	1							e20191545	10.1590/0001-3765202220191545	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0001-3765202220191545								35018997					WOS:000748405400001

Sampling was conducted throughout the entire year of the experiment (January through December). A total of 2285 specimens, ranging from 12 to 58 cm in length (TL) and 24.7 to 2620 g in weight, were caught during the study period. The sample consisted of 1291 females and 994 males with total length weight (W) rela-tionship estimated at W = 0.0156 x TL2.93. The monthly percentage of specimen having a termi-nal translucent zone indicated that circuli formed once a year, during the cold season (January). The back calculation method demonstrated the validity of using scales in the estimation of this species' age and growth. The parameters of Von Bertalanffy growth, based on the analysis of scales for 570 specimens, were estimated for each sex separately: Lm = 62.20 cm, K = 0.151 a-1, t0 =-0.966 for females, as Lm = 57.98 cm, K = 0.165 a-1, t0 =-0.873 for males and as Lm = 60.05 cm, K = 0.157 a-1, t0 =-0.92 for combined sexes. Ten age groups were identified within the common carp population in the studied reservoir.

This article is providing a long-term information and fills the research gap of multiyear data on zooplankton, as the previous research on zooplankton provided only snapshots of the community, and a consistent assessment over multiple years was missing. However, an initial mini-review of historical studies indicated that zooplankton biomass and fish abundance were undergoing large fluctuations, indicating the importance of top-down control. We analysed 239 samples from the period 2016-2019 from 32 sampling sites in Lake Sevan and recorded 37 species of meso- and macrozooplankton (Rotifers, Copepods, Cladocera). Biomass fluctuations were high with peaking biomasses in 2016 and lowest biomasses in 2018, yearly averaged biomass varied about one order of magnitude. Variability over time was hence much higher than spatial variability. The pelagic habitat at the deepest part of the lake showed the highest diversity and biomasses but contrasts between sampling sites remained smaller than changes from year to year or seasonally. Many samples were dominated by a single species, and these key species explain observed biomass dynamics to a wide extent. We applied hierarchical clustering in order to identify phenological groups that appear to show similar patterns of occurrence. This clustering resulted in 6 groups whereof 5 groups just consisting of one single species and these 5 key species were the Cladocerans Daphnia magna, Daphnia hyalina, Diaphanosoma sp. as well as the calanoids Arctodiaptomus bacillifer and Acanthodiaptomus denticornis. The most important species in Lake Sevan's zooplankton during the observation period was D. magna, which reached high biomasses in 2016 and 2017 but then suddenly almost disappeared in 2018 and 2019. When there were more D. magna present, the water became clearer, which was measured using Secchi depth. This shows that these large water fleas effectively controlled the amount of phytoplankton in the water. Daphnia magna, in turn, managed to dominate zooplankton community only during times of extremely low fish biomass indicating strong top-down control of this large Cladoceran by fish. Both observations together imply a strong trophic linkage between fish, zooplankton, and phytoplankton and provide evidence for trophic cascades in Lake Sevan. Besides the novel insights into zooplankton community dynamics of this unique lake of high socio-economical, cultural, and ecological importance, our study also points to potential management opportunities for eutrophication control by biomanipulation, as well as our investigation allows us to conclude that probably biotic factors were more important than abiotic factors in explaining the observed changes and dynamics within the plankton community.

J	Kuznetsova, MR; Priakhina, GV				Kuznetsova, M. R.; Priakhina, G., V			Methods of snowmelt calculation in the Antarctic oasis Larsemann Hills	VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES												This paper studies the validity of snowmelt calculation methods, which are mostly used in hydrology, for the Larsemann Hills oasis (East Antarctica). The study bases on snow surveys data obtained on catchments of Law Lake, Reid Lake and Stepped Lake during the 65th season of the Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE) in 2019-2020. Materials of the fond of Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) are also used: snow surveys data collected on the catchment of Stepped Lake during the 57th RAE season in 2012 and on catchments of Law Lake, Reid Lake, Scandrett Lake and Stepped Lake during the 62th RAE season in 2017. Considered three methods of snowmelt calculation were derived by P. P. Kuz'min, E. G. Popov, Yu. B. Vinogradov Results of calculation are compared with snowmelt value obtained according to snow surveys. The paper shows two variants of calculations: in the first albedo of snow is determined from function of snow age as different values for each day, in the second albedo is determined from remote sensing data as average value for all period. Results of snowmelt calculation depend on the method which sets value of snow albedo: relative inaccuracies of results obtained of all discussed methods are smaller when albedo is determined as average value. The equation by Kuz'min gives the smallest inaccuracies of snowmelt calculation results in relative to real snowmelt values estimated from snow survey data. This snowmelt calculation method in the majority of cases reviewed gives satisfactory results and should be recommended for estimation of snowmelt values for this Antarctic territory.																			2541-9668	2587-585X					2022	67	3					515	528		10.21638/spbu07.2022.307	http://dx.doi.org/10.21638/spbu07.2022.307													WOS:000925840800007

Fishes in the running and stagnant waters in this region are of vital importance as a food resource for local residents. This study aimed to describe the fish community, catch, and biomass in the three headwater streams Bambou, Lebomo, and Bongo in the Lake Tumba Landscape (LTL) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Such information is of vital impor-tance as a benchmark to understand the sustainability of the fish population for future generations of residents of the LTL. The field data were collected from 2007 through 2011, including dry and wet seasons. Here we present the results of this systematic, multi-annual study which was the first for fishes in streams of this region. In total, 50 species of 15 families were found in the nutrient-poor brown waters of these streams where high concentrations of humic acids cause a low pH. Among abundant species occurring in all three streams were the cyprinid Enteromius holotaenia (Boulenger, 1904), the mormyrid Marcusenius moorii (Gunther, 1867), the alestids Clupeocharax schoutedeni Pellegrin, 1926 and Bryconaethiops boulengeri Pellegrin, 1900, and the clariid Clarias angolensis Steindachner, 1866. Bon-go Stream was distinguished from the others by a rich abundance of Alestopetersius compressus (Poll et Gosse, 1963). The presence of several species at low pH (between 5.0 and 5.5) is new information that lowers the bottom of the pH interval for these species compared to earlier reports. The maximum total length (TL) of some other species was by 5-20 percentage points higher than those reported earlier. The median weight per unit effort (WPUE) in the streams varied between 30 and 115 g per hour during the dry seasons and between 18 and 86 g per hour during the wet seasons. The fish biomass in the streams varied between 0.05 and 0.7 g & BULL; m-2 with a median 0.14 g & BULL; m-2. This relatively low value compared to other tropical headwaters may be a result of the low pH and dark color of these headwaters. The results of the study serve as a reference point to which future monitoring of fish fauna can be compared for sustainable management of the LTL.

The aim of the study was to determine the oxidative potential in the muscles of selected fish species found in lakes with different trophy status. Values of redox indexes (MDA, Vit. C, SOD and CAT) in the muscle tissue of two native (roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis)) and one invasive fish species -brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) were determined. The differences in redox indexes in muscle tissue of fish from lakes with different trophy status were noted. This indicates differentiated sensitivity of individual fish species to oxidative stress resulting from changes in water quality parameters. The changes in the redox parameters in the tissues of selected fish species were more influenced by the lake trophy than the effect resulting from interspecies differences. Fish from a hypertrophic lake had poorer meat quality due to the greater intensity of oxidation processes in relation to fish from the eutrophic lake. The present study gives the need for further studies that will take into account more fish species and a longer period of time, including changes resulting from the functioning of these reservoirs in different seasons.

For this, we used experimental fisheries, with ichthyofauna samplings carried out in the years 2019 and 2020, which resulted in 2,508 specimens. For quantifying the ecological data, we analyzed Shannon-Weaver diversity, species richness, Simpson dominance and Pielou evenness. The predominant fish orders were Characiformes and Siluriformes, and the species Anchovia aff. surinamensis was the most abundant (N=809/35.49%). Diversity indicators were similar across all sectors (S1=the lower margin - end, S2=center and S3=mouth of the lake). Only the levels of richness and abundance were lower in the S3 sector, despite the importance of this habitat as a link to the Madeira River, which indicates transient diversity, followed by active selection of the S1 and S2 sectors in the lake by most fish. Limnological data, such as those of temperature (30.30 +/- 1.20 degrees C), conductivity (35.82 +/- 5.98 mu S cm-1), dissolved oxygen (7.38 +/- 3.56 mg L-1) and pH (6.70 +/- 0.54), were within the acceptable levels for tropical fish. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis showed the ordering of parameters by sector and species with greater affinity for each environmental attribute, in which dissolved oxygen (NMDS1=-0.720; r2=0.862 and p=0.043) and electrical conductivity stood out. Thus, it can be concluded that the behavior of the fish diversity of Cujubim Lake is affected both seasonally and longitudinally.

J	Talukdar, A				Talukdar, Anusmita			HYDRONYMY OF CENTRAL AND LOWER ASSAM WITH SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON NATURAL HYDRONYMYS: LAKE-BEEL (NATURAL PONDS)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARLY CHILDHOOD SPECIAL EDUCATION												A beel is a term for a pond (wetland) with static water in the Ganges-Brahmaputra flood plains of the Eastern Indian states of West Bengal, and Assam and in the country of Bangladesh (once a part of Pragjyotisa-Kamrupa). The term owes its origins to the word of the same pronunciation meaning 'pond' in the Bengali and Assamese languages. There are different causes for the formation of beels. A string of beels is indicative of their being the remains of a great river that deserted its channel, moving to a new one elsewhere. Typically, beels are formed by abandoned river meandering course, inundation of low lying lands during flooding, where some water gets trapped even after flood waters recede back from the flood plains. Beels may also be caused by filling up of low-lying areas during rains, especially during the monsoon season. In ancient Assam there are large water bodies called haors. A haor is a bowl or saucer shaped shallow depression, also known as a backswamp. Throughout the rainy season a haor is such a vast stretch of turbulent water that it is thought of as a sea, within which the villages appear as islands. It remains under water for seven months of the year. During the dry season water drains out leaving small shallow lakes exposing rich soil extensively cultivated for rice. In the central part todays Bangladesh, important beels are Katla, Chatal, Nagarkanda, and Chanda In greater Comilla, Faridpur, Dhaka and Pabna districts the beel is sometimes referred to as baor. Ancient Assam comprising present Bangladesh has thousands of beels, with the most common names being Chalan Beel, Gopalganj-Khulna Beel, Meda Beel, Aila beel, Dekhar beel, Kuri beel, Erali beel and Arial Beel. Most of the large beels have shrunk a great deal in recent decades. Regionwise, in the northwest of Bangladesh some of the larger beels are Bara Beel in Pirganj, Tagrai Beel in Kurigram, Lunipukur in Rangpur, Bara Mirzapur Beel in Narail and Keshpathar in Bogra. The old river course of Atrai has beels. In the southern region of Bangladesh, important beels are Boyra, Dakatia, Bara, Kola, Patla, Chatal and Srirampur. In Assam, Derelict and semi-derelict wetlands constituting a part of the Brahmaputra floodplain, the beets are a vitally important fishery resource of Assam. There are about 1392 beets in present Assam, the maximum number being in Nagaon district (289), followed by Cachar (263), North Lakhimpur (153), and Jorhat (131). Together the beets constitute over 80% of Assam's lentic waters. In beels that maintain connection with the river, locally migratory fishes are of considerable significance. The Indian major carps, particularly catla and rohu, depict such forms with Labeo gonius also contributing significantly. Gravid fishes of these species enter the beel every year during the monsoon months for spawning. The fishery of Dhir beel is dominated by Gudusia chapra and other miscellaneous species including minor carps followed by major carps, cat fishes, live fishes, and common carp. Dominant zooplankton in Dhir beel include Protozoans followed by Copepods, Rotifers and Cladocerans. Due to high decomposition of organic matter at the bottom, beels, in general, are rich in benthos.																			1308-5581						2022	14	2					2274	2278		10.9756/INT-JECSE/V14I2.203	http://dx.doi.org/10.9756/INT-JECSE/V14I2.203													WOS:000806030700011

This study investigates thermally driven convection resulting from heat loss at the air-water interface during cooling periods in freshwater environments. In the littoral zone, where the water depth increases from the shoreline to interior waters (pelagic zone), uniform heat loss at the surface generates differential cooling between shallow and deep regions. If the latter process occurs for a long enough time, the density-induced cross-shore pressure gradient may drive an overturning circulation across littoral waters, known as "thermal siphon". This paper examines the conditions under which a thermal siphon develops in natural water bodies and its associated convective regimes. For the above setting, we derive time and velocity scales associated with the transition from Rayleigh-Benard type convection to horizontal overturning circulation across sloping basin regions. The above transition in the convective regime is characterised by a three-way horizontal momentum balance between the cross-shore pressure gradient and inertia before reaching a quasi-steady regime. Our theoretical scaling expressions are supported by high-fidelity numerical simulations and field- scale experiments, and they provide a robust conceptual framework to characterise convective flows induced by night-time or seasonal surface cooling in nearshore aquatic systems, such as lakes, reservoirs, and coastal seas.

Lake Kasumigaura is a large lake in Japan with an average depth of only 4m, and it is highly eutrophic. Although declining dissolved oxygen (DO) in the bottom of the lake during the weak wind period has been reported by field observations in previous studies. However, the nature of the hypoxia generation and recovery process is unclear. An integrated approach, which combines data acquisition and numerical modeling, was followed to reveal this process. The analysis was conducted with the three-dimensional coastal ocean hydrodynamic model coupled with an ecological numerical model, SCHISM-ICM. Water quality data monitored at four automatic observation stations were used in the analyses, which indicates a time-scale correlation between temperature stratification and hypoxia water masses at the shallow lake. Under the condition of weak wind (about 2 m/s), the lake water frequently shows continuous diurnal stratification. During this period, DO in the lake has obvious diurnal variation but generally decreases. Furthermore, in a few days of sustained diurnal stratification, the bottom layer may enter a state of hypoxia. The simulation results demonstrated that the model could have a good performance for modeling the diurnal temperature stratification and the trend of observed DO. Simulation results indicated that the diurnal temperature stratification under the weak wind forcing reduced the vertical mixing of water masses. It leads to continuous depletion of DO in the bottom layer, inducing the occurrence of hypoxia.

One of such tools could be devised by monitoring the taxonomic structure of reservoirs' microbiomes. Microbial taxa's ecological and metabolic characteristics suggest their essential roles in maintaining the water ecosystem's environmental equilibrium. The study aimed to explain the role of diversity and seasonal variability of the microbial communities in the ecosystem stability on the example of Goczalkowice Reservoir (Poland). The structure of the reservoir microbiome was studied using bioinformatics and modeling techniques. Water was sampled periodically in July & November 2010, and April 2011 at four representative sites. The abundance and relative fraction of the limnetic taxonomic units were determined in respect to the physicochemical indices. Significant seasonal variations in the number of operational taxonomic units (OTU) were observed within the reservoir basin's main body but not at the main tributary's mouth. The highest values of the correlation coefficients between OTU and physicochemical variables were obtained for Burkholderiales, Pseudoanabenales, Rickettsiales, Roseiflexales, Methylophilales, Actinomycetales, and Cryptophyta. These microorganisms are proposed as indicators of environmental conditions and water quality. Metataxonomic analyses of the freshwater microbiome in the reservoir, showed that microorganisms constitute conservative communities that undergo seasonal and local changes regarding the relative participation of the identified taxa. Therefore, we propose that monitoring those variations could provide a reliable measure of the state of aquatic ecosystems.					; Kwasniewski, Miroslaw/B-5160-2012; Babczyńska, Agnieszka/ABC-9525-2020; Krzyzowski, Micha/LCD-9857-2024; Chwialkowska, Karolina/HPN-3637-2023; Absalon, Damian/A-1139-2011	Krzyzowski, Michal/0000-0003-4154-1981; Woznica, Andrzej/0000-0003-3051-1816; Absalon, Damian/0000-0001-7504-4962; Chwialkowska, Karolina/0000-0001-8053-8959													2083-4772	2083-4810					2022	48	1					18	30		10.24425/aep.2022.140542	http://dx.doi.org/10.24425/aep.2022.140542													WOS:000767489600002

The high water cut of the exposed rock strata and the presence of groundwater require the constant pumping of wastewater into the filtration fields, and then to the nearby river. This work shows a significant contribution of discharge processes and drainage waters to the trace metal contents in the surface waters of the Zolotitsa river; an increase in the concentrations of Mg, Sr, Zn, Cu, Cd, As , and Se was noted. The seasonal variations of physicochemical parameters, the trace metal contents, as well as the total uranium and U isotope U-234, U-238, and U-235 were analysed. Calculations of water quality indices (HMEI, HMPI, and HMTL) and public health risks (HI and CR) revealed a high level of pollution of certain sections of watercourses. Radiological studies of polluted rivers in the area showed a satisfactory situation. The results of this study can provide a basis for the subsequent monitoring of the impact of anthropogenic activities on nearby watercourses in the development of diamond deposits.

However, the interference of complex background and surface reed make it difficult to accurately extract the water body of Wuliangsuhai Lake. This paper proposes a novel method (FCN-OPT) of water body extraction based on Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN). The FCN-OPT method first uses FCN to extract and fuse the deep-level features of the image to achieve pixel-level segmentation. It then uses the OpenCV computer vision library to remove the wrongly extracted part and holes of the FCN segmentation result to improve the accuracy of water extraction. Thereby the FCN-OPT method achieves accurate and complete Wuliangsuhai Lake water body extraction. Also, it can extract the bright water area and reed area of Wuliangsuhai Lake simultaneously and eliminate the interference of complex background, significantly reducing the misdivision and leakage of the water body. The experimental results show that, in comparison with Multi-band Spectral Relationship Method and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) method, the maximum Pixel Accuracy (PA) of FCN-OPT is improved by 21.44% and 20.58% respectively, the maximum Mean Pixel Accuracy (MPA) enhanced by 35.03% and 34.56% respectively, the Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) increased by 17.51% and 28.19% respectively. Moreover, the proposed method FCN-POT achieves good performance when extracting the complete water body of Wuliangsuhai Lake from the remote sensing images of different seasons.

Status and movement of adfluvial brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis at Isle Royale, Michigan, Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Adfluvial brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis populations in the Lake Superior basin have suffered declines over the last century due to habitat degradation and exploitation. Natural resources agencies throughout the basin have restored habitat and implemented restrictive angling regulations as tools to protect remnant coaster brook trout populations, but the success of these practices is unknown in some locations. We used electrofishing and passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag movement data from 2008 to 2020 to describe population characteristics, temporal trends, and adfluvial life history of coaster brook trout in Washington Harbor, Isle Royale National Park, Lake Superior after implementation of catch-and-release regulations in 2004. Our results document the presence of an adfluvial coaster brook trout population in Washington Harbor, Isle Royale. Temporal trends indicate that brook trout abundance and distribution in Washington Harbor increased since earlier observations in the late 1990s and early 2000s likely due to enactment of protective regulations, and increased stream flows and water levels observed in recent years in both Washington Creek and Lake Superior, respectively. Annual tag detection of Washington Harbor brook trout in Washington Creek at the antenna arrays varied from 25% in 2009 to 100% in 2011 and 2013, and averaged 60.7% throughout the study. Peak in adfluvial brook trout use of Washington Creek was from August - October with few detections occurring outside of the presumed spawning period. This study provides valuable insight into the population characteristics, movement patterns, and temporal increase in abundance of an adfluvial brook trout population in Lake Superior.

J	Liu, HQ; Li, HZ; Ren, HK; Hu, JX				Liu, Haiqiu; Li, Hangzhou; Ren, Hengkui; Hu, Jinxiu			A method to extract cyanobacteria blooms from satellite imagery with no requirements for any prior atmospheric correction or cloud-masking	OPTICS EXPRESS												Lake Chaohu has been suffering from harmful cyanobacteria blooms, while the clouds pixels in satellite images are usually mistaken as cyanobacteria blooms by some traditional indicators, leading to the need for cloud masking in advance. In addition, atmospheric correction is another challenge due to lack of a general atmospheric correction method and the difficulties in evaluating its accuracy without in situ investigations. Fortunately, tasseled cap transformation (TCT) allows to extract vegetation properties directly from satellite imagery digital numbers (DN), which provides a perspective for extracting cyanobacteria blooms independent from atmospheric correction. This study focuses on how to use TCT to establish an indicator, which allows to extract cyanobacteria blooms directly from image DN values without conducting any atmospheric correction or cloud-masking. Training and test sets containing over 200,000 pixels are constructed from 18 Sentinel-2A/B MSI images acquired in different seasons in recent three years. Four components are derived from TCT and they could form up to 81 linear combinations. Experimental results performed on the training set show that the candidate, which combines the last three components with the coefficients of 1,-1 and 0, assigns cyanobacteria blooms pixels in a completely separated value range from water, cloud, cloud shadow and cloud edge pixels. The candidate is defined as ICW3C index. Its threshold value range of (175 330) is given and the pixels with ICW3C values greater than its threshold could be classified as cyanobacteria blooms. Comparisons between ICW3C and the floating algae index (FAI) on the test set show that ICW3C misclassifies 0.02% of cloud pixels and 1.55% of yellow cloud edge pixels as cyanobacteria blooms, however, 19.18% clouds, 13.74% yellow cloud edges and 19.34% blue-green cloud edges are incorrectly identified as cyanobacteria blooms by FAI. Comparisons between ICW3C and FAI performed on image regions over time show that, in clear-sky regions with cyanobacteria blooms, FAI extracts 5.81% more pixels, which mainly lay in the edge of cyanobacteria blooms. In cloud-covered image regions without cyanobacteria blooms, FAI misclassifies over 608 times as many cloud and cloud edge pixels as ICW3C. Sensitivity test results suggest that the change of ICW3C threshold within its value range (175 330) will not lead to serious increase in misclassification, and ICW3C performs stable to variations of viewing geometry. Extension tests indicate that ICW3C is applicable for several other sensors. Further researches are still needed to test whether ICW3C is suitable for other inland lakes or seas.

Mara, Goksu River, Antalya, in the Anatolian Region of Turkey. Only a species of the genus Rhabdo-chona was found in intestines and identified as R. fortunatowi Dinnik, 1933. Totally, 104 specimens of R. fortunatowi infected 19 out of 99 individuals of C. caelestis (prevalence 19.1 %, mean intensity 5.4). In C. angorae, 40 specimens of R. fortunatowi infected 15 out of 178 fish individuals (prevalence 8.4 %, mean abundance 2.6). Prevalence and intensity of R. fortunatowi infection were calculated across the seasons as well as in age groups and sexes of hosts. The present study provides the first record of R. fortunatowi in Turkey and the first host records of this parasite in both C. caelestis and C. angorae, thus expanding the known geographical and host range of this nematode species.

J	Bregnballe, T; Frederiksen, M				Bregnballe, Thomas; Frederiksen, Morten			Conspecific density as a driver of offspring body condition in three Cormorant colonies in Denmark	ARDEA												Density-dependent depletion of prey during the breeding season may affect breeding performance and colony development in seabirds and colonial waterbirds. Breeding Great Cormorants Phatacrocorax carbo sinensis are central place foragers, so parental flight distances to profitable foraging grounds and thus parental provisioning of offspring are likely affected by local food availability. Chick body condition in a given colony may therefore be influenced by the distance to feeding areas, changes in fish stocks and fish distribution as well as the number of Cormorants from neighbouring colonies using the same feeding areas. At three Danish Great Cormorant colonies with overlapping foraging ranges and variable access to shallow marine areas, Vorso (VO), Mageoeme (MA) and Stavns Fjord (SF), we investigated variation in mean chick body condition (n = 9697) in relation to colony location, year, colony size and estimated density of foraging conspecifics during 1993-2007. Foraging areas available to VO colony parents had the highest theoretical densities of conspecifics and the VO chicks were invariably in poorer condition than the chicks at the other two colonies. Chick body condition was negatively correlated with estimated foraging density, especially within a foraging range of 20 km. Body condition between all three colonies was weakly correlated over the years, suggesting that changes in macro-environmental conditions (e.g. fish density) only had moderate impacts on food availability, independently of Cormorant numbers. We conclude that both the geographical location of colonies, the size of the colony itself and the nearest neighbouring colonies and the associated variation in density of foraging Cormorants were major drivers of variation in chick body condition between colonies and years.

Since field monitoring of songbirds can be difficult due to complex habitat requirements, behavioral, or logistical issues, our results provide an important methodological alternative for habitat assessment and conservation monitoring of species difficult to study with traditional methods. We found significant differences between pollen rain in water samples and pollen loads in feathers. Pollen loads were comparable between bird species during both rainy and dry seasons. Contrary to previous assumptions, Black-polled Yellowthroats showed pollen loads associated with terrestrial habitats, particularly during the dry season. Our results on equitability resource-use, showed marked differences between seasons, being more homogeneous in the dry season than in the rainy season. In addition, equitability values of pollen loads were similar between sexes in Common Yellowthroat but significantly higher in males as compared to females' Black-polled Yellowthroats, suggesting some degree of resource partitioning. GLM's identified a significantly negative relationship between anemophilous and entomophilous pollination syndromes in both species and the pollen rain recorded during dry and rainy seasons, as well as a significant effect of season sampling on pollen load, but no effect of species, sex, or any interaction with season upon pollen loads. We concluded that pollen analysis was a useful tool for the study of use of habitat in birds.

Dryland soil salinity and seasonal effects on leaf and xylem sap ecophysiological characteristics of native plant species	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The objective of this 3-year study was to investigate the relationships between soil salinity and ecophysiological responses of C-3 and C-4 native plant species around Lake Altham and Lake Coyrecup (both are salt lakes in Western Australia), and to evaluate their potential for use in the remediation of salt-affected soils. Three shrubs (Atriplex vesicaria, Tecticornia lepidosperma and T. indica) that grew in highly saline soil of average Na concentration greater than 300 mM had higher leaf delta C-13 and delta N-15 ratios. These species also had higher Na-to-K and Na-to-Ca ratios in both their leaves and stem xylem sap, indicating that these species accumulate high amounts of sodium in their tissues. In contrast, tree species Eucalyptus loxophleba, Casuarina obesa and Acacia acuminata grew in soil of average Na concentration of less than 100 mM and had lower values of delta N-15, delta C-13, Na content, and Na-to-K ratio in their leaves. These species also had lower xylem Na-to-K and Na-to-Ca ratios. Seasonal effects were observed in leaf total N content, leaf Na, xylem sap Na-to-K ratio and xylem sap Na-to-Ca ratio. Strong and significant positive correlations (r > 0.75; P < 0.01) were observed between soil Na concentration and ecophysiological responses, such as leaf Na contents, leaf delta N-15, xylem sap Na, xylem Na-to-K ratio and xylem Na-to-Ca ratio. Overall, Atr. vesicaria, T. lepidosperma, T. indica and Santalum acuminatum are good candidates for remediation of highly saline soils.					; Mapfumo, Emmanuel/T-7942-2019	Mapfumo, Emmanuel/0000-0002-8008-8721; 													0067-1924	1444-9862				2021 NOV 26	2021										10.1071/BT21022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT21022		NOV 2021											WOS:000723119900001

Moreover, studies of fish consumption rarely focus on the perceptions and awareness of consumers. Considering this, the present study examines the factors determining the willingness to follow fish consumption advice as well as calculate the risk-benefit ratio and produce the vulnerability map followed by formulating fish consumption advice for consumers of two commercially important fish species, tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and mudfish (Ophiocephalus striatus), in the Laguna de Bay area of the Philippines. Primary data on consumers' perceptions were collected through a questionnaire, whereas heavy metal contamination data were compiled from the best available literature. We concluded that people's willingness to adopt consumption advice is mostly dependent on their existing level of fish consumption (P = 0.000). There was no discernible difference in the mean concentration of heavy metals in fish between the dry and wet seasons, with the exception of As concentrations in the samples (t15.75 = 3.72, p < 0.001). The hazard quotient (risk-benefit ratio) for fish consumption (HQefa) was an order of magnitude higher in the mudfish samples (0.05 and 28.28) compared to tilapia (0.04 to 16.02). Binangonan and Taguig from the Northern West Bay (1A, 1B) were clearly recognised on the vulnerability map as the most vulnerable regions in the lake. In general, it was determined that As and Pb were the elements causing consumption restrictions on tilapia collected from various parts of Laguna Lake. As with tilapia, locations with a high-risk advisory for mudfish were identified as the Northern West Bay and Central Bay, with a consumption limit of five meals per month due to excessive mercury pollution. This empirical study can serve as an option for the future development of fish consumption advice in the region.

A vegetation classification and description of white-winged flufftail (Sarothrura ayresi) habitat at selected high-altitude peatlands in South Africa	ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE												The white-winged flufftail is listed as critically endangered, and limited knowledge about the species' ecology has been identified as a limiting factor to effectively conserving the bird. Little is known about the vegetation inhabited by the white-winged flufftail, which hampers the identification and management of its habitat. This study presents a fine-scale classification and description of the vegetation of wetland sites where the bird is known to be present. A plant phytosociological study was conducted to describe the plant communities and vegetation structure of the habitat. Three sites were selected at Verloren Valei Nature Reserve and two at Middelpunt Wetland, Mpumalanga, South Africa, shortly after the white-winged flufftail breeding season. A total of 60 sample plots were placed within the study sites, where all plant species present were recorded and identified. Other aspects such as plant height, water depth and anthropogenic influences were also documented. A modified TWINSPAN analysis resulted in the identification of three sub-communities that can be grouped into one major community. The Cyperaceae, Asteraceae and Poaceae families dominate the vegetation, with the sedges Carex austro-africana and Cyperus denudatus being dominant, and the grasses Leersia hexandra and Arundinella nepalensis co-dominant. The broad habitat structure consisted of medium to tall herbaceous plants (0.5-0.7 m) with shallow slow-flowing water.

J	Luo, Y; Zhang, HB; Zhu, SL				Luo, You; Zhang, Hongbin; Zhu, Senlin			Depositional styles and adjustment of channel cross-sections in a seasonal deltaic system: a large-scale physical experiment	ACTA GEOPHYSICA												Small scale experiments provide limited mechanistic insight on the evolution of the cross-sections of the channel in a deltaic system. Here, we report the results of a large-scale tank experiment on the deltaic processes in a new river course into the Qinglan Lake. The depositional body occurred from upstream to downstream in the new river course in the depositional processes. Three depositional styles have been observed in the delta building: levee, stable-bar, and wandering-bar. Single-thread and braided channels have been formed with deposits of levee style and stable-bar style. Wandering-bar style, which is an autogenic process, refers to the switching in the location of the main silting zones at different spatial-temporal scales and is frequently accompanied by avulsion, river braiding, and mainstream migration. The elevation of levees and bars increased to the bankfull elevation in the blocked river reach in the first 30 similar to 40 years and impacted the main channel flow. Comparing to the blocked river reach, the evolution of the bankfull elevation and geomorphic coefficient B-0.5/H (B is width, H is water depth) of the cross-sections in the new reach indicates that the evolution pathways of the cross-sections could be divided into two stages: convergent stage and autogenic feedback stage. The convergent stage refers to a positive feedback loop, while the autogenic feedback stage is dominated by autogenic process. The present study shows the diversity of landforms, complex feedbacks and internal thresholds of a seasonal deltaic system, and the results provide another view on hydraulic geometry.

Since spatial distributions of biological and environmental elements are always susceptible to water diversion, the monitoring specifications in water-receiving regions are always different from conventional ecological monitoring, especially in monitoring parameter selection and site distribution. To construct the method for selecting sensitive monitoring parameters and optimizing sites distribution in lakes, the large river-to-lake water diversion project, Water Diversion from Yangtze River to Lake Taihu in China, was taken as an example. The physicochemical properties and phytoplankton communities in the water-receiving Gonghu Bay and the referenced lake center were investigated and compared between the water diversion and nondiversion days in different seasons from 2013 to 2014. The comparative and collinearity analyses for selecting sensitive physicochemical parameters to water diversion, and the multidimensional scaling analysis based on the matrices of biological and sensitive physicochemical data, were integrated to optimize the monitoring in the waterreceiving lake regions. Seven physicochemical parameters, including water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, and active silicate, were demonstrated to be sensitive to seasonal water diversion activities and selected for optimizing the site distribution and daily water quality monitoring. The nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis results based on the data matrices of sensitive physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton communities were consistent for sites distribution optimization. For cost-effective monitoring, the sites distribution scheme could choose the optimizing results based on the Euclidean distance from 3.0 to 4.0 and the Bray-Curtis similarity from 40 to 60%. This scheme divided the Gonghu Bay into three water regions: the inflow river inlet, bay center, and bay mouth adjacent to the open water region. In each of the three regions, one representative site could be selected. If focusing on more details of each region, the standards with the Euclidean distance lower than 2.0 and the Bray-Curtis similarity higher than 60% should be considered. This optimization method provided an available way to fulfill the cost-effective long-term monitoring of urban drinking water sources influenced by water diversion projects.

Wind, temperature and relative humidity time series data were obtained from a weather station installed on the island, sea level atmospheric pressure data were obtained from North American Regional Reanalysis data from which, the seasonal pattern and diurnal breezes can be observed. CTD (Conductivity, Temperature, Depth device) surveys were conducted to analyze the hydrography, and a spectral analysis of temperature time series derived from a chain of thermistors anchored inside the volcanic lake was performed. The results show that the maximum temperature is found not in the first layers of water but at a depth of 1.8 m at 37.9 degrees C; while from 4 m of depth to the bottom, the temperature remains constant at 27 degrees C. The lower density water from rain flows into the lake, covering the surface layer of the lake and maintaining this temperature profile. The thermal changes in the first three meters of depth are due to the atmospheric influence and diurnal solar radiation and some strong wind events. To confirm this information, a calculation of heat fluxes through the lake surface was performed. Changes at greater depths are a consequence of the variations in the seasonal effects on the water column.

Here, changes in depositional environment over the past ca. 53,000 years were reconstructed using a range of physical, sedimentological, geochemical, and mu-XRF elemental proxy datasets analyzed from lake sediment cores obtained from Lake Kanono, Northland, New Zealand. The Lake Kanono stratigraphy displays a terrestrial peat environment (ca. 53,700-6,670 cal yr BP), followed by a trend of increased influx of detrital sediment during the Late Glacial-Interglacial Transition (LGIT) at ca. 14,000 cal yr BP with a peak from ca. 12,000 to 9,000 cal yr BP driven by increasingly dry conditions. The increase in sediment influx continued during the early to mid-Holocene, leading to dune reactivation which altered the catchment dynamics of the region, leading to the inception of a shallow lake basin at ca. 6,670 cal yr BP. The timing of the formation of this lake basin can be associated with changes in intensity of the Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) and the appearance and increase in intensity of the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) after ca. 7,500-7,000 cal yr BP (Moy et al. 2002; Moreno et al. 2018). Drier conditions peaked from ca. 4,000 to 2,400 cal yr BP, possibly culminating in decreased lake levels that persisted from ca. 2,400 to 2,210 cal yr BP, renewed dune accumulation, and blocked stream outlets, resulting in a deep lake basin with thermal stratification that persisted to the present. Cluster analysis of the l-XRF data demonstrates that the most prominent change in chemistry is near the onset of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at ca. 26,700 cal yr BP associated with a transition to a drier, windier climate. The second most prominent change in the mu-XRF data is during the Polynesian phase of human settlement at ca. 612-575 cal yr BP (1338-1375 CE). Hence, we can demonstrate the utility and power of a multi-proxy approach coupled with l-XRF element data to interpret changing sediment sources to a lake basin. Such an approach allows rapid and reliable evaluation of catchment processes influenced by climate events and land-use changes at a resolution not available using other approaches.					; Shane, Phil/HKV-7633-2023; Augustinus, Paul/B-5125-2011	Shane, Philip/0000-0002-7824-1184; Gadd, Patricia/0000-0001-6725-1603; 													1527-1404	1938-3681				OCT	2021	91	10					1094	1111		10.2110/jsr.2020.021	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2020.021													WOS:000718014500002

The aim of this study is to collect new information on the diversity and abundance of microorganisms present in a hypertrophic body of water and their seasonal changes. The samplings were carried out seasonally in the period from January to October 2014. From the sediment analysis of the Don Tomas lagoon, 21 diatom taxa were identified, of which three correspond to the order Centrales and 18 to the order Pennales; four genera of ostracods and two morphotypes of chrysophyte cysts (ornamented and smooth) were also recorded. The data obtained from the study of current samples will allow us to interpret with a greater degree of certainty the Holocene deposits from lake environments of temperate climates.																			1519-7530	2236-1715				OCT-DEC	2021	24	4					380	391		10.4072/rbp.2021.4.08	http://dx.doi.org/10.4072/rbp.2021.4.08													WOS:000761107100002

With the bio-optical data collected during 2009-2011 from Taihu Lake, Chaohu Lake, Poyang Lake, Pearl River Estuary, and Daya Bay, this work analyzed the remote sensing response bands for variations of TSS concentrations and constructed a remote sensing-based quantitative estimation model for TSS concentrations in coastal and inland waters. The visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) satellite remote sensing data were employed to obtain the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the TSS concentrations. The results show that the model of the band ratio [R-rs (865)/k(d) (555)] contributed by different components of water can explain 81% of the TSS concentration changes. In the model, the R-rs(865) is the remote sensing reflectance at 865 nm and the k(d)(555) is the attenuation coefficient of the waters at 555 nm. Compared with other empirical models that have been reported, this model has significantly improved estimation accuracy. The verification results show that the model can be applied to coastal and inland waters. When applied to pre-processed VIIRS satellite remote sensing data, it can reveal the spatial and seasonal variations of TSS concentrations of in waters from Taihu Lake and the Pearl River Estuary.					su, wen/J-4152-2018; ma, rong/GVU-3096-2022														0253-2239					OCT	2021	41	19							1901003	10.3788/AOS202141.1901003	http://dx.doi.org/10.3788/AOS202141.1901003													WOS:000838270000003

The objectives of the study were to assess fishing activities and the impact of fishing on the Nile tilapia fish species in Lake Hayq. A total of 198 fishermen selected randomly from Kebeles bordering Lake Hayq were used as respondents for structured questionnaires. In addition to this, 30 fish traders and 8 fish hotel owners specialized in fish dish were used as key informants. The average age of fishermen was around 36 which were in active force age group (< 65 years). Most (97%) of the fishermen used gillnets imported from Egypt with mesh size of 4-6 cm stretched mesh size < 8 cm which is the national standard. There are three commercially important fish species, common carp (Cyprinus carpio), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and Catfish (Clarias gariepinus). Fishery of Lake Hayq is being used as source of livelihoods for about 2000 people living around the lake. Tehulederie, the largest district bordering the lake has established three months (May-July) as breeding seasons, however, the fishermen didn't respect the regulation set by the district. As the result, the fishery production was being reduced highly since 2010. Especially, the most important fish species (Nile tilapia) has been overfished due to the illegal fishing activities. Therefore, fishery management tools such as mesh size regulation, closing season and ground and fishery regulatory systems enacted by the federal and regional governments should be implemented through application of community-based fishery management system.																			0030-9923					OCT	2021	53	5					1755	1765		10.17582/journal.pjz/20200227150220	http://dx.doi.org/10.17582/journal.pjz/20200227150220													WOS:000689463600018

Samples were collected from 36 sections of the SHR during the high, low, and flat seasons of the river, and the main sources of nitrogen in the water were qualitatively analyzed with isotope data for nitrogen and oxygen of nitrate. The contribution rates of each major pollution source were quantitatively analyzed using the Iso Source mass balance model. The results from these experiments indicate that the values for delta N-15-NO3 and delta O-18-NO3 in the flat flow season range from 1.52 parts per thousand to 14.55 parts per thousand and -14.26 parts per thousand to 2.03 parts per thousand, respectively. The values for delta N-15-NO3 and delta O-18-NO3 in the low flow season range from 6.66 parts per thousand to 15.46 parts per thousand and -5.82 parts per thousand to 65.70 parts per thousand, respectively. In the low flow season, nitrogen comes from the input of domestic and manure sewage (53%) and soil organic N (45%). The values of delta N-15-NO3 and delta O-18-NO3 in the high flow season range from 2.07 parts per thousand to 14.24 parts per thousand and -3.99 parts per thousand to 8.03 parts per thousand, respectively. In the high flow season, nitrogen comes from soil organic nitrogen (41%), domestic and manure sewage (32%), and nitrogen fertilizer (27%), which are the main sources of nitrogen pollution in the SHR. The conclusions from the qualitative and quantitative analysis of nitrogen sources in the SHR can provide a scientific basis for the source control and treatment of nitrogen pollution.

In the Gulf of Mexico, the Alvarado Lagoon System (ALS) stands out for its dimensions and fisheries. Rotifers are among the most abundant groups of zooplankton in these ecosystems. Information on its composition, diversity, and seasonal variation is scarce, despite its structural and functional importance. Objective. We determined the diversity, seasonal variation, and the influence of pH, transparency, salinity, and temperature in the rotifer community structure in the ALS. Method. We collected zooplankton samples and physicochemical parameters from September 2017 to May 2018 in four zones of the ALS along the salinity gradient. Zooplankton was separated into groups, and rotifers identified species level. Shannon-Weiner diversity index and effective diversity Hill numbers Q1 and Q2 were calculated by analyzing differences among seasons and zones. A cluster analysis was performed to determine the similarity in the biological composition between zones and seasons. Canonical correspondence analysis was performed with transformed data of physicochemical parameters and rotifer abundances. Results. Oligohaline behavior in the rainy season to mesohaline in the dry season and the influence of the rivers in all the ALS was observed. 24 rotifer species and four cladocerans were identified, all correspond to new records, being Brachionidae the most abundant. The highest diversity occurs during the rainy season in the south zone while the lowest in the dry season. Salinity and turbidity were related to the distribution of the Brachionidae species. Conclusions. Hydrological behavior and salinity variation gradient agree with records for ALS.																			0188-8897					SEP-DEC	2021	31	3					209	219																WOS:000806406300004

A new assemblage of Cenozoic lungfishes (Dipnoi: Lepidosirenidae) from the late Oligocene Nsungwe Formation, Rukwa Rift Basin, southwestern Tanzania	GEOBIOS					PalEurAfrica International Symposium on Evolution and Paleoenvironment of Early Modern Vertebrates during the Paleogene	SEP 10-13, 2019	Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci, Brussels, BELGIUM		Royal Belgian Inst Nat Sci			Lungfish (Dipnoi) date back to the Devonian, and some fossil taxa as well as extant African lungfishes are known for their ability to aestivate, tolerating low-oxygen environments associated with seasonal drying. Extant lungfishes are separated into two families: Lepidosirenidae (Protopterus in Africa and Lepidosiren in South America) and Neoceratodontidae (Neocerotadus in Australia). African lungfishes were more geographically and phylogenetically diverse on the continent in the past than they are today, with only 5% of extinct taxa recorded from the sub-Saharan fossil record. Given the sparse record of Lepidosirenidae fossils from continental Africa, any new materials are important for understanding diversification of the clade. Here we describe new lungfish fossils cautiously referable to Protopterus annectens and Protopterus aethiopicus, which are strongly supported sister taxa based on the molecular phylogeny. Specimens were collected from the late Oligocene Nsungwe Formation in the Rukwa Rift Basin (RRB) of southwestern Tanzania. The late Oligocene Nsungwe Formation represents a sequence of continental rift-fill deposits of the Songwe sub-basin of the RRB and is subdivided into the lower Utengule and upper Songwe members. Recovery of such material from the Paleogene of Africa below the equator addresses a sizable gap in the lungfish fossil record. It also expands the Nsungwe Formation fauna that includes invertebrates, alestid fishes, ptychadenid anurans, snakes, and several clades of mammals, deepening paleoecological insights into the late Oligocene record of the continental African interior. At present, P. aethiopicus and P. dolloi have an extensive modern eastern African distribution associated with the rift lakes and a region where extant members of P. annectens are not presently known. Fossil specimens described herein document presence of the clade during Paleogene volcanic activity in the western branch of the Eastern African Rift System.

Chemical Effects of Snowmelt on an Alpine Lake in the Wind River Range, WY	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Nitrogen deposition from air pollution is increasingly reaching alpine lakes where the addition of nitrate and ammonium to sensitive surface waters can cause acidification and/or eutrophication. Thirty years of sampling in the Wind River Range, WY, has shown some lakes increasing in nitrogen. We sought to (1) determine if nutrient concentrations in Deep Lake increase during snowmelt when atmospheric deposition is released from the snowpack and (2) assess if the sampling season, location, meteorological factors, and time of day samples are collected influence lake chemistry metrics, to inform monitoring. We analyzed water samples from the outlet of Deep Lake in peak snowmelt (June) and from the inlet, outlet, and middle of Deep Lake when the basin was snow free (August). In June, outlet samples were more acidic, and nitrogen content was three times August levels. Acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) declined with snowmelt. August inlet samples were higher in nutrients than outlet and mid-lake samples. Our results indicate that atmospheric pollution in the snowpack enters the lake with snowmelt. Although Deep Lake has not acidified, ANC levels indicate a risk of episodic acidification if nitrogen deposition continues to increase. When monitoring lakes at risk for episodic acidification, sampling during the late snowmelt pulse should be prioritized. Simplified sampling protocols may be used in some lakes, as epilimnion and outlet samples were nearly identical. The time of day and cloud cover did not affect lake chemistry, while wind speed and precipitation weakly increased August ANC and June pH, respectively.

Methane gas was measured monthly with a static closed chamber technique and later analyzed by a gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID). Results showed that methane fluxes varied widely in the range of 1.9-22.7 mg m(-2) day(-1) with the median +/- SD of 10.1 +/- 5.4 mg m(-2) day(-1) . Seasonally, the methane fluxes during wet season ranged from 5.2 to 22.7 mg m(-2) day(-1) with the median +/- SD of 14.1 +/- 5.0 mg m(-2) day(-1) while the methane fluxes during dry season were between 1.9 and 21.9 mg m(-2) day(-1) with the median +/- SD of 8.8 +/- 5.2 mg m(-2) day(-1). The estimate methane fluxes of the wetland in wet and dry seasons were 1.5-3.1 kg m(-2) and 0.7-2.9 kg m(-2) , respectively. The estimated methane emission factor from the natural wetland in the province was 1.7 to 5.7 kg m(-2) year(-1) compared to the default methane emission factor from IPCC, 0.0136 kg m -2 year -1 . When considering global warming potential (GWP) of methane based on 100-year time horizon, the natural wetlands in the province may emit about 15.48 to 52.16 million ton CO2 equivalent a year based on the emission factor derived locally. With the IPCC default emission factor, the methane emission was as low as 0.03 to 0.22 million ton CO2 equivalent a year.																			1513-718X					SEP	2021	21	3					339	346																WOS:000694709300007
J	Shin, DM; Han, JH				Shin, Dong-Man; Han, Jeong-Ho			Identification of Little Tern (Sternula albifrons) Prey in Inland Andong Lake, Korea using Video Image Analysis	WATERBIRDS												Little Tern (Sternula albifrons) prey composition was studied on a sandy islet in inland Andong Lake, Republic of Korea, during the breeding season (April to July 2018). Two remote-control video cameras with 4K-resolution were set on the islet to identify prey and determine whether prey species composition or size differed among breeding stages. On still images in which terns had prey in their bills (n = 1,275), prey species were identified, classified to five length-categories, and compared among breeding stages. Freshwater fishes dominated the observed diet (100%; 11 species overall), where the landlocked pond smelt (Hypomesus nipponensis; 80.8%) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides; 13.7%) were main prey species. The mean prey length was 51.0 +/- 20.89 mm, where 50.1-75.0 mm prey was the most frequent in the diet (42.2%) and varied significantly among breeding stages; 50.1-75.0 mm prey were most frequent during courtship and incubation stages, whereas 1.0-25.0 mm prey were most frequent at the chick-rearing stage. Surface water temperatures exceeded the upper thermal tolerance of the primary prey species at a date coincidental with tern departure from the colony.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				SEP	2021	44	3					269	276		10.1675/063.044.0301	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.044.0301													WOS:000782290400001

The facultative lagoon system of that small community treats domestic wastewater and seasonally discharges effluent into a wetland that connects to Lake Manitoba. This research assesses phosphorus removal efficiency through the natural wetland during the vegetation growing season. The average total phosphorus (TP) concentration reduction for the observed treatment area of 1.3 ha was more than 70%, achieving the desired TP discharge concentration below 1 mg/L. Data analysis showed that the main accumulation of TP occurred at the 21-40 cm soil depth, which indicates the potential of natural wetland treatment applications under cold continental climate conditions as an effluent polishing step to satisfy regulatory requirements for phosphorus reduction.

J	Gajewski, K				Gajewski, Konrad			Multiple drivers of ecological change in Arctic lakes and ponds	PLOS ONE												Griffiths et al. (2017) analyzed several ponds and lakes from the Cape Herschel region of Ellesmere Island in order to " horizontal ellipsis explicitly examine the role of ice cover as the dominant driver of diatom assemblage change horizontal ellipsis ". I reanalyze their data and suggest that their classification scheme, that they propose is due to differences in ice cover seasonality ("warm", "cool", "cold", and "oasis"), is confounded with other morphological and chemical variables that better explain the differences between the groups. The "cold" sites are the deepest (lakes) and differ from the small, shallow ponds that occasionally dry, which would therefore have different diatom assemblages and histories. The "oasis" sites are nutrient enriched and probably have more stable water supplies, thereby enabling an aquatic flora providing habitats for diatoms. A key part of their interpretation is that "warm" sites have responded more rapidly to recent climate change than "cold" or "cool" sites, but their chronologies do not allow for such a conclusion. There is no clear difference between "cool" and "warm" sites, and problems in dating the sequences means inferences about their histories are not supported by data. Their results, which are restricted to the past century, are contradicted by a Holocene sequence from the region.																			1932-6203					JUL 30	2021	16	7							e0254257	10.1371/journal.pone.0254257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254257								34330143					WOS:000685248600070

Long-range prediction models are tools that offer the potential for integration and joint analysis with the hydrological, hydrodynamic, and management response of the socio-ecological systems to which they are linked. The main objective of this article is to present a seasonal climate prediction model, the open-source algorithm SIE-Climate, whose application consists of three phases (exploration, development, and evaluation), and to describe its application to the Lake Sochagota socio-ecological system (Paipa, Boyaca, Colombia). The K-nearest neighbours method is used when defining a target matrix that represents and integrates macro- and micro-climatic phenomena (Oceanic Nino Index, local temperature, and local rainfall) to identify periods of similar climatic behaviour. Considering a 1-year horizon and management purposes the tool is calibrated and validated in periods with and without climatic anomalies (2000-2018), giving reliable adjustment results (RSME:4.86; R-2: 0.95; PBIAS: -8.89%; EFF: 0.85). SIE-Climate can be adapted to various contexts, variables of interest, and temporal and spatial scales, with an appropriate technological and computational cost for regional water management.

Waterbirds are significant components of this diversity. Among them, the Eurasian Coot Fulica atra is a key species when studying the correlations and interactions between waterbirds and environmental variables, because of its abundance, ease of detection, and relation with some basic aspects of the functioning of wetlands. The present study aimed to analyse the annual and seasonal variation in populations of Eurasian Coot in 31 wetlands in Andalusia, southern Spain, from 2003 to 2008, paying particular attention to correlations with biotic and abiotic variables. The results showed a positive correlation between water depth and coot abundance, while a negative relationship was observed with salinity and no correlation was observed between wetland size and coot abundance. These environmental variables, together with submerged macrophyte coverage, stand out as playing important roles in the use of habitat by coots in Andalusian wetlands.

J	Mao, XG; Liu, XM; Zhou, X				Mao, Xuegang; Liu, Xiuming; Zhou, Xia			Permo-Triassic aeolian red clay of southwestern England and its palaeoenvironmental implications	AEOLIAN RESEARCH												Late Permian and Triassic red mudstones are widely distributed and exposed in southwestern England. This homogenous, massive mudstone succession has been extensively studied for its palaeoenvironmental potential. However, its origin and palaeoenvironment remain under debate. The Triassic Mercia mudstone was early proposed to be aeolian loessic clay based on collapse nature when wetted or loaded and its similarities with aeolian clay in Quaternary Australia, but lacks experimental confirmation and is not generally accepted. In comparison with aeolian red clay in China, here we confirmed that the Triassic Mercia mudstone, together with the Upper Permian Aylesbeare mudstone, was dominated by aeolian clay. This was based on lines of evidence regarding sedimentary structure, particle grain size, geochemistry, micromorphology, and pedogenic features. The results showed that the Mercia mudstone and the Aylesbeare mudstone had sedimentary structures and grain size distributions that were similar to the aeolian red clay in the Chinese Loess Plateau. The major chemical elements correlated well with the aeolian red clay, with the exception of minor discrepancies in CaO and K2O. The similarity in the rare earth element (REE) distribution of the Mercia mudstone and the Aylesbeare mustone with aeolian red clay inferred their similar origin. Widespread pedogenic features indicated the universal development of palaeovertisols forming in alternating wet/dry climates.

This study investigated the link between feed parameters and the membrane performance of a pilot-scale microfiltration (MF) plant for 7 months. The seasonal succession of algae in relation to temperature dynamics was monitored. Temperature-dependent seasonal patterns for algae species were observed. The water temperatures during the dominance of cyanobacteria, especially Microcystis, were relatively higher (over 25 degrees C) than those during the dominance of diatoms. Diatoms did not much affect membrane performance (less than 0.2 kgf/cm(2)), however, under the cyanobacterial dominance condition, especially Microcystis sp., transmembrane pressure (TMP) reached up to the limited level (0.4 kgf/cm(2)) within one month. Concurrently UV absorbance at 254 nm wavelength and dissolved organic carbon values increased significantly during the Microcystis bloom and the build-up rate of TMP increased up to 0.005 kgf/cm(2)/day. Membrane autopsy also showed that during the dominance of diatom, application of cleaning agents can fully remove foulants on the membrane surface. However, during the dominance of cyanobacteria, there is a lot of Al, Si and organic complex on the fouled membrane, indicating the formation of Al-organic complexes that contributed to the residual membrane fouling. It is suggested that the irrecoverable fouling layer still contained some Al, mostly in complex with organics. Thus, organic matter originated from cyanobacteria may cause a serious impact on membrane fouling by forming the complex with metal ions originated from coagulant.					최동훈, (일반대학원 전기전자공학과)/HSJ-8044-2023; Lee, Jungchul/P-7319-2018														1093-4529	1532-4117				JUL 3	2021	56	8					912	919		10.1080/10934529.2021.1941557	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2021.1941557		JUN 2021						34279191					WOS:000674797600001

Repeated large-scale mechanical treatment of invasive Typha under increasing water levels promotes floating mat formation and wetland methane emissions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Invasive species management typically aims to promote diversity and wildlife habitat, but little is known about how management techniques affect wetland carbon (C) dynamics. Since wetland C uptake is largely influenced by water levels and highly productive plants, the interplay of hydrologic extremes and invasive species is fundamental to understanding and managing these ecosystems. During a period of rapid water level rise in the Laurentian Great Lakes, we tested how mechanical treatment of invasive plant Typha x glauca shifts plant-mediated wetland C metrics. From 2015 to 2017, we implemented large-scale treatment plots (0.36-ha) of harvest (i.e., cut above water surface, removed biomass twice a season), crush (i.e., ran over biomass once mid-season with a tracked vehicle), and Typha-dominated controls. Treated Typha regrew with approximately half as much biomass as unmanipulated controls each year, and Typha production in control stands increased from 500 to 1500 g-drymass m(-2) yr(-1) with rising water levels (similar to 10 to 75 cm) across five years. Harvested stands had total in-situ methane (CH4) flux rates twice as high as in controls, and this increase was likely via transport through cut stems because crushing did not change total CH4 flux. In 2018, one year after final treatment implementation, crushed stands had greater surface water diffusive CH4 flux rates than controls (measured using dissolved gas in water), likely due to anaerobic decomposition of flattened biomass. Legacy effects of treatments were evident in 2019; floating Typha mats were present only in harvested and crushed stands, with higher frequency in deeper water and a positive correlation with surface water diffusive CH4 flux. Our study demonstrates that two mechanical treatments have differential effects on Typha structure and consequent wetland CH4 emissions, suggesting that C-based responses and multi-year monitoring in variable water conditions are necessary to accurately assess how management impacts ecological function.

It remains unclear how these events quantitatively impact dissolved organic carbon (DOC), a pool approximately equal to CO2 in the atmosphere. This study conducted a weekly-to-biweekly sampling in a deep subtropical reservoir in the typhoon-prevailing season (June to September) from 2004 to 2009, at which 33 typhoons with distinctive precipitation (<1 similar to 362 mm d(-1)) had passed the study site. Our analyses indicated that the phosphate (i.e., DIP; <10 similar to 181 nMP) varied positively with the intensity of the accumulated rainfall 2-weeks prior; bacteria growth rate (0.05 similar to 3.68 d(-1)) behaved as a positive function of DIP, and DOC concentrations (54 similar to 119 mu MC) changed negatively with bacterial production (1.2 similar to 26.1 mgC m(-3) d(-1)). These implied that the elevated DIP-loading in the hyperpycnal flow induced by typhoons could fuel bacteria growth and cause a significant decline of DOC concentrations. As the typhoon's intensity increases, many mineral-limited lentic freshwater ecosystems might become more like a CO2 source injecting more CO2 back to the atmosphere, creating a positive feedback loop that might generate severer extreme weather events.

To ensure a high nutrient removal efficiency, it is often suggested to use macrophytes to retain or remove nutrients via uptake and through the denitrifying biofilm. In Europe, Phragmites australis and Typha spp are the most commonly used aquatic plants in constructed wetlands (CWs) with free surface flow, and these species often form monocultures in the wetlands. In order to achieve a more diverse vegetation, there is a need to introduce more plant species. Creating a mass production of plant material reduces both handling time and the risk of depleting and disturbing vegetation in natural habitats such as streams or lakes. However, a successful and continuous production of such material during growing seasons requires knowledge of the selected species' establishment and propagation. We examined the relative growth rate (RGR) of six emergent macrophyte species collected from streams and small lakes located in Mid Jutland (Denmark), in seasonal experiments from March to October in order to determine the most efficient time period for their propagation. We found that all species had highest RGR in June, and that several species showed high growth efficiency from April to August. The results showed that it is possible to have a full production of emergent macrophytes throughout the growing season, and therefore, we suggest to propagate plants for use in constructed wetlands in order to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

This paper describes a new 1-dimensional (1D) numerical model code and its application to investigations of multi-scale linkages between the vertical temperature structure and meteorological forcing. UCLAKE is implemented as highly portable open-source software, based on computationally efficient algorithms, and able to resolve sub-daily (e.g., hourly) dynamics while retaining the efficiency to simulate multi-decadal time scales. A UCLAKE model is calibrated and validated against thermistor profile time series for a small upland lake in North Wales, UK. Some of the challenges in 1D model calibration are explored and a sensitivity analysis reveals a dependence of optimal parameter set values on water column depth and time. An exploratory 52-year hindcast simulation demonstrates the computational efficiency of UCLAKE for multi-decadal studies of trends in lake temperature that vary with depth. A supplementary application of UCLAKE to Windermere, in the English Lake District, demonstrates its performance for larger and deeper lakes.

J	Shih, DCF				Shih, David Ching-Fang			Rotary Spectral Analysis for Directional Time Series: Seasonal Variation of Wind Speed on a Subtropical Island near the Western Pacific Ocean	PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS												Directional or vector time-dependent observations, such as the flow at a river branch, streamflow, lake flow, ocean currents, or wind data, are commonly observed in the environment. Traditionally, a rose diagram can be used to summarize the possible main orientation using all the data in the time domain. However, it cannot indicate the significant variation in the specific frequency bands that may show dominant periodic fluctuations. Assessment of directional time series often requires the identification of significant components in the specific frequency bands for not only the magnitude but also the orientation. The rotary pattern, main orientation, and magnitude of directional time series in the frequency domain for five sets of seasonal wind velocity observed at the northern, southern, eastern, and western coast of the subtropical island Taiwan and Taiwan Strait have been demonstrated. It shows that the representative pattern is clockwise, counterclockwise, or near rectilinear, and semidiurnal and diurnal components are significant in the frequency domain for most stations. The most important research innovation suggests that the use of rotary spectral analysis in the frequency domain to effectively assess the orientation and magnitude of directional time series, such as hydrological, coastal, or environmental observations, has become feasible.

Ontogenetic habitat shifts and vulnerability: lake-outlet-spawning sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) sensitivity to habitat connectivity and hydrologic change	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Sockeye salmon that spawn downstream of rearing lakes are an important example of the challenges faced by organisms with complex life histories requiring connectivity in aquatic habitat complexes. Specifically, newly emerged juvenile sockeye salmon must migrate upstream, against the flow of water, if they are to reach lake rearing habitat. Here, we examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of the water velocity landscape and juvenile sockeye salmon movement and condition at increasing distances downstream from the lake outlet of an important sockeye salmon system, the Babine Lake of British Columbia, one of Canada's largest and most important sockeye salmon rearing lakes. The results of this study indicate that (i) there were seasonal and spatial patterns of water velocities that exceed the ability of juveniles to swim upstream to lake rearing habitat, (ii) higher water discharge was associated with more velocity barriers and potentially with less upstream movement of juveniles, and (iii) juveniles rearing in the lake obtained larger sizes (30% longer and 150% heavier) than those in downstream river habitats. Multiple processes that may be influencing these patterns could include more abundant food resources, lower metabolic demands, or size-selective immigration, emigration, or mortality among habitats. Years and seasons with high discharge may temporarily create one-way, downstream transport routes at lake outlets. Long-term changes in hydrology, perhaps driven by climate variability or land-use change, may control the degree to which lake outlets function as bidirectional travel corridors or one-way travel routes for young sockeye salmon.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				APR	2021	104	4					383	399		10.1007/s10641-021-01071-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-021-01071-1		APR 2021											WOS:000637644700003

The data collection involved field sampling of water samples in 23 sampling stations spatially distributed in the basin during nine seasons from July/2016 to May/2018. The hydro-chemical data was generated from the Laboratory analysis of the water samples using the ion chromatogram. Samples for nitrate isotope (delta N-15-, delta O-18-NO3-) analysis were prepared via the bacterial denitrification method and analysed using Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer. The data, which is categorised in different land use zones and seasons, is important for understanding the spatiotemporal variation in nitrate and solute concentrations and the role of land use on the river water quality. In addition, the delta N-15-, delta O-18-NO3- and delta B-11 values are key for elucidating nitrate pollution sources and potential biogeochemical processes for the management and control of nutrient pollution and eutrophication of the Lake Victoria. Furthermore, the dataset can be of great use in water quality models for understanding non-point pollution dynamics in tropical basins. This article is related to [1]. (C) 2021 The Authors.

Mean clutch size in 462 Lake Forsyth nests was 5.3 (sd = 1.3) eggs, with clutches of 4, 5, and 6 eggs comprising 17%, 30% and 30% respectively of the total. Goslings hatched from 67.4% of 1,602 eggs in 298 monitored nests, and the entire clutch hatched successfully in 42.6% of the monitored nests. Mean productivity at hatching was 3.6 (sd = 2.3) goslings per nest. Mean clutch size in 1,211 Waimakariri River headwaters nests was 4.5 (sd = 1.3), with clutches of 4, 5, and 6 eggs comprising 25%, 32%, and 20% respectively of the total. Goslings hatched from 63.3% of 3,952 eggs in 871 monitored nests, and the entire clutch hatched successfully in 30.5% of the monitored nests. Mean productivity at hatching was 2.9 (sd = 1.9) goslings per nest. Relative to Canada geese in their native North American range, geese nesting at Lake Forsyth laid clutches of similar size, had similar hatching success but higher nest success whereas geese nesting in the Waimakariri River headwaters laid, on average, conspicuously smaller clutches, had similar hatching success, but higher nest success.																			0029-4470	1177-7680					2021	68	1					13	25																WOS:000629184800002

Therefore, the target and source tasks are i.i.d. samples of the same distribution. Unfortunately, this assumption rarely holds in real-world conditions, e.g., due to seasonality or periodicity, evolution in the environment or faults in the sensors/actuators. In the context of this work, we consider the problem of transferring value functions through a variational method when the distribution that generates the tasks is timevariant, proposing a solution that leverages this temporal structure inherent in the task generating process. Furthermore, by means of a finite-sample analysis, the previously mentioned solution is theoretically compared to its time-invariant version. Finally, the experimental evaluation of the proposed technique is carried out on the lake Como water system representing a real-world scenario and on three different RL environments with three distinct temporal dynamics.					; Castelletti, Andrea/AAG-7111-2020	Restelli, Marcello/0000-0002-6322-1076; 													2640-3498						2021	161						876	886																WOS:001237128000082

Worldwide patterns of the sea surface temperature (SST) can be monitored using spaceborne observations of the 4 mu m wavebands during nighttime since July 2002 by AquaMODIS. Despite the spatial collection, most studies examine the part of the time-series as lineplots. This research proposes to decipher the 18-year-old SST trends, from July 2002 to December 2020, by focusing on the spatiotemporal detections of the SST anomalies, in order to decompose, hindcast and forecast the time-series. An array of >200 Level-3 SST4 global maps was subject to the Reed-Xiaoli Anomaly Detector, then high, moderate and low anomaly areas were decomposed (seasonal effect removal) and modelled using state space smoothing. Southern Newfoundland and Eastern Hokkaido were representatives of ice-free high anomalies, while the Philippine Sea and Northern Canary were identified as moderately and slightly anomalous, respectively. The modelling accuracy was very satisfactory for both western boundary currents, and excellent for less anomalous regions. The global analysis better fitted with the anomalous Southern Newfoundland than the other regions, indicating an overall rapid increase in SST.

This study was carried out from 1 July to 15 September in 2016 in Keban Dam Lake of Turkey. Crayfish fishing is usually done 10 weeks due to marketing problems crayfish in our region (the legal fishing duration being 5 months in July and December). The purpose of this study to determine of distribution and contribution to production of the crayfish captured by fyke-nets of local fishermen from different localities of the Keban Dam Lake. The CPUE (Catch per unit effort) values were 1.98, 1.08, 0.83 individuals/fyke-net/night for fishing season in Agin, Keban, Cemisgezek regions, respectively in 2016. The annual catch of crayfish was estimated as 13.15 tonnes. The length and weight compositions of crayfish captured in the fyke-nets have varied between 100 and 140 mm, and 52 and 90 g, respectively. The mean length and weight were found as 116 mm and 71.33 g for legal-sized individuals, The contribution of the Keban Dam Lake of this total production was 2.55 % in Turkey.

J	Fox, J; Jiménez, AM; Stange, M				Fox, Janay; Jimenez, Maximo A.; Stange, Madlen			Natural history study of an understudied sea catfish species from Panama (Siluriformes: Ariidae)	NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY												The semi-anadromous sea catfish species Cathorops tuyra (Ariidae, Besudo sea catfish) from the Tropical Eastern Pacific has been found reproductively active in the freshwater rivers and lakes of the Panama Canal. Despite growing concerns for biodiversity, reports on natural history are lacking for many Neotropical sea catfishes. We aimed to provide data on the diet and seasonal timing of spawning of C. tuyra for an autochthonous, semi-anadromous, brackish water population from Rio Santa Maria and an allochthonous freshwater non-migrating population from Rio Chagres, an affluent to the Panama Canal, to understand how changing from semi-anadromous to residential lifestyle affects the natural history of a species. Fish from both sampling sites were dissected and information on stomach content, size, weight, parasitic load, sex, maturity, and number of eggs were recorded. In Rio Chagres, there was a female bias and individuals were larger and in pre-spawning mode compared to Rio Santa Maria. Parasite prevalence was low in Rio Chagres and zero in Rio Santa Maria. The diets were very similar between populations: gastropods, bivalves, and insects were the most important prey items in both rivers representing a diverse omnivorous diet that is similar to that of other catfishes.

Patterns and Models of Variability in the Useful Inflow into Lake Baikal	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												An attempt has been made to construct models that approximate the time-range statistical properties of the useful inflow into Lake Baikal and its relationships with potential predictors that permit predictive assessments to be obtained. The problem solution consists of two parts. In the first part, the constructed physical and statistical models record the known patterns of runoff from the catchment. These patterns are subject to significant regression relationships between the predicted value of the monthly inflow and its hydrometeorological predictors. These models can be used to forecast the average useful inflow for the next month. The predictive correction for interannual variability to the seasonal inflow wave in these models is based on variability in the predictor values that are known at the forecasting time. The second part of the research is focused on possible trends and cycles in the interannual variability in useful inflow in the most water-abundant third quarter in order to predict it with a lead time of 1 year or more. Various cycle models with parameters estimated using the training sampling set do not provide a stable solution in the control sampling set. The best result has been obtained by a cyclical model with fixed periods, which records the possible impact on the inflow variability provided by gravitational influence of the Moon and major planets on the Earth and the Sun. Nevertheless, this model also should not be considered statistically significant due to the small proportion of the explainable variance and insufficiency of the data on useful inflow into Baikal.																			1875-3728	1875-371X				JAN	2021	42	1					37	43		10.1134/S187537282101008X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S187537282101008X													WOS:000674431300006

The natural lake fills up during the short rainy season and continuously dries out due to the long dry season without any rainfall and the extensive water abstraction by farmers. The present study classifies 119 dual-co-polarised TerraSAR-X stripmap acquisitions collected with the highest possible temporal sampling of eleven days between 2013 and 2018. Seasonal and annual changes are visualised in order to recognize trends. Evidently, the ongoing sedimentation of Lac Bam causes a deterioration of the effects of droughts and floods pointing out the need for a regulation of water exploitation.																			2197-4403		978-3-8007-5457-1				2021							537	542																WOS:001237879500117

Previously successful in Donana and Camargue Biosphere Reserves, this study examines the transferability of unsupervised inundation mapping through automatic local thresholding in discriminating inundated areas from non-inundated ones in Kerkini Lake. Nine different alternatives of this approach are employed on Sentinel-2 (S2) Level-2A images (2016-2019). The best fit alternative was derived by the validation against local and on-site registered attributes. To overcome unfavourable atmospheric conditions, Sentinel-1 (S1) images were examined in tandem with derived S2 inundation maps (S2m), using the best fit alternative. Two S2m, one preceding and one following a target S1 image, were used to train random forest models (per pixel) to be applied to the target S1 image and derive the respective inundation map (S1m). S1m was validated against a S2m for the same date; not previously used in the training process. Classification performance reached k [0.77-0.94] and overall accuracy [88.05-97.16%] for the S2m. The evaluation of S1m showed k of 0.99 and overall accuracy between 99.71-99.88%. Automation of the process and minimum human interference supports its usage by non-specialists, e.g. for Protected Areas management.					; Manakos, Ioannis/AAD-5404-2019; Kalaitzidis, Chariton/D-6763-2012	Sismanis, Michail/0000-0001-6387-5849; TSOLAKIDIS, IOANNIS/0000-0001-6848-189X; 															978-989-758-503-6				2021							48	55		10.5220/0010555700480055	http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0010555700480055													WOS:000821066300004

The comprehensive analysis of weather conditions (wind direction, relative humidity and temperature of the air as well as atmospheric pressure)was carried out. There were high correlations between meteorological parameters and PAH concentrations in the study area. Average PAH concentrations in the anomalously warm 2020 were three times lower than the average values obtained in the cold 2016.

Field studies were conducted during the peak of the reproductive season from 2017 to 2019. A total of 51 samples (phalangeal bones from 13 males, 35 females and three sub-adults) were collected to determine the demographic structure of the population by skeletochronology. Snout-vent length (SVL) was 72.03 +/- 2.79 mm (min-max: 67-78 mm) in males and 73.12 +/- 4.59 mm (min-max: 63-84 mm) in females, where the difference was not statistically significant. The sexual dimorphism index was 0.01 and it was found to be female-biased. The mean age of females was 5.94 +/- 1.85 years and the mean age of males was 5.77 +/- 1.79 years. The minimum reproductive age was three years in both sexes. The maximum observed age was ten years for females and nine years for males. Our results were compared with literature data, and Triturus anatolicus showed a similar pattern on agestructure with cognate species. We found that the high survival rates of the Torkul Lake population (female = 0.81; male = 0.77) may result from a low human interference and favourable climatic conditions.

The measurements were carried out in the Baikal Atmospheric-Limnological Observatory (BALO SB RAS, which is a part of the Resource Sharing Center "Atmosfera"). A steady increase of the methane content in the atmosphere by about 12 ppb per year is observed. The average diurnal methane content in March 2021 (the last measurement cycle) was 2.012 ppm. For the period of ling-term observations, the measured partial methane pressure in the surface water always exceeded that in the atmosphere. This fact indicates that this part of Lake Baikal is a source of methane into the atmosphere. For the coastal zone, the average value of methane flux from water was 380 mu gCH(4) m(-2) day(-1). The observed increased methane concentration in the near-bottom layer indicates the predominance of bottom methanogenesis. Our data show that the increment rate of dissolved methane in surface water of Lake Baikal is 0.015 mu gCH(4)/l per year.

J	Riju; Singh, HP; Linda, A				Riju; Singh, Harminder Pal; Linda, Anurag			High Altitude Lake and Hydrochemistry: A Study of Lam Dal and Six Consecutive Lakes of Dhauladhar, Himachal Himalaya, India	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE												Increased human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land thereby resulting in widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere (IPCC, 2021). High altitude lakes are generally small and quite sensitive to natural and antluopogenic perturbations. The present work is a preliminary work to investigate different hydro chemical processes and factors that controls the geochemistry of a high altitude lake, Lam Lake (dal) and its consecutive six lakes flowing through the Chamba district, Himachal Pradesh. Two hundred and eighty (n=280) water samples were collected in the year 2017 during the pre-monsoon and postmonsoon season. The anion concentration for all the seven lakes followed the trend HCO3-> NO3- > Cl- > SO42- > PO43- whereas the order of cation concentrations was Ca2+> Mg2+> Na+> K+ for both the seasons. Less EC of the water samples shows its serene nature. Components of bicarbonate (HCO3-) were found to be the major anion whereas calcium (Ca2+) was found to be the major cation present in the lakes. Piper Plot and Durov plot indicated Ca2+ - HCO3- as the major hydrogeochemical facics with comparatively less contribution from Mg2+-HCO3- type. The dominance of Ca2+ - HCO3- over Mg2+- HCO3- reflects the possibility of the natural order of dominance in the geology of the catchment area. The low Na+ + K+/TZ(+) (total cations) ratios and the high Ca2+ + Mg2+/TZ(+) (total cations) and (Ca2+ + Mg2+)/(Na+ + K+) ratios showed dominance of carbonate weathering. The average carbon ratios during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon were found to be 0.97 and 0.98, respectively, suggesting that proton is primarily derived from the oxidation of sulphide involving carbonate dissolution. The baseline data generated for a high-altitude lake shows that weathering and erosion during monsoonal precipitation and snow melt runoff during ablation season are the main sources of the chemical composition of lake water. Further to trace the imprints of climate change and seasonal variations in the high-altitude lakes, long term monitoring is recommended along with isotopic tracer techniques.																			2395-7611	2395-7697					2021	7	4					53	70		10.3233/JCC210025	http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/JCC210025													WOS:000734503900006

OPERATIONAL SATELLITE-BASED HIGH-RESOLUTION WATER QUALITY PRODUCTS FROM FOR USE CASES AROUND THE WORLD	PLANET CARE FROM SPACE	AIT Series: Trends in Earth Observation											Within the H2020 project PrimeWater, EOMAP is generating operational satellite-based water quality datasets for four different case studies in Europe, Australia and the USA. The applied physics-based retrieval algorithm Modular Inversion and Processing system (MIP) accounts and corrects for a variety of environmental impacts, such as atmospheric conditions, adjacent land cover, water surface and composition of water constituents as well as considering varying observation geometries and sensor properties. It delivers main water quality parameters like turbidity, chlorophyll-a concentrations, secchi disk depth, water temperature and a harmful algae bloom indicator which is sensitive to cyanobacteria. With automated routines for satellite archive access, the fully operational water quality product processing chain as well as the automated delivery mechanisms, the datasets are ingested directly into the online accessible PrimeWater platform and are further used for assimilation with modelled data. Based on Copernicus missions of Sentinel-2A/B combined with additional data from Landsat 8, spatial resolutions down to 10m pixel size allow monitoring of very small water bodies and ponds up to larger reservoirs, such as the Western Water Treatment Plant near Melbourne in Australia, Lake Harsha in USA, Lake Hume in Australia and Lake Mulargia and Flumendosa reservoir in Italy. For these use cases, all available records from 2015 onwards have been processed, with processor-internal quality control mechanisms screening automatically for e.g. cloud shadows or high influences of aerosol, resulting in pixelwise masking of unreliable data. Next to operational monitoring of water quality, the generated time series indicate clear spatial dynamics and seasonal trends.																					978-88-944687-0-0				2021	2						162	165				10.978.88944687/00												WOS:000925317600047

Spectral comparison between sensors is an essential preliminary step before conducting a data fusion for such applications. Comparison of medium spatial resolution data, e. g., Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 were mostly conducted in subtropical regions, nevertheless, limited in equatorial tropical environments. This study utilised the same day of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data to investigate the spectral changes over relatively unchanged environment conditions during 3-10 minutes of differences acquisitions time of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. The study area was the Citarum River Basin area in Indonesia with monsoonal climate type and various landcover, e.g., Lake, agricultural area, rain forest, and settlement areas. Surface reflectance of visible, Near Infrared, Shortwave Infrared and spectral indices, i.e., Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) generated from a valid pair of pixels, which free from cloud, cloud-shadow, saturated, dark area and cirrus of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images, were compared. Ordinary Least Square and t-test for mean difference analysis were accomplished to perform the relationship and the spectral changes of surface reflectance and spectral indices of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. The results showed a significant difference in mean values of surface reflectance and spectral indices of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 with a higher value of R-2 in the dry season (July) than in the rainy season (January). SWIR performed the highest relationships among the other spectra with R-2 of 0.68 in the wet season and R-2 of 0.8 in the dry season. However, spectral indices comparison is likely performed well over the dry and wet seasons. A single band of surface reflectance provided a lower relationship (R-2 < 0.8) than from spectral indices (R-2 > 0.8). NDWI provided best relationships on water pixels while EVI and NDVI well performed on soil and vegetation pixels, respectively. We found a lower relationships of surface reflectance between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 in tropical environments than were reported in subtropical regions. The highest relationship of this spectral comparison was found on water pixels, then decreased on soil pixels and lastly on vegetation pixels. Higher variability of tropical atmospheric conditions and mixed pixels issue may influence this lower relationship, particularly during the rainy season.

In Laguna El Tejo, a sheltered 1.7-ha Spanish karst lake, chlorophyll levels were < 2 mu g/L in the epilimnion but reached 10 mu g/L in the metalimnion and upper hypolimnion where cyanobacterial picoplankton dominated. Particulate nitrogen levels were 2-14 times higher in the metalimnion than in the epilimnion and 42 % of the primary productivity occurred in the deeper strata where the DCL was located. To address the trophic importance of the high biomass and production in the deep chlorophyll layer, we injected (NH4+)-N-15 and rhodamine into a 0.5-m strata (15-16 m) in the metalimnion of the lake. The (NH4+)-N-15 taken up by the nitrogen-limited phytoplankton allowed us to measure the importance of biologically mediated transport whereas the rhodamine traced physical eddy diffusion. After 28 days 55 % of the N-15 could be accounted for: 71 % remained in the metalimnetic seston (11-18 m), 10 % was in the hypolimnetic seston (18-20 m), 11 % was found above in the epilimnetic seston, and only 8 % had sedimented into the anoxic layer below 20 m. Only negligible amounts of rhodamine (corrected for degradation) moved beyond the 14-18 m strata in the lake, but bio-diffusivity of N-15 was 3 times greater than the physically induced diffusivity of rhodamine. A mixing model indicated that the deep chlorophyll layer contributed only 1-2 % of the diet of epilimnetic macrozooplankton but 14-33 % of the diet of the meta-hypolimnetic zooplankton. The data indicate the overall importance for primary production and the sequestration of nutrients in the DCL, but relatively limited importance for the macrozooplankton in the lake.

Recently, it became an issue that the gates have been opened not to deteriorate water quality in the lake. It is, thus, necessary to precisely estimate the changes of water quality characteristics, especially DO, phosphate and nitrate, in the lake according to various gate operations. In this study, Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model and Carbon, Silicate, Nitrogen Ecosystem model (SCHISM-CoSiNE) which is cable to simulate dynamic exchange such as gate operation conditions was utilized to obtain reliable and reasonable results including hydrodyanamic and environmental variables. For the verification, the measured data at 6 locations in Saemangeum basin was used to compare incluidng temperatue and salintiy from 2016 and each relative error became small enough to show high accurary. Also, under various scenarios by changing the designated water surface elevation on flood seasons, this model has been applied to present the best designated water surface elevation in terms of both water quality and water supply in the Saemangeum basin. It becomes possbile to show reliable guidance for dynamic operations and environmental changes with this model as requested in near future.																			1648-6897	1822-4199					2021	29	3					346	358		10.3846/jeelm.2021.15130	http://dx.doi.org/10.3846/jeelm.2021.15130													WOS:000719100500007

Principals have reviewed the area. In the first season, four excavations were opened - three (A-C) ones in the high castle and one (D) in the middle castle area. Trench A was founded on the outside of the south-eastern corner of the castle. The work was to verify the presence of the external wall - it was built from the side of the lake, present on the plans of the castle. During the excavation tests, the remains of the toilet tank were unveiled. Fragments of usable ceramics were extracted from these places. Samples were taken from vessels and transferred to the laboratory. During the chemical analysis, fatty acids were isolated. Based on the proportion of acids obtained, an attempt was made to interpret food prepared in dishes. The following tests were chosen for the tests: lid (P1), six den (P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7), two bellies (P9, P10) and two outlets (P8 and P11). After an overall analysis, it was found that FAME of plant and animal origin was detected in all samples.

Main Trends in Vertebrate Population Dynamics in the Clay Semi-desert of the Trans-Volga Region since the Mid-18th Century	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The main natural changes related to the climate variations and the economic activities over the past 250 years in the area of the clay semi-desert along the interfluve between the Volga River and the Ural River have been considered. The authors define four climate periods based on humidity in the region: the mid-18th century to the 1820s, the 1830s to the 1950s, the 1960s to the end of the 1980s, and the 1990s to the 2010s. For each period, the area features related to humidity and human economic activities, which are followed by altering life for plants and animals in the region, are described. It is proven that only the existence and patterns of aquatic and waterfront communities are directly dependent on the climatogenic factors. Most changes in wildlife of the other communities reflect the impact of regional economic activities representing different stages and types, while the climate variations only adjust them. The ravine forests that existed in lake depressions until the 19th century could ensure the presence of a ravine-woodland complex in the regional fauna. After clearing these forests, a part of the ravine-woodland species complex completely disappeared from the region, some part became synanthropes, while others, once extinct from the region, then recolonized with the occurrence of polydominant woody-shrub thickets in lake depressions and afforested plains. A shift from a steppe vegetation formation to a desert formation across the plain occurred because of overgrazing during the dry season. Therefore, some steppe animal species also became extinct in the region, while the desert animals occupied the niches left vacant. Plowing of the flatlands caused the occurrence of wildlife species using the arable fields in the region as feeding habitats. Anthropogenic activities of various kinds contributed to the arrival of the range-shifting species.

Influence of seasonality on the physiological and seminal parameters of buffaloes in the western region of Para	PESQUISA VETERINARIA BRASILEIRA												Awareness of the physiological changes that occur when animals are subjected to climatic changes that are considered stressful is essential to maintain animal welfare and to be able to exploit their reproductive potential efficiently and rationally. The present study was carried out to evaluate climatic variables' influence on physiological parameters, and Murrah buffalo ejaculates reared in a humid tropical climate in the Amazon. The immediate analyzes pertinent to the physical and morphological characteristics of the ejaculates were carried out and corresponded in the rainy season (RS) volume of 3.4 +/- 2.0mL; the mass activity of 4.4 +/- 0.5; motility of 80.4 +/- 5.6%; vigor of 4.4 +/- 0.4; concentration of 657,300 +/- 237,865.1 x 106sptz/mL; major defects of 9.0 +/- 2.6%; minor defects of 11.2 +/- 3.9%; total defects 20.2 +/- 5.3% and sperm plasma membrane integrity (SPMI) 84.8 +/- 5.6%, whereas in the non-rainy season (nRS), the results were 4.0 +/- 2.1mL; the mass activity of 3.0 +/- 1.0; motility of 56.2 +/- 13.4%; vigor of 3.0 +/- 1.0; concentration of 586,000 +/- 291,925.9 x 106sptz/mL; major defects of 20.8 +/- 9.9%; minor defects of 27.5 +/- 6.3%; total defects 48.3 +/- 9.3% and SPMI of 57.9 +/- 12.4%. Furthermore, a statistical difference (P<0.05) was observed for the parameters mass activity, motility, vigor, major defects, minor defects, total defects, and sperm plasma membrane integrity between both periods. The data on heart frequency, superficial temperature (head, back, groin, and scrotal pouch) showed a statistical difference between both periods (P<0.05). To conclude is necessary specific management in the non-rainy season that thermal stress is not a determining factor in reducing the reproductive quality of buffaloes; it is necessary to use means to improve animal welfare; one alternative is to use baths regularly for these animals or provide constant access to areas of rivers or lakes, as well as shading, preventing the buffaloes from being directly exposed to the unfavorable thermal environment.					; Silva, Welligton/AAV-9670-2021; NEVES, KEDSON/NLO-5546-2025	Castro, Samia/0000-0001-5336-1828; dos Santos Rebelo, Leticia/0000-0002-6741-3649; 													0100-736X	1678-5150				DEC	2020	40	12					1048	1053		10.1590/1678-5150-PVB-6716	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1678-5150-PVB-6716													WOS:000641991500013

Although this species was once abundant, there have been widespread declines due to habitat loss and modification, pollution, lampricide use, and overcollection. We compared environmental DNA (eDNA) and trapping surveys conducted from 2014 to 2016 to determine Mudpuppy occupancy along the St. Clair-Detroit River System, where this indicator species could be a gauge for success of ongoing restoration. Mudpuppy eDNA was detected at all sites with positive trapping records, as well as one site where individuals have not been trapped previously. Sites with shoreline restoration had the highest occupancy estimates, whereas deep-water restoration did not affect Mudpuppy occupancy. Additionally, eDNA surveys resulted in higher detection probability than setline and minnow trap survey methods, illustrating the benefit of using eDNA to detect secretive species. This study demonstrates the success of restoration efforts in increasing the occupancy of an indicator species and can be used as a template for other restoration initiatives.

We conducted a study on the limnology of Tasek Lake, a tectonic lake located in the Indo-Burma Province of the South Asian region. Physico-chemical parameters of the lake's water along with its plankton were considered for the study. Their relationship was analysed by understanding their seasonal variations and through linear regression models. The water quality index (WQI), plankton diversity indices and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were computed. The ichthyofaunal diversity was also studied to get an insight into the lake's fishery potential. A preliminary assessment on the economic feasibility of converting Tasek Lake into a fishery was also completed. Results indicate moderate eutrophication in the lake and the plankton population is observed to be rich and abundant. The WQI value confirms the water to be of "very poor" quality. The CCA was done to analyze the relationships of physico-chemical parameters with months and seasons, and the relation between seasons and plankton assemblages. Results corroborate the results of WQI. Identified fish population suggest ample fishery potential of the lake. The economic assessment reveals that in order to maintain the ecological sustainability of the lake, it should be transformed into a recreational fishery, following a catch-and-release model. The study calls for urgent restoration of the lake so that not only its pristine ecology is survived but also its fishery potential is sustainably harnessed and local livelihood is improved.					; Kalita, Dr. Unmilan/MVY-1114-2025	Bhusal, Tara/0009-0005-2260-6622; Kalita, Unmilan/0000-0002-1398-784X; Das, Dulumoni/0000-0001-5940-4163; Hazarika, Arup kumar/0000-0001-6206-3195; Panthi, Saroj/0000-0002-1502-7711													1932-6203					NOV 4	2020	15	11							e0240685	10.1371/journal.pone.0240685	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240685								33147227					WOS:000589609300034

Seasonal variations in export of antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria in runoff from an agricultural watershed in Iowa	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Seasonal variations of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) indicators in runoff water can help improve our understanding of AMR sources and transport within an agricultural watershed. This study aimed to monitor multiple areas throughout the Black Hawk Lake (BHL) watershed (5324 ha) in central Iowa during 2017 and 2018 that consists of both swine and cattle feeding operations as well as known areas with manure application. The measured indicators included plate counts for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) E. coli, Enterococcus, antibiotic resistant fecal indicator bacteria (ARBs) tylosin resistant Enterococcus, tetracycline resistant Enterococcus, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs): ermB, ermF (macrolide), tetA, tetM, tetO, tetW (tetracycline), sul1, sul2 (sulfonamide), aadA2 (aminoglycoside), vgaA, andvgaB (pleuromutilin). Both the plate count and the ARG analyses showed seasonal trends. Plate counts were significantly greater during the growing season, while the ARGs were greater in the pre-planting and post-harvest seasons (Wilcoxon Rank-SumTest p < 0.05). The ermB gene concentration was significantly correlated (p < 0.05) with E. coli and Enterococcus concentrations in 2017, suggesting a potential use of this ARG as an indicator of environmental AMR and human health risk. Flow rate was not a significant contributor to annual variations in bacteria and AMR indicators. Based on observed seasonal patterns, we concluded that manure application was the likely contributor to elevated ARG indicators observed in the BHL watershed, while the driver of elevated ARB indictors in the growing season can only be speculated. Understanding AMR export patterns in agricultural watersheds provides public health officials knowledge of seasonal periods of higher AMR load to recreational waters. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In each mire, species complexes peculiar both to the central part of each secondary water body and to the surrounding Sphagnum floating mat, at the water edge, were described. Altogether, 31 species of microcrustaceans were found in the collected material. Among them, two species of Cladocera and eight species of Copepoda were recordered from mountain water bodies of the North Caucasus for the first time. Montane Sphagnum peatlands were shown to be an outpost of northern species distributions, as confirmed by finding two Copepoda species typical of more northern regions. The abundance of microcrustaceans in floating Sphagnum mats was often tens times higher than in the water column. The habitat type, seasonality, latitude, longitude, altitude, temperature, acidity and mineralization combined were shown to explain only 32.3% variations in species complexes. This indicates a complex regulation of the community structure in altitudinal zonation conditions.

A total of 40 PLs were enumerated and characterized to determine their nature, position, depth, area and comparative account in RCF during the period of 2014-2017. A 1-year study of physicochemical parameters of water and soil was recorded at 27 selected mine PLs to understand its quality. During the study period, the 14 most frequently cultured/naturally occurred fish species were collected and identified from the PL. PLs aged over 20-30 years turned naturally into wetland ecosystem harbouring a good amount of aquatic biota, excellent water quality and stabilized embankment. The present study is based on the relationship between seasonal variation of heavy metals and fish diversity. During the analysis it is found that there is a direct impact on heavy metal concentration in these OCPs during different seasons. It was observed that concentration level differed among OCPs due to their different geographical location. Monsoon is the most vulnerable season for heavy metals concentration and pit lakes of Satgram area were more contaminated than those of Kajora Area. As a result of it, fish diversity and fish production were high in Parasea OCP and Ghanshyam OCP than Damalia OCP and Ratibati OCP and it may also be stated that post monsoon is most productive season in terms of rich fish diversity and fish production. The main aim of the work was to find out the relationship between the seasons and heavy metals concentration and its impact on fish diversity. It also gave emphasis to find out the probable measures for improvement of fishery sector.					; Saha, Nimai/ABH-1455-2020; SAHA, DR ABHISEK/AAU-2677-2021; Saha/AAL-9989-2021	Saha, Dr. Dibyendu/0000-0002-8022-6557; 													0974-6455					OCT-DEC	2020	13	4					2226	2232		10.21786/bbrc/13.4/90	http://dx.doi.org/10.21786/bbrc/13.4/90													WOS:000617116700090

Given the considerable data availability, methods to summarize multitemporal datasets are needed to support the analysis. Our study introduces and compares methods to monitor temporal variations of water bodies based on multitemporal image composition. For this purpose, the presence of water at different dates is mapped applying the normalized difference water index using two encoding methods. The first one is based on the cumulative analysis of water in the pixel along time, and the second one uses the principle of binary encoding. The cumulative analysis helps to visualize more humid and dry areas, while binary encoding indicates the monthly variations of the lake surface, storing information about the dynamics of the phenomenon. The methods are compared using Landsat time series of Lake Poopo obtained between 2013 and 2019. The results showed that binary encoding allows detecting when and where severe droughts affect the water body and its recovery. In addition, it was possible to monitor the severe drought that affected the lake in 2016 and it was also noticed that its surface is still below the level registered before the drought in 2013.

J	Borzenko, SV; Zamana, LV				Borzenko, S., V; Zamana, L., V			HYDROGEOCHEMISTRY OF THE IVANO-ARAKHLEISKY LAKES	GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH												The main purpose of the study is to determine the ranges of changes in the hydrochemical parameters of lakes in different climatic phases, as well as to identify the main sources of salts and processes that control the main geochemical parameters of lake water. The hydrogeochemical studies were carried out on the Ivano-Arachlea lakes, performed with a gap of more than 20 years. Chemical and analytical measurements of water samples were performed using generally accepted methods. It is shown that all lakes differ in morphometric characteristics, mineralization, chemical composition and pH value of water. According to Ivanov's classification, the studied lakes are divided into medium lakes with a surface area of 10,1-100,0 km(2) and very small lakes with a surface area of 0,1-1,0 km(2). Most reservoirs are shallow (about 1-5 m), with the exception of the lake. Arachlei, the average depth of which is 10,2-13,1 m according to Ovchinnikov's classification of water mineralization, three groups of reservoirs are identified: ultra-fresh, fresh and brackish. Ultra-fresh lakes with a mineralization of less than 200 mg/l and a pH of less than 8,2 are the most common in the region. They are mainly represented by the HCO3-Ca-Mg-Na chemical composition. Freshwater lakes are less common. They are more saline and alkaline, anionic composition represented more often HCO3- and SO42- and cation mixed Ca-Mg-Na, changing with the growth of salinity and pH of waters in HCO3-Na-Mg-Ca, and at a higher salinity to SO4-Cl-HCO3-Na. Even rarer are more alkaline brackish lakes. They have an HCO3-SO4-Mg-Na-Ca composition that transforms into SO4-Na as the salinity of the water increases. It is shown that small brackish lakes are more susceptible to change and larger ultra - fresh lakes are less susceptible to change. Variations of the main physical and chemical parameters can be traced both in the interannual context and in the off-season. Changes in the content of CO2, HCO3-, pH and SO42- were found in the depth of reservoirs. According to the number of biogenic elements, the lake is allocated. Arakhley Lake with the highest content of total phosphorus and lake. Large Hutel-Nur with a relatively high concentration of nitrogen. In this case, the dominant compound is the nitrate and ammonium forms. Increased concentrations of heavy metals such as manganese, iron, lead, Nickel, molybdenum, and cadmium are allocated to the lakes Maly Hutel-Nur, Bolshoy Undugun, Maly Undugun, Ivan, Irgen, and Shakshinskoe. In contrast to macro-coupling of micro-components with the main hydrochemical parameters of the medium, salinity and pH of water is absent. The main processes that control the hydrogeochemical diversity of lakes, including water interactions with aluminosilicate rock, sulfate reduction, sulfide oxidation, and evaporative concentration, have been established.

Changes of Zooplankton Community in the Shallow Floodplain Lake Srebarna (NE Bulgaria) Associated with Seasonal and Long-term Water-level Fluctuations	ACTA ZOOLOGICA BULGARICA												Lake Srebama is a shallow lake in the floodplain of the Danube River in NE Bulgaria, which is characterised by strong seasonal and long-term water-level fluctuations. The present study aimed to analyse the impact of the water level on the species richness, abundance and structure of the zooplankton community in this lake. Sampling was done monthly in 1999-2006. Overall, 100 zooplankton taxa were identified, including 71 rotifer and 29 crustacean (11 copepod and 18 cladoceran) species. The seasonal analyses identified specific species assemblages in both rotifers (four assemblages) and crustaceans (three assemblages), alternating along the annual cycle of the plankton community. High water levels facilitated the increase of the abundance of the Rotifera, while such effect was not detected on the Crustacea. The pattern of the dynamics of the abundance of rotifers differed from that of crustaceans and the maxima of the former coincided with the minima of the latter, and vice versa. The water-level fluctuations also affected the composition of the dominant species (both crustacean and rotifer) in the zooplankton community.

J	Singh, J; Singh, O				Singh, Jagdeep; Singh, Omvir			Exploring seasonality and erosivity of rainfall over a lower Himachal Himalayan catchment, India	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												The present study aims to explore the spatial distribution and trends in rainfall, its seasonality and erosivity between 1971 and 2015 over the Suketi river catchment of lower Himachal Himalayas in India. Daily rainfall recorded at three stations in the catchment have been used for the computation of rainfall seasonality and erosivity by employing non-parametric indices say seasonality index, precipitation concentration index and modified Fournier index. The distribution maps have been prepared by applying the kriging technique of geographic information system. The results have indicated remarkable spatial and temporal variability in rainfall as well as in its seasonality and erosivity. Largely, the pattern of rainfall has been found unimodal (single wet season) and more than 95% area of the catchment have witnessed a marked seasonality and prevalence of very severe rainfall erosivity. However, the long-term annual rainfall erosivity has revealed a statistically non-significant decreasing trend. The highest values of rainfall erosivity have been observed in the month of July followed by August, June and September with lower reaches being the most vulnerable one. We have witnessed an absolute relationship between annual rainfall and modified Fournier index (R-2 = 0 center dot 999;p < 0 center dot 001), indicating that the spatial distribution of annual rainfall erosivity is intensely controlled by annual rainfall depth. Finally, it is hoped that the results of this study will assist farmers, agronomists and policy makers in chalking out best management practices for reducing soil erosion vulnerability not only for the Suketi river catchment but also for other identical catchments of the lower Himachal Himalayas.

Continuous instrumental observations were used for quantitative data analyses and proper process-understanding. The observations include sediment sampling with trap, water level measurement, and precipitation measurement. Observational results show that changes in physical properties are basically due to precipitation; increase in precipitation is related to increase in grain density, mineral content and mineral grain size. Large change in bottom erodible area are mainly related to seasonal irrigation. Analytical results indicate that the sedimentation rate can be expressed as a function of both external factor (precipitation intensity) and system factor (increase in erodible area from water level changes). The correlation of multiple regression analysis for the seasonal relationship is better than that for the monthly relationship, suggesting that reservoir effect in the catchment should be considered.																			2198-7491	2198-7505				JUN	2020	7	2					615	630		10.1007/s40710-020-00433-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40710-020-00433-8		JUL 2020											WOS:000544832400001

The fate of model organic pollutants; 3,5-dimethylphenol and N-phenyl-1-naphthaleneamine in Lake Naivasha wetland, Kenya	SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN												Wetland ecosystems are sinks for organic carbon and greenhouse gases thus faciliating their biotransformation into less harmful compounds through anaerobic degradation. The aim is to protect aquatic ecosystems from ecotoxicological harm. This paper studies model pollutants; N-phenyl-1-naphthaleneamine and 3,5-diethylphenol in Lake Naivasha wetland. N-phenyl-1-naphthaleneamine is a suspected carcinogen which can metabolize into the well-known human carcinogen 2-naphthylamine whereas phenol derivatives scuh as 3,5-diethyl phenols are well-established carcinogens and mutagens. Soil sediments were collected from the wetland at intervals of 3 hours starting from 6.00 am to 6.00 pm three times during the dry season of December, 2018. Extraction of organics from sediments was carried out in a mixture of methanol and dichloromethane. Purified extracts were analyzed using a Gas Chromatograph coupled to a mass selective detector (MSD). The maximum concentration of N-phenyl-1-naphthaleneamine was 2.71 mu g/L at 6 am and decreased to similar to 34% at 6 pm. 3,5-dimethylphenol had a maximum concentration of 0.51 mu g/L and decreased to 25% at 6 pm. The diminishing concentration of these model organic pollutants is an indication that wetlands play a remarkable role in water purification and environmental management. Degradation pathways of N-phenyl-1-naphthaleneamine and 3,5-dimethylphenol to H2O CH4, and CO2 by microbial action has been suggested in this work. Furthermore, computational simulation on the stability behaviour of the model compounds under study has been performed to support their degradation characteristics. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Decreases in trapping success have created concerns that the population is declining. Some potential threats include water use, climate change, and management actions. Owing to the absence of long-term data on population trends, little information is available to estimate habitat quality and factors that influence it. We sought to fill this gap by examining associations between habitat area and variables representing suspected key drivers of habitat availability. Critical habitat areas were imaged using an unmanned aerial vehicle over a period of three years at three sites at Cowichan Lake and a subsequent habitat area was classified. Meteorological and anthropogenic controls on habitat area were investigated through automatic relevance detection regression models. The major driver of habitat area during the critical spawning period was water level during the storage season, which also depends on the meteorological variables and anthropogenic control. It is recommended that regulation of the weir should aim to ensure that the water level remains above the 1 m mark, which roughly equates to the 67% coverage of water on the habitat area used for spawning.

The study area consisted of the drainage basin of the Parseta River and a small catchment of the Borucinka River that flows across the Kaszubskie Lake District in northern Poland. Measurements of pH, electrolytic conductivity, oxygenation, and water temperature were performed in the field. The concentration of Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3-, SO42-, Cl-, NH4+, NO3-, PO43- was measured in the laboratory. Also, the atmospheric precipitation was determined using automatic precipitation stations. Climate conditions served as the primary determinants of seasonal change in the supply of dissolved matter to basins without outlets in the drainage basin. This is especially true of atmospheric precipitation and the effects of vegetation in the contact zone between precipitation and the biosphere. In the case of biogenic substances, one of the main factors was the length of the vegetation season. The main determinant of the hydrochemical state of kettle ponds was land use.					; Cieslinski, Roman/A-5427-2008	Cieslinski, Roman/0000-0002-5313-1923; Major, Maciej/0000-0002-5424-919X; 													0067-3064	1648-858X				JUN	2020	33	1					21	34		10.5200/baltica.2020.1.3	http://dx.doi.org/10.5200/baltica.2020.1.3													WOS:000545710000003

Therefore, it is critical to follow the laws of nature in design and planning of river shorelines to achieve the harmonious coexistence of human and nature free of flood catastrophes. This article takes the S River Park on the Living Shoreline of the Rule Lake New Town, Ganjiang New District, Jiangxi Province as an example of nature-based design approach: First, by examining remote sensing maps and water level data in different historical periods of the site, the design team learnt the evolving hydrological characteristics of the river; Second, the relations between the river's evolution and major human interventions in history are clarified and sorted; Last but not the least, guided by the nature laws of water erosion and sedimentation, a nature-based design solution was approached-By catalyzing natural processes with appropriate human interventions, it aims at rehabilitating the damaged sandbar habitats through spontaneous remediation of the river, and creating fascinating riverfront experience out of a rational function zoning of the park based on various natural conditions, thus to make the new town more vibrant and resilient by connecting it with the seasonal waterfront landscape driven by the ebb and flow of the river.																			2096-336X	2095-5413				JUN	2020	8	3					114	129		10.15302/J-LAF-1-040015	http://dx.doi.org/10.15302/J-LAF-1-040015													WOS:000598076900009

Decades of dam-building on the Lancang have removed sediment crucial to the health of Tonle Sap and the lack of reliability in the flood pulse is damaging to the region's economy and agriculture. Similarly, flood control dams and large hydropower projects such as the Nam Ou Cascade have put further strain on the most productive freshwater fishery in Asia. In addition to the development of large mainstream dams from the Himalayas to Laos, recent data suggests that China has intentionally held back water resources from downriver countries.																			1557-4660					MAY 15	2020	18	10							5396															WOS:000536730000001

We showed what factors can increase or decrease this process and how important are helophytes in the lake's water balance. The intensity of transpiration depends on many environmental factors including light, temperature, wind, and air humidity. By eliminating the variation of these factors under laboratory conditions, an attempt was made to indicate the intensity of this process among different species of helophytes and are there any factors limiting this process. We performed a field study of some shallow lakes to answer the question: what is the role of emergent macrophytes in evapotranspiration in lakes with different trophy and surface. Field works were carried out in the shallow littoral at the peak of the growing season. Under laboratory conditions five species were analysing in respect of water uptake. Under laboratory conditions, the width, length and number of leaves as well as the mass and diameter of the stems of respective species had the most significant effect on the uptake of water by helophytes. The length of the plant was a characteristic with the least significant impact on water uptake. The presence of inflorescence was highly negatively correlated with the amount of water taken up by the plants. This phenomenon may slow down the process of water uptake by plants. Among the analyzed factors affecting the uptake of water in the shallow lakes of the Leczna-Wlodawa Lake District, the most important effect was the area of rushes, their density and lake trophic type. In contrast, the type of lake supply, surface of the lake and the variety of helophytes proved to be irrelevant to the amount of water uptake. Helophytes play a significant role in the uptake of water. The share of Typha rushes significantly increases transpiration.					; GRZYWNA, ANTONI/T-7179-2018; Różańska-Boczula, Monika/T-8752-2018	grzywna, antoni/0000-0002-7105-7173; Rozanska-Boczula, Monika/0000-0001-6108-1607; Sender, Joanna/0000-0003-3126-5645													0003-4088	2100-000X				APR 10	2020	56								5	10.1051/limn/2020003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2020003													WOS:000526955100001

Integrated modelling of its concentration in the aquatic continuum requires specific tools for water bodies. However, although simple static empirical models and complex biogeochemical models are numerous, there are few relatively simple and flexible models able to simulate seasonal variations in phosphorus concentrations in water bodies and particularly in reservoirs. In this study, the two-layer dynamic model, LakeMab, simulating phosphorus variations in water bodies, was enhanced to consider some tributary characteristics and reservoir specificities. It was then applied to the case of a reservoir in western France, Lake Bultiere. Without any calibration, the modified model reproduced reasonably well seasonal variations in phosphorus concentration in the lake. A sensitivity analysis showed the importance of improvements related to reservoir functioning (outlet depth, water level fluctuations) and the smaller importance of those related to tributaries (variable concentrations, depth of riverine inputs). The model can easily be applied to diverse lentic systems and could be coupled to stream models, thereby making it a useful tool for managing water quality in lakes and reservoirs.					; Minaudo, Camille/AAG-9707-2019; Zhang, Qian/A-1295-2014	Minaudo, Camille/0000-0003-0979-9595; Moatar, Florentina/0000-0002-9251-6420; Zhang, Qian/0000-0003-0500-5655; DANIS, Pierre-Alain/0000-0002-4787-347X													1439-8621	1439-863X				APR	2020	21	2					233	244		10.1007/s10201-019-00606-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-019-00606-x													WOS:000521837800006

However, so-far this history cannot be proved archaeologically. The region has witnessed a few, short-term surveys, which did not continue long. Trabzon Protohistoric Period Survey Project which was started in 2018 aims to increase data about the region. In 2019 survey season, Mulaga Valley in Macka was one of the areas where reseach was conducted. In this valley, south to Zirvanos at Kalecik (Mile) Castle with an altitude of 2000 m, ceramic pieces dated to the Early Iron Age were identified.. These ceramic findings show similarities with the Early Iron Age ceramic repertoire of the northern part of the Van Lake basin, north-eastern Anatolia, and Transcaucasia with regard to their paste, surface treatment, and decoration. Kalecik (Mile) Castle findings allows for the first time to interpret Early Iron Age in the region. This paper argues that Eastern Black Sea Mountains were actually not a barrier for the Eastern Anatolian Early Iron Age.																			0569-9746	2667-629X					2020		23					91	111		10.26650/anar.2020.23.818496	http://dx.doi.org/10.26650/anar.2020.23.818496													WOS:000873964100004

Monitoring eutrophic processes is therefore mandatory to the aquatic environment and human health. However, the changes in the spatial and seasonal distribution of the phenomena are difficult to be resolved using sparse water sampling or acquisition of remote sensing data. Therefore, this research work proposes a methodology that takes advantage of the temporal and spectral resolution of Sentinel-2 (S2) for monitoring eutrophic reservoir. Specifically, it uses large temporal series of S2 images and advanced temporal unmixing model to study the spectral response of the turbid and productive water of San Roque reservoir, Argentina.

Samples were taken 7-fold in 3 places during the period from October to April. In the tested water was determined by the colorimetric method PO(4)(-3)ions, total P and N, nitrate(V), nitrite(III) and NH4-N. Additionally, the pH and temperature. The temperature and pH of water analyzed in the course of the study were at the level characteristic for the seasons under study and did not have a significant impact on the content of the determined chemical indicators. The level of biogenic elements and their compounds, determined a few years after reclamation, is higher than the results obtained in 2001 (immediately after reclamation), which may indicate improper sewage and agricultural management in the lake's basin.

Shashikumar; Jayapalan, Chitra; Kar, Devashish			Diversity and Seasonal Incidence of Zooplankton with Physico-Chemical Properties of Thongjaolok Stream of Bishnupur District Manipur, North East India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT												Biodiversity on the earth consist of innumerable of distinct biological species. The present paper reports on zooplankton diversity from the Thongjaolok stream, a partially subterranean stream located in the Bishnupur District at Manipur, North East India. The stream lies in the intersection of 24 degrees 30 '' N and 93 degrees 45 '' E. Due to the prime importance of zooplankton in fish culture, their role in recycling process of natural resources and degrade the waste materials for fish culture has to be investigated. Zooplankton diversity and physico-chemical parameters are important factors to evaluate the quality of a fresh water body. In order to study the status of Thongjaolok Stream, water samples and zooplankton samples were collected from Thongjaolok Stream during 2012-2014 subjected to analysis. A total of 31 species of zooplankton viz., Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda were recorded from the investigation. Among zooplankton, Rotifera were the dominant group represented by 22 species belonging to 6 genera and 5 families, cladocera represented by 9 species belonging to 5 genera and 5 families and copepoda of 3 species; 3 genera and 2 families respectively. Physico chemical parameters were also studied in detail and correlated with the zooplankton occurrence and abundance.																			0972-9984	0973-7308					2020	35	2					93	101																WOS:000570015200008

Material and methods Water samples for analysis were collected in two places - near the platform located on the bathing beach (first point) and in the vicinity of the platform situated among the abundant rush vegetation, away from the bathing beach (second point). Water samples were taken from both points five times, every six hours. In each case, samples were taken from a depth of about 60 cm using an open container. Immediately after their collection, the water temperature was measured, while the remaining parameters were tested within about an hour, i.e. pH, concentration of ammonia, nitrites, nitrates, phosphates, total hardness and carbonate. Additionally, the air temperature was measured. Results and conclusions 1. The trophic level in Rotcze lake is low, therefore the lake can be classified as an oligotrophic type. 2. The lake is not endangered by eutrophication, as the concentration of nutrients is negligible (below the quantification threshold), and it does not overgrow (during the growing season, rush vegetation accounts for up to 8% of the entire lake area). 3. Daily variation of water temperature is small (+/- 2 degrees C), but it correlates with air temperature. 4. The pH value increased after dark (10:00 pm), which was caused by the photosynthesis process that took place during the day, leading to a decrease in CO2 concentration and alkalinization of the water.																			1644-0765						2020	19	4					3	17																WOS:000644822300001

The rivers of Albania have a total annual flow rate of 1,308 m(3)/s per year. A screening of beta radioactivity in superficial waters (rivers and lakes) in Albania originates from 1970, which was one of the most important activities of Institute of Nuclear Physics (INP) for about 20 years. Samples for gross beta radioactivity were taken from representative rivers: Mat, Erzen, Ishem, Drin, Shkumbin, Seman and Vjose. Sampling has been periodic every two months. During the 1990 - 2004 after the change of political system this activity was reduced in 4 times per year. Since 2005-2007 the monitoring activity was financially supported by Ministry of Environment, National Environmental Agency (NEA), also 4 times per year. During 2007-2009 the cooperation project "Monitoring of radioactivity in drinking and surface waters in Albania" between IANP and Riso National Laboratory, University of Copenhagen supported by DEMA, Denmark. In 2015 also the NEA agency financed the monitoring of gross alpha/beta concentration in superficial waters every season of the year. Although Albanian legislation does not have limits on the level of radioactivity in river waters, use of some rivers for supply of water reservoirs for public consumption and irrigation of crops requires continuous monitoring. In this study were summarized the results of these long-term measurements.

The Trinity River drains into the Trinity-San Jacinto Estuary. Lake Livingston Reservoir is located on the Trinity River and is under environmental flow regulations to release a required amount of water to maintain seasonal inflow at a downstream USGS stream gage to ensure water researches the bay and estuary. The Sacramento River drains into the San Francisco Bay. The Keswick Reservoir and Shasta Dam on the Sacramento River have minimum instream flow requirements to maintain the water temperature for downstream fisheries. Correlations were made between inflow, releases, gauged flow, instream and environmental flow requirements, and fisheries data.

Effusive emissions of interest include precursors, reaction intermediates and products, decomposition products, growth media, fermentation metabolites, solvents, and cleaners used in a variety of processes of interest. For all volatile organic compound/semivolatile organic compound (VOC/sVOC) sensors, a vital question is sensitivity to false alarms resulting from the presence of background clutter. To assess this sensitivity, "normal background" must be understood in terms of parameters such as: physical position (latitude, longitude, nearby geographical feature such as lakes, mountains, deserts); temporally varying factors (season, time of day, weather); and industrial features (surrounding population density, nearby presence of known or unknown activities that emit characteristic patterns of chemical effluent). It is only by understanding the scope and variability of the normal background that one can determine if it is possible for a given sensor modality to discriminate a specific industry or classes of industries from normal background either absolutely, through specific chemical indicators or indicator patterns, or as change detection, if the baseline of an area or area class is known. The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) is conducting full VOC/sVOC mapping of a number of representative sites with varying climates, urban density, and local geographical features, as well as nearby contributing industries such as gas stations, a bakery, a brewery, a sewer treatment plant, and agricultural activities. This presentation will discuss the choice of sites, sampling methodology used, and preliminary comparative results.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-3610-1				2020	11416								114160E	10.1117/12.2559028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2559028													WOS:000590002900010

BIOCHEMICAL VARIABILITY OF A DEEP LANDSLIDE-SET LAKE (LAKE TORTUM, ERZURUM/TURKEY)	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Lake Tortum is a natural deep and landslide-set lake located in the northeast of Erzurum in the Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. The lake is under the influence of anthropogenic activity and pollution from agriculture. This paper, it was aimed to estimate the trophic level of Lake Tortum together with biological and some physicochemical parameters, as well as the external phosphorus load of this lake. The Lake was determined to be mesotrophic according to Secchi depth, total phosphorus concentration and chlorophyll-a tests. External phosphorus load was calculated above the critical phosphorus value determined for lakes. The lake has been shown in the eutrophication phase due to the nutrient inflow results exceeding the lake's loading capacity, the presence of some eutrophic species in the phytoplankton composition, and the periodic increase in blue-green algae. A total of 51 phytoplankton species were identified in the study period, belonging to 12 functional groups. The seasonal succession of dominant functional group is code LM (Ceratium hirundinella). The mean value of Q index in Tortum Lake was estimated as 1.88 which pointed out the tolerable ecological quality status.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2020	18	5					6137	6162		10.15666/aeer/1805_61376162	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1805_61376162													WOS:000585225100008

Hence, the chapter is a single-objective one and looks at the broad terrestrial habitat types and major water bodies of the Lake Tumba Landscape. As a qualitative examination, it is limited to forests and savannahs that are two major habitat types of the Lake Tumba Landscape. Qualitatively, and without covering forest floristic compositions, each major habitats type is decomposed into its broad components. Methodologically, the data were collected from combining estimates from transects and the analysis of satellite images. Seven forest types were identified in the Lake Tumba Landscape of which the most important forest types were permanently swampy forest (34.2%) and seasonally flooded forest (28.1%). Terra firma forests of the Lake Tumba Landscape had no single species-dominated large swathes of forest, which is often the case in many areas of the region.																			2211-9019		978-3-030-38728-0; 978-3-030-38727-3				2020	12						59	78		10.1007/978-3-030-38728-0_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-38728-0_5	10.1007/978-3-030-38728-0												WOS:000679978800007

Unfortunately, after the completion of the surveys, samples were insufficient to conduct a density analysis properly. The encounter rates were used as a sensible indicator of the species abundance and this latter varied with distance from main rivers, with the highest being within the distance 11-15 km; their averages were 0.11 nesting sites km(-1) and 0.05 nesting sites, respectively, for the Ngiri Triangle and Bosobele, respectively. Swampy forests and seasonally flooded forests combined dominated the overall area; woody swamps occupied 32% of the space and that Ngiri Triangle had 27.6% of mixed mature forest on terra firma, which was higher than most forests in that zone where the average terra firma forest is greater than 20%. Finally, Chimpanzees' nesting sites were found at the highest proportions (70%) in flooded forests and that human signs averaged at 2.3 signs per km in the Ngiri region (ranging between 0.8 and 5.0).																			2211-9019		978-3-030-38728-0; 978-3-030-38727-3				2020	12						133	141		10.1007/978-3-030-38728-0_11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-38728-0_11	10.1007/978-3-030-38728-0												WOS:000679978800013

Three species were observed in six groups: De Brazza's monkey, Mona monkey, and red tail monkey along a 10 km long trail. The mean relative abundance for all three species delta = 0.6 groups/km +/- 0.2 (SD). The mean group sizes for red tail monkeys (X) over bar = 7.3 individuals/group +/- 0.12 (SE), larger than any of the three systematically monitored in the region and De Brazza's monkey, with (X) over bar = 2.5 individuals/group +/- 0.23 (SE) had the smallest group size. The most encountered species was Mona monkey (sighting probability mu = 0.82 sightings/visit). The overall mean density (omega) over bar = 0.28 individuals km(-2), within the range = [0.13-0.38] individuals km(-2). The red tail monkey was the most abundant ((omega) over bar = 0.38 individuals km-2) followed by Mona monkey ((omega) over bar = 0.32 individuals km(-2)) and De Brazza's monkey ((omega) over bar = 0.25 individuals km(-2)). Comparisons with other areas in Tropical Africa indicated that group sizes, relative abundance, and densities in this region were lower. Despite the potential of other ecological processes (e.g. differences in habitat types, food availability, etc.) in the region to deplete primate populations, bushmeat trade was arguably the main reason for lower primate abundance in this region. Immediate conservation actions were called upon to help conserve some of the most important forest galleries from hunting to preserve the primate populations.																			2211-9019		978-3-030-38728-0; 978-3-030-38727-3				2020	12						153	162		10.1007/978-3-030-38728-0_13	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-38728-0_13	10.1007/978-3-030-38728-0												WOS:000679978800015

The histology of the oogenetic cycle in this species was documented for the first time. Histochemistry with semi-quantification revealed positive correlations between the gonadosomatic indices and copper load. Uptake of the metal increases in the liver as the ovaries increase in size, with the highest hepatic copper load occurring postspawning. The plasmatic levels of 17 beta-oestradiol were also quantified, but no correlations to copper load were found, so there is no direct estrogenic control on the uptake and release of copper from the bloodstream to either organ. Therefore, when interpreting field studies or assays on hepatic copper pollution and toxicity, breeding-related seasonal changes in Ohrid trout must be taken into account.

On the one hand, the region is very rich in natural resources and the largest European freshwater lake, the Lake Balaton, is situated there. It offers high quality leisure and tourism services for visitors, mainly during the high season. About 70 beaches give valuable services like spa facilities, kite surfing, stand-up paddling or dragon boats to lovers of water sports. On the other hand, the whole area is rich in cultural heritage which provide excellent facilities for tourists during the off-peak period. Museums, visitor centres, castles, ancient ruins, country houses, historical buildings and monuments entertain thousands of tourists every year. Besides these attractions, different kinds of cultural festivals are organised there and are popular among visitors and also residents of the region. The main aim of this research was to investigate the opinions and experiences of the tourists and locals in connection with the cultural offer of the Lake Balaton region. This paper focuses on the visitors' and residents' levels of satisfaction, the most common positive and negative attributes and the deficiencies regarding these attractions. In order to reach the goal of the research, both qualitative and quantitative methods were used, as well as an analysis of the related literature with inclusion of the tourism statistics. Firstly, the author made a content analysis by examining the available comments of the TripAdvisor review site regarding the cultural tourism attractions of this area. Secondly, 844 local inhabitants in 2018 and 358 residents in 2019 answered the questions of an online questionnaire in which they reported on their preferences and opinions regarding the cultural heritage of their home, the Lake Balaton region. On the basis of the results, visitors and local inhabitants seemed satisfied with the cultural offer of this area and there is demand for its enlargement and development in the future.																					978-953-8278-54-9				2020							123	142																WOS:000835726900006

It is such hydrobiocenoses that are the most susceptible to increasing anthropogenic impact. Phytoplankton is a good indicator of the ecological situation in the reservoir. The aim of the work was to analyze the composition and structure of phytoplankton of some small urbanized lakes of Samara region with different levels of protection and degree of anthropogenic load. Here, this is the first time we present an analysis of the current ecological state of three small water bodies having various nature protection statuses: Lake Yaitskoe (53 degrees 10'85 '' N,50 degrees 17'46 '' E), the regional natural monument; Lake Gatnoe (53 degrees 14'93 '' N, 50 degrees 11'83 '' E), Samara region natural heritage site; and Lake Bolshoe Vasilievskoe (53 degrees 54'40 '' N, 49 degrees 5324 '' E), the suburban lake located in the transition zone of the Middle Volga complex biosphere reserve (See Table 1). We collected samples for phytoplankton study and basic physical and chemical measurements in the growing season from 2013 to 2014 (See Table 2). We sampled the algae with a Ruffner bathometer. The material was fixed with 40% formalin solution. The cell count was carried out in the chamber "Uchinskaya" (Russia) with a volume of 0.01 ml. This chamber is a glass plate with low sides, the bottom of which is equipped with a special counting grid, optimized for counting plankton. Organisms are counted twice in 20 bands. Species identification of algae and counting of their cells were carried out on the microscope "BIOLAR PI" (limited liability company "Biolar", Poland) with an increase of 600 times. To determine the species of algae, we used reference guides from the series "Determinants of freshwater algae of the USSR" and "Susswasserflora von Mitteleuropa". The classification of Reynolds and co-authors was used to differentiate phytoplankton into functional groups. S-1-type (planktotrichete type) consisted of filamentous non-heterocyst forms of cyanoprokaryotes that previously belonged to genus Oscillatoria, M-type contained representatives of genus Microcystis, H-1-type contained representatives of genera Anabaena and Aphanizomenon. The similarity of the algae species composition of lakes was estimated with the Sorensen coefficient (Ks). The level of cenotic diversity and the degree of community alignment were assessed using Shannon (H) and Pielu (E) indices, respectively, taking into account the standard deviation. The dominant species were those whose number and biomass was 10% or more of the total value. The Simpson dominance index (S) was used to estimate the degree of dominance of individual species. Assessment of saprobity of waters was carried out by the method of Pantie and Bucc in the modification of Sladechek, using known indicator values of saprobity of individual species. The general state of ecosystems of the studied lakes was analyzed on the basis of the qualitative composition and quantitative development of phytoplankton from 2013 to 2014. In all lakes, the species richness of phytoplankton was quite high and contributed mainly by chlorophytes, diatoms and cyanoprokaryota species (See Table 3 and Fig. 1). Floristic analysis revealed signs of imbalance in lake ecosystems, probably caused by anthropogenic impact and/or lack of biogenic limitation (See Table 4). This situation is especially unfavorable for ecosystems of water bodies of protected nature areas. Ecological and geographical analysis did not reveal significant differences between the algal flora of the studied reservoirs (See Table 5). The level of similarity of the species composition of the studied reservoirs was quite high (See Table 6). Perhaps this was due not only to similar abiotic parameters of the environment, but also to a high level of identical anthropogenic load. Quantitative phytoplankton development was high in all water bodies, the highest one was observed in Lake Bolshoe Vasilievskoe, and the lowest in lake Gatnoe (See Fig. 3). According to average algal biomass over the study period, Lake Bolshoe Vasilievskoe corresponds to the hypertrophic state, while lakes Gatnoe and Yaitskoe are eutrophic. Phytoplankton species diversity and alignment were highest in lake Gatnoe, and smallest in lake Yaitskoe. According to saprobity, the studied water bodies were beta-mezosaprobic which corresponds to the water quality class III. Analysis of the floristic composition, the ratio of taxonomic ranks, indicators of quantitative development and the structure of the dominant species complex revealed signs of an imbalance in ecosystems and the development of "oscillatory" disease in all studied lakes, regardless of their conservation status due to anthropogenic impact and lack of biogenic restriction.					; Krivina, Elena/ABG-4501-2020; Malysheva, Alina/KGM-0616-2024	Krivina, Elena/0000-0002-0849-5832; 													1998-8591	2311-2077					2020		49					128	148		10.17223/19988591/49/7	http://dx.doi.org/10.17223/19988591/49/7													WOS:000535301300007

The Mann-Kendall test and Spearman's rho test were conducted with results showing no significant trend in both the flood season averaged WLs and monthly averaged WLs in the Poyang Lake. The sequential Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt test were carried out and showed no significant abrupt change in trend of WLs as well. Besides, the Morlet continuous wavelet transform was applied to identify the periodic characteristics in trend of WLs. The results indicated that there were three types scale of periodic component, in which the periodic oscillation in 35 years was the first main period of the annual flood season averaged WLs with basically two oscillations, while the periodic oscillation in 11 years and 5 years were the second and third main periods, respectively.																			1755-1307						2020	510								032012	10.1088/1755-1315/510/3/032012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/510/3/032012													WOS:000615964600066

In most of the cases, combined solutions have been implemented, the wastewaters are treated in treatment plants before discharging into the natural environment such as rivers, lakes or coastal areas. Unfortunately, in the South-East and North-West areas of Danang city, the wastewaters from the drainage system are discharged directly into nearby water environment that is the coast of the East sea at the mouth of Han river. The selected approach combines modeling tools-Mike Urban and Mike 21 FM EcoLab-that allow to simulate jointly the behavior of the sewage system, the production of pollutants and their impact within the coastal area. NH4+ is chosen to simulate the coastal water quality. A hypothesis has been formulated for the event observed in July 2016 in Danang city. Through the results of simulation in the dry season, the ammonium concentration distribution along the coast of Danang is higher than 0.5 mg/l-the standard limited value of National Technical Regulation on marine water quality of Vietnam with a small area approximately 0.03 km(2) during a short time. On the other hand, the high NH4+ concentration will disperse in larger areas after rainy events following a dry period. Findings indicated that 0.3 km(2) areas are covered over 0.5 mg/l NH4+ after a rainfall of 8 mm/h. In addition, the 4 km(2) area in the coast of Danang is covered by 0.14-0.5 mg/l NH4+.

There has been a considerably wide gap, with floods during rainy seasons but water crisis in dry seasons, which creates animbalanced spatial distribution of groundwater. For this reason, groundwater flow system analysisisnecessary for efficient water resource planning and management.This research was designed to compare several deterministic methods and evaluate how deterministic and classical methods could identify and map the spatial distribution of the groundwater flow system in the Limboto-Gorontalo lowland. This system was determined by monitoring and measuring 157 samples of dug wells. The obtained data were interpolated using two GIS-based deterministic methods, namely inverse distance weighted (IDW) and radial basis function (RBF), and one classical technique, i.e., manual three-point problem method (3PM). Mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values were used to evaluate and decide the best interpolation method. After comparing MAI.: and RMSE values and analyzing the resulting maps, the RBF was proven to be better than the IDW method. Moreover, the maps generated by RBF and 3PM did not differ significantly. The spatial analysis results showed that the groundwater flow system in the study arca originated in the hilly areas in the north and south of Lake Limboto and flew to several valleys and rivers instead of directly accumulating in this lake.																			1755-1307						2020	485								012039	10.1088/1755-1315/485/1/012039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/485/1/012039													WOS:000594132100039

The study was conducted between 2011 to 2013 covering pre and post-monsoon seasons. In total, 4,852 individual fish specimens were collected representing 66 fish species belonging to 23 families. The species diversity comprised 65 species in pre-monsoon and 60 species in post-monsoon seasons (p<0.05). The highest species diversity was recorded for the family Cyprinidae (22), followed by Bagridae (7). An assessment of conservation status of 66 fish species as per IUCN Red List 2019 criteria listed 6 species under near threatened (NT), 54 under least concern (LC) and 2 species under vulnerable (VU) category. The study reports several commercially important species under near threatened (Chitala chitala, Labeo pangusia, Ompok bimaculatus, Ompok pabda, Ailia coila and Bagarius bagarius) which makes Surha Taal an important natural lake from fishery management point of view. The study also prioritised different habitat types important for different species. The slow water in the mid-channel areas of the lake were categorised as important habitats for threatened and vulnerable fish species like C. chitala and B. bagarius and Wallago attu, which can be prioritised for population level management.

A field campaign was carried out at Lake Vela (Figueira da Foz, Portugal) to access the impact of wind and horizontal temperature gradients on surface exchange flows. A weather station and four water temperature probes installed in a littoral-pelagic transects are continuously collecting data allowing the characterization of seasonal and diurnal variations. Superficial flow velocity was computed by Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques employing images acquired by a drone equipped with a CMOS sensor camera.

Lake Cala is a wetland that flooded during high tide and become land in dry season. The study was conducted to determine present status of the diversity and the condition of fish. This study has been done at Lake Cala in February until March 2017. On this tide season, data were collected by fishers. The fish sampling was conducted using hook line, cast nets, gillnets and fish traps (corong). A total of 27 fish species belongs to three ordo,11 families, and 19 genera were recorded during the study. Diversity of fish in Lake Cala on the tide season is dominated by whitefishes. Based on its potency, most fish species are 59% consumption, 33% double potency, and 8% ornamental fish. Aro (Osteochilus melanopleura) and palau (O. vittatus) from Cyprinidae family, and baung (Mystus nemerus) from Bagridae family were dominant. The length-weight relationship showed that dominant two species of fish (baung and palau) had positive allometric growth patterns, while aro is isometric. Those parameters obtained from the study are useful fundamental information applicable in the future population dynamics studies. Furthermore, based on these result it was necessary to manage the fishing gears operation and regulating tributaries to maintain the process of fish on search for feed, distribution, and colonization of various species and populations.																			1755-1307						2020	535								012038	10.1088/1755-1315/535/1/012038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/535/1/012038													WOS:000631912900038

Various works in the literature propose a combination of optical imagery and radar altimetry to estimate water storage variations in inland water targets. This work wants to exploit the simultaneous acquisition offered by SRAL (Synthetic aperture Radar ALtimeter) and SLSTR instruments hosted by the Sentinel-3A/B platform. We present a practical case study, demonstrating how a strongly reduced subset of radiometric measurements can be enough representative of the status of the natural system under observation. In our approach, a subset of the collected radiance maps is extracted, based on the selection of the most variable pixels. Thus, a time series of average spectral radiances is built upon the reduced set of SLSTR data, and compared with satellite radar altimetry measurements. Preliminary results show a promising relationship between the timeseries generated by the two independent instruments, in terms of both general trend and seasonal dependence. Finally, by using the approximation proposed in this paper, a very light computational process can infer an estimation of water storage, when the natural system is fully identified on the basis of ground-truth data.

For river flood simulation, the automatic domain updating (ADU), which can effectively control the simulation domain only in and around the flooded areas, has recently been developed. It is easily implementable without any computational errors for river flood simulation; however, its applicability to lake flow simulation with pre-cipitation/evapotranspiration has not been investigated. This study examines the applicability of the ADU to large-scale lake flow simulation with the 2-dimensional local inertial equations (2D-LIE) taking the Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia, as a study site. The 2D-LIE with the ADU demonstrated 2.1 times faster simulation with errors less than 5.5%. This efficiency was achieved owing to the wet/dry seasonal nature of the tropical lake and backflow from the mainstream of the Mekong River in the rainy season, suggesting that the ADU is applicable to large-scale lake flow simulation.					; Yoshioka, Hidekazu/Q-8786-2019	Tanaka, Tomohiro/0000-0002-8884-9089; 													1882-3416						2020	14	2					68	74		10.3178/hrl.14.68	http://dx.doi.org/10.3178/hrl.14.68													WOS:000610195900001

The exploitation status of this species was also characterized using data from landing. Toluidine-stained transverse section of otoliths from 450 specimens, collected between November 2015 and January 2017 (by experimental gillnet fishing and landing surveys), were analysed to identify the periodicity of annulus formation and to age individuals. Length, weight, sex and sexual maturity stage were recorded. Life history traits were characterized by length-weight and length-age relationships. The periodicity of annulus formation was annual, with complete formation of the translucent zone at the end of the warm and dry season and the beginning of the warm and wet season (May-June). The length at first sexual maturity of females was estimated to occur at a standard length of 212 mm and at 3.3 years old (50% of matured females). The condition factor, which was between 1.04 and 1.09, was lower than for other studied populations. H. macrolepidota in the Nam Theun 2 Reservoir had a relatively slow growth (0.24 yr(-1)) with a relatively short lifespan (maximum age of approximately 9 years old). The species exploitation in the reservoir mainly concerned individuals that had a standard length between 120 and 220 mm, meaning that 67% of landed individuals did not have time to reproduce before capture. The exploitation rate was 0.87, and according to the probability of capture, individuals had 50% chances of being caught after 182.5 mm, preventing them from taking part in the stock renewal. The present study suggests that the H. macrolepidota population in the reservoir is overexploited. These new findings should be considered for further improvements in fishery management and the sustainability of fisheries.

This study evaluated the spatial and temporal changes in the phytoplankton, epipelon and epiphyton structures in a shallow reservoir. We investigated the determining factors of the structural variability and spatial differences in the species composition and algal density in the three habitats. Bimonthly samplings were carried out for determination of the limnological variables and algal communities. The rainy season was characterized by high nutrient availability and macrophyte coverage, and the communities were dominated by flagellate algae, as Chromulina elegans Doflein. The highest modification rate was found in the phytoplankton structure, followed by epiphyton and epipelon. Despite the species co-occurrence among phytoplankton, epipelon and epiphyton, the descriptor species presented different representativeness in communities. Planktonic and epiphytic algae were more associated with temporal variation in nutrient availability, while depth was more important for epipelic algae structuring. We conclude that the algal community in the plankton, epipelon and epiphyton was structured by different environmental factors, but descriptor species co-occurrence suggested an interrelationship between communities in this shallow reservoir with high abundance of macrophytes.

AGEING NORTHERN SAW-WHET OWLS (AEGOLTUS ACADICUS) FROM REMIGIAL MOLT PATTERNS	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												We recorded molt patterns of migrant Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) at three locations in the Great Lakes region: Stevens Point, Wisconsin; Whitefish Point, Michigan; and Duluth, Minnesota. We then analyzed the molt patterns of recaptured birds that were banded in a previous season and originally classified as hatch-year birds (i.e., they had no remigial molt). Of these 286 known-age birds included in our analysis, 155 (54%) were second-year (SY), 72 (25%) were third-year (TY), 39 (14%) were fourth-year (4Y), 16 (6%) were fifth-year (5Y), three (1%) were sixth-year (6Y), and one (0.30%) was eighth-year (8Y). Using these known-age birds, we were able to identify definitive molt patterns for the SY and TY age classes. All 155 (100%) SY birds and 52 (72%) of the TY birds matched our ageing criteria. The remaining 28% of TY birds did not match our ageing criteria and were classified as after-second-year (ASY). Of the entire sample (n = 286), only three birds (1%) matched an incorrect age class, including one 4Y that matched the SY age class and two 5Y that matched the TY age class.																			0892-1016	2162-4569				DEC	2019	53	4					387	392		10.3356/0892-1016-53.4.387	http://dx.doi.org/10.3356/0892-1016-53.4.387													WOS:000496730800003

Optimal spatial-dynamic management to minimize the damages caused by aquatic invasive species	LETTERS IN SPATIAL AND RESOURCE SCIENCES												Invasive species have been recognized as a leading threat to biodiversity. In particular, lakes are especially affected by species invasions because they are closed systems sensitive to disruption. Accurately controlling the spread of invasive species requires solving a complex spatial-dynamic optimization problem. In this work we propose a novel framework for determining the optimal management strategy to maximize the value of a lake system net of damages from invasive species, including an endogenous diffusion mechanism for the spread of invasive species through boaters' trips between lakes. The proposed method includes a combined global iterative process which determines the optimal number of trips to each lake in each season and the spatial-dynamic optimal boat ramp fee.					; Zikatanov, Ludmil/N-1065-2019	Zipp, Katherine/0000-0002-7206-5159; Zikatanov, Ludmil/0000-0002-5189-4230													1864-4031	1864-404X				DEC	2019	12	3					199	213		10.1007/s12076-019-00237-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12076-019-00237-x		OCT 2019											WOS:000493503900001

Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis showed homogeneous assemblages of dominant zooplankton species except Chydorus gibbus which has wider range of niche partitioning. Turbidity formed by suspended materials facilitated better avoidance of larger zooplankton like Daphnia similis from predators. Sedimentary silt particles influenced on the assemblages of sensitive species such as Tropocyclops prasinus, Asplanchna priodonta and Colurella obtuse. Changes within the land-use pattern in the catchment of the central Himalayan lakes either directly or indirectly impact on the distribution of zooplankton community.

J	Evdokimenko, MD				Evdokimenko, M. D.			Landscape Fires in Transbaikalia	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												This paper presents results of wildfire studies conducted Transbaikalia over the last five decades. Station-based experimental investigations into fire hazards of vegetation accomplished at the regional forest fire stations during those years covered all altitudinal vegetation zones, representative landscape localities and forest types. Route investigations were made in different natural areas. Arial monitoring of landscape fires was used during two fire seasons. Long-term effects of fires in the Baikal Natural Area and in Central Transbaikalia were investigated. Fire regimes in vegetation complexes were analyzed and for each of them the duration of the fire hazard was determined both as the total duration for the entire season and as a continuous duration for the period of the fire maximum. Characteristics of the regimes for the altitudinal belts are provided in three versions according to precipitation amounts for a season (normal, dry and wet). It is found that forest fires occur in intensive and extreme fire regimes where most of the vegetation complexes of the region become exceptionally hazardous as compared to adjacent areas. In such a situation, there are almost no barriers to fire, except for broad rivers, lakes and mountain crests. The forest fire frequency index is high due to a predominance of light coniferous stands. A rapid spread of fires is also promoted by dry grass stands and fire-hazardous shrubs where the fire is spreading nearly as fast as the speed of wind. It was established that unmown meadows, and abandoned pastures and croplands in the outskirts of villages present the threat of devastating fires not only in forests but also in settlements. In a situation, such as the one that arose in 2015, landscape fires turn to a natural disaster with severe forest-ecological consequences. Surviving forest stands decrease in productivity and increase in self-thinning, followed by an increasing degradation caused by subsequently recurring fires. Burns undergo local deforestation or a long-lasting replacement of coniferous stands by deciduous forests. The future runoff from the burned-over areas is able to enhance pollution of Lake Baikal. It is concluded that the EMERCOM resources used to fight the latest fires in Transbaikalia showed very little promise because of being delayed. A reasonable alternative to EMERCOM would involve advanced forecasting of high risks of fire occurrence in order to rapidly fight fires with moderate expenses without letting them turning to a natural disaster.																			1875-3728	1875-371X				OCT	2019	40	4					335	345		10.1134/S187537281904005X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S187537281904005X													WOS:000519449800005

A morphologically based functional group (MBFG) proposed by Kruk et al. (2010), especially potential toxic cyanobacteria (group III and VII), was also illustrated. Samples were collected at 96 sites along main rivers throughout the four seasons from September 2014 to January 2016. Significant differences in the phytoplankton community structure were observed at spatial (particularly between Huangpu/Tiaoxi and the other 4 river systems) and seasonal scales. On a spatial basis, high variability was observed in the mean phytoplankton biomass, with a relatively high value of 3.13 mg L-1 in Yanjiang system and a relatively low value in Huangpu (1.23 mg L-1) and Tiaoxi (1.44 mg L-1) systems. The mean biomass of potential toxic cyanobacteria accounted for 18.28% of the mean total biomass spatially, which was more abundant in Nanhe and Yanjiang systems. Spatial autocorrelation was weak for the total biomass and its four main components (bacillariophyta, chlorophyta, euglenophyta, and cyanobacteria) at whole basin scale regardless of season. Regarding the river system, significant autocorrelation was scarcely observed in all the river systems except Huangpu, especially in the inflows. The characteristic in terms of hydrological and environmental conditions may determine the community structure of the 6 river systems. Our study highlighted the importance of monitoring based on a large spatial scale, and more attention should be paid to potential toxic cyanobacteria for water quality management purposes.

J	Adhiambo, NE; Onyango, OE; Kivuva, KN				Adhiambo, Ngesa Elizabeth; Onyango, Otachi Elick; Kivuva, Kitaka Nzula			Some biological aspects of straightfin barb, Enteromius paludinosus (Peters 1852) during the rainy season in Lake Naivasha, Kenya	SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN												This paper focused on determining the sub lethal effects of reported pollutants in Lake Naivasha, Kenya using the straightfin barb (Enteromius paludinosus), a decade after the existing baseline study. The specific objectives included determining the length-weight relationship (LWR), condition factor (K) and the sex ratio, of the migratory E. paludinosus. A total of 1279 straightfin barb were collected from the mouth of River Malewa, a major source of water for Lake Naivasha using seine nets of mesh size 1.2 mm in the month of November 2017. The fish were caught and transported to the laboratory, then killed humanely by cervical dislocation and thereafter their lengths (cm) and weights (g) determined followed by their dissection to examine the gonads. The length-weight relationship was determined using the formula W = aTL(b). The condition factor (K) was determined using the formula K = 100 W/ L-b. A student's t-test was used to test the significant differences in the weight and length of both sexes. The sex ratio, expressed as male: female was calculated by dividing the number of females by that of the males. The equations obtained for the LWR of the combined sexes, males and females of E. paludinosus were, Log W = 3.23 Log L + Log 0.1073, Log W = 2.83 Log L + Log 0.1500 and Log W = 2.87 Log L + Log 0.1522 respectively. The mean condition factor of the combined sex, males and females of E. paludinosus were; 0.5897, 0.5729 and 0.5981 respectively. The sex ratio of the fish was 1: 1.981 (males: females). The results showed that E. paludinosus in Lake Naivasha are not in a good condition, k < 1. The findings of this study may be attributed to the state of the lake due to the reported pollution increase and ecological changes by recent studies. (C) 2019 The Authors.

The samples were taken during two annual cycles, 2012 and 2013. In this study, six species of crustacean zooplankton of two groups, copepods and cladocerans, were identified. Daphnia lumholtzi was the most abundant species, accounting for 58.26% of the total zooplankton density. We recorded a low zooplankton specific richness and a great spatial heterogeneity. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that hydrodynamics of the ecosystem, trophic relationships and environmental factors were generally responsible for the spatial and temporal distribution of these zooplankton species.																			0324-0770					JUN	2019	71	2					227	234																WOS:000474315900010

It is the driest country in sub-Saharan Africa with unpredictable rainfall patterns which occur between October and May. The Cuvelai Etosha Basin is a rural setting in which most people depend on groundwater to circumvent water scarcity by the construction of hand-dug wells. Communities consume hand-dug well water throughout the year without; knowledge of its safety, and treatment prior to use. Hence, this study aimed at evaluating the seasonal safety and quality of hand-dug well water for human consumption. A 16S rRNA metagenomics study was conducted to explore the influence of season on the human pathogenic bacterial species richness, diversity, evenness and abundance in the hand-dug wells. Bacterial pathogens were identified and analysis revealed no significant difference in species richness and diversity, and a significant difference in species evenness and abundance between the wet and dry seasons. Hence, seasonality had an influence on human bacterial pathogens evenness and abundance but had no influence on species richness and diversity. In addition, the water in hand-dug wells of the Cuvelai Etosha Basin is not safe for consumption and domestic use unless sanitized. It is recommended that efforts should be made to treat the water prior to use, and hand-dug wells should be properly constructed to reduce contamination.

The phytoplankton samples were collected from ten pre-selected sites. Nine of the selected sites were closely associated with the discharge mouth of seafood processing plants and one kept as the reference site which is free from the seafood plant discharge. From all the study sites, a total of 38,472 phytoplankton individuals belonging to 11 classes were identified on the basis of standard keys. The major classes obtained were Bacillariophyceae (21,812 individuals), Chlorophyceae (7111 individuals), Cyanophyceae (6118). The correlation analysis showed that physico-chemical parameters like DO, BOD, COD, transparency and pH significantly influenced the distribution of phytoplankton.																			2348-5191	2348-8980				APR	2019	6	1					21	25		10.21276/ambi.2019.06.1.ra03	http://dx.doi.org/10.21276/ambi.2019.06.1.ra03													WOS:000467058300005

Generally, there are two types of land use for crop, i.e. irrigated land and non-irrigated land. This research was aimed to determine water input, water use and water loss, consumptive use crop water balance and designing a cropping pattern on rainfed paddy field at Watershed Tenggarong. Determination of field capacity and permanent wilting point using soil texture data was input through Bouyoucos hydrometer methods. The calculation of land water balance according to Thornthwaite and Mather (1957) was employed to determine the agro-climate condition, particularly the dynamics of soil moisture content to plan a general cropping patterns was used based on monthly data. The planting time period is the water holding capacity > 50% from available water. Water balance monthly indicated that this area has potential growing season about 9 months, water surplus 8 months (439.6 mm year(-1)) and water deficits about 3 months (59.7 mm year(-1)). In these area, paddy could be planted twice a year without irrigation. Whereas when there are climate anomalies, paddy fields can be cultivated on certain land (swamps or suburbs of lake/river).					; Sujalu, Akas/AAJ-5606-2021	Hidayanto, Muhamad/0000-0003-3685-254X; 													1310-0351					FEB	2019	25	1					214	220																WOS:000459986000030

Climatic fluctuations directly affect the hydrology of an area, which in turn plays a significant role in the economy of any country. In South Asia, Himalayan glaciers shrinkage at high elevated areas is more pronounced at unprecedented rates causes major change in seasonal freshwater flow regimes. Therefore, the present study is aimed at reviewing and analyzing the cryosphere dynamics of Himalayan region of South Asia. Glacier retreat has resulted in the increase of the number and size of glacial lakes at exposed end moraines; resulting in glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). Nepal and Bhutan are two hot spot areas for Glacier retreat. It is predicted that climate change will continue to proceed, temperature will rise globally in the same way. Thus, there is a need to articulate a coordinated strategy to deal effectively with water management issues and risk of GLOFs events.

Seasonal Study of Cu, Zn and Pb Accumulation and Distribution in Sediments and PhragmitesAustralisplanted in A Constructed Wetland "Lake Manzala Engineered Wetland Project", (LMEWP), Egypt	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND ALLIED SCIENCES												Lake Manzala Engineered Wetland project (LMEWP) is a constructed wetland that has been designed for treating drainage water coming from Bahr El-Baqar drain. In this study, the concentration of heavy metals (Cu, Zn and Pb) in water, sediment and different organs of Phragmitesaustralis collected from LMEWP seasonally. The aim of this study was to determine the dynamics of distribution of metals in different parts of phragmitesaustralis, and to determined the bioaccumulation factor (BCF) in different organs of plant phragmitesaustralis and Translocation Factor (TA), particularly to determine the time of maximum accumulation in the above-ground tissues and to assess removal capacity of phragmitesaustralis in LMEWP. Results revealed a high significant correlation between heavy metals concentrations in phragmitesaustralis with its location in LMEWP vegetation cell; start cell> end cell. The highest concentration of metals is mostly found in phragmitesaustralis root. All metals were accumulated in root over time until the end of the growing season after eight months. On the other side, metal concentrations in stem and leaves increased even after the growing season of the plant. Overall, the results suggest to harvestphragmitesaustralis before six months IN the growing season in order to improve the accumulative efficiency of phragmitesaustralis in LMEWP project.

The goal was to establish, balancing economics and environmental impact, the best combination of primary energy supply and conversion technologies required to meet electricity, heating, cooling, chilled and potable water requirements for the new city, for which prior analysis had defined detailed demand profiles (variable hourly, daily and seasonally). A multi-objective MILP optimisation model was developed which included the key generation, transformation, storage and utilisation options, together with financial (capital and operating cost) and CO2 emission models of each. After an initial screening, primary energy supply technologies considered included: Combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT), Solar photovoltaics, Solar thermal (parabolic troughs), Large scale on-shore wind power and Waste to energy. For water desalination, both thermal (in particular Multiple effect distillation) and electromechanical processes (in particular Reverse Osmosis) were considered as potentially viable. For cooling, options selected included Absorption chillers and Vapour compression chillers. While storage of electricity was not considered feasible, options to store chilled and potable water were included. Key aspects of the approach and model, some of the data used, and representative results are described. The model, implemented and solved in GAMS, provided a consistent framework for the comparison of alternative technologies, the trade-offs between cost and emissions and the assessment of deployment scenarios. Results include some unexpected findings arising from the complex interactions between demand variations and energy, water and water storage components. In particular, storing chilled water in insulated storage tanks and potable water in exposed but deep lakes represented an effective way to store energy, minimise peak energy supply, and reduce both capital and CO2 emissions.					; Liu, Pei/C-4913-2011	Liu, Pei/0000-0002-6854-4333; Macchietto, Sandro/0000-0001-6096-8126													1570-7946		978-0-12-818597-1				2019	47						107	112		10.1016/B978-0-12-818597-1.50018-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-818597-1.50018-7													WOS:000495451900018

Growth and development of Pierce's disease-tolerant hybrid bunch grapes in the southeastern USA	PROCEEDINGS OF THE XII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GRAPEVINE BREEDING AND GENETICS	Acta Horticulturae				12th International Conference on Grapevine Breeding and Genetics (GBG)	JUL 15-20, 2018	Bordeaux, FRANCE	Int Soc Horticultural Sci Div Vine & Berry Fruits, Int Soc Horticultural Sci Div Plant Genet Resources & Biotechnol, Int Soc Horticultural Sci Working Grp Grape Genet Physiol & Management, Int Soc Horticultural Sci				In the humid subtropical climate of the southeastern region of the USA, commercial cultivation of European (Vitis vinifera L.) and hybrid bunch grapes has largely been prevented by the presence of Pierce's disease (PD), a bacterial infection caused by Xylella fastidiosa, a Gram-negative bacterium endemic to the region. Consequently, only PD-resistant or -tolerant grape cultivars can currently be grown sustainably in the region. Yet, limited research has been conducted to evaluate the yield potential, fruit quality characteristics, and vine growth and development of PD-tolerant/-resistant hybrid bunch grape cultivars in the southeast. An experimental vineyard was established at the Sand Mountain Research and Extension Center, Crossville, AL, in 2008 with a main objective to evaluate the vegetative characteristics and cropping potential of ten PD-tolerant hybrid bunch grape cultivars. The experiment was a random complete block design with four replications. Studied PD-tolerant American and French-American hybrid bunch grape cultivars included 'Black Spanish', 'Blanc du Bois', 'Champanel', 'Conquistador', 'Cynthiana', 'Favorite', 'Lake Emerald', 'Seyval Blanc', 'Seyval Blanc' grafted on 'Couderc 3309' rootstock ('Seyval Blanc'/3309C), 'Stover', and 'Villard Blanc'. Based on 2011-2017 results for cumulative yield per vine, the most productive cultivars in our environment were 'Favorite' and 'Villard Blanc' (yielding 96.3 and 90.0 kg vine(-1) cumulative yield, respectively), while 'Conquistador' was the least productive, with 32.4 kg vine(-1) cumulative yield. 'Blanc du Bois' also produced high yields during the last three seasons. 'Villard Blanc' had the largest fruit clusters throughout the study period, while 'Champanel' consistently produced the largest berries, followed by 'Blanc du Bois' and 'Villard Blanc'. Based on their overall performance 'Villard Blanc', 'Black Spanish', and 'Favorite' are considered suitable for sustainable commercial grape production in Alabama and the southeastern USA.					; Coneva, Elina/A-5474-2008	Svyantek, Andrej/0000-0001-9444-1250; 													0567-7572	2406-6168	978-94-62612-45-7				2019	1248						561	566		10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1248.75	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1248.75													WOS:000711212400075

The study encompassed the stream La Piedra and the floodplain lake Arenosa. The functional organization of the assemblages was studied through the analysis of the Siluriformes species distributions within the morpho-space and the relation between morphological divergences and the coexistence patterns between species. The Siluriformes were more closely positioned than randomly expected within the morpho-space in the stream during August 2014 and in the lake during August 2015, whereas the morpho-space was smaller than expected in the lake during May 2015. Likewise, morphologically close species segregated spatially within the stream during July 2014, whereas they aggregated in the lake during August 2014. Altogether, these results suggest that the assembly of Siluriformes in the Arauca floodplain, as well as the strength of biotic and abiotic factors on the organization processes, can vary as a result of seasonal fluctuations in the water level and as a function of the habitat type.

J	Fowler, KD; Shabaga, B; Brownlee, K; Fayek, M				Fowler, Kent D.; Shabaga, Brandi; Brownlee, Kevin; Fayek, Mostafa			Identifying precontact ceramic resource areas in the boreal forest of northern Manitoba, Canada	NORTH AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGIST												The objective of this study is to better understand how people gained resources to make Middle and Late Woodland pottery from Sipiwesk Lake in northcentral Manitoba. To meet this objective, we conducted petrographic analyses of sediments from Sipiwesk Lake, archaeological sherds from sites around the lake, material from outwashes, fired experimental tiles, and sherds from archaeological sites across the boreal forest ecozone and the prairie ecozone in the south-central and south-western regions of the province. Specimens from each sample were examined using optical petrography, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. Nine distinct fabrics (fired pastes) were identified by correlating the results of these analytical techniques. Each fabric can be considered a "paste recipe" that has local, regional, or pan-regional distributions. Local and regional distribution patterns redefine what "local" production means for mobile hunter-gather communities when the distances people travel for regular and routine seasonal activities are considered. This new model challenges exchange as an explanation for the spatial distribution of pottery. Expanding the range of exploitable distance thresholds for resource acquisition is alone enough to explain why the same pottery compositions would be found over vast areas incorporating one or more river systems. We further suggest that pan-regional recipes resulted from similar practices that served to add, remove, and/or alter the properties of nonplastics in clays. Such practices could potentially frustrate pottery provenience analysis, and we urge further research on the production of experimental pastes and the application of geochemical analyses to precontact Manitoba pottery.

For this purpose, monthly measurements were made at five stations from the source to the downstream and water samples were taken. During the monitoring period, water temperature 5.0-25.2 degrees C; electrical conductivity 216-359 pS/cm; total dissolved solids 147-244 mg/L; dissolved oxygen 8.67-13.36 mg/L and pH were measured in range of 7.08-8.76. Suspended solid 2-138 mg/L; turbidity 0.92-96.70 NTU; total alkalinity 102-200 mg/L; chloride 0.71-5.02 mg/L; ammonium nitrogen 0.007-0.400 mg/L; nitrite nitrogen 0.003-0.060 mg/L; nitrate nitrogen 0.12-1.19 mg/L; dissolved reactive phosphorus 0.007-0.033 mg/L; silica 5-23 mg/L; sulphate 8-33 mg/L and chemical oxygen demand were determined betwen 0.63-9.18 mg/L. Kahta Stream with slightly alkaline character, in terms of the parameters monitored, it is determined that the Surface Water Quality Regulation has the characteristics of Class I (high quality water) according to the Environmental Quality Standards. With this characteristic, it has been determined that Kahta Stream has a high potential to be used for drinking water supply, it can be used for re-use, trout farming, animal production and other farm needs. In addition, when the temporal relationship of variables was analyzed statistically, a significant difference was found among all variables except SiO2 (p <0.05). This result shows that the variables are affected by seasonal changes.

For this purpose, metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Ni, Zn, Cr, Pb, Cd, As and B) in treated effluent and muscle, gill and liver tissues of fish were examined seasonally. It was found that treated effluent was suitable for irrigation and partially available for aquaculture, and the concentrations in fish tissues were over standard values. The values in liver and gill were higher than muscles. The TF (transfer factor) values of all metals examined were observed as >1 in the three tissues and the metals caused bioaccumulation. Concentrations in muscles were found to be 10 to 1000 times higher than in water. Size order of TF and BCF (bio-concentration factor) values in eatable muscle tissue were the same and it was Zn>Fe>Pb>Cu>Ni>Cd>As>Cr>Mn>B. Concentration differences among the tissues for As, Cd, Pb, Ni and B were not significant (P>0.05). Because the correlations between Cd, Mn, Pb and Cu concentrations in tissues and treated effluent were found to be statistically significant, the metals caused bioaccumulation because of treated effluent. HQ (hazard quotient) and BCF values of Pb in muscle had carcinogenic risk levels.																			1230-1485	2083-5906					2019	28	6					4221	4238		10.15244/pjoes/96265	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/96265													WOS:000489645100018

The site is located on Port property within the secured area of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, in a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)-managed mitigation area, and within the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 100-year floodplain. The site remedy includes placing 56,000 cubic yards of carbon-amended sand cap throughout the 3-acre manmade lake to return it to its native wetland condition. This remedial action was selected through a net environmental benefit approach that considered the goals of multiple agencies and stakeholders. Considerations included compliance with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration rules for runway protection zones, reduction of aircraft navigation dangers from bird strikes, limitation of disturbance to surrounding USACE-managed mitigation areas, and water quality improvements to downstream Miller Creek, a salmon-bearing stream with local government and community interest. The collaborative remedial design effort included: remedy selection based on consideration of benefits and impacts to the surrounding ecosystem and airport; strategic coordination with local, state, and federal agencies regarding these short-and long-term impacts; and design incorporation of hydrogeologic groundwater flow and engineering floodplain analyses.																					978-0-7844-8262-9				2019							33	43																WOS:000566253600004

The model has two critical temperatures: T-1*-the maximum density water temperature T-cr = 4 degrees C and T-2*-the lake water surface asymptotic temperature in warm seasons. Although the model depends on four parameters, its solution and properties are effectively determined by only two dimensionless parameters: the constant temperature gradient. and the nonlinearity parameter v. The proposed thermodepth model is applicable to the interpretation of the vertical thermal regime of Lake Tapeliai by comparing the results of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. Within the limits of our model, the position of the thermocline can be determined theoretically, i.e., the model parameters allow for expressing the thermocline position. A great match has been obtained between experimental data and theoretical dependencies.					; JUKNA, Arturas/AAQ-4931-2021; JUKNA, Arturas/HZM-4003-2023	Vasiliauskiene, Vaida/0000-0003-0654-4490; Daunaraviciene, Asta/0000-0002-2981-9437; JUKNA, Arturas/0000-0001-5418-7526; Grigaliunaite-Vonseviciene, Grazina/0000-0002-4419-0569													1230-1485	2083-5906					2019	28	4					2765	2772		10.15244/pjoes/93924	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/93924													WOS:000467051900023

Satellite-based optical images and radar altimetertogether have provided significant advances in monitoring inland water bodies like lakes and reservoirs, and asses its water storage capacity. Optical imageries are usually good for identifying the extent of lakes with a certain margin of error, whereas Satellite radar altimetry is helpful in monitoring temporal variations in water surface heights. This study focuses on the method used to monitor MancharLake's surface area along with its volume. Time series altimetry data provided by European satellite Sentinel 3and optical data of Landsat 8 (30m spatial resolution) were used to calculate area, while temporal analysis wasperformed to generate lake boundaries usingNormalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The lake volume was estimated by using water level variation from altimetry and surface area. Further, a relationship between Rating curves and volume was developed in order to calculate water flow at different outlets of Manchar Lake.																			2153-6996		978-1-5386-9154-0				2019							6911	6914		10.1109/igarss.2019.8900476	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/igarss.2019.8900476													WOS:000519270606120

Economic Feasibility Of Weather Modification Technology Application (GBG Towers) On Hydropower Larona River	ADVANCED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY IN ENGINEERING PHYSICS	AIP Conference Proceedings				2nd Engineering Physics International Conference (EPIC)	OCT 31-NOV 02, 2018	Inst Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Dept Engn Phys, Surabaya, INDONESIA		Inst Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Dept Engn Phys			Weather Modification Process to increase the amount of rainfall can be done continuously if weather conditions are favorable and can be used to maintain the lake water level especially during the dry season. By keeping the lake water level with Weather Modification Technology the environmental balance between supply and demand will be maintained. Towuti Lake located on the upper of the Larona River is the main water supply for 3 Hydropower, therefore optimizing the water resources in the Larona Basin as a whole is necessary to reduce production costs. The reduced supply of electricity from the 3 hydropower will certainly affect the disruption of nickel production and electrical energy sources for the community. This feasibility evaluation aims to calculate the losses if not implemented Weather Modification Technology (TMC), especially the use of ground clouds in the form of Tower Ground Based Generator (GBG). The influential parameters to calculate this evaluation include the required production capacity, the cost of nickel per pound production, the nickel price, the production cost of each power plant is Hydropower Plant, Diesel Power Plant, Steam Power Plant and MBDG, so that the losses for each plant can be compared with the unavailability of water. In particular, this feasibility evaluation aims to calculate the economic value of the application of Weather Modification Technology (GBG Towers) in all of the hydropower located along the Larona River with Towuti Lake condition only has a minimum elevation of 317,45 meters above sea level, where there is a rather long drought. The results of data collection and analysis show that the average operation of water from the lake to the hydropower is 130.1 m3/sec, whereas if the dry season is only 100 m3/sec, therefore the additional amount of TMC activity water required is approximately 30 m3/sec with total volume of water equal to 946.118,37 m3. In addition, the water can generate 40 MWh of electrical energy and if calculated on the basis of nickel and other generating costs, the savings derived from nickel loss of $3.549.915,92/month and other plant operating costs of $7.583.342,44/month, the total of both costs $11.133.258,36/month. The conclusion of the total cost and some parameters above when compared with TMC cost of $122.685/month, the result of the economic analysis of the ratio of costs incurred for TMC financing compared to using thermal with fuel consumption without TMC is $122.685/$11.133.258,36 or 1/90,75. The advantage of using TMC that only cost $122.685/month can save fuel costs by $11.133.258,36/month.					; Nasution, Aulia/P-2590-2017	Nasution, Aulia M.

The acoustic propagation in underwater is typically governed by physical properties of the underwater channel, such as temperature, pressure, and salinity. The seasonal fluctuations in the physical properties of the tropical region manifest as thermal stratification. The random thermal stratification has a significant impact on the Sound Speed Profile (SSP), thereby distorting the received echoes from the surface and the bottom. The site-specific behavior in the tropical region makes it an interesting research problem to investigate the correlation of the surface parameters like temperature with the surface and bottom reflection due to variations in the SSP. In this work, we attempt to present underwater channel characteristics of the tropical freshwater lake system at Khadakwasla (18.43 degrees N, 73.76 degrees E), located in the municipal limits of Pune city in India. The temperature gradient along the water column is computed using the one-dimensional Freshwater Lake Model (FLake) to derive the SSP using Medwin relation. The statistical analysis of the sound speed fluctuations resulted due to seasonal variation in the water temperature is presented using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Goodness-of-Fit test is used to find a close Probability Density Function (pdf) match for the surface and the bottom path impulse response. The results indicate a good match of the surface and bottom path impulse response with Weibull distribution with a high confidence level. Such characterization can facilitate the design of adaptive algorithms to minimize the underwater channel impact based on a precise estimate of the channel impulse response.

Tahar Stream is one of the important inflows of Keban Dam Lake that is the second largest dam lake of Turkey. Samplings were performed monthly at stations chosen in upper, middle and lower parts of the stream. A total of 41 diatom taxa all belonging to pennales were identified throughout the study. The genera Cymbella, Diatoma, Epithemia, Gomphonema, Navicula and Nitzschia were represented by more species than others. Cocconeis pediculus, Cymbella affinis, C. helvetica, Diatoma elongata, Fragilaria acus, Gomphonema intricatum, G. olivaceum, Navicula cryptotenella, N. radiosa, N. rhynchocephala, Nitzschia sigmoidea, Pseudostaurosira brevistriata and Ulnaria ulna were noticable diatoms with respect to frequency of occurrence and their abundance in epilithon. Variations in occurrence of diatom species and their abundance at stations were compared and discussed in relation to physical and chemical properties of stream water. The physicochemical values yielded that Tahar Stream has Class I Water Quality according to the Inland Water Quality Criteria. This finding is supported to some extent by the occurrence of certain clean water diatom species.

Thus, in many metropolises, cities have distinctive climatic characteristics and they cause local and regional climate changes. This climate differentiation between urban areas and rural areas with geographical similarity is called Urban Heat Island. As a result, changes in urban climate and new microclimatic properties and air pollution play a negative role on the health and comfort of people. The aim of this study is to show that the factors such as industrialization, population growth and migration in Mersin have created an urban heat island in the city. In this study, the city center population was selected as Silifke, which is the rural station to be compared in terms of urban heat island with Mersin, which has more than 500.000 inhabitants. The criteria of extreme elevation difference between the two measuring stations which do not affect the climatic parameters, such as the absence of a geographic shape such as lake or high peak were taken into consideration. The annual and seasonal trend analyzes of the 65-year temperature datasets of the General Directorate of Meteorology between 1951 and 2016 were carried out and Sen's Trend Education method was used to reveal the temperature differences. When the trends are analyzed on an annual basis, Mersin is 4,1 degrees C warmer than the comparative station Silifke at the minimum temperatures shown by the urban heat island.																					978-605-07-0714-4				2019							588	594		10.26650/PB/PS12.2019.002.058	http://dx.doi.org/10.26650/PB/PS12.2019.002.058													WOS:001300412000058

By means of developing an instrument which can gather the multi-spectral data of the waterbody, the method can be used for real-time monitoring the contamination of inland waters, such as cyanobacteria bloom and phytoplankton. The research is focused on the technology of high-resolution multi-spectral data extraction and the theory of contaminant inversion model. Four branches of light beams of simple spectrum are obtained with spectral filters and are recorded by four groups of lens and detectors respectively. The four interested wavelength is chosen as 565 nm, 620 nm, 660 nm, 750 nm, according to the typical reflection peaks and dips of the contamination with a spectral resolution of 15 nm. The optical design features a field of view of 25.2x19.3 degree with a 16mm focal lens. The camera's resolution is 1628x1236 with the pixel size of 4.4 microns that reaches the spatial resolution of 0.945 arc min. The multi-spectral image is obtained through out-door experiments by monitoring the inland lake-Dianchi at a distance of 5 kilometers. After data revision, we can identify the constituent of the underwater contaminant and explain the pollution situation of cyanobacteria bloom in a certain period quantitatively. The inversion and extraction accuracy can reach at least 85%. And the long-term observation can explore the seasonal pattern of cyanobacteria bloom outbreak.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-3447-3				2019	11337								UNSP 113370V	10.1117/12.2547283	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2547283													WOS:000526705900030
J	Moon, Y; Lee, HJ; Lee, H				Moon, Youngrong; Lee, Hong-Jong; Lee, Heejin			Environmental changes and ancient long-term wet field management schemes: A preliminary case study of the Daepyeongri site, locality 3-1-D, South Korea	HOLOCENE												Large-scale excavations between 2012 and 2015 at the Daepyeongri site on the floodplain of the River Geumgang have revealed the presence of an ancient complex settlement comprising houses, extensive agricultural fields, and pits that have been dated to between the Bronze Age and the early Three Kingdoms periods. The beginning and end of the occupation of this site and land-use patterns are assumed to have been associated with its natural environment. The pollen records presented in this study show that wet conditions continued throughout the time that this site was occupied, evidenced by the consistent appearance of Alnus, while there are nevertheless hints of some land reclamation from the Bronze Age onwards. More intensive agricultural activities that took place during this later period are evidenced by an increase in the abundance of NAP pollens related to cultivation including Gramineae, Cyperaceae, Bistorta, Compositae and Fagopyrum. At the end of the occupation period, an abrupt transition to wetter conditions is recognized while dry land condition had been prevalent for some time in other parts of the site. Microscopic examination of buried cultivated soils that evidence multiple phases of ancient field systems has enabled the identification of pedological traces of discrete cultivation patterns and shows that they changed over time. The recognition of micro-structures and associated features shows that seasonally flooded wetland was first utilized during the early phase (the Bronze Age), and that more intensified irrigation management was seen during the late phase (the time span encompassed by the proto-Kingdoms and Three Kingdoms periods). These data reveal evidence for intensive hydromorphic degradation and enable a robust recognition of settlement history and an enhanced understanding of the intensity of various land-use patterns, and landscape changes from both environmental and archaeological perspectives.					; Lee, Heejin/AAI-7457-2020	Lee, Heejin/0000-0003-0717-1155; Moon, Youngrong/0000-0002-5082-0061; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2018	28	12					1979	1991		10.1177/0959683618798114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683618798114													WOS:000450145600011

ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The traditional view of biogenic limitation in freshwater ecosystems considers phosphorus as the primary limiting element, but this concept has recently been challenged. There are a number of studies that suggest that photosynthetic indices may depend on the levels of nitrogen (especially, nitrate-nitrogen). To test the hypothesis about the possibility of nitrogen limitation in the lake ecosystem, the present study analysed the water in the littoral zone of a shallow model lake for the relationship between the content of phytoplankton pigments (chlorophyll a and carotenoids) and nitrate. The nitrate-nitrogen was selected because it is the most chemically stable nitrogen species. The study was conducted in a small lake with a pronounced autochthonous regime (as indicated by its small drainage ratio) during a vegetation season with contrasting hydrological conditions. The relationship with the nitrate concentration was not confirmed for chlorophyll a, but the levels of nitrate anion and carotenoids were shown to be related. Chlorophyll a, which is regarded as a metabolically active component of phytoplankton cells, shows a close correlation with air temperature. The corresponding prognostic regression models were created. The data on nominal availability of nitrate-nitrogen for primary production show possible nitrogen limitation on some of the observation dates. If the production potential represented by certain levels of nitrate is not realised by phytoplankton, it can be used by filamentous algae. The results of the study provide first steps toward prediction of one of the indicators of phytoplankton growth, the content of two main types of pigment (chlorophyll a and carotenoids)					Rizhinashvili, Alexandra/K-2042-2018														0003-4088	2100-000X				NOV 30	2018	54								38	10.1051/limn/2018029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2018029													WOS:000452290400001

The Titicaca lake is recognized by the Ramsar Convention as Wetland of International Importance. In the present work, 135 species comprised in 17 orders, 33 families and 83 genders have been registered. With regard to seasonality, 95 species are residents and 40 are from other latitudes, of which 17 species are Nearctic migrants, 10 migratory species come from the Austral Region, and 13 species make vertical migrations from The Peruvian Andes to the coastal region. For the time they spend in most environments, 81 species are terrestrial, 45 aquatic and 9 in flight. Therefore, the results obtained have determined that the species of resident birds spend all year in the Titicaca basin: the neartic migrants from September to March, the austral migratory birds between April and August and those that make altitudinal migrations to the coastal region, from May to August.

Scientific Principles of Biomonitoring of Lake Onego	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												Original scientific approaches to the assessment of spatial and temporal variability of biota of Lake Onego, which may be used as a basis for its biomonitoring, are proposed for the first time. Reliably differing natural phenological phases of the seasonal cycle of plankton of Lake Onego have been revealed. The terms, duration, and interannual variability of phases are the criteria of reaction of the planktonic system to climatic changes. A series of models for assessment of the functioning stability of the ecosystem was developed on the basis of the regression method of minimization of orthogonal distances. Biotic indexes elaborated on the basis of the benthos structure were used for zoning of the bottom of Lake Onego. Three zones-of anthropogenic impact, intensive development of amphipods, and effect of geochemical anomalies-are specified. The proposed approaches may be applied in monitoring the status of large lakes in the boreal zone.

Landscape-level Habitat Variables Influence Reproductive Output of Aechmophorus Grebes	WATERBIRDS												A quantitative investigation examining the effect of changes in wetland habitat on reproductive output of Western and Clark's grebes (Aechmophorus occidentalis and A. clarkii, respectively) was conducted. Earlier studies examined local factors influencing nest success. This study supplements earlier work by seeking to determine which landscape-level habitat elements best predict annual landscape-level reproductive output of grebes. Western and Clark's grebes were monitored during the breeding season from 14 September 1998 to 20 September 2010 at Eagle Lake, California, USA. Remotely-sensed images were used to develop habitat indices and quantify changes in wetland availability and quality. The effect of these indices, and lake level, on annual reproductive output was analyzed using an information theoretic approach. Indices of habitat availability (beta(i) = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.099-0.31) and habitat quality (beta(i) = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.012-0.45) best predicted and had a positive effect on annual reproductive output. Lake level had little direct predictive power but was highly correlated with the other habitat covariates (Pearson's r > 0.80), indicating its importance as an indirect predictor of reproductive output. Thresholds of habitat availability and habitat quality were found, below which steep declines in reproductive output were observed.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				SEP	2018	41	3					276	284		10.1675/063.041.0307	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.041.0307													WOS:000446234000006
J	Zhou, XY; Niu, ZP; Lei, WJ				Zhou, Xiangyang; Niu, Zhipan; Lei, Wenjuan			Estimation of Precipitation Evolution from Desert to Oasis Using Information Entropy Theory: A Case Study in Tarim Basin of Northwestern China	WATER												The cold-wet effect of oasis improves the extreme natural conditions of the desert areas significantly. However, the relationship between precipitation and the width of oasis is challenged by the shortage of observed data. In this study, the evolution of annual precipitation from desert to oasis was explored by the model establishment and simulation in Tarim Basin of northwestern China. The model was developed from the principle of maximum information entropy, and was calibrated by the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset with a high spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees from 1990 to 2010. The model performs well in describing the evolution of annual precipitation from the desert to oasis when the oasis is wide enough, and the R-2 is generally more than 0.90 and can be up to 0.99. However, it fails to simulate the seasonal precipitation evolution because of the non-convergence solved by nonlinear fitting and the unfixed upper boundary condition solved by the least square method. Through the simulation with the parameters obtained from the nonlinear fitting, the basic patterns, four stages of precipitation evolution with the oasis width increasing, are revealed at annual scale, and the current stages of these oases are also uncovered. Therefore, the establishment of the model and the simulated results provide a deeper insight from the perspective of informatics to understand the regional precipitation evolution of the desert-oasis system. These results are not only helpful in desertification prevention, but also helpful in fusing multisource data, especially in extreme drought desert areas.

Trait Response and Change in Genetic Variation upon Selection for Spike Number in Salina Wildrye	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Salinawildrye (Leymus salinus [M.E. Jones] A. Love) is a perennial cool-season grass that potentially could become an important restoration species in the Colorado Plateau. However, its seed production has never been commercially viable due to sparse heading. We compared a 4x ssp. salmonis population, Lakeside C-3, to an 8x ssp. salinus population, 9043501, for seed production-related traits and measured the response of 9043501 to 2 cycles of selection for increased spike number over a 4-yr period at Millville, Utah. Seed yield of Lakeside and 9043501 was similar (P > 0.10) in 2013, but seed yield of 9043501 was 81% greater (P < 0.10) than Lakeside in 2014 and 191% greater (P < 0.01) in 2015. Lakeside spike number was 99% greater (P < 0.0001) than 9043501 in 2013, but they were similar (P > 0.10) in 2014 and 2015. Seeds per spike of 9043501 were 71% (P < 0.05), 80% (P < 0.05), and 209% (P < 0.01) greater than Lakeside in 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. Selection in 9043501 increased (P < 0.05) spike number by 4.3 spikes per plant (19.8%) per cycle of selection in the first seed-production yr (2013), but no change was seen in 2014 or 2015 (P > 0.10). Selection did not change (P > 0.10) seeds per spike or individual seed mass. Consequently, seed yield increased (P < 0.05) 0.32 g per plant per cycle (36.8%) in 2013, with no increase (P > 0.10) in 2014 or 2015. Dry matter per plant across the 4 yr increased (P < 0.01) 10.3 g per plant per cycle (9.3%), and canopy height increased (P < 0.01) 3.9 cm per cycle (6.6%) in 2013. AFLP DNA primers detected a 1.7% loss of genetic variation per cycle, presumably due to a combination of selection and genetic drift, but no plant traits were diminished as a result.

The objectives were: 1) Evaluation of the population size of Lepus europaeus (European hare), 2) Verification of damages caused in agricultural production in three communities, 3) Determination of the appropriate method of capture to reduce and control the populations of European hares. We apply the linear transect method, used to determine the population size and the method of indirect observation of fingerprints, through olfactory stations, with fingerprints. We placed 160 stakes for loop traps in total for the communities under study, around which we placed 100 olfactory stations, and we also made Chacu de hares (capture with the participation of several people). Finally, we quantified the percentage of economic losses through on-site observations in 10 plots / community Based on the area consumed by hare of the total area / plot, we apply damage percentage and conduct interviews. Based on the loop and Chacu trap method, we compared the appropriate method of capture. The results were: estimate population of 1.2 ind/ha in Churo, 1.1 ind/ha in Karma and 2.4 ind/ha in Luquina Chico, while the abundance obtained in the olfactory seasons in 5 different crops was: 11.7 individuals in Luquina Chico, 10.8 individuals in Churo and 9.3 individuals in Karina. In the analysis of economic losses, it was found that: the greater the economic damage, the higher the cost (r = 0.67) between two variables evaluated in Churo (r = 0.64) in Karina and (r = 0.49) in Luquina Chico. Finally, we show that there is no difference between trap methods Lazo and Chacu (H-calc(0.05)=1.19; 1 gl; p=0.2000).

Natural and anthropogenic factors affect the water quality. Anthropogenic impact, solid domestic waste and wastewater have a negative impact on water quality and the state of the lake. Recently, the increase in the number of tourists affects the water quality and condition of the Issyk-Kul lake. However, according to the results of analyzes, the water of the Issyk-Kul basin is not exposed to significant pollution. The quality of the surface waters of the lake is satisfactory, but the concentrations of some parameters such as nitrites and ammonium nitrogen (NH4+ and NH2-) are relatively high in Balykchy Bay, and the content of the remaining parameters does not exceed the MPC. The volume of water in the lake is huge, so while the lake is completely coping with the dissolution of harmful substances to a safe level for organisms.

Reproductive biology and size structure of Lethrinops gossei (Teleostei:Cichlidae) in the demersal trawl fishery of the southeast arm of Lake Malawi, Malawi	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT					8th Great Lakes of the World (GLOW) Conference on Advancing the Ecosystem Approach - Good Governance for Adaptation and Rehabilitation	MAR 24-26, 2015	Mangochi, MALAWI					The reproductive biology and size structure was determined for Lethrinops gossei, one of the most abundant fish species contributing 26% of the catch in the demersal trawl fishery of the Southeast Arm of Lake Malawi. Breeding seasonality was analyzed on the basis of monthly variation of gonado-somatic index and gonadal appearance, while sexual maturity was determined by fitting the logistic model to the proportions of sexually mature individuals. Length frequency data were used to characterize size structure of the population and to derive a selection ogive for the species based on the currently used cod-end mesh size of 38mm in the fishery. Results suggest that even though mature individuals were encountered all year round, the main breeding events for L. gossei occur in March and September. It was also determined that the size at which 50% of female L. gossei reached maturity (L-50%) was 137mm total length, while 100% sexual maturity was reached at 170mm total length. The size at first maturity was 122mm total length, while the steepness parameter of the maturity ogive, () was 7mm. Distribution of sizes in the sample was roughly symmetric about a mean of 145mm total length, while the size at 50% selection was 120mm total length. These results are discussed in the context of their implications on the management of the demersal trawl fishery in the Southeast Arm currently dominated by L. gossei, given the misalignment of the closed season currently in October to December and the inadequacy of the cod-end mesh size of 38mm. The main conclusion of this study was that the current cod-end mesh size in the fishery is too small and should be adjusted to prevent growth overfishing. A proposal is made for a closed season for the trawl fishery from March to April.

The study highlights the usefulness of digital image processing when retrieving color data from the oceans, such as sedimentation. The resulting data proves to be relevant for the analyses of environmental care and ecological preservation in such coastal areas, which are known to be important due to their biodiversity but not as known regarding their associated sediment dynamics and concentration. Both spatial and temporal variability of sediments are analyzed in yearly scales. The results show significant season-driven differences in terms of concentration and direction of sediment plumes.

Gheorghe branch in the south-east, is an important hydrographic unit, hosting numerous of native plant and animal species, as well as several recreational navigation, fishing, and water tourism spots. The water quality of this area may be heavily affected by natural or local human-related factors as agricultural activities, fishery exploitation, navigation along the water courses etc. The present study aimed to identify factors or processes that set out the water quality of investigated lakes. Thereby, surface water samples from fifty-four sampling points were collected in July 2017 and analyzed for different common physico-chemical parameters (pH, DO, N-NO2-, N-NO3-, P-PO43-, EC, TDS, SO42-, turbidity, TSS, chl"a", SiO2, ORP etc.). Furthermore, on the basis of a limited number of punctual sampling stations, was measured the distribution of heavy metals in the surface water samples. The obtained results were related to standard water quality criteria to assess the current state of the surface water quality of explored lakes. Generally, the common water quality parameters results showed comparable mean values, without significant exceedances of regulatory criteria. Particularly, in some incidental cases were exceeded the value orientations imposed by environmental quality standards. It was noticed that few samples were significantly less saturated with oxygen, sporadically the nitrite levels meet the class I criteria, and the orthophosphates, infrequently, meet the class I and V criteria of the national standard. Other samples contained higher amounts of total suspended solids and higher turbidity levels. The heavy metal concentration generally agreed with the criteria of national water quality standard. The exceptions were represented by Ba and Ni that meet the class I standard, including Mn that meet the class I and II criteria. Taking into consideration the widely-known spatial-temporal variability of surface water quality, this evaluation suggested that the water quality is in a relatively good condition. The disturbances in seasonal concentrations of some physico-chemical parameters did not show detectable levels of potential concern and are probably due to local natural circumstances (climate variability, flow rate and hydrologic characteristics, surficial geology and substrate etc.). The water quality in the investigated perimeter is consistent with the freshwater environment under deltaic natural circumstances, probably, due to intense self-purification capacity.

Laminations were studied by analyzing scans of polished samples of shale. Spectral analysis of couplets showed harmonic elements with periods that are multiples of 11, indicating the seasonal nature of lamination and providing an opportunity for determining the sedimentation rate. The sedimentation rate is estimated at 0.15 mm per year and differs significantly from estimates obtained earlier. Perhaps not all couplets should be considered annual. The question of which layers should be considered as annual and which should not, remains open, and requires further study.

The aim of the present study thus is to investigate the role of conductivity and temperature on the relative and absolute abundance of B. gracilis in seasonal coastal pools in the Araucania region (38 degrees S, Chile). The results of correlation analysis revealed the presence of a significant inverse correlation between conductivity and relative abundance, whereas no significant correlations were found between conductivity and absolute abundance, between temperature and absolute abundance, and between temperature and relative abundance. These results agree partially with similar observations for mountain pools in the same region, but they would not agree with observations for calanoids of saline and subsaline inland waters in the northern and southern extremes of Chile. Considering this scenario, the species would show different populational responses to environmental stress in different situations, which phenomenon deserves to be studied more extensively and in more detail.

In order to understand the effects of environmental conditions on the spatial and temporal variability of the phytoplankton functional groups (FG) and the main 'characterizing taxa', sub-superficial water samples were collected from March 2012 to August 2013, a period distinguished by the continuous drop in reservoir volume due to rainfall shortage. Eighteen functional groups and 102 total phytoplankton taxa were found in the Castanhao reservoir during the study. No significant differences were observed relative to spatial variation of total phytoplankton composition throughout the reservoir (PERMANOVA, P>0.05), On the other hand, according to cluster analysis results, three temporal phases have been identified (Similarity Profile, P<0.05), based on 102 phytoplankton taxa. The 'characterizing taxa' was found using the Similarity Percentage procedure (cut-off 90%). being thus defined as those taxa that contributed the most to the similarity within each temporal phase. Nineteen 'characterizing taxa' described the Castanhao reservoir, with predominance of those typical of mixing and turbidity conditions. Cyanobacteria dominated through the three temporal phases. According to the redundancy analysis, nutrient availability and water transparency were found to influence the phytoplankton temporal dynamics. The phase I (rainy season) was most represented by Planktolyngbya minor/Pl. limnetica (FG=S1), which reached best performance under strongly decreased phosphate-P concentrations and low water transparency. In phase It (dry season), Pseudanabaena sp. 1 (FG=?) outcompeted other cyanobacteria probably due the increase in water transparency and decrease in ammonium-N. Finally, in phase III (rainy season) the decrease of water transparency triggered a recovery of shade-adapted cyanobacteria, but at this time mostly represented by Pseudanabaena limnetica (FG=SI). Phase III was also distinctive from the other ones by the highest Nitrate-N and phosphateP concentrations related to thermocline disruption, which favored an increase in total phytoplankton biomass recorded by the augment of green algae density (FGs=X1, J and F). We concluded that the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton composition was associated to environmental changes in Castanhao Reservoir from 2012 to 2013. which were driven by seasonal climate variation from region (rainy/dry seasons), as well as. by the reduction in reservoir volume that resulted in the disruption of the thermocline, water mixing and an increase in inorganic P and N.

The physicochemical parameters in the water were monitored in situ using electronic equipment and sensors in two seasons of the year (rains and low water) of 2017. The sediments were collected in three point and two seasons of the year. After, the quantification of heavy metals and pesticides in sediments was determined. The results showed the presence of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), iron (Fe) and mercury (Hg), found that the concentrations of these metals were higher values than the maximum permissible limits of the official Mexican standard NOM-127-SSA-1994. The reported chemical oxygen demand values indicate site contamination (24 to 87 mg/L OD). Likewise, pH, electrical conductivity, temperature and dissolved oxygen values were determined, finding significant differences in the sampling seasons [4]. Finally, the pesticides organochlorines (endosulfan, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor) and organophosphorus (triadinefin, parathion, malathion) were not detected in sediment, even though these pesticides were employed by the populations near the study site, for the cultivation of corn, tomato and squash (4). Currently, techniques are established for the identification of microorganisms present in the sediments of the study sites within lakes of Montebello, Mexico.																			0188-4999						2018	34						99	104																WOS:000437423400018

This subsidence filled by water made the local water cycle become more complicated and severe geological hazards easy to occur. Oxygen-stable isotope, playing an important role in the study on water-cycle mechanism, is a substantial way to track different sources of water in nature. In this study, we took samples from different water bodies of soil water, the surface waters (river, lake and collapse pit) and the groundwater (well water) seasonally in a year. The analyses of delta D and delta O-18 were further conducted to trace the transforming relationships between these water bodies. The findings are as follows: (i) precipitation is the main charge source of soil water, along with significant evaporation processes; (ii) with soil depth increasing, delta D and delta O-18 of soil water showed a trend like that first decreasing to a certain value and then stabilizing and finally increasing to the bottom of soil profile; (iii) when the reclamation soil experienced longer time, the values of soil water delta D and delta O-18 increased in the whole profile, and this character was more obvious in deeper layers than in shallower and in surface layers; (iv) indicated from the isotopic characters of different water bodies and precipitation that precipitation was the main source of recharge of collapse pit water, and the infiltrated soil water and ground water experienced mixing with river water and precipitation by the water pathways conducted through the entire Cenozoic coal seam by mining.

Also the results of validation of the modified version in accordance with the parameters of lake part of Gorky water reservoir are provided. The modification caused changing the procedure of input data assignment, ensured the possibility of using the results from field measurements as starting profiles, led to the greater consideration of wind influence on mixing and allowed to reproduce general forms of distribution more accurately. The data from the experimental sites of Gorky water reservoir in combination with the files of global reanalysis and the data of hydrometeorological station were used for validation. Measurements of the vertical temperature profiles were carried out with freely sinking CTD-probe, which recorded the temperature values several times per second. Time and temperature dependences in control points, comparison of the forms of the profiles and standard deviation were analyzed to assess the results of numerical modeling. Numerical simulation with the modified model gave results which were in good agreement with the real seasonal variations of thermal regime in lake part of Gorky water reservoir. The best quantitative and qualitative agreement was obtained for the thermal regimes with strong mixing: the results of the forecasting reproduced the forms of distribution and the values of temperature extremely accurately. The results for the ones with strong stratification demonstrated less accuracy in the values of temperature in control points, particularly near the surface, but all specificities of the forms of vertical temperature distribution were correctly reproduced.

In this aquatic ecosystem, the lakes have different abiotic and biotic components', one of the biotic components are the microbial communities, which can play an important role in the different biogeochemical processes, and also used as bioindicators of the quality of the water(28). :However for our knowledge there are no scientific reports that reveal the diversity and abundance of prokaryotic communities (bacteria and archaea) associated with the sediments of the Montebello lakes. For this reason, the sediments were collected in three points from "Esmeralda" and "Encantada" lakes in two seasons of the year (2017). The samples were characterized physic-chemically and the protocols combine the application of mechanical (sterile sand and vortex), chemical and enzymatic (lysozyme) lysis methods for extraction of total DNA from sediments of lakes followed by its quantification and purity assessment using the nanospectrophotometer(1,9). he extracted DNA was used to successfully amplify 168 rRNA region. The method of enzymatic lysis is simple, rapid and allowed to obtain an appropriate DNA quality for future metagenomic studies of diversity and exploration of functional genes in sediments of lakes of Montebello, Mexico.																			0188-4999						2018	34						91	97																WOS:000437423400017

It indicates some traditional and potential uses of insects for direct human consumption and the opportunities for and constraints to farming them for food and feed. The concept of sustainable diets, with biodiversity and at its core, has recently received renewed attention as the world struggles with many natural and man-made disasters. Sustainable diets are those diets with low environmental impacts which contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy; while optimizing natural and human resources [222]. Edible insects have always been a part of human diets. Although the majority of consumed insects are gathered in forest habitats, mass-rearing systems are being developed in many countries. Insects offer a significant opportunity to merge traditional knowledge and modern science to improve human food security worldwide. However, the urbanization has led to new human bahaviour that is far from natural resources and distant to the wild environment. Additionally, in some societies there is a degree of distaste for inscts consumption that further developed a standstill of the grasshopers in the Nile vally (Amar, 2003). Although the majority of edible insects are gathered from forest habitats, innovation in mass-rearing systems has begun in many countries. Insects offer a significant opportunity to merge traditional knowledge and modern science in both developed and developing countries. Edible insects as food fit comfortably within this environmentally sound scenario and, by extension, ought to be considered prime candidates as both food staples and supplements, as well as more generally for their role in sustainable diets. Sustainability of food and agriculture activities upon which 2.4 billion people depend for livelihoods was considered a key driver in the transition towards a green economy, due to its dual positive impact on ecosystem services and poverty alleviation [222, 229]. Recent studies confirm that the insects are potentially an important energy efficient source of protein for humans, either through a direct consumption or as food supplements for stock. The high protein content is an indication that the insects can be of value in man and animal ration and can eventually replace higher animal protein usually absent in the diet of rural dwellers in developing countries [87]. The protein content varies by species of insects, but generally is of a good quality and high digestibility [48]. Analyses showed that in egg, larva, pupa and adult stages, the raw protein content is generally 15-81% / dry basis. With a daily growing world population, there are now more than 3.7 billion people suffering from malnutrition, mainly due to lack of protein and energy from food. Associated with the declining availability of land, water and energy resources per capita [35], we need to conserve and manage these resources to produce more food. Animal husbandry competes for these vital resources, as the land is occupied by the production of feed and cannot be used to produce food for humans [18]. Livestock production is very expensive because it requires a large input of water, grain and fodder as well as human effort and energy from fossil resources [35]. Utilization of insects as a protein source could benefit insect conservation through habitat protection [18]. Insects are essential agents feeding on organic matter in nature, and they efficiently exploit all organic sources. It is also important that insects are able to recycle organic waste and provide nutrients for farm animals [1, 179, 191]. Hence, insects could be used as efficient biotransformers to convert abundant, low cost organic wastes into animal biomass rich in proteins and suitable for use in animal nutrition. In a world as it is today, insects can contribute to human nutrition. Raising insects using waste biomass is already being implemented and managed today, with minimal infrastructure. Furthermore, insect culture requires little areas. Many of the edible insect species do not compete with human beings for food resources. The energetic cost of collecting edible insects is lower than that for vertebrates. Hence, insects may efficiently provide the necessary energy for the vital functions of our organism. Some species of edible insects have mostly the polyunsaturated fat type, as they feed on vegetables with largely unsaturated fats [1]. Mostly, the fat content of edible insects is between 10-50%. The fat content of insects depends on many factors such as species, reproductive stages, season, age (life stage), or sex, habitat and diet. For example, the fat content is higher in the larva and pupa stages; at the adult stage, the fat content is relatively lower. Female insects contain more fat than male insects. As a general statement it could be said that insects are not inferior to other sources of protein such as fish, chicken or beef. Insects can partly replace the increasingly expensive protein ingredients of compound feeds in the livestock, poultry and aquaculture industries. Grains now used as livestock feed, which often comprise half the cost of meat production, could then be used for human consumption [182]. In 2011, combined world feed production was estimated at 870 million tonnes, with revenue from global commercial feed manufacturing generating approximately US$350 billion globally. FAO estimates that production will have to increase by 70 percent to be able to feed the world in 2050, with meat outputs (poultry, pork and beef) expected to double [19]. A major constraint to further development are the prohibitive costs of feed, including meat meal, fishmeal and soybean meal, which represent 60-70 percent of production costs. Another problem is manure disposal, which is becoming a serious environmental problem; large amounts of manure to be stockpiled in open-air, swarming with flies and potential human health hazards. It is striking to realize that the agricultural sector is the leading cause of human-induced climate change. Roughly one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions are due to agriculture, if we include the carbon dioxide emissions from deforestation (mainly to clear land for farming and pasture), energy use in agriculture (including the production of chemical fertilizers), methane released by ruminant livestock and rice paddies, and nitrous oxide released by the heavy use of nitrogen fertilizers. We will need new technologies, and new patterns of food consumption, based on healthier and more sustainable diets [20]. There is a wealth of traditional and cultural knowledge on the uses of edible insects as food in tropical countries, yet production is largely concentrated in household and small-scale operations. In temperate countries, processing technology is virtually nonexistent because edible insects are not recognized food and feed sources. If insects are to become a useful and profitable raw material in the food and feed industries, large quantities of quality insects will need to be produced on a continuous basis. This requires both introducing new farming and processing methods, which remains a challenge for the development of the sector. However, major requirements are rearing practices in tropical countries should employ local species because they pose virtually no risk to the environment, there is no need for climate control, and such local species are likely to be more culturally accepted. Selection criteria should involve ease of rearing, taste, colour and whether they can be used as feed. In temperate zones, cosmopolitan species like the house cricket (Acheta domesticus) should be used, or those that do not pose environmental risks. Species destined for mass production, moreover should possess certain characteristics, including a high intrinsic rate of increase; a short development cycle; high survival of immatures and high oviposition rate; a high potential of biomass increase per day (i.e. weight gain per day); a high conversion rate (kg biomass gain per kg feedstock); the ability to live in high densities (kg biomass per m(2)); and low vulnerability to disease (high resistance). Good candidates were considered to be the black soldier fly (Hermetia illuscens) for feed and the yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) for both food and feed [1]. Additionally, insect animal feed developed from manure and related organic waste streams raises bacteriological, mycological and toxicological concerns. The polarity of views surrounding the practice of entomophagy requires tailor-made communication approaches. In parts of the world where entomophagy is well established, such as the tropics, communication strategies need to promote and preserve edible insects as valuable sources of nutrition in order to counter the growing westernization of diets. In areas where food security is fragile, edible insects need to be promoted as key foods and feeds for nutritional, cultural and economic reasons. However, Western societies still largely averse to the practice of eating insects will require tailored strategies that address the disgust factor and break down common myths surrounding the practice. In general, education is the key instrument for creating public awareness of the potential roles of insects and in influencing consumer choices towards a more balanced and favourable outlook on insects as food and feed. Research on the contribution of edible insects to nutrition and economy, on insect species' biology and ecology has to be implemented in projects on sustainable agriculture/food. Additionally, addressing the entomophagy disgust factor in Western societies might depend largely on the ability to involve the entire educational community. The past decade, however, has seen a slow but steady rise in food insects in formal education. As of the end of 2011, 46 percent of the universities in the United States - the main food and agricultural universities in the country - had at least one course in their curricula that featured food insects. In the Netherlands, the Laboratory of Entomology at Wageningen University offers "insects and society" courses including entomophagy. The Laboratory has an outstanding reputation in multitrophic interactions, biological control, malaria vector research and entomophagy, and draws worldwide attention to the issue of entomophagy. The objective is to explore the potential sustainable production of edible insects and insect-derived products, particularly proteins, as a reliable and high-quality food source with a lower negative environmental impact than conventional meat production. Governmental bodies have important roles to play in promoting insects as food and feed. In particular, the development of this new sector as a viable (and environmentally friendly) alternative to the conventional food and feed. Experts from international agencies, scientific institutions and private-sector stakeholders, together with staff from relevant FAO sectors created webportal on edible insects since 2010. It provides basic information on the use and potential of edible insects as well as relevant weblinks, such as to the proceedings of the conferences, information on the Expert Consultation Meetings and other relevant technical information, videos and media coverage. The address of the webportal is www.fao.org/forestry/edibleinsects. In developed countries, insect rering occurs mainly on family-operated farms. Presently, there are only a few large-scale industrial plans that rear insects. The most common insects that were collected or reared within Europe are: Acheta domesticus, Bombyx mori, Galleria mellonella, Gryllus assimillis, Hermetia illucens, Locusta migratoria, Musca domestica, Schistocerca gregaria, T. molitor and Zophobas atratus [225]. The H. illucens reperesent the species of good rearing potential because it substantially reduce biowaste and house fly breeding and additionally can be used as animal food [226]. Except this invasive species, few native species as grass hopers, crickets, and mealworms, are significant source of proteins. A number of species in Serbia are highly abundant and pose a molesting problem. This is a case with flood water mosquitoes, insects of Chironomidae family and house flies. Resarch on their mass production as potential food source for house pets, animals or as a part of organic fertilazers could support a small scale of organic farming production in rural regions. Additionally, it should not be forgotten that some of the species have important impact in waste decomposition, hence create additional value to the family-operated farms. Insect rearing is easy, does not require much of technical knowledge nor high investments, therefore accessable to a majority of rural inhabitants of a law income. The production and consumption of insects should also be analysed from the viewpoint of their potential impact on health and biodiversity and the potential environmental hazards associated with insect production and release, including the accidental release of insect species not indigenous to the area of production. People, especially in areas where insects were not consumed for a long time, prefer incorporating insects into the food in a way they are not visible, so they accept only the idea that the insects have a nutritional value. This shows that people especially in North America and Europe can eat insects if they do not know what they are eating.These factors suggest that insect transformation will facilitate its consumption in the future. In practice, dried insects may be crushed or pulverized, and raw or boiled insects ground or mashed, making their insect form unrecognizable [9]. Much work still needs to be done and many issues taken into account when elaborating normative frameworks and adjusting for insect-inclusive food laws. At the Expert FAO Meeting in 2012, therefore, a working group developed the following proposals for elaborating regulatory frameworks [59]. Private and public standards may establish the basis of harmonized regulatory practices on the use of insects as food and feed. Legal frameworks should be developed to consolidate and set binding provisions and to ensure the implementation and enforcement of such provisions throughout the sector. It is necessary to promote the establishment of appropriate international and national standards and legal frameworks to facilitate the use of insects as food and feed and the development and formalization of the sector. It is also very important to take into consideration the potential effects of insect production and rearing on the environment, and the environmental and trade implications of the international movement of insects. Develop a clear and comprehensive legal framework at the (inter-) national level that can pave the way for production and trade in insect products for food and feed internationally. In the Western world, consumer acceptability will be determined, in large part, by pricing, perceived environmental benefits, and the development by the catering industry of tasty insect-derived protein products. Preservation and processing techniques are needed to increase shelf life, conserve quality and increase the acceptability of insect food products; processing procedures are also needed to transform insects into protein meal for animal/fish feedstock and for the extraction of insect proteins to be used as ingredients in the food industry. Considering the immense quantities of insect biomass needed to replace current protein-rich ingradients such as meal and oil from fish and soybeans, automated massrearing facilities that produce stable, reliable and safe products need to be developed. The challenge for this new industry will be to ensure the cost-effective, reliable production of an insect biomass of high and consistent quality. Regulatory frameworks need to be developed. The close collaboration of government, industry and academia will be essential for success.

A central population of Pine in North Sumatra is located in the Tapanuli region to south of Lake Toba. Junghuhn discovered the species in the mountains range of Sipirok. He provisionally named the species as Pinus sumatrana. The article presents a detail analysis of approaches to climate factors, considers rainfall, air temperature, humidity, stemflow, throughfall and Interception following calculation of regression to determine relationship between precipitation with stemflow and interception. Stemflow, it is highly significant with significance of difference between correlation coefficients and z normal distribution. Temperature and relative humidity are the important components in the climate. These components influence the evaporation process and rainfall in the catchment. Pinus merkusii has the big crown interception. Stemflow and Interception has an opposite relation. Increasing of interception capacity will decrease stemflow. This type of Pine also has rough bark however significant channels so that, it flows water even during the wet season and caused the stemflow in Pinus merkusii relatively bigger.

In practice, reservoir operators usually follow rule curves, which stipulate the actions that should be taken conditioned on the current state of the system. Through construction of the dam Modrac in 1964, the reservoir of the same name was formed. Its primary objectives were the provision of technological water for industries in the Tuzla region and mitigation of downstream floods as well as recreation and other purposes. The multi-purpose reservoir Modrac is currently a drinking water source for the municipality Tuzla. In order to better manage of the multi-purpose reservoir "Modrac", certain analyzes are presented in this paper. This paper presents an analysis of annual precipitation, mean annual inflows in the catchment area of the multi-purpose reservoir "Modrac" for the period 1967 - 2016. In this paper there are presented statistical datas on the maximum amount of precipitation for the dry season period (May to October) for different return periods, for different distribution curves, as well as the maximum amount of precipitation for the wet season (November to April) for different return periods for different curves distribution. This paper provides information on the movement of precipitation changes in the catchment area of multi-purpose reservoir "Modrac" for the period from 1967.- 2016.																			1840-4855	2233-0046					2018		18					31	40		10.7251/afts.2018.1018.031S	http://dx.doi.org/10.7251/afts.2018.1018.031S													WOS:000433980200004

The length composition, age, sex ratio and gonadosomatic index (GSI) of nigorobuna landed by gill-net during February and March from 2006 to 2008 were investigated to evaluate the regulation. The percentage of catches smaller than 170 mm in standard length decreased from 18.9% in 2006 to 2.8% in 2008. The catches were dominated by fish of age 1 and age 2, and females accounted for about 70% of the catches. Females with low GSI values were classified as male with low commercial value, and they accounted for about 30% of the catches in 2008. Delaying the fishing season would reduce the unreasonable catch.																			0021-5392	1349-998X					2018	84	3					369	376		10.2331/suisan.17-00023	http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/suisan.17-00023													WOS:000439132100007

WHITE-TAILED LAPWING (VANELLOCHETTUSIA LEUCURA) IN LAKE SYSTEMS OF SYRDARYA RIVER'S DELTA (CARTMA LAKE)	AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH												This article generalizes data of authors collected in course of birds count at Cartma lake, in period of 2014-2016. Distribution, quantity, ecology of white-tailed lapwing (Vanellochettusia leucura) is considered in details. White-tailed lapwing is a medium-sized wader; body structure largely resembles black-sided lapwing but the size is slightly lesser. At present time, on territory of Kazakhstan, the white-railed lapwing is nesting at wetland stations of middle and downstream (from border with Uzbekistan to North Aral sea), system of lakes in delta of Syr-Darya river, in the north part of Caspian sea. Quantity of white-tailed lawing on studied Cartma lake is determined in limits of 30-150 specimen; this is the result of season nature of countings, area of studied water body surface. A characteristic feature of this species is a peculiar voice, descriptively translated as "chetyre, chetyre" ("four, four" in Russian), increasing at approach to nesting sites. Analysis of special literature on ornithology of eastern site of Aral sea and lakes of Syr-Darya river delta showed that for two hundred years period, white-tailed lapwing mostly adheres to constant habitats. Nesting station is located in shore zone, at sandbars and isles,																			1804-7890						2018	8	1			3		246	248																WOS:000452964200067

However, no previous study was conducted on its biomagnification. This research is the first exploratory study that examined lead biomagnification in a food web of the lake. Water quality, aquatic communities, trophic levels and lead concentrations were analyzed during the dry and wet seasons. Lead concentrations were analyzed using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. Levels of lead in the water were 0.05 mg L-1 and 0.03 mg L-1 for dry and wet seasons, respectively. Lead concentrations increased in phytoplankton with 3.87 and 9.66 mg kg(-1) lead during wet and dry season, respectively. Furthermore, lead levels increased in zooplankton with 2.92 and 14.31 mg kg(-1) during wet and dry seasons, respectively. Infishes, the highest lead concentration in dry season was detected in Hypophthalmichthys nobilis with 0.38 mg kg(-1) while the highest during wet season was observed in Oreochromis niloticus with 0.67 mg kg(-1). Lead biomagnification was observed in this study in the following order: water < phytoplankton < zooplankton. However, this increasing trend did not continue up to fishes.

Assuming a bacterial carbon conversion efficiency of 31% and bacterial production of 2.56 mu g C L-1 h(-1) for the period from April to September, the bacterial carbon demand would correspond to 8.26 mu g C L-1 h(-1), which ought to be covered by primary production. For January to March and October to December, we calculated a mean bacterial carbon demand of 3.06 mu g C L-1 h(-1) and 3.48 mu g C L-1 h(-1) respectively. The balance calculations indicate that heterotrophic bacteria would consume not all of the photosynthetically reduced carbon. Despite a positive C-balance in the water column its worthwhile mentioning that benthic bacterial production needs to be considered before balance calculations are forwarded for this ecosystem. The abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) and the high ratios of bacterial to HNF abundance (B: HNF range: 2 x 10(3) to 9 x 10(3), mean: 5.4 x 10(3)) indicated a low bacterivorous impact by HNF. Calculated ingestion rates were 2.2-26.5 bacteria HNF(-1)h(-1) with a mean of 7.5 HNF(-1)h(-1). Grazing rates comprised between 0.3 and 20% of bacterial production, with a mean of 5%. Virus-to-bacteria ratio (VBR) ranged from 4 in July to 39 in February, with an average of 19. Viruses < 60 nm capsid diameter dominated over all seasons accounting for some 74% of the total, determined by transmission electron microscope (TEM). To estimate the virus induced control of bacterial production the number of lysed bacteria was obtained by dividing viral decay rates by the maximum burst size. On average 3.0 x 10(4) bacterial cells ml(-1) h(-1) had to be lysed to maintain the monitored viral production implying that viruses controlled on average 56% of the bacterial production, ranging from 42 to 88%.																			1573-4595	2543-005X	978-3-319-93270-5; 978-3-319-93268-2				2018	10						227	241		10.1007/978-3-319-93270-5_13	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-93270-5_13	10.1007/978-3-319-93270-5												WOS:000459447700013

However, the Sea has shrunk substantially over time and water quality has deteriorated considerably, mainly caused by agricultural and industrial pollutants, reduced inflow, and enhanced evaporation. Six functionally different spectral water indexes were selected and evaluated to determine their efficiency in estimating water surfaces during excessive growth of algae and outbreaks of green tide when water quality degraded significantly. The evaluation indicated that among the selected water indexes, the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) was most efficient in differentiating open water from surrounding non-water features, and the differentiation was least affected by water quality change. MNDWI was applied to each archived Landsat TM imagery of the Salton Sea area acquired between 1982 and 2012. The extracted water surfaces showed that the Sea experienced significant change over the 31-year period and entered an accelerated drying stage in 2005. The results also revealed the clear seasonal variations of water surface extent, which increases from September to January and decreases afterwards.					; Wang, Teng/HPF-9459-2023	Wu, Jindong/0000-0003-0460-1383; 													2380-8039		978-1-5386-6642-5				2018							119	123																WOS:000458838500026

J	Anteneh, W; Getahun, A; Dejen, E				Anteneh, Wassie; Getahun, Abebe; Dejen, Ehete			Spawning aggregation and segregation of Labeobarbus spp. (Pisces: Cyprinidae) in the Megech and Dirma River mouths, Lake Tana, Ethiopia	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												Spawning aggregation and segregation of Labeobarbus species congregating at the mouths of Megech and Dirma Rivers were studied using catch data collected from December 2003 to November 2004. Fish were collected monthly from November to June and twice in July. However, during the main rainy season (August to October 2004), samples were collected weekly at both river mouths. Polyfilament gillnets with mesh sizes: 6, 8, 10 and 12 cm were set overnight. A total of 4280 Labeobarbus specimens were collected. Six Labeobarbus species (L. intermedius, L. megastoma, L. tsanensis, L. truttiformis, L. brevicephalus and L. surkis) formed spawning aggregations in the river mouths during the peak of the rainy season (August to October). Although there was overlap of spawning aggregations between these six Labeobarbus species weekly catch data indicated temporal segregation among all species, except L. intermedius. Four species (L. intermedius, L. megastoma, L. truttiformis and L. tsanensis) were significantly higher in abundance at Megech River than at Dirma River during the peak aggregation months. Labeobarbus surkis, never reported in other previous studies, was found to aggregate at both river mouths. However, three species (L. acutirostris, L. macrophtalmus and L. platydorsus) formed spawning aggregation in other tributaries were rare in the present study. Closing commercial gillnet fishing in both river mouths during the peak aggregation months (August to October) is highly recommended to conserve the already declining endemic Labeobarbus species flock of Lake Tana. Dam constructions for irrigation in Megech River upstream will impede spawning migration of Labeobarbus species. (C) 2017 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

WATER QUALITY ANALYSIS OF DHUKESHWARI TEMPLE POND DEORI WITH REFERENCE TO CULTURAL EUTROPHICATION	INDO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES												In the present investigation an attempt was made for assessment of Monthly and Seasonal Variation in some physicochemical properties in freshwater ecosystem of Dhukeshwari Temple Pond Deori in Gondia district of Maharashtra in the year 2014-2015. Expanding urbanization in the catchments area with consequent increase in anthropogenic activities, culminating in the introduction of untreated domestic sewage and immersion of idols, offerings, commercial waste and other socio-cultural practices also contributed to nutrient enrichment of this pond. Result shows, Water Temperature (22.2 degrees C to 32.2 degrees C), pH (7.1 to 7.8.), Transparency (22 cm -37cm.), TDS (340 mg/l to 620 mg/l.), DO (3.5 mg/l -6.7 mg/l.), Free CO2(3.5 mg/l -7.1 mg/l.), Total Alkalinity (122 mg/l -195 mg/l.), Total Hardness (135 mg/l - 430 mg/l.), Ca (90 mg/l - 370 mg/l.), Mg (35 mg/l - 85 mg/l.), Chloride (between 42 mg/l - 99.5 mg/l.), BOD (14 mg/l 29.2 mg/l.), Sulphate (31.4 mg/l 66 mg/l.), Phosphate (19 mg/l 36.6 mg/l.), Nitrate (0.4 mg/l 3.65 mg/l.).

The Time of Origin and Genetic Diversity of Three Isolated Kokanee Populations in Southwest Alaska	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We examined the time of origin and genetic diversity of native kokanee, the nonanadromous ecotype of Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka, from three isolated lakes in the Katmai National Park and Preserve in southwest Alaska. These kokanee evolved independently from Sockeye Salmon when migration barriers arose, blocking ocean access. We used information about the relative age of each barrier to hypothesize the relative time of origin for kokanee in each lake. In addition, we used data from 13 microsatellite loci to test our time of origin hypotheses and assess genetic diversity of kokanee from these three lakes and proximate Sockeye Salmon populations. Coalescent-based estimates of the time of origin for kokanee in Jo-Jo Lake (170 years before present [ybp]) and Devil's Cove Lake (6,583 ybp) were consistent with the relative age of barriers isolating each lake. However, data from Dakavak Lake (1,379 ybp) suggested that the barrier was older than hypothesized. Indices of intrapopulation diversity were lower for kokanee than for Sockeye Salmon. Estimates for kokanee population divergence (R-ST; the F-ST analog for microsatellites) among the three lakes were consistent with time of origin estimates. Furthermore, the most recently isolated kokanee (Jo-Jo Lake population) were most closely related to neighboring Sockeye Salmon. Only the kokanee from Jo-Jo Lake exhibited a relatively low historical effective population size (N-e approximate to 107) and evidence of a genetic bottleneck. Taken together, the results of this study show that although rare, kokanee in Alaska are not ephemeral and can persist in isolation for hundreds of generations despite the colder temperatures and shorter growing season, that are thought to limit their sustainability in Alaska.					; Wenburg, John/Y-4373-2019	Wenburg, John/0000-0001-9831-1672; 													0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2017	146	6					1212	1222		10.1080/00028487.2017.1362472	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2017.1362472													WOS:000489683300011

An Implementation of a Database Management System for Real-Time Large-Lake Observations	MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL												Real-time environmental observations have typically been stored in relatively inaccessible flat text files. In this publication, we present an instance of a PostgreSQL database management system-to ingest real-time observations from four buoys in North America's western Lake Erie. Data are transmitted via a cellular data modem, initially archived as text data, and then ingested into the database for further analysis and retrieval. The database utilizes two tables with parallel structure to archive data in a consistent manner. We assign unique keys to instrumentation configurations as they change within and between monitoring seasons. Daily sets of data are linked to their configurations by key and thus are documented, allowing for efficient browsing of user desired data. In addition, we quality check data and archive the findings in a corresponding matrix. With assistance from server-side processing, we produce a web interface for the database. We hope the design of this database allows for relatively simple deployment in domains other than western Lake Erie.

J	Thompson, B				Thompson, Bill			Effects of Nesting Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) on Behaviour and Reproductive Rates in a Great Blue Heron (Ardea herodias) Colony in Ontario	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and Great Blue Herons (Ardea herodias) are known to occasionally nest in mixed colonies, even though the former is one of the primary predators of the latter. I observed the two species in four heron colonies near Lake Simcoe, Ontario during two field seasons to assess whether rates of heron chick mortality or nest abandonment were greater in a colony that supported a nesting pair of Bald Eagles than in three nearby single-species colonies. I assessed the effects of eagle presence on heron behaviour using heron movement rates, the number of heron sentries left in colonies during the nesting period, heron nest mortality rates, and the average number of successfully fledged herons per nest. There was no statistically significant difference in movement rate among the four colonies, proportion of birds remaining as sentries, nor nest mortality rates. However, nests in the mixed colony successfully fledged significantly more heron young per nest than did nests in the single-species colonies. The mixed colony was located in a wetland and open lake system that provided extensive foraging habitat and an abundance of the preferred fish prey species of both Great Blue Herons and Bald Eagles, thus reducing predation pressure on the herons.																			0008-3550					OCT-DEC	2017	131	4					369	371		10.22621/cfn.v131i4.1848	http://dx.doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v131i4.1848													WOS:000465153800012

The results showed that males have higher values than females, with statistically significant difference for the erythrocyte count, haemoglobin concentration, hematocrit and mean cell volume. These findings demonstrate that males have higher metabolic rate during this period, and that their blood physiology is influenced by the increased physical activity and very likely by the appropriate sex hormones.																			2224-4980					OCT	2017	7	4					727	730																WOS:000417183400013

Fluctuations of water temperature, water depth, Sechhi depth, pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, free CO2, SRP, SRS and NO3-N were studied in three different stations for six months. Water temperature, water depth and Secchi transparency ranged from 28.0 - 34.2 degrees C, 5.13 - 7.01 m, 0.39 - 0.80 m, respectively. The range of pH, conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved oxygen (DO), alkalinity, free CO2, SRP, SRS and NO3-N of water over dry to rainy period varied from 7.50 - 7.93, 422 - 650 mu S/cm, 86 - 212 mg/l, 7.31 - 7.9 mg/l, 1.0 - 4.3 meq/l, 3.8 - 6.5 mg/l, 4.02 - 5.04 mu g/l, 3.0 - 5.50 mg/l and 28.11 - 60.25 mu g/l, respectively. A total of 20 genera of phytoplankton were recorded which belonged to six classes, namely Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Cryptophyceae and Dinophyceae. From Cryptophyceae, two genera were recorded namely, Cryptomonas and Rhodomonas. Among the members of Cyanophyceae Lyngbya limnetica Lemm. and Raphidiopsis indica Singh were dominated during the dry to rainy period. Dinophyceae was represented by Peridinium cinctum (Muller) Ehrenberg. Because of a higher pH and low nutrient concentration, the studied water body could be characterized as blue-green dominated, alkaline and meso-eutrophic type.

Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the seasonal phytoplankton dynamics in two distinct streams located in an area of environmental protection in subtropical Brazil, and to identify the main drivers of community structure. Phytoplankton community and environmental variables were sampled on a monthly basis, between September 2012 and August 2013, in Apepu and Gualberto streams, located in Foz do Iguacu, Parana, Brazil. We verified that both streams presented a seasonal distinction regarding the precipitation levels. Regarding the others environmental variables (e.g., nutrients, light, temperature), a temporal similarity was observed in both streams. A high taxonomic diversity was recorded, including Bacillariophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Chloro-phyceae and Zygnematophyceae as the most representative groups. Low abundance, richness and diversity were recorded in Apepu and Gualberto streams, while high equitability was recorded in both streams due to the uniform distribution of the species. Low variability of phytoplankton was recorded with high temporal similarity between the two streams. This study shows that the factors determining phytoplankton diversity and dynamics in Apepu and Gualberto streams are related not only to hydrological and limnological conditions, but also to the local characteristics of the streams, such as low depth and small extension.

Pairing paleolimnological inference models with mechanistic water column models enhances assessment of lake water quality	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Reconciliation of paleolimnology inference models with hindcasts from mechanistic water column models aided the reconstruction of past relationships for total phosphorus/dissolved oxygen and acid neutralizing capacity/pH in highly polluted lake ecosystems in New York State. Pre-disturbance Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, NY, was shown to have experienced seasonal hypolimnetic anoxia even under oligotrophic (< 10 ug l(-1)) phosphorus levels. In the Adirondack Mountains of New York State the paired modeling confirmed that, while many lakes have the potential to eventually recover from acidification by atmospheric deposition, approximately 30% likely experienced naturally acidic conditions (pH < 6) prior to increases in industrial emissions. Comparison between the model results illuminated areas of individual model inadequacy, improved understanding of lake ecology, and increased confidence in the ability of predictive water column models to accurately develop restoration scenarios representing improved conditions. The work presented here is the first such comparison modeling for total phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, and acid neutralizing capacity. The technique remains to be more widely applied geographically and extended to less heavily stressed lake systems. Because a fossil inference and mechanistic hindcast should independently lead to similar results, comparison modeling is a potentially powerful tool for examining past interactions between ecosystem structure and ecosystem functioning.

Sealed and exposed to sunlight, these miniature ecosystems can sustain themselves for a decade or more. Unlike Winogradsky columns, ecosystem jars are optimized for protist, animal, and plant observations and experiments, and are not altered by addition of sulfur, carbon, or cellulose sources, more accurately representing natural ecosystems. Ecosystem jars can support a variety of inquiry-based experiments, including student-designed projects, from middle school to college levels. Students, with instructor assistance, formulate hypotheses, design experiments, observe and catalog organisms by microscopy, then record their data in tables and graphs and draw conclusions. Students present their data in a paper or poster format or as oral presentations to the class. Potential experiments include examining biotic changes over time, the effects of added pollutants or nutrients, biotic differences between watershed types, or seasonal changes in biota. These investigations not only provide students with cooperative learning, inquiry-based lab experiences, but also help them gain appreciation for the effects of pollution or nutrient runoff on ecosystems.																			0002-7685	1938-4211				AUG	2017	79	6					466	472		10.1525/abt.2017.79.6.466	http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/abt.2017.79.6.466													WOS:000408522200008

Present thermal regime of Lake Atomic (Semipalatinsk test site)	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												We present results of the first research into the thermal regime of the water column of man-made Lake Atomic (Semipalatinsk test site) performed in 2013-2015. The temperature data have shown a two-layer stratification of the water column. In the upper layer (0-30 m) there are significant yearly temperature variations caused by seasonal climatic changes and wind wave mixing. In the lower layer (30-80 m) there is a stable nonlinear temperature distribution. This lake can be classified as meromictic, whose upper layer consists of weakly mineralized "light" water and lower one, of highly mineralized "heavy" water. This stratification prevents seasonal mixing of waters of the entire column (from surface to bottom). (C) 2017, V.S. Sobolev IGM, Siberian Branch of the RAS. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to compare milk fatty acid profiles measured on Kouri cows and on high-yielding dairy cattle in Europe and elsewhere as reported by meta-analytical data (22 experimentations). Milk samples were collected from 14 Kouri dairy cows in dry season (March to June) and fatty acids (FA) were determined by gas chromatography. Overall, 32 FA have been identified. Kouri showed lower values (P < 0.001) in the sum of saturated FA (SFA, -10.9 pts), cis-9, cis-12 18:2 (-1.00 pt) (P < 0.01, higher values (P < 0.001) in the sum of monounsaturated FA (MUFA, +15.3 pts), C18:0) (+3.5 pts), cis-9, trans-11 C18:2-CLA (+1.00 pts), trans-11 18:1 (+1.4 pts) and (P < 0.01) in cis-9, C18:1 (+3.00 pts) acids. The differences between the milk FA profile of the Kouri cows and that obtained from meta-analytical data could be the possible consequence of the use of particular lake pastures by Kouri cows.					; , Hornick/AAV-1394-2020	Hornick, Jean-Luc/0000-0003-1831-1440; 													0049-4747	1573-7438				JUN	2017	49	5					915	921		10.1007/s11250-017-1272-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-017-1272-1								28397034					WOS:000401431800004

Modelling catch per unit effort of the Black Volta near the Bui dam in Ghana	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The chlorophyll a concentration and water level of the Black Volta near the Bui dam were studied in relation to fish production as measured by catch per unit effort (CPUE) between February 2011 and December 2012. The primary objective was to develop a simple linear regression model for predicting CPUE levels. The mean estimated CPUE for 2011 and 2012 was lower (6.23 kg canoe(-1) day(-1)) in the postwet season than in the dry season (10.86 kg canoe(-1) day(-1)) with a mean of 7.95 kg canoe(-1) day(-1). Hence, the dry season was the most important season for fish catches in the study area. Predictor variables that significantly explained CPUE levels were chlorophyll a (positive correlation) and water level (negative correlation) (P - 0.0002). The model was validated with independent data from the same Black Volta in 2011 and 2012. This model, CPUE = (0.062 x chlorophyll a) - (0.456 x water level) + 3.363, explained 91% CPUE variability. Independent validation indicated that the model had the potential to predict CPUE (as a measure of fish production) in the Black Volta near the Bui dam. Hence, the model is also a valuable tool to predict future trends in the CPUE levels of the Black Volta.

This study pertains to assessment of physico-Chemical characteristics of Nandhivaram lake for effective mangement of lakes. Water samples were collected during the Northeast monsoon season from the biggest lake Nandhivaram of Guduvanchery watershed in Kanchipuram district of Tamilnadu, India. The sampling and analytical methodologies were followed for the estimation of selected parameters as per 'Standard methods of water and wastewater analysis' (APHA et al. 1998). The NIST traceable standards are used for calibration of instruments before and after sample analysis for quality control check [6]. Water samples were collected from various locations of the lake. The water quality parameters such as pH, turbidity, conductivity, COD, BOD, Total Dissolved Solids, Phosphate, Nitrate and Chlorophyll-a were analyzed. The ranges of water quality parameters obtained are as follows. pH (6.71-7.04), Turbidity (2.4-3.3NTU), conductivity(565-660 mu s/m), COD (3.512.8mg/l), BOD(1.5-3.7mg/l), TDS(294-335mg/l), PO4(0.219-0.608mg/l), NO2(0.094-2.359mg/l), chlorophyll-a (3.14-3.93 mu g/l). The analysis revealed that the parameters pH, TDS, COD, BOD, conductivity levels are within the standard limits for surface water quality whereas Nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll-a were noticed exceeding the permissible level at many of the sampling locations. The phyto plankton is an important index of presence of high nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen, which are the factors responsible for eutrophication of the lake.

J	Jorgji, F; Kupe, L				Jorgji, Fiorentina; Kupe, Lirika			POTENTIAL OF TOURISM DEVELOPMENT TO PRESPA NATIONAL PARK	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOSYSTEMS AND ECOLOGY SCIENCE-IJEES												Research has shown that the Prespa Lakes basin's greatest tourism strengths lie in its nature and heritage and that it has a developing ecotourism product. Facilities to foster nature-based and heritage-based tourism exist but the area is suffering from a lack of profile and declining market interest, and the very important domestic market in each country is increasingly holidaying elsewhere. There have been many tourism-related support initiatives in the area in the past, but their sustainability is mostly questionable. There is a need for projects to be more strongly embedded in local institutions which take responsibility for continuing them. The accommodation base in Albania is weak, with some developments in community-based tourism. Solid waste issues undermine tourism potential in Albania especially. National Parks are the area's strongest tourism asset at present and sustainable tourism capacity is strongest within some of these organizations. Seasonality is a major challenge not only in Albania but in all three countries and products and events have not been developed to address this.

Phytoplankton primary productivity seasonality and changes in a small African lake, Lake Hora-Kilole, Ethiopia	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The seasonality of primary productivity by phytoplankton in relation to physico-chemical and biological variables was studied in Lake Hora-Kilole from August 2007 to May 2008. In 1989, the Mojo River was temporarily diverted to flow into the lake, which substantially changed its physico-chemical conditions and the composition of the phytoplankton. Primary productivity was controlled primarily by soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), ammonia (NH3), temperature and euphotic depth (Zeu). The light-saturated rate of photosynthesis (A(max)) varied from 370 to 3 843 mg O-2 m(-3) h(-1) with the maximum value corresponding to the seasonal maximum of phytoplankton biomass. Compared to the period before the diversion of the river, A(max) was reduced by more than ninety-fold in early 1990s and by less than five-fold in 2007 and 2008. Similarly, average phytoplankton chlorophyll a was reduced by more than 2.5 x in the early 1990s and to less than 50% in 2007 and 2008. This highlights the importance of the diversion river water on the physico-chemical and biological environment of the lake.					abate, rediat/F-4552-2016	Abate Adilo, Rediat/0000-0002-6035-2548													1608-5914	1727-9364					2017	42	3					259	269		10.2989/16085914.2017.1361712	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/16085914.2017.1361712													WOS:000416745200005

Estimation of Surface Water Temperature of the Tigris River System in Iraq	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: WATER, WASTEWATER, AND STORMWATER; URBAN WATERSHED MANAGEMENT; AND MUNICIPAL WATER INFRASTRUCTURE					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				Monitoring surface water temperatures (Tw) in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs is a key component of environmental management and influences water quality by affecting bio-geo chemical reaction rates, altering the saturation concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO), and influencing the susceptibility of fish to disease. Temperatures in the Tigris River, one of the largest rivers in the Middle East, are influenced by factors such as heat fluxes at the air-water and human activities such as direct discharge of water to the river. However, modeling and management of water temperature is limited by a paucity of in-situ data, which prevents calibration of models. In this study, we infill data gaps by estimating Tw using the thermal bands of both the Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ sensors. These satellite-based estimates, typically measured once or twice a month with 60-120m resolution, are then used to develop a regression model that relates daily water temperature to daily air temperature and river flow. These estimates are used to define the Tw boundary conditions for a hydrodynamic and water quality model of the Tigris River based on a 2D implementation of the CE-QUAL-W2 (W2) numerical model. Initial results suggest that there is a significant agreement between modeled and remotely estimated data of Tw. Results suggest that short-wave solar radiation is the most important factor that controls seasonal Tw variations. However, anthropogenic influence is observed as a result of return irrigation flows and flows from Tharthar Lake.

Millimeter-wave astroclimate investigations on Badary observatory near Baikal lake	2017 XXXIIND GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM OF THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF RADIO SCIENCE (URSI GASS)					32nd General Assembly and Scientific Symposium of the International-Union-of-Radio-Science (URSI GASS)	AUG 19-26, 2017	Montreal, CANADA	Int Union Radio Sci				This paper deals with results of long-term astroclimate investigations in millimeter-wave band in the Badary observatory near Baikal lake. The optical depths for the 3 millimeter and 2-millimeter-band windows have been determined with the atmospheric dip method. The results of measurements taken at Sayan Solar Observatory of ISTP RAS and on Badary observatory are presented. The collected statistical data yield the mean percentage of good condition time for mm-wave radioastronomy per year. In addition, the seasonal variations of the precipitable water vapour (PWV) have been approximately calculated. Using available data on the measurements of the absorption, the PWV, height, etc., suitability of the site can be evaluated for potential stationing of a millimeter or a submillimeter wave range observatory. The other goal of the work is to calibrate the mm-wave radiometer operating in 2mm & 3mm atmospheric windows by comparing the data with Water Vapour Radiometer operating in cm-waveband.

The Salt Lake is bordered by Tuzgolu, Aksehir and Nigde fault zones in NE-GW direction. Typical mechanical and sedimentary structures in the evaporitic sediments are observed in especially gypsum and anhydrite, partially glauberite and halite deposits. The most prominent structures observed in the investigated cores are usually sequential sedimentation or stratification, other primary structures are slump structures, sub-strata traces, mud cracks and flat conglomeratic gravel sediments. Stratification in the evaporites showed changes in the mineralogical and textural properties from the bed to the bed. There are also settlement/load structures, ripple cross lamination and cross stratification were determined. As a result of sedimentation, sedimentation-grade bedding and intercalation of clay or carbonate mud and salted mineral mud have been observed. The lacustrine sediments in the inner zones of the basin consist of Ca-Na-sulphate, Mg-sulphate sediments, claystone, carbonate alternation and partly laminated.

Before the establishment of Matahara Sugar Plantation, the lake was like a small surface pond created during rainy season and used as grazing area. The lake expansion has certain negative consequences to the region. Thus, appropriate method of quantification of the Lake expansion is extremely important. In this particular study, the areal expansion of the Lake Basaka and sugarcane plantation was analysed. Four LandSat images (1973, 1986, 2000 and 2008) were taken for the cloud-free period and processed in ERDAS Imagine and ArcGIS softwares. Three techniques were employed in the delineation of the areas of the lake and plantation: visual interpretation of FCC in GIS, enhancements and advanced classification in ERDAS Imagine. The study result shows that Lake Basaka expansion is very significant and the increment is geometric rather than linear. Overall, the finding indicates that visual image interpretation gives a fast and accurate indication of the Lake Basaka expansion compared to image enhancement and classification techniques.					; DINKA, Megersa/LVR-4385-2024	DINKA, MEGERSA OLUMANA/0000-0003-3032-7672; 													1755-1307						2017	52								012090	10.1088/1755-1315/52/1/012090	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/52/1/012090													WOS:000399396500090
J	Eid, P				Eid, Patrick			Imported stone artifacts in a quarry context: the techno-economy of lithic industries from the Temiscouata (Quebec) during the Woodland and the early historic period	JOURNAL OF LITHIC STUDIES												This article presents data on chipped stone techno-economic patterns of nomadic hunters-gatherers at a quarry source area in the Temiscouata region (Quebec, Canada) during the Middle late Woodland (1500-1000 BP) and the Late Woodland (1000-450 BP) and also the early historic period (450-250 BP). Located in the hinterland of the Bas-Saint-Laurent, in the upper St-John river drainage, the Temiscouata region is rich of many common natural resources, but also by the presence of an important chert outcrop. The Touladi chert is present in two main quarries and is also found in pebbles forms scattered in the vicinity of the surrounding lakes and rivers. We applied a technological analysis, from the technological approach in the French tradition, on five lithic collections in the objectives to reconstruct the chaine operatoires and their economic management patterns (techno-economy). This methodology was first applied on the local chert material and afterward on the exotic chipped stone artifacts in order to study the patterns that prevailed while hunters-gatherers were outside the quarries zone and also to understand the influence of the outcrops in the economics patterns. The most prominent artifacts found is of course the numerous flakes which can be derive from three different chaines operatoires: the bifacial process, the multidirectional (ad hoc) core reduction and the use of pieces esquillees. The production of bifacial tools is the most important process in Temiscouata lithic industries and is the one who produce most of the flakes found on prehistoric settlements. Core reduction sequence is unstandardized and is responsible for just a small part of the flakes product. The pieces esquillees process is only found on two sites and the flakes are generated unintentionally during the used of these artifacts. The tools assemblage is first characterized by the bifacial tools which are mostly manufactured on raw tabular blocks of chert. As for the flake tools, they are mostly represented by informal (ad hoc) tool (retouched and used flakes), endscrapers and pieces esquillees. Techno-economics patterns on Touladi chert have demonstrated that most of the flake tools were made on flake blanks derived from the bifacial process, mostly from the early and middle stages of this chaine operatoire. Bifacial process was also fractioned in time and space and we found that bifacial blanks and preforms were carried throughout the territory to be used as "cores". The two other productions are quite secondary in respect of the small amount of tools manufactured and they are far less mobile than the first one. Exotic materials show similar and different patterns than those observed on local chert. The bifacial process is still the dominant one and the most prominent way to make flake tools when the quarries are remote. Even then, they still use mostly flakes derived from early and intermediate stages of reduction. Core reduction is interesting because it shows different techno-economic patterns. Reduction sequences are more formal or at least more efficient than those observed on Touladi chert. For example, a small discoid core demonstrate a more complex reduction method which allows a greater ratio of flakes production compared to the multidirectional core processes used in the Temiscouta region. This is partly a consequence of the exotic raw materials used for cores, which is in the form of small pebbles. But it is also probably an adaptation of the core technology in the purpose of making it more efficient and more productive when knappers were away from lithic sources. However, the use of core technologies was probably a second choice, mostly adopted when the raw material did not allow the manufacture of bifacial tools. Bifaces used as cores seem to have prevailed when it was possible to do so. As for the pieces esquillees, they do not seem to have played an important part in tool fabrication in context of raw material scarcity. Another interesting aspect of tools manufacturing with exotic materials is the behavior of carrying flake blanks. Every site shows numerous flake blanks, imported and discarded unused, a behavior which reveals that the prehistoric groups were carrying more flakes than their real needs. Conversely of the curated bifacial tools, which were discarded in quarry zone only if their economic threshold was reach (fractures, size too small, inadequate morphology, knapping accidents, etc.), flake tools and flake blanks were mostly discarded at workshop sites in a gearing up strategy. The results demonstrate also that all the flake tools were not managed in the same ways. Endscrappers, unlike the other flake tools, show some evidences of curation, but not as important as bifacial tools. Since they are discarded less quickly than the ad hoc tool and pieces esquillees, this behavior explain probably why the imported endscrappers are found in greater amount at the Temiscouata sites. The technological analysis shows empiric evidences that hunter-gatherers of the Temiscouata adopted flexible and simple, yet very efficient, techno-economical strategies. These management schemes, which use bifacial chaine operatoire as the central element of the tool manufacturing, seem well adapted to their way of life based on a generalist, seasonal and flexible subsistence economy. Exotic artifacts, even if they represent a small part of the archaeological record, can reveal important aspects of the organization of past stone tool technologies.																			2055-0472						2017	4	2								10.2218/jls.v4i2.2543	http://dx.doi.org/10.2218/jls.v4i2.2543													WOS:000438108900006

Sarfaraz			Studies on different desalination processes turning sea water into drinking fresh water	APPLICATIONS OF ADSORPTION AND ION EXCHANGE CHROMATOGRAPHY IN WASTE WATER TREATMENT	Materials Research Foundations											Desalination is a practical way of making salty water drinkable and it is used widely around the world, especially in very dry countries and on ships and small islands. The process is quite expensive and it uses a lot of energy. It also produces a very concentrated waste stream of brine which has to be disposed of responsibly. For these reasons, it is generally applied as the last resource, implemented only when all other approches have failed. The most common, modern methods of desalination are thermal processes and reverse osmosis (RO). Although there is an increased trend to RO due to the advances in this technology in the last decade. Humans cannot drink seawater as it contains salt and is saline water. But, luckily saline water can be made into freshwater, so that there is enough water for drinking washing and growing crops and for everyday use. Many parts of the world such as dry desert areas simply do not have enough fresh water from surface water such as rivers, lakes. They have little rainfall and then it may only be seasonal. The scarcity of fresh water and the need for additional fresh water is already critical in many arid regions of the world and will be increasingly important in the future. It is very likely that the need for fresh water will soon be considered, in the same category as oil and energy resources, and to be one of the determining factors of world stability and the prosperity of nations. So a regular dependable supply of water is needed in these areas to enable them to have water to grow crops and build their countries to prosper. As our world populations grow we need to be able to guarantee this basic need and avoid any shortages of fresh water. The solution is to look to the abundant supply of sea water and turn salty water into fresh water for drinking.

The sources of the River Menderes are located in the northeast of the Basin. In the westernmost end of this valley lies the village of Duman of the district of Dinar whereas Dikici Huyuk, close to Dinar town center, is situated in the easternmost part. Although the state of the Upper Menderes Valley in the Ancient period is partially known, we do not have many materials concerning earlier eras. The history of the region from the Neolithic Age to the Roman Era was investigated during the surveys we conducted in this valley between 2013 and 2016. It was understood from these studies that the history of the Upper Menderes Valley dates as far back as 7500 years ago. The earliest findings belonging to this phase, which corresponds to the Late Neolithic Age have so far been encountered in the locations of Kabakli Kocakir, Yuksel Huyuk and Dikici Huyuk. Settlements belonging to the Chalcolithic Age are also seen in this area. The Kuyubasi Huyuk in the village of Sutlac can be cited as an example of this. However, the greatest concentrations of ancient settlements in the region are those that belong to the Early Bronze Age. Findings belonging to the Early Bronze Age were found in almost all of the mounds in the Upper Menderes Valley. This situation indicates that the settlements in this area were scattered about 5000 years before now and that there was an increase in population. It is observed that the number of settlements in the region declined in the IInd Millennium B.C. This change, which took place about 4000 years before now, is thought to have been related to issues such as decrease in the number of small settlements in this area, as in the whole of A natolia, people's living together in larger communities, urbanization, emergence of states etc. This is most apparently seen in Dikici Huyuk in the Valley section. Dikici Huyuk is located on the main roads leading to the Lakes District as well as being on the roads that are linked to the roads connecting the Aegean Region to the Konya Lowland. The purpose of this study is to present, together with findings, the early period (from the Neolithic Age to the Roman Period) in the fertile Upper Menderes Valley.

RUSSIAN RIVER NAMES: THE POTENTIAL OF SEMANTIC DEVELOPMENT (WITH REFERENCE TO DIALECTAL VOCABULARY)	VOPROSY ONOMASTIKI-PROBLEMS OF ONOMASTICS												The article considers appellative derivatives from river names used in Russian dialects. Such common nouns are attested in different regions of Russia, mainly in the area of the Russian North. The author identifies nine recipient thematic groups displaying the depotamonymic word-formational pattern: fish; plants and animals; winds; seasonal works; river transport; dances; household utensils. The author shows that the nouns derived from river names can constitute lexical systems, exemplified by the names of fish species (sumskaya seld and sorokskaya seld), winds (in the Lake Baikal area: angara, katluk, sarma, frolikha), various kinds of quadrille (pizhemskaya, verkhovazhskaya quadrille). The author also identifies the structural types of derivatives, noting that the most numerous are suffixed derivatives (veksar, visherka, mokshan, tikhvinka, ustyak) and adjectival collocations (andogsky veter, sukhonsky len, shekhonskaya sominka). The paper describes some exclusive semantic derivational patterns proper only to river names (and not to other kinds of toponyms), such are derivatives from river names designating seasonal works (angarshchina, vaganit') and dances (verkhnetayomka, pezhemskaya igra).

In this study, a new trophic index was derived as a function of the ratio of vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) at 531 nm to 490 nm, expressed as K-d(531/490), to obtain the predictive scaling for monitoring the eutrophication status. The trophic index was also expressed in terms of Turbidity (NTU) which employs the Secchi Depth (Z(sd)) as a crucial intermediate parameter to derive the desired product. It was found that the ratio of Kd in the green-blue region of the visible spectra plays a paramount role in predicting the eutrophic conditions. Moreover, turbidity can be leveraged to establish the bio-optical link-pin between chlorophyll concentration and Z(sd) to determine the water quality in terms of trophic state index (TSI). The chlorophyll concentration was fixed as the primary classifier to derive water quality index on the scale of 0 to 100 denoted by non-dimensional reference scale of TSI (referred as TSIref). TSIref. was then, used as standard scale to predict the accuracy of the modelled TSI products obtained by correlation of K-d(531/490) and Z(sd) with chlorophyll concentration, referred as TSIKd and TSIZsd respectively. The performance of the modelled TSI products was tested over a wide variety of water types, ranging from relatively clear to highly turbid waters. The statistical measures calculated between the modelled TSI and the TSIref revealed that the trophic state of coastal and estuarine waters can be estimated with a percent mean relative error of +/- 20% and RMSE similar to 0.015 with R-2 of approximately 0.9. It was found that the newly derived TSI are in good agreement with TSIref.. The spatial contours for modelled and reference TSI were plotted for different seasons (i.e. for the month of August 2013 and January 2014) which further revealed the potential capability of the modelled TSI to closely predict TSIref. Thus, it can be implied that the proposed optical parameters can be adopted as crucial inputs to determine the eutrophication level of relatively turbid and turbid productive waters.

Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), accounting for about 98% of total nitrogen (TN), was the dominant component in sediment. Ammonium (NH4+-N) was the main component of inorganic nitrogen in the sediment and the pore water while nitrate (NO3--N) slightly exceeded NH4+-N in the overlying water. NH4+-N/ DON ratio had an obvious negative correlation with Eh, temperature and FDA while NO3--N/NH4+-N had a positive correlation with those factors. Calculated by the Fick's First Law, the NH4+-N was the major nitrogen component in internal release with apparent diffusive tendency when NO3--N mainly accumulated in the sediment. Obvious seasonal and spatial variations of nitrogen species and diffusion fluxes were observed. The plant area had lower NH4+-N and higher NO3--N than the center area due to weak reduction condition, which revealed that the anoxic condition played an important role in adsorption and immobilization of nitrogen by means of plant roots in internal release and also suggested the guidance mechanism for nitrogen nitrification and ammonification. In general, the surface sediment in eutrophic lakes, enriched by nitrogen, was the most active dimension for the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen in which NH4+-N was the major and most effective forms.																			2352-5401		978-94-6252-392-0				2017	143						530	535																WOS:000416087900093

Nowadays, 'Status is unknown' like inadequate, inaccurate and non-systematic information on the design parameters, construction age and operating status of pumping station facilities is common for most pumping stations in our country. Kunming is located in the southwest of China border and in the subtropical monsoon zone, the climate is extremely affected by the tropical monsoon, which makes the rainfall obviously different in different seasons. Meanwhile, sitting beside Dianchi Lake, the city's unique geographical location determines the unique construction of drainage pumping stations. From the economic view, compared to Beijing, Shanghai and other developed areas in China, Yunnan Provence's industrial strength and information management are still at low level. Thus, this paper is the first time for Yunnan Provence to make a set of data standards for the drainage pumping station and will be a principle for the future innovation of relevant facilities. In this paper, all the data are from the existing data collected by Kunming Drainage Facilities Management Co., Ltd, and systematically summarized from the existing and operating drainage pumping stations in Kunming.

Bahir Dar and the Lake Tana Basin: Historical Phases of Growth and Ecology	SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM DYNAMICS: CHARACTERISTICS, TRENDS, AND INTEGRATION IN THE LAKE TANA BASIN, ETHIOPIA	AESS Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies and Sciences Series											This essay sets out five distinct periods of economic, demographic, and spatial change that transformed the physical landscape and its effect on the region's hinterland on a local, national and international level - that would form the "urbanscape" of the early twenty first century. Lake Tana is at the Blue Nile's first major outflow and is the heartbeat of the watershed, registering its seasonal pulse. Lake Tana and its surrounding ecologies is the font of the Blue Nile's waters, sitting at 1800 meters above sea level from where it frames much of the watershed. The Blue Nile watershed's agriculture and its relationship with human settlement had evolved over many generations of smallholder agriculture and its regional role in trade. The Blue Nile basin, its geology and its geographies simultaneously shaped the cultures of several distinctive peoples. The ethnographic landscape included Christian highland farmers and aristocrats, Cushitic-speaking Agaw farmers, Muslim traders (who spoke Amharic), and Omotic-speaking Shinasha. These cultures traded places and bodies of knowledge on the local ecologies over time, resulting in a cereal-based agro-economy that supported livestock and small farms that managed them.

Average concentrations (mu g g(-1) wet weight) in Tersakan: Al (60.81 +/- 58.51), B (27.13 +/- 12.42), Co (0.07 +/- 0.05), Cd (0.01 +/- 0.02), Cu (1.44 +/- 0.51), Cr (0.75 +/- 0.54), Fe (33.49 +/- 30.69), Mn (2.19 +/- 1.35), Ni (0.98 +/- 1.27), Zn (20.71 +/- 20.16) and in Saricay: Al (33.82 +/- 37.19), B(8.15 +/- 8.90), Co (0.04 +/- 0.035), Cd (0.01 +/- 0.01), Cu (0.90 +/- 0.44), Cr (0.40 +/- 0.27), Fe (12.97 +/- 8.17), Mn (3.75 +/- 2.045), Ni (0.54 +/- 0.82), Zn (19.05 +/- 10.65) were found. Lead (Pb) was found below detection limits in all stations or seasons while Al accumulation was found highest. The effects of water quality parameters on essential and non-essential metal-metalloid accumulations in fish tissue were indicated by PCA and Co-inertia analyses. Concentrations of observed non-essential metals did not exceed the consumption limits. The evaluation of the data obtained from the study, in Tersakan and Saricay streams, reveal that the ecological balance can be changed in a negative way in case of continuation of the pollution of these two streams.

To protect the cultural heritage in term of conservation called protection of which the effort to prevent and overcome from damage, it needs to do destruction or obliteration through rescue, security, zoning, maintenance, and restoration of cultural heritage. The most fundamental issue is the hydrological impact of the existence of Hydroelectric Power Koto Panjang located around Muara Takus temple that could threaten the sustainability of the region. In this case, hydroelectric dam frequently causes Kampar Kanan River overflowed thus potentially floods, especially in the rainy season that could eventually submerges Muara Takus area. The total area of the region Muara Takus enshrinement is +/- 94.5 hectares that are divided into two main parts. Those are the terrestrial land of +/- 56.44 m(2), and PLTA Koto Panjang lake of +/- 38.06 m(2). Consequently, it is necessary for drainage planning of economical dimension in the core zone of Muara Takus temple. Furthermore, from the data of the maximum rainfall of 101 mm/day obtained a discharge of rainfall of 0.38 m(3) / second so that this discharge of rainfall can be designed drainage channel dimension to accommodate the discharge of rainfall. From the analysis of dimension designed drainage is the size of 30 cm x 45 cm. this dimension can accommodate the discharge rainfall that is equal to 0.43 m3 / second. Regarding the finding, it can be concluded that the discharge of rainfall that occurred less than discharge calculation of dimensional analysis of drainage channel so that the size of this dimension can accommodate discharge rainfall occurs.

The study area was located in a part of Jakarta Urban Lake was called Mookervart catchment area with some part of them are artifical river. The aims of the paper are to discover a new method to describe and to predict the dynamical of Mookervart river system by using a parameter simplify run off and rainfall. The average of rainfall was taken as long12 year showed that rainfall in Mookervart River under 500 mm/month which called as a "wet month". Mookervart river system was caused by 2 season: wet and dry month. The dry month starting from month of May up to October and wet month from November to April. In 2010 the wet month more longest than other year is caused by La Nina effect. By using the alpha=3 then the equation has two solution, this is mean that the solution is not unique. When the value of parameter increase then there are many kind of solution. This condition is called bifurcation. The rainfall on 8th days shown that increasing and decreasing from 15th day and then stabilize from 20th day to 100th day. Run off on the 18th days shown that increasing optimally and stabilize from 18th day to 100th day. The part or 50% of rainfall can be absorp to the land and others can be change to the runoff form. The application this model into the observation data of Mookervart catchment area is still developed. This is a restriction of a parameter value in our system that proofed that the behavior of the solution will be highlighted.

Therefore, application of dynamic methods may play significant role in adjustment of such conditions concerning the frequencies of climate parameters and occurrence of imbalance behaviors in precipitation pattern of the country. Regarding improper distribution of observed data, this research firstly completes post-processing operation using precipitation data of Aphrodite network, and Model Output Statistics(MOS) post-processing methods on the output of dynamic prediction model MRI-CGCM3 in a 28-year period(1980-2007), the precipitation grid of post-processed model and upon weighting output climate variables of dynamic model for each cell of data network and also, determining statistical model coefficients of multivariable correlation; output systematic error of the model highly reduced to be used in small scale applications. Then, post-processed prediction data of dynamic model were applied for computing Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) provided in order to predict drought. Capabilities of selected post-processing method were assessed using evaluation criteria. Findings showed that application of statistical post-processing on direct output of dynamic model results in developing the monthly prediction of precipitation up to 29% in selected post-processing method. Accuracy of Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) predicting may increase up to 22.3% than no post-processing mode, in a way that this value reaches to 79.5% after the implementation of post-processing operation.

The results show that, compared with the flow backward series before the alteration point, the water level and discharge of flow backward after the alteration point were much more intensity, and the tendency of flow backward discharge was decreasing, the times and lasting period of flow backward were much more reduced at the same time. The regulation appeared above may be one of the reasons that cause the water level decreasing, and dry season advancing of Poyang Lake.

J	Davey, W				Davey, William			A different view from the sea: placenaming on Cape Breton Island	ISLAND STUDIES JOURNAL												George Story's paper A view from the sea: Newfoundland place-naming suggests that there are other, complementary methods of collection and analysis than those used by his colleague E. R. Seary. Story examines the wealth of material found in travel accounts and the knowledge of fishers. This paper takes a different view from the sea as it considers the development of Cape Breton placenames using cartographic evidence from several influential historic maps from 1632 to 1878. The paper's focus is on the shift names that were first given to water and coastal features and later shifted to designate settlements. As the seasonal fishing stations became permanent settlements, these new communities retained the names originally given to water and coastal features, so, for example, Glace Bay names a town and bay. By the 1870s, shift names account for a little more than 80% of the community names recorded on the Cape Breton county maps in the Atlas of the Maritime Provinces. Other patterns of naming also reflect a view from the sea. Landmarks and boundary markers appear on early maps and are consistently repeated, and perimeter naming occurs along the seacoasts, lakes, and rivers. This view from the sea is a distinctive quality of the island's names.																				1715-2593				NOV	2016	11	2					381	398																WOS:000391345400005
J	Partal, T				Partal, Turgay			Intra-seasonal variability and wavelet characteristics of lake evaporation in comparison with hydro-meteorological data at Lake Keban (Turkey)	HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES												This study focuses on the variability of lake evaporation and also the periodic relationships among hydro-meteorological variables. The monthly hydro-meteorological data of Lake Keban were investigated by wavelet transforms. The results show that the main periodicity is on an annual scale. This periodicity is weaker for precipitation and wind speed but higher for evaporation, temperature, runoff and relative humidity. In addition to this, the continuous wavelet figures show some weak periodicities on the almost 10-year scale level but they are not continuous over time. Also, strong events on a short-term monthly scale are seen for evaporation, precipitation and runoff in 1988. This event in 1988 may be explained by the 1988 La Nina event, which was one of the strongest on record. Also, the periodicities on the 2-8-month scales in the precipitation data can be interpreted as being connected with the strong El Nino events of 1982 and 1992.																			0262-6667	2150-3435				OCT	2016	61	13					2455	2464		10.1080/02626667.2015.1131897	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2015.1131897													WOS:000383408700013

The biological data of 586 bigeye tuna were collected from the longline fishery in the waters of Western Central Indian Ocean from November, 2012 to March, 2013. The spatial or temporal distribution of the fat content, and the relationships of fat content with gender, round weight, gonadal maturity and fork length were analyzed. A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to analyze the relationships between fat content and fork length (FL), gonadosomatic index (GSI), condition factor (K), and somatic index (SI). Results showed that: 1) the fat content of bigeye tuna was in the range of 3.1%-27.1% with the average 12.8%; 2) there were no significant geographical differences of average fat content (P > 0.05) among 1 degrees squares in general; 3) there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) of the fat content for different genders, months, or gonad maturity stages; 4) there was an extremely significant correlation (P = 0.000) between fat content and FL and GSI. There was no significant correlation (P = 0.051) between fat content and K. There was a significant correlation (P = 0.003) between fat content and SI. The results of this study suggest that the fat content of the matured fish was relatively stable. The survey area was in a spawning region, and the survey period was the spawning season for bigeye tuna.					li, yuwei/LTD-1523-2024														1672-5182	1993-5021				OCT	2016	15	5					853	860		10.1007/s11802-016-2974-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11802-016-2974-0													WOS:000387574800014

Distribution, Abundance, and Habitat Characteristics of Fundulus jenkinsi (Evermann) (Saltmarsh Topminnow) in Coastal Mississippi Watersheds, with Comments on Range-wide Occurrences Based on Non-vouchered and Museum Records	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Fundulus jenkinsi (Saltmarsh Topminnow) is listed as "at risk" by the USFWS and as a Tier 2 conservation priority in Mississippi, in part, because of marsh-habitat loss due to storms, urbanization, and its specialized habitat requirements and limited geographic distribution. To provide additional quantitative data for conservation planning, our objectives were to (1) determine the distribution and abundance of Saltmarsh Topminnow within coastal Mississippi, (2) characterize its habitat requirements, and (3) organize and present all Saltmarsh Topminnow data records (non-vouchered and museum records and those from this study) for use in the development of management/conservation plans. We collected 497 fish and associated habitat data from 27 February to 1 August 2009. PCA produced 3 meaningful components: (1) a landscape-position axis (32.40% of the total variance), (2) a seasonal/spatial axis of species occurrence (18.99%), and (3) a geomorphic bank-slope axis (18.78%). Ninety-six percent of all fish (representing 78.8% of collection effort) were captured in water with salinity <13 psu. We compiled 831 geo-referenced occurrences with collection dates ranging from 1891 to 2015. To better quantify and conserve the closely-linked habitat requirements of this species within a reduced salinity range, additional sampling should be focused in undersampled areas between Lake Borgne, LA, to west of Galveston Bay, TX.

Most studies of high-elevation lakes in the North Cascades have used a landscape-scale approach to describe aquatic systems, but smaller scale research is needed to examine natural variation in these types of lakes. We conducted a watershed-scale study encompassing four close-proximity lakes near Mt. Baker (Whatcom Co., WA) in order to examine the variation in phytoplankton and water quality in these lakes. The lakes were sampled weekly during the ice-free season of 2012 to measure seasonal changes. Chlorophyll-a levels were < 2.0 mu g L-1, confirming the oligotrophic nature of these lakes. Nitrogen limitation was indicated by median DIN:TP < 3 at all sites, along with significant correlations between chlorophyll-a and nitrogen. The phytoplankton were represented by 49 genera (79 unique taxa), which was comparable to landscape-scale studies of North Cascades lakes. Ordination of phytoplankton samples separated the lakes into two groups: one group dominated by diatoms and the other dominated by Chlorophyta, Cyanobacteria, and Ochrophyta. The diatom group was associated with lower water temperatures and total nitrogen concentrations, and higher pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and phosphate concentrations. Results aligned with differences in the lakes' external physical environments, including lakeshore vegetation and ice-melt timing. Our results demonstrated that close-proximity, high-elevation lakes can differ in phytoplankton and water quality, which should be taken into account when evaluating larger scale patterns across multiple watersheds and mountain ranges.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				MAY	2016	90	2					119	135		10.3955/046.090.0205	http://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.090.0205													WOS:000379525000001

Water mite samples were collected from Karamik Lake (Afyonkarahisar, Turkey) on a seasonal basis during 2013-2014 to this end. An equal number of samples were placed into separate aquariums to study each metal salt. Increasing concentrations of heavy metal nitrate salts such as Ni(NO3)(2), Cu(NO3)(2), Cd(NO3)(2), Hg(NO3)(2) and Pb(NO3)(2) were added periodically into the aquaria. The ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma-optical Emission Spectroscopy ICP-OES; Spectro Genesis, Germany) analysis of the lake water revealed medium and low levels of heavy metal ratios. It was observed that this mite absorbed each different heavy metals Ni(NO3)(2), Cu(NO3)(2), Cd(NO3)(2) Hg(NO3)(2) and Pb(NO3)(2). in different ratios and that very low concentrations of Hg had the most severe negative impact, while high concentrations of Ni appeared to have the least negative impact.																			0030-9923					APR	2016	48	2					345	348																WOS:000374719000006

In addition, discontinuous shifts of system at equilibrium is predicted, which is often called regime shift in ecosystem sciences. This hysteresis structure is unfavorable from environmental management point of view, because the reconstruction of original equilibrium state requests much lower levels of external forcing. Mathematical models proposed in previous works are simple and mathematically tractable ([7], [2]). However, it is difficult to extrapolate from such simple models the occurrence likelihood of regime shift in natural environments since temporally dynamic features in ecology and physico-chemical environments, and spatial dimension are less explored in those models. In this study, we construct a realistic but mathematically tractable model of interaction between phytoplankton and phosphorus, which incorporates (1) 1-dimensional vertical structure of lake ecosystem and (2) seasonal periodic cycle of water mixing. We aim to understand the impact of changes in seasonality in various types of lakes on the occurrence of multiple attractors (periodic solution) and hysteresis structure.

The area is mainly supported by three lake-based hydro power plants, Maninjau, Singkarak, and Batang Agam. The electrical supply problems appear during the dry season when water availability is limited. Power outage during dry season in Padang area also becomes inevitable because the Sumatra island electricity system is a 150 kV interconnection power grid and due to the limitation of the transmission power transfer capacity lines from the Southern part of Sumatra (max for 250 MW) the demand cannot be satisfied. This paper presents the 2012 data of power outage and power production in Padang area. Using PVsyst software, a simulation of 200 MW solar PV systems in the Padang location is studied. Three scenarios are described, the current conditions without solar PV, with solar PV, and with solar PV-hydro collaboration. The results show that solar PV hydro collaboration reduces the power outages significantly and distributes it more uniformly for the 2012 data.																					978-0-7918-5685-7				2016									V002T11A002															WOS:000374279500002

GHEORGHE ARM	3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE WATER RESOURCES AND WETLANDS	Water Resources and Wetlands				3rd International Conference on "Water resources and wetlands"	SEP 08-10, 2016	Tulcea, ROMANIA					The oxbow lakes are a unique type of lakes settled in the floodplains of large rivers, in an abandoned meander curvature of a river channel. In this study, we assess the environmental quality status (water and sediment) in three different oxbow lakes formed from the Sf. Gheorghe distributary, the oldest branch of the Danube River. The research was focused on specific field work, subsequent laboratory analysis, data processing and interpretation. In this sense, 30 water and 30 surficial sediment samples, as well as 2 short cores have been gathered during the October 2015 sampling campaign, to estimate the water physico-chemical properties and the lithological character of the recent sediments. The investigated lakes are Gorgostel, Erenciuc and Belciug, disposed from upstream to downstream, namely from west to east in the deltaic areal. The Gorgostel Lake is located in the upper fluvial delta plain and the others as Erenciuc and respectively Belciug are situated in the lower marine delta plain. These lakes are not completely isolated, being further supplied by waterway of different streams or canals. The analytical data show that, Secchi transparency (m), temperature (oC), dissolved oxygen (mg/l), conductivity (mu S/cm), total dissolved solids (mg/l), pH (units), redox potential (mV), turbidity (NTU), suspended solids (mg/l), nitrates (mg/l), nitrites(mg/l), orthophosphates (mg/l) and sulphates (mg/l) are found to be generally, in accordance with environmental regulations. The results expressed as an average value of the water quality parameters varied conforming to the local conditions, sampling stations, seasonal changes in the water budget through lakes etc. The percentage distribution results of the physical sediment parameters as moisture and dry content, as well as total organic matter, total carbonates and siliciclastic fraction, also fluctuates in function of the specific local conditions of the studied areas. The main findings did not notify major differences between the investigated areas. Overall, the obtained results were mainly argued by the sampling locations and seasonal change issues. In conclusion, this study report that the water quality investigated in these particular lakes is in a sustainable condition. The particular environmental conditions of lakes speed up the accumulation of the total organic matter that is assured by autochthonous sources. The acquired results could be base for future studies concerning the oxbow lakes evolution.					pavel, Ana/P-2774-2018; Pojar, Iulian/E-7981-2019; Catianis, Irina/HJZ-2836-2023; Albert, Scrieciu/AAD-8193-2021														2285-7923						2016							228	235																WOS:000450455800030

This species is captured by traps throughout the year and particularly during the Amazon dry season, when animals are concentrated in floodplain lakes. The aim of this paper was to know the populational biology of M. amazonicum in the Macurany and Catispera lakes, both located in the city of Parintins, Amazonas, Brazil. Samples were collected monthly from September 2009 to April 2010, using regional fishing gear. Males, females and total fertility were significantly higher in Catispera lake. The largest ovigerous female was recorded for the Catispera lake (56.2 mm) and low to the Macurany lake (18.3 mm). Sexually undifferentiated individuals were captured throughout the collection period in both lakes. It was observed a higher proportion of females than males (1:2.6) in Macurany lake. The reproductive peak was in the full-flood period (December to April). It may be related to the greatest flow of river and overflowing the banks of lakes, which contribute to larvae dispersion.																			0046-9939	1678-2305					2016	42	2					281	293		10.20950/1678-2305.2016v42n2p281	http://dx.doi.org/10.20950/1678-2305.2016v42n2p281													WOS:000389725700002

Today, the region is known for its hyper-arid conditions, with few isolated oases and no sizable surface drainage system. The remnants of these palaeochannels are now buried beneath the dunefields of the contemporary desert. However, their presence as potential groundwater migration pathways are of importance in understanding the palaeohydrological history of the Sahara, as well potential sources to tap for desert irrigation projects. Conventional means of locating these buried channels have used accurate terrain models to map contemporary seasonal drainage networks (wadis), or satellite-borne radar to penetrate a few meters beneath the sand sheet. An alternative approach is through the use of ground-based geophysics employing a deep-profiling ground penetrating radar technology. A survey over a 15 km X 18 km gravel plain in the Wadi al-Haylit in the Libyan Sahara reveals that ground radar technology can map buried channels rapidly and cost-effectively, given suitable ground conditions.																					978-1-5090-5181-6				2016																								WOS:000390091300066

The water of saline lakes and their sapropelic mud are considered "therapetitic mineral substances" and are used in balneological therapy as alternative treatments for rheumatic, nervous, dermatological and gynecological diseases. Anthroposaline lakes require special protection and management measures which go beyond the usual regulations and recommendations. The history of the anthroposaline lake of the Telega Baths and especially the relatively recent balneological exploitation of the establishment, has revealed notable cyclical patterns of the hydrostatic level of the lake correlated with climatic cyclicality increased in amplitude and extension of extra-wet seasons in the last decades. Geomorphological context is specific to evaporitic formations associated to the Badenian salt and is characterized by landslides and exo-karst. As-a consequence, the environment with obvious dissolution Ruins generating instability is vulnerable to hydrological-hydrogeological cyclicalities, in their turn climatic controlled. The paper presents the hydrological, hydrogeological and geotechnical circumstances history referring to anthropomorphic saline lake of the Telega Baths and of the limitrophe environment whose climatic influenced cyclicity reveals the accounting implications on conditions for a safely balneotherapeutic exploitation. Depending on geological-geomorphological and hydrological setting is recommended restrictive ameliorative and management measures of the current exploitation for balneotherapeutic purposes.					; Branoiu, Gheorghe/C-7794-2015	Frunzescu, Dumitru/0009-0004-9245-6001; Branoiu, Gheorghe/0000-0002-9562-7564; 													1314-2704		978-619-7105-81-0				2016							165	172																WOS:000391653600021

The F-1 Hybrid striped bass was fed with commercial pellet feed in floating net cages. They reached the sexual maturity at two years old. Female brood fish were given 30 mu g/kg of LHRH-a (Lutenizing hormone releasing hormone analogue) and male fish given 10 mu g/kg; of CHP(Dried carp pituitary), 4 mg/kg was used for the female and half that amount for the male for induced breeding. The fish injected LHRHa were successfully induced to both strip spawning and tank spawning by a single hormone injection. However, fish injected CPH and saline, untreated control did not spawn. Latency period was found to be 20.41 +/- 0.91 hour. In term of fertilization rate, larval deformity rate no significant difference was found between tank spawning and strip spawning (p>0.05). Fertilization rates ranged from 56.3% to 85.4% and hatch rates were between 0.99% and 46.88%, whereas the level of larval deformities ranged between 81.25% and 100%. Hatched larvae were placed into 400-liter rectangular tanks with water discharge of 4 liter/minute at a stocking density of 30 larvae/liter. After larvae hatching, they were given artemia nauplii for 5-19 days. Trout granule feed (300-500 micron) also started to be given in addition to artemia nauplii afterwards. Granule feed was started eating completely 24 th days. The larvae obtained from a single hatch in the production season reached 2.87 cm length in 32 days with 2.7% survival rate. Of this study was terminated due to white spot disease (Ichtyophthirius multifilis) arising from sudden change in water temperature. The F-2 progenies were not deemed to be available for aquaculture due to poor fertilization, poor hatching, low survival rate and high deformity rate. For the progenies of the hybrid striped bass that grow in natural water, it was suggested that their ecology in waters in Turkey be first studied and brought into aquaculture afterwards.

The climate in these Northern Hemisphere continental masses was tropical, with vast coastal peat swamps and reefal limestone forming offshore. The Permian continued to be hot, with seasonal river systems and large salt lakes in North America and Europe. The climate was very different on the landmasses of Gondwana, which extended through high southern latitudes towards the South Pole. There, the climate was cold and in some places glacial. Permian Gondwanan coal in Australia, India and South Africa formed in these very different, cold-climate situations. A chain of volcanoes along eastern Australia erupted intermittently for over 60 Ma, and the last orogeny affecting Australia built a mountain chain at its eastern margin.																					978-1-107-43241-3				2016							147	170				10.1007/978-3-319-32337-4												WOS:000400116200008

Statistical analyses enabled distinctions to be made between pelican density with month, season, habitat, environmental factors and prey abundance. The analysis revealed spatial and temporal differences in pelican density in Pulicat Lake. Pelican populations were recorded in five different habitats. The freshwater habitat (2.18 km(2)) supported the highest density followed by mudflat (0.50 birds km2), river mouth (0.29 birds/km(2)), open water (0.028 birds/km(2)) and tidal flats (0.027 birds/km(2)). Population showed monthly, yearly and seasonal variations in numbers and densities in all habitats. Environmental factors and prey abundance greatly affects population density of pelicans and were considered to be influencing factor in Pulicat Lake. Within-site distribution of pelicans depends mainly on the movements of fish, which in turn is affected by meteorological parameters. On the other hand the occurrence of pelicans on this lake also much depended on ecological conditions in other nearby wetlands. It appears that pelicans present in freshwater habitats have favorable ecological conditions. The Pulicat Lake provides a mosaic of varying habitat conditions, essential for the population of Spot-billed Pelicans. However, the status of the Spot-billed Pelican in the Pulicat Lake appears to be a breeding resident.

The results indicated that: The main pollutants of West Lake are total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN) and permanganate index(CODMn). TP is the key pollutant of West Lake. The single factor water quality identification index of TP is from 6.21 to 9.44. The water quality is worse than the national quality standards for Class. in all the monitoring sites and time. The water quality of TP is 1 to 4 grade worse than water environment function zone of West Lake. The water quality shows regular change trend in different monitoring time. The water quality at wet season, i.e. May and September is better than that at dry season, i.e. December and March. The highest comprehensive water quality identification index value of 6.331 appears in December, and the lowest is 4.310 in September.

We investigate one of the processes responsible for permanent stratification formation, the cycle of precipitation and re-dissolution of iron species due to changing redox conditions in different water layers. Hence, evaluating the relevant processes in these so called iron-meromictic lakes on their impact on density stratification helps to predict future water quality and to forecast potential turnovers. We present an approach of quantifying the impact of iron-redox reactions on lake stability of a small well documented iron meromictic Lake called Waldsee in the lower Lusatian Mining district by summing up in-situ measured vertical electrical conductivity profiles. We used the derived "summed conductivity" as a measure reflecting the amount and seasonal mass-balance dynamics of electro-active substances in the lake. Furthermore we conducted a unique aeration experiment to physically reproduce the assumed chemical reactions in the lake. Our findings showed that calculating "summed conductivity" revealed a seasonal oscillation in phase with the chemocline depth which indicates the transition zone between the two water layers. However, induced stratification was sustained throughout the observation period of four years. Mass-balance calculations revealed that the internal iron redox cycle alone was able to maintain the conductivity gradient. However, an inflow of significant amounts of ion rich groundwater seemed to be needed for the recovery of summed conductivity during times of rising chemocline in Waldsee. Aeration of deep water from the lake by the experiment lead to a change in water properties close to surface water layer properties of Waldsee and hence confirmed the occurrence of internal geochemical processes: iron removal, pH depression, DOC removal and CO2 loss.																					978-3-86012-533-5				2016							269	275																WOS:000402663400045

In order to test this concept in large shallow lakes a field pilot was constructed along the Houtribdijk in Lake Markermeer (the Netherlands) in 2014 to gain experience with construction, stability, maintenance and governance aspects. A large scale monitoring programme was set up to follow the hydrodynamic forcing, morphological changes and vegetation development on the pilot. The pilot is located on an exposed south-westerly direction, and experiences substantial wave impact. As a result the desired vegetation on the land-water interface has not been able to establish, but a rather dynamic sandy beach is currently the main feature along the waterline of the site. Higher up the slope planted reeds, and a mixture of willows has well established itself in the first growing season. The exposed position of the location makes that hardly any natural pioneer vegetation has settled, only in small sheltered areas some annuals were able to germinate and maintain themselves.

A set of specific profiles of the distribution of potentially hazardous nanoparticles and nanosized metal associates in water ecosystems of the Ladoga basin was obtained for the first time with account for standards on the content of metals in surface waters, the geochemical traits of the catchment basin territories, and hydrodynamic and seasonal changes. The ecosystem of Lake Ladoga is characterized by an expressed specificity of the inherent sol-gel processes; most likely, this is an important cause of morbidity among the population of St. Petersburg, the Republic of Karelia, and Novgorod oblast.

Therefore in output the parameters were more balance than input.					fahimi, farid/AAO-8720-2021														0976-2612	2278-599X					2016	7				4		928	934																WOS:000402909100110

Within the last ten years a system of lakes and rivers have been discovered. The climate and seasonal cycles of Titan are still not very well known, but the composition and pressure are fairly well established. Perhaps in the future boats will sail the lakes of Titan for research purposes or even sport. The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the concept of space sports, the conditions of Titan and to calculate important parameters of sailing such as floatability, stability, hull resistance and sail forces. This paper shows that if a sailing yacht on Titan will have twice as large displacement as on Earth, it will be 2.6 times less stable for the same beam. Since friction will be smaller, it will be faster than on Earth at low speed, but significantly slower at high speeds due to the wave generation. The same sail area is required to get the same sail forces if the average wind is 3 m/s, while a 9 times larger sail area is required for if the wind speed is only 1 m/s.					/O-3609-2017	/0000-0003-2645-0539															978-989-758-205-9				2016							141	146		10.5220/0006086701410146	http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0006086701410146													WOS:000391109600017

In this research, in a recovering lake, the concentration of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), biomass of zooplankton (BZ), density of zooplankton (DZ), species richness of zooplankton (SRZ) and SRP were measured in 12 sampling sites seasonally. The relationship of SRP with nutrients or zooplankton is statistically analyzed by stepwise regressions. Results show that TN, TP, NH4+-N, BZ and DZ have no influence on SRP at the significance level of 0.05, SRZ is the sole factor that has statistically significant influence on SRP (p<0.001). The adjusted R-2 in the linear stepwise regressions varied from 0.748 to 0.847 in different seasons, indicting high explaining rates of SRZ on SRP in mesotrophic aquatic ecosystems. The slopes in regression equations are ranging from 0.806 to 0.953, which is the quantitative relationship between SRZ and SRP. Results in this research will be helpful in understanding the bottom-up and top-down effects on SRP and providing guidance for biodiversity conservation in aquatic ecosystems.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2016	25	12A					5744	5750																WOS:000392555800013

The results obtained showed that environmental factors affected the biology of Artemia. The highest abundance was recorded in May (550 +/- 2.16 ind/l). All life history stages existed with season-dependent different proportions. The Artemia populations were bisexual with ovoviviparous reproduction at the beginning and oviparous at the end of the life cycle. The sex ratio showed the dominance of males at the start and the females at the end of the cycle. The size of mature females is bigger than that of males. The fertility obtained resulted in a significant production of cysts compared to the nauplii. Statistical analysis showed a negative correlation with highly significant effect between environmental factors (temperature and salinity) and the production of nauplii (ovoviviparity) in contrast with dissolved oxygen.																			0011-216X	1568-5403					2016	89	8					949	974		10.1163/15685403-00003558	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685403-00003558													WOS:000382179700007

From 2012 to 2014, we conducted a creel survey for two days just after the start of the angling season, aging by scale, and species identification by DNA analysis. The total length composition was transformed into the age composition using age-length keys. Under the assumption of an equilibrium condition, total mortality Z was roughly estimated from the age composition. Fishing mortality F was estimated from Z by subtracting natural mortality empirically estimated from longevity (four to seven years). The populations of Kunimasu and Himemasu were estimated by the number of total catch C, F, and Z. Multiplying N and the ratio of the number of Kunimasu in the recreational catch, the population of Kunimasu was roughly estimated to be 4,300-11,000 individuals.

Increasing greenhouse gas emissions, e. g. from melting permafrost soils, are assumed to result in positive feedback mechanisms within the global climate system. Water bodies and the seasonal dependent freeze/thaw dynamics of the uppermost permafrost layer (active layer) are the major carbon and methane source in the Arctic regions. Impacts induced by climate change are resulting in the transformation of the existing Arctic landforms, such as the destruction of settlements or changes in the terrain, hydrology and vegetation cover. This paper presents the potential of using Earth observation data from various sources and time steps to monitor land cover characteristics and changes in the Arctic regions. Information on vegetation structure types and physiognomy is commonly incorporated into spatial models predicting the permafrost distribution. The MODIS land cover, the GlobCover land cover map, SYNMAP and MODIS VCF (vegetation continuous field) have been combined in a product describing the fractional vegetation cover. The dataset, with a spatial resolution of 1 km, consists of four layers providing percentage cover information for trees, shrubs, herbaceous areas and barren areas. Additional information, such as the CAVM (Circumpolar Arctic Vegetation Map), has been integrated into the harmonization approach. Local land cover and water body changes have been analyzed using high spatial resolution earth observation information from Landsat, RapidEye and Corona Keyhole. This analysis was carried out for a test site in central Yakutia and the Lena river delta system in Siberia, Russia. High-resolution land cover information was mapped using an object-oriented classification approach. Object characteristics, such as the shape, spectral properties and information within different hierarchical object levels, are utilized to identify individual vegetation class properties for assignment to a thematic class. Water body changes are identified using historical earth observation data from the 1960s and recent RapidEye data.

To perform the impact valuation, during the 2013-2014 season, we first enumerate ecosystem goods and services generated by the Natural Park of the Albufera. Once the services are defined we proceed by using a multi-criteria analysis (AMUVAM) based on experts to evaluate how each of the services are affected by straw anaerobic fermentation. Finally, once hierarchical relevance of impacts is settled, we obtain the total economic impact by using AMUVAM analysis.

VLB is densely populated and industrialized; therefore the extreme climate events can cause severe impacts. In the Venezuelan territory, it is known that ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) can modulate the rainfalls, however no has been explored in detail as ENSO can affect the rainfalls on VLB. This study analyzes the spatio-temporal trends of the seasonal rainfalls and explores the association between the occurrence of extreme rainfall months and the phases of ENSO (El Nino, La Nina and Neutral) on VLB. Eight stations were selected by the quality control of their registers. We considered two periods for our analysis: 1934-2005 (local scale) and 1966-1992 (regional-local scale). In addition, were identified the months of occurrence of the rainy and dry seasons. The accumulated rainfall by season in each station was calculated and after was explored the occurrence of a long-term trend by Mann-Kendall test. Seasonal precipitation in each station and season was categorized in extreme dry, extreme-no, or extreme wet (ED, EN and EW) using the 10th and 90th percentiles as threshold. The likelihood of occurrence of a month ED, EN or EW at local scale according to season and phase of ENSO was estimated. The association between these categorical variables was analyzed by chi-square test for independence. The results more remarkable were: there is no evidence of a long-term trend at local scale on seasonal precipitation; the Nino/Nina episodes are partially associated with the occurrence of extreme rainfall at seasonal scale; a high-proportion of the extreme rainfall events could have been driven by local factors which were not evaluated here.

We examined life history and reproductive variation among four ecologically distinct populations of the federally listed Pecos gambusia, Gambusia nobilis, from sinkholes at Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge in New Mexico, United States. Despite ecological variation between sinkholes, there were no significant differences in female reproductive traits between populations. Reproductive strategy shifted over the reproductive season from investment in many small embryos to fewer large offspring. Reproductive effort was not correlated with female size or condition (which varies between populations), suggesting that small or poor quality females invest similarly to larger or healthier females. Reproduction was asynchronous between populations and through the reproductive season. Embryo development patterns suggest that females often carry embryos of two or more developmental stages and provision them during gestation (matrotrophy). Understanding the life history strategies of this endangered species is important to the planning and implementation of conservation efforts.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JUL	2015	98	7					1833	1844		10.1007/s10641-015-0401-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-015-0401-9													WOS:000355620700009

SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATIONS' OF CHARACIDAE HABITAT, CASE STUDY IN ABRAS DE MANTEQUILLA WETLAND, ECUADOR	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 36TH IAHR WORLD CONGRESS: DELTAS OF THE FUTURE AND WHAT HAPPENS UPSTREAM					36th IAHR World Congress	JUN 28-JUL 03, 2015	Delft, NETHERLANDS	Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res, Boskalis, Van Oord, UNESCO IHE, Delft Univ Technol, Deltares, Minist Infrastructure & Environm, Rijkswaterstaat, Royal HaskoningDHV, ARCADIS, WItteveen Bos, AANDERAA, Prince Sultan Bin Abulaziz Int Prize Water				A central component of predictive ecology in wetlands is the analysis of species distribution as a function of their biotic and abiotic environment. Decision-makers in biodiversity conservation, species monitoring and environmental planning, among others normally use this analysis. Habitat suitability modelling is a major component of the process of making the analysis, however, temporal and spatial variations of hydrological, hydrodynamic and environmental variables are normally not well known and overall values are estimated. In Abras de Mantequilla wetland (Ecuador) we find a tropical situation where the hydrodynamics of inflows seem to play an important role on the stability of the ecosystem. The habitat suitability in wetlands is driven by hydrodynamic, physical and biological interactions that are not fully understood. This research explores the habitat changes in space and time of a littoral fish community (Characidae) in this tropical wetland, identifying extremes using a constant analysis (thresholds in a range), a one variable index, and a fuzzy combination of hydrodynamic model variables. The main goal was to quantify the extension of the habitat areas were the habitat index was high enough to be considered as suitable for this fish community. This analysis was based on the hydrodynamic features and on spatiotemporal variations of the habitat index. The hydrodynamic variables water depth and velocity were modelled with a 2D flow representation and information from hydrological models simulations at the inflows of the wetland. The hydrodynamic model of the wetland was built in Delft3D-FLOW software. A change of spatial distribution of the habitat for Characidae family was related to the velocity and water depth. Results from the Habitat model indicated that when only water depth was selected as unique variable for the analysis, the percentage of suitable areas was higher at the beginning and at the end of the wet season. Conversely, when velocity was selected as unique variable the percentage of suitable areas was higher during the middle of the wet season. A subsequent combination of both variables depth and velocity showed a similar trend to the one of velocity alone. The results from this Combined Habitat Index determined that a higher percentage of suitable areas for this fish assemblage occurred during periods of high flows (middle of the wet season), given the hydrodynamic variables selected. Thus, it would appear that the habitability of the Characids in the littoral areas decreased when low flows occurred. Despite this fact, it is essential to acknowledge that other physical, chemical and biotic variables may play an important role in the presence of this community and therefore should be gradually included in future studies for an integrated ecological habitat assessment.

Data set was processed using the West-transdanubian Water Inspectorate methodology. Potential evapotranspiration (PET) was calculated using Hungarian empirical models (Antal and Dunay), while Lake Ferto formula was applied evaluating the ET that includes the impacts of vegetation. Calculated PET values of the wider (adjacent) environment of Lake Feneki (Zalaegerszeg, Nagykanizsa, and Keszthely meteorological stations) differed significantly and further variation was observed in PET, when measured meteorological elements on Lake Feneki were applied. PET increment, as a result of linear trend fitted to the 43-year long data (Keszthely station) was 3-4 mm year-1. Relation between PET calculated from the data of Keszthely station and for Lake Feneki was strong, so PET of Lake Feneki can be originated from the data of Keszthely station. Calculated ET was not significantly different due to the likely similar input data in ET calculation model of Hungarian Meteorological Service (OMSZ). 43-year annual mean ET for Lake Feneki was 809 +/- 88 mm. This ET was 84% of calculated PET. Analyzing the nine dry-warm seasons, average annual ET exceeded the long term average (874.7 +/- 37.6 mm) with 78 mm. The average ET of the remaining 34 wet-cold seasons totalled 796.6 +/- 89.4 mm. Empirical formulas cannot be replaced, according to monthly ET comparisons, by using "A" class pan estimating the ET of aquatic habitats. Seasonal pattern of monthly ET time series for Lake Feneki was analyzed using autoregressive integrated moving averages (ARIMA) modeling technique. After first differencing, the transformed series was stationary and found to be governed by moving average process of order 1.

Since the open-pit is very close to Sai Lake, the seasonally changed water level and the distance between lake and slope have great influence to the stability of open-pit slope. Based on the drill data and geological sections, a numerical model of the slope is built. With the fluid-mechanical interaction associated, the stability of the slopes is numerically analyzed, in which different lake water levels and lake-slope distances are taken into consideration. The comparative analysis shows that a larger lake-slope distance can promise better slope stability and weaken the sensitivity of slope stability to water. The stability of slopes with different heights is analyzed to find that the stability weakens and the sensitivity is enhanced with the height increasing. To the most serious situation, the slope height and the lake water level being 238m and 17.2 m, respectively, the F-s value equals 1.18945 which is extremely closed to the allowable safety factor of 1.20 for slope design. According to the minimum F-s for slope design, the minimum distance between lake and open-pit slope is found to be 60m.

Based on the in situ data from wet and dry season in 2008-2011, the paper studied the temporal and spatial characteristics of PSD in Poyang Lake and its influence on water optical properties. The median particle size (D-v50) shows more significant variation in dry season between different districts than in wet season. The negative correlation between D-v50 and mass-specific absorption coefficient of total suspended particles (a(p)*(400)) denotes that inorganic particles also has "package effect". Good correlationship is found between spectral slope of PSD and spectral slope of attenuation coefficient and scattering coefficient. Compared to mass concentration, the particle size information can better explain the variability of scattering properties. Furthermore, a retrieval model for cross-sectional area concentration is established by remote sensing reflectance ratio to provide more information about particle size in Poyang Lake.																			2153-6996		978-1-4799-7929-5				2015							2253	2256																WOS:000371696702088

Around the rising trend in average temperature and rainfall, interannual and seasonal variation will increase. This will result in more frequent and more intense extreme events such as droughts. Drought affects many aspects of environment and society, and any future increases in the demand for water will be most critical in periods of severe drought. The identification, monitoring and characterization of droughts are of great importance in water resources planning and management. The water resource of the Blue Nile River is of key regional importance to the eastern Nile basin countries (Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt). The Blue Nile originates from Lake Tana in the Ethiopian Highlands and contributes about 60 - 69% of the main Nile discharge. In this study, spatial and temporal dimensions of meteorological drought in in Blue Nile basin were investigated from vulnerability concept. Analysis of historical droughts was undertaken by converting observed monthly precipitation time series, of 11 meteorological stations over a 48-years period, to the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The standardized precipitation index (SPI) was computed at multiple-time steps and the Mann - Kendall test was applied on monthly SPI time series for trend detection. Results indicate that droughts randomly affect the region and several drought events contain mild, moderate severe, and extreme droughts were observed during the long rainy season (June to September) and the short rainy season flow (March to May) as well. Trend analysis showed that most of the detected trends are statistically insignificant. Severity and frequency analysis of the monthly SPI index for studied station indicated that, on average, more than 35% of the months in all stations experienced droughts and their intensity various from moderate to extreme and the intense droughts were during the 1980s.

Assessment of Phage Abundance in Water Samples of Napahai Wetland by Epifluorescence Microscopy	PROCEEDINGS OF THE AASRI INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS AND APPLICATIONS (IEA 2015)	AER-Advances in Engineering Research				AASRI International Conference on Industrial Electronics and Applications (IEA)	JUN 27-28, 2015	London, ENGLAND	Amer Appl Sci Res Inst, Huazhong Normal Univ				Bacteriophage is abundant in various aquatic environment. Napahai is a seasonal plateau wetland located in Yunnan of China. But the reports on phage abundance of Napahai have not been seen. The object of this study was to make an accurate estimation for phage abundance of Napahai. We collected water samples at different sampling sites in December 2013 and detected the abundance by epifluorescence microscopy using SYBR green I or SYBR Gold. The results indicate that the phage abundance of water samples in Napahai wetland ranged from 1.35 to 3.54x10(9) virus-like particles L-1. The dying effect of SYBR Gold is better than SYBR green I. Phage abundance of Napahai is close to that of Yangtze River and higher than the Yunnan Plateau lake, Bita Lake (5x10(8) particles L-1) and largely lower than the polar lake Beaver Lake (2x1010 particles L-1) [1].

Development of a district information system for water management planning and strategic decision making	THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION OF THE ENVIRONMENT (RSCY2015)	Proceedings of SPIE				3rd International Conference on Remote Sensing and Geoinformation of the Environment (RSCy)	MAR 16-19, 2015	Paphos, CYPRUS	Cyprus Univ Technol, Cyprus Remote Sensing Soc, European Space Agcy, Cyprus Sci & Tech Chamber, Dept Meteorol, Minist Def, Minist Commun & Works, Dept Elect Commun, Agr Res Inst, Grp Earth Observat, DLR, Hellas Sat, Neapolis Univ, Frederick Univ, Intergraph, GeoSystems Hellas, I BEC, Si Cluster, Spectra Vista Corp, Agisoft, QuestUAV, SPOLMHK, SODAP, Smart Events, Municipal Pafos, Municipal Geroskipou, Pegeia Municipal				The overall objective of this work is the development of a District Information System (DIS) which could be used by stakeholders for the purposes of a district day-to-day water management as well as for planning and strategic decision-making The DIS was developed from a GIS-based modeling approach, which integrates a generic crop model and a hydraulic model of the transport/distribution system, using land use maps generated by Landsat TM imagery. The main sub-objectives are: (i) the development of an operational algorithm to retrieve crop evapotranspiration from remote sensing data, (ii) the development of an information system with friendly user interface for the data base, the crop module and the hydraulic module and (iii) the analysis and validation of management scenarios from model simulations predicting the respective behavior. The Lake Karla watershed is used in this study, but the overall methodology could be used as a basis for future analysis elsewhere. Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) was used to derive monthly actual evapotranspiration (ET) values from Landsat TM imagery. Meteorological data from the archives of the Institute for Research and Technology, Thessaly (I.RE.TE.TH) has also been used. The methodology was developed using high quality Landsat TM images during 2007 growing season. Monthly ET values are used as an input to CROPWAT model. Outputs of CROPWAT model are then used as input for WEAP model. The developed scenario is based on the actual situation of the surface irrigation network of the Local Administration of Land Reclamation (LALR) of Pinios for the year of 2007. The DIS is calibrated with observed data of this year and the district parameterization is conducted based on the actual operation of the network. The operation of the surface irrigation network of Pinios LALR is simulated using Technologismiki Works, while the operation of closed pipe irrigation network of Lake Karla LALR is simulated using Watercad.Your alternative scenarios have been tested with the DIS: .Reduction of channel losses .Alteration of irrigation methods .Introduction of greenhouse cultivation .Operation of the future Lake Karla network The results of the simulation for the historical period indicate that the water pumped from Pinios LALR is not enough to serve irrigation requirements. The spatial and temporal variation of the unmet and unsatisfied water demand has been estimated. Simulation of the four alternative scenarios indicated that the alteration of irrigation methods scenario mainly increases the efficiency of the irrigation network.

The major phylogenic groups of all sediments included Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Nitrospira, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia among them, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi were the dominant phyla. The highest bacterial diversity occurred in Lake Longhupao and the lowest in Lake Qingkenpao. Relationships between environmental factors and bacterial community compositions were identified with redundancy analysis. It was identified that pH and total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) were related to bacterial community compositions and pH was the most influential parameter. Our results found different bacterial community compositions in sediments of three lakes, which suggested environmental factors exerted a key influence on the bacterial communities in lake ecosystems.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2015	24	10B					3452	3459																WOS:000366880600006

The increasing availability of remotely sensed spatial datasets of fire activity and atmospheric concentrations of the emission products from biomass combustion presents an opportunity for greenhouse gas accounting methodologies that are independent of the current bottom-up methods. Three potential applications for top-down accounting are identified: (1) independent assessment of the accuracy of bottom-up accounts; (2) a method for constraining bottom-up emission estimates to match the observed atmospheric concentrations of emitted compounds; and (3) a fully independent method for determining regional emissions. Assessment of consistency between independent datasets used as input to -bottom-up accounts confirmed that current Australian practice and method yield emission estimates that are reliable. However, global data products appear to significantly underestimate fire area in the Australian savanna woodlands and rangelands, and overestimate fuel loads. Regional monitoring and analysis is therefore essential for regional accounts. Atmospheric dispersion models of proven accuracy in the Australian region, coupled with a chemical transport model, are also found to perform reasonably reliably in Australian applications. This confirms that current emissions estimates produce atmospheric concentrations of smoke that are consistent with observed concentrations. At three observing sites (Lake Argyle, Darwin and Jabiru), there is good correspondence between the magnitude and seasonal variation in aerosol optical depth (AOD) - the loading of particulate matter observed though the atmospheric column. This could only be achieved by accounting for all sources of aerosol (i.e. marine, wind-blown dust, secondary aerosol produced from biogenic sources of volatile organic compounds, and both fresh and aged smoke). Model predictions of the smoke contribution to total AOD were slightly smaller than indicated by the surface measurements. This work is consistent with previous studies, but indicates that the empirical methods used in previous studies may have overestimated the significance of smoke relative to other aerosol sources. Clearly, some components of the chemical transport model require further refinement to fully describe the known aerosol chemical and physical transformations in the atmosphere. There is also good agreement between AOD predicted from emissions estimates and AOD predicted from atmospheric transport with observations of smoke plumes derived from lidar backscattering profiles from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite. However, the comparison was limited by the mismatch between the spatial resolution of the model and that of the CALIPSO observations. To develop the top-down technique to the point where it can be used to constrain and even replace bottom-up accounts will require further refinement of model components and development of inverse modelling software. While both are currently in planning, it appears unlikely that top-down accounting can be applied in the near future for totally independent accounting due to the limited precision and temporal coverage of the satellite observations.

The initial intention of this paper is to present an approach for determining the so called "salient times" during which the trend of the shrinkage process is accelerated or decelerated. To find these salient times, a quasi_continuous curve was optimally fitted to the Topex altimetry data within the period 1998 to 2006. To find the salient points within this period of time, the points of inflections of the fitted curve is computed using a second derivative approach. The water volume was also computed using 16 cloud free Landsat images of the Lake within the periods of 1998 to 2006. In the first stage of the water volume calculation, the pixels of the Lake were segmented using the Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) and the shorelines of the Lake were extracted by a boundary detecting operator using the generated binary image of the Lake surface. The water volume fluctuation rate was then computed under the assumption that the two successive Lake surfaces and their corresponding water level differences demonstrate approximately a truncated pyramid. The analysis of the water level fluctuation rates were further extended by a sinusoidal curve fitted to the Topex altimetry data. This curve was intended to model the seasonal fluctuations of the water level. In the final stage of this article, the correlation between the fluctuation rates and the precipitation and temperature variations were also numerically determined. This paper reports in some details the stages mentioned above.

The collections were made during high water and low water seasons in 2010, employing gill nets, bottom trawl net and landing nets. Stomach contents of 875 specimens from 66 species (30 for high water and 48 for low water) were analyzed; species diet similarity was determined through the Bray-Curtis Index; the trophic niche extent was determined using Levin's Index. There were changes in the compositions of the trophic guilds in both seasons (X-2=323.95, P=<0.001). Six trophic guilds for high water season and five for low water season were found. Changes in diet composition were recorded in both seasons, which appear to correspond to resource offer. For future research, it is recommended to increase the number of samples for stomach contents and to widen the sampling to the other season of the hydrological cycle in order to determine with greater precision the trophic variation.																			2145-5082						2015	6	2					67	85		10.15446/ma.v6n2.52809	http://dx.doi.org/10.15446/ma.v6n2.52809													WOS:000382747300004

The proper monitoring and analysis of such temporally dynamic phenomena requires dense time series data. Radar time series data is also useful for mitigating uncertainties in individual images, e.g. for the mapping of permanent water bodies. This chapter reviews capabilities, potentials and challenges of spaceborne radar time series data for the mapping of permanent water bodies, the monitoring of floods, and the retrieval of soil moisture content. The focus is put on the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB) in Southeast Asia. Two thirds of the LMB's population of 60 million people live directly from agriculture and fisheries. The Mekong River's resources are under pressure among others from an increasing population, intensified agriculture, and the expansion of hydropower. A thorough understanding of water resources in the LMB is therefore crucial to the sustainable development in the region. The chapter provides an outline of radar remote sensing for retrieval of hydrological information as well as an overview of the relevant operational capabilities of radar missions. A map of permanent water bodies of the entire Lower Mekong Basin derived from a time series of ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) data is presented. Potentials and challenges of flood monitoring with SAR are illustrated with ASAR imagery showing the evolution of the floods that occurred around Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia in 2011. Finally, the spatial and temporal dynamics of soil moisture across the LMB are analysed with the use of 14 years of scatterometer time series data acquired by the ERS-1, ERS-2, Metop-A and Metop-B satellites. The average seasonal soil moisture cycle was computed at the sub-catchment level. An anomaly analysis of the temporal soil moisture dynamics revealed large inter-annual variability across the Lower Mekong Basin.

The high rate of flow manifests as high siltation in the reservoirs created for storing water for the long dry spell post monsoon. The incessant siltation during the monsoon period over the years depletes the storage capacity of the reservoirs created at very high cost. The present situation in India is really critical and urgent measures for de-siltation is called for to ensure reasonable availability of water resources for varied applications. De-siltation efforts require precise sediment classification for effective water resource management. The remote sensing followed by image analysis has been the most popular method to undertake such sediment analysis for reservoirs due to convenience. However, such methods have significant limitations in terms of inaccuracies of measurement and analysis of sediments. Acoustic methods can substantially enhance the measurement and analysis accuracies; however these techniques are highly sensitive to the medium properties of the underwater medium. The tropical Indian waters further adds to the challenges due to random fluctuations of the medium characteristics based on diurnal and seasonal variations of surface parameters including temperature, wind, etc. The deployment of acoustic methods could get limited if the medium fluctuations are not compensated and the advantages over the remote sensing methods could be neutralized. The temptation to import acoustic technology could have serious limitations in the absence of detailed study of the local conditions prior deployment. The most basic parameter for any form of acoustic analysis is the sound velocity profile (SVP) that is dependent on the temperature, salinity and pressure of the medium. The equipments used for sediment classification use default empirical equation for the computation of the SVP. These empirical equations have specified limitation of their validity with respect to these parameters like temperature, salinity and pressure. It is well known that tropical waters have typical values for these parameters and also the equations valid in the sea water will not be applicable for freshwater measurements. The work attempts to highlight the variations of the commonly used empirical equations for computation of the SVP and their applicability in the tropical shallow freshwater reservoirs. The shallow water reservoirs in India ensure high multi-path interactions of the acoustic signal with the surface and the bottom, and the tropical condition cause high diurnal and seasonal fluctuations of the surface parameter. The work presents the error bound for the multiple empirical equations available in the literature namely the Wilson's, Medwin, Cop pen and Leroy et. al, their validity for sediment classification in the tropical shallow freshwater. The tropical conditions in Khadakwasla lake have been used as a reference to validate the proposed difference. The simulation results have been validated with real data recording in the Lake.																			2573-3788	2573-3796	978-1-4799-8301-8				2015																								WOS:000380439000014

We conduct regular cycles of combined observations at the Southern Baikal shore for different seasons at the Baikal Atmospheric-Limnological Observatory (BALO). The measurements under maritime conditions were conducted at the stationary station of the Far East Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences at Schultz Cape in the period of October 6-10 of 2012 and October 7-13 of 2013, as well as in 2014 a cycle of investigations on the assessment of spatial variability was carried out. The most remarkable distinctive feature of the content of dissolved gases and their flux under maritime conditions (Far East) is the permanent sink of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere onto the water surface. At Lake Baikal in this period, we observed the pronounced diurnal dynamics characterized by the daytime sink and nighttime emission of CO2 into the atmosphere.

Since contaminants (especially heavy metals) can easily stick on sediments and then deposit on the riverbed, sediments contaminated by heavy metals become the potential secondary pollution sources to aquatic system. To assess the effects of heavy metals on the estuarine environment, seasonal distribution characteristics of heavy metal in surface sediments on riverbed of Dapuhe River were investigated in this study. Sediment samples were collected at 6 sites along the river estuary during August (i.e. the flood season) and November 2011 (i.e. the dry season). They were analyzed by polarization spectrometer for heavy metals to examine the element distribution pattern and pollution status. The concentrations (mg/kg) of heavy metals were for Cu in 10.2-322.0, Zn in 19.7-435.2, Cd in 0.04-0.59, Pb in 4.2-142.0, Cr in 37.0-154.6, Hg in 0.02-0.73, As in 0.6-36.7, respectively. A primary assessment with Geo-accumulation Index and Potential Ecological Risk Index indicated that the pollution status associated with heavy mental in sediments was unpolluted to moderate polluted which posed a light potential ecological risk to the aquatic environment. The pollution status of the river in the flood season was worse than that in the dry season, and the middle reach of the river (especially the branch of Guhe River) may suffer more pollution than the upper and the lower reaches. It was also found that the contaminated degree of heavy metal on the riverbed sediments was: Cu > Pb > Zn > Hg > As > Cd > Cr and some heavy metals from metallic wastewater discharges along the river were likely to result in harmful effects on river ecosystem. Although the concentrations of metals were lower than the threshold level in the study area, an attention still should be paid to the potentially ecological risk of heavy metal on bed sediments of Dapuhe River estuary.																					978-90-824846-0-1				2015							963	970																WOS:000398996201011

The LWR for a total of 94 unsexed Gibel carp, examined from the very next day of sampling was calculated as: TW = 0.0055 TL3.6303. Similar with other biometric case studies conducted on this species in the specialized literature, our report has limitations like narrow-sized specimens, but this is because in sample season, the fish had not yet reached full maturity. However, to our knowledge, this is the first contribution on length-weight relationship for Carassius gibelio belonging to an anthropic lake from Bucharest.

After the second monitoring phase was terminated due to lightning damage in October 2013, the recording system was trimmed down to a three-hydrophone array system that can measure the direction of the sound source to monitor the dolphins' migration behavior in a long-term span. To answer the questions such as: How often and when do they migrate from Lake Semayang to up/down-stream of the river through the tributary, the statistical data analysis using the dolphins' direction data recorded from the first and second monitoring phases and uploaded to the database was initially carried out for understanding their diel/daily/monthly/seasonal migration trends. The results confirmed that the statistical analysis using the data acquired by the long duration acoustic monitoring could reveal the answers to the above questions: "how often and when". Answering the further question: "What is the main factor in their migration changes?- is the next step of the study.																			2573-3788	2573-3796	978-1-4799-8301-8				2015																								WOS:000380439000025

The masterplan is called National Capital Integrated Coastal Development (NCICD). One of its action plans is to build a Giant Sea Wall along the Jakarta Bay. In this research, the possible effects of NCICD to the urban drainage system will be discussed. For that purpose, it is proposed that Jakarta can be divided into 5 compartments; each compartment has area of approximately 10,000 ha and delineated based on existing main drainage systems (natural drainage) and other physical boundaries e.g. roads which border one compartment to another. In this case, one compartment will be evaluated on their hydraulic performance. It is so called Compartment 2. Located in northern of Jakarta and at the northern boundary, this compartment is bordered by the inner dikes of the coming NCICD project. From the model simulation, it can be concluded that in general pumping capacity in combination with the open storage areas are sufficient and all the pumps should be operated simultaneously. Compartment system could be useful in order to mitigate the flood in Jakarta area. By considering practical aspects of the water management system, the service area of a compartment should not be too large or too small. The model shows that the effect of the land reclamation NCICD to the water levels along the main drainage system (Ciliwung River). The water level (Delta h) will increase between 0.8 m at the downstream to 0.2 m at the upstream. To avoid overtopping, the crest elevation of the river embankments has to be increased. It is suggested that in Phase A of NCICD should also strengthen and improve the dikes along the main drainage system, and not only the existing dikes along the coastlines. A proper operation of water management is really required in Giant Sea Wall as an integrated system when Phase A and Phase B are completed. This wall is planned to be constructed in a fully controlled system, creating a giant artificial lake. In case the land subsidence will continue, it means that water level in the lake will be lower and lower in time. If the water level in the lake decreases, it will also affect the water level along the rivers which flow into the lake (dry season). Hence, a proper water management has to be established.

Scaling Up the Adoption of Positive Selection and Seed-plot Techniques in Seed Potato Systems in Uganda - UNSPPA's Experience	Potato and Sweetpotato in Africa: Transforming the Value Chains for Food and Nutrition Security					9th Triennial African Potato Association Conference	JUN 30-JUL 04, 2013	Int Potato Ctr, Naivasha, KENYA	African Potato Assoc, Republic of Kenya, Ministry Agr Livestock & Fisheries, Natl Potato Council Kenya	Int Potato Ctr			Accessing quality seed potato by smallholder farmers has continued to be a major challenge to increased potato production. An intervention by the Uganda National Seed Potato Producers' Association (UNSPPA) with support from the Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA), the International Potato Center (CIP) and the National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO) aimed to promote the adoption of positive selection (PS) and seed-plot techniques in south-western Uganda, a major potato production zone in the country. In a participatory approach with farmers, trials were set up to compare seed potato yields produced by PS and seed obtained from farmers' own practice. Using PS, an increase of 34% or 6.8 t/ha was recorded compared with farmer's seed. This provides an economic gain with minimal or no increase in cash investment. Another approach called the seed-plot technique in which small quantities of high-quality seed are grown under intensive management on raised beds at close spacing was also demonstrated on-farm in participatory experiments involving researchers, development agents and farmers. Validations indicated that the seed-plot technique achieved two-and-a-half to three times land productivity and about 50% bacterial wilt reduction compared with conventional ridge planting. Under different programmes supported by ASARECA, CIP, Carry American Relief Everywhere (CARE) Enterprise, Environment and Equity in the Great Lakes (EEEGL), National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS) and NARO, these techniques have reached 5890 farmers from south-western Uganda, out of which 80% have adopted the technologies. It was revealed that such simple technologies can enhance the quality of seed potato used by smallholder farmers every season. It was further shown that technology adoption was achieved faster through stakeholder participatory experimentation and group learning.

We demonstrated that the higher rainfall regime was more likely to lead to increased runoff coefficient and soil loss. Total nitrogen was easier to lose in sustained rainfall. Total phosphorus concentration was higher in the first few rainfall events, and decreased gradually with the increase of rainfall events. A large amount of output of non-point source pollution was in the fourth or fifth rainfall event in the rainy season. Continuous weak rainfall more easily dissolved nitrogen and organic pollutants. The larger the runoff was, the higher soil loss and runoff coefficient values were. The data indicated that the "mode of planting on poor, shallow soils in degraded hilly area" was the best mode in intercepting pollutants in the first year after planting.																					978-1-315-66798-0; 978-1-138-02867-8				2015							1341	1346																WOS:000377647700257

However, this anthropogenic activity has caused serious land subsidence and damages. In this paper, mining-induced subsidence lakes areas are monitored using Radarsat-2 SAR images in Huinan city. The area and expanding rate of the three major mining induced subsidence lakes were obtained and analyzed by our method. The total expansion areas of subsidence lakes reached to 1.6111km(2). The area expansion of subsidence lakes correlated with the deformation result by InSAR in previous research, which indicates that the underground mining activity, is the main reason for the subsidence lake expansion.

A severe algal bloom in 2007 led to the development of the Lake Tai Master Plan, launched by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), to improve nutrient management in the basin. Under a joint Australian China Environmental Development Project, the Australian eWater Source Integrated Modelling System (IMS) was applied to model water quantity and quality for a pilot area on the Dongshan Peninsula in the Lake Tai Basin. Source is a powerful modelling platform for environmental management which can integrate many physical processes and human impacts, successfully applied in over 70 basins across Australia. The aims of the project were to: apply the model to a small pilot area and investigate strategies to improve nutrient (total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)) management in the Lake Tai Basin. Source was applied to the 77 km(2) Dongshan Peninsula. The model consisted of 50 subcatchments with seven major landuse categories including aquaculture (43% of the area), upland and lowland fruit trees (31%), low and high density urban (12%) and vegetables (6%). The daily timestep model was run for the period 2001 to 2010. The flexible nature of the Source software enabled a number of novel modelling approaches to be applied such as simulation of the seasonal variability in runoff and nutrient export from the 33 km(2) of aquaculture ponds on the Peninsula. The model was parameterised and validated drawing on local knowledge, expert opinion from the Chinese and Australian technical working group and literature from both countries. Three scenarios were investigated. The implementation of a proposed wetland to filter runoff from the aquaculture ponds could reduce TN and TP exports to the lake by 13% and 16% respectively. Other scenarios included the closure of the sewage treatment plant, and the adoption of improved fertilizer management practices in the vegetable and tree cropping areas. The project has provided valuable insights into the dominant nutrient sources exported to Lake Tai, potential nutrient reduction strategies and priorities for future research and data collection.																					978-7-5509-0399-9				2015							423	431																WOS:000391414900054

The numerical scheme of the model is spatial finite difference method in a three time-level, external-internal mode splitting frame. Based on Xingzi station field data, 15 days of calibration was conducted during dry season and flood season in 2008 respectively, using measured bathymetry, rainfall, wind velocity, inflow and outflow data for the section from Duobao Village to Hukou Count in Poyang Lake. During dry season from 2007 to 2008, the lake current is south to north; during flood season in 2008, the lake current in Hukou is turning from northward to southward. The reversion process is important for fresh water exchange between Yangtze River and Poyang Lake, also affording a channel important for fish migration and upgrading of water quality of Poyang Lake. The numerical results were verified by field observation data, and it is suggested the water lock as Poyang Complex project in plan is including a water level adjustment function to reserve the existing water level and lake current variation, and satisfy the demand of biodiversity.

In this paper, remote sensing images are used to extract the water body of Hong Lake in flood season and dry season from 2013 to 2016, and analyze the characteristics of water changes in Hong Lake. Concepts as compactness index, shape fractal dimension and spatial gravity index in urban expansion field are introduced respectively, which are used for studying the speed and direction of Hong Lake change with lake area analysis, lake variation morphological analysis and lake spatial difference analysis. On the basis of this, the driving forces of lake change are studied by combining meteorological, hydrological and socio-economic factors, and the relationship between multiple factors and the area of Hong Lake are analyzed. Some factors show remarkable correlation with the area of Hong Lake. In conclusion, this paper provides important reference information for the ecological environment protection and sustainable utilization of water resources in Hong Lake, and has great application potential.																					978-1-4503-5289-5				2015							81	87		10.1145/3132300.3132323	http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3132300.3132323													WOS:000501609100018

Based on the in-situ data from wet and dry season in 2008-2011, the paper studied suspended particle size distribution of Poyang Lake and its optical features. The suspended particle size distribution showed seasonal variation: the particle size of southern lake was larger than that of northern lake in dry season but showed little variation in wet season. The suspended particle size distribution exerted influence on particulate absorption coefficient, attenuation coefficient and scattering coefficient. The particulate absorption coefficient of northern lake was higher than that of southern lake. The negative correlation between specific absorption coefficient of total suspended particles and median particle size indicated that there was "package effect" of mineral particles in turbid Poyang Lake. The spatial and temporal distribution of particulate attenuation coefficient and scattering coefficient are similar: there were obvious regional differences in dry season but few in wet season. There were good correlations among the remote sensing reflectance, spectra slope of particle size distribution and spectra slope of particulate scattering coefficient. These correlations would provide the foundation for remote sensing retrieval of particle size and quantitative analysis of influence of suspended particle size on the optical properties. The relationship between particle size distribution, particulate back-scattering coefficient and bulk refractive index can provide information of particle composition in Poyang Lake.																			1000-0593					NOV	2014	34	11					3085	3089		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2014)11-3085-05	http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2014)11-3085-05								25752063					WOS:000344447700040

Estimating Sediment-water P exchange in Lake Rio Verde (Parana State, Brazil)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Monthly and annual water and phosphorus mass budgets were set up over the year 2010 for the Lake Rio Verde, Brazil. Limited data for the water budget was compensated using an interpolation method with data water budget data of a nearby reservoir. Thus, errors of ca. 1.5% were estimated for the water budgets. Dominant P mass input terms were inflows from the rivers and direct run off into the reservoir. Main output terms were P outflow via rivers and industrial water abstraction. Equalizing the P inputs and outputs leads to a sediment phosphorus uptake term were estimated at 35% of the annual P inflow, but with a possible weak correlation between monthly P sediment/water exchange and monthly precipitation figures. Sediment characteristics likely play an important role in the P sediment-water exchange. High concentrations of P in sediment pore water, and seasonal reductions in the oxidized surface layer of sediment suggests reduction of the potential of the sediment to retain P under current and likely, increased, P loads to the reservoir. Future management of the reservoir, therefore, requires continued monitoring and catchment management to mitigate nutrient both point source and diffuse loads. This necessitates an integrated approach to reduce pressures on the reservoir. Failure to address potential problems can lead to reduced water quality, with associated increased treatment costs for water supply.					; Irvine, Kenneth/M-5756-2013	Carneiro, Charles/0000-0002-4593-9105; Irvine, Kenneth/0000-0002-1010-9064													1735-6865	2008-2304				FAL	2014	8	4					1203	1214																WOS:000344126300035

Each species is subdivided into age and prey-predator groups. There are eight groups altogether. The model takes into account the spatial distribution of the organisms, seasonal birth rate variation, possible habitat pollution, and water streams. A computational experiment has been carried out for pollution in a southern area of Lake Baikal. It demonstrates that the population dynamics tends to an oscillating process with a period of one year. The minimum pollution at total extinction and maximum pollution not affecting the population dynamics are estimated.

The overall average of body weight at birth was 23.78 +/- 3.30 kg (Pd >> 0.05) and the body weight at 360 days was 112.61 +/- 19.29 kg was still different from campaigns (Pd >> 0.05), but not evident for sex and season factors. The body weight gain to 180 days was 36.38 +/- 11.96 kg and body weightgain to 360 days of 86.95 +/- 20.39 kg, with differences between cam paigns (Pd >> 0.05) but not for other factors. The milk production of cows Creole was 397.20 +/- 143.76 kg achieved in 210.83 +/- 33.01 days and production of 1.89 +/- 0.46 kg/day, there were differences between livestock campaigns (Pd >> 0.05); but not between seasons; the production per lactation has varied from 347.30 +/- 131.17 to 467.79 +/- 174.44 kg (Pd >> 0.05); the milking duration from 199.57 +/- 47.67 to 218.43 +/- 48.48 days; and the daily production of 1.64 +/- 0.45 to 2.18 +/- 0.44 kg per lactation (Pd >> 0.05). It is concluded that, in current agroecological conditions, the Creole cattle highland not fully manifest their bioproductive potentials of meat and milk.																			2306-8582	2313-2957				JUL-DEC	2014	16	2					49	56																WOS:000216125100007

A total of 125,746 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained from 12 samples. The composition of bacterial assemblages was different in the outfalls examined,Across the 12 samples analyzed (3 sites sampled in 4 separate months), the most predominant phylum was Proteobacteria, followed by Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria and Firmicutes. While Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in the 12 samples, variation in the classes of Proteobacteria comprising each assemblage were evident. alpha-Proteobacteria accounted for about 10% of all Proteobacteria found and exceeded 50% of the total proteobacterial sequences in several samples. Likewise, alpha-Proteobacteria comprised less than 30% of the total proteobacterial sequences in most samples, but exceeded 80 of the total in several samples. These results suggest that the composition of microbial communities shift in response to seasonal and spatial gradients, which likely reflects variation in the physical and chemical characteristics of the sewage.					; wang, weifeng/N-4140-2013; zhang, dijun/GQP-8906-2022	Zhang, Dijun/0000-0003-3417-9849; 													0973-7510	2581-690X				FEB	2014	8	1					807	815																WOS:000336869500107

At the same time there are expectations to increase this potential which makes it necessary to carry out strict monitoring of water quality. In 2010 a project 'Integrated Support System for Management and Protection of Water Dam Reservoir (ZiZOZap)' was initiated, which led to creation of an innovative system of continuous monitoring of selected physical and chemical parameters of limnic and potamic waters in certain research cross-sections. Continuous monitoring of physical and chemical properties of water is done with the use of automatic multi-parametre probes DS5X by OTT Messtechnik GmbH, measuring the following parameters: water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, redox potential, specific conductance, chlorophyll, turbidity as well as ammonia, nitrate and chloride content. The probes have a self-cleaning system that removes dirt from the electrodes before each measurement, which guarantees maximum reliability of tests. The probes can test 16 parameters at the same time. Results are collected in the probe's memory (120 000 measurements) and their interval may be programmed at one's discretion. Measurements with the use of automatic probes providing continuous access to the results regardless of the weather, season, day or meteorological conditions are the future of monitoring water quality. Continuous monitoring sets a trend for modern measurement methodology of water quality. The results obtained in this way are much more representative than the ones obtained in the traditional way. Traditional monitoring based on rare measurements in an annual cycle in specific conditions may lead to false conclusions about the state of the subject of research. This mainly concerns parameters with great day to day variability such as turbidity, chlorophyll concentration and dissolved oxygen. Continuous monitoring of physical and chemical parameters of water shows changes in the observed indexes, not only seasonal but also round the clock. This improves the possibility of proper interpretation of the obtained values and the speed of reaction to threats, so important for the reservoir supplying water to over 3 million people.					; Matysik, Magdalena/AAH-6936-2019; Ruman, Marek/S-9533-2017; Absalon, Damian/A-1139-2011	Matysik, Magdalena/0000-0002-5424-5703; Absalon, Damian/0000-0001-7504-4962													0867-7816						2014	20						329	340																WOS:000470190200027

J	Becks, BAP; Metin, H				Becks, B. Ayca Polat; Metin, Huseyin			A Votive Stele with Plouton-Kore Depiction from Pisidia and Some Remarks on the Local Cult	ADALYA												The votive stele presented in this article was found in the village of Kecili on the border of the Bucak district of Burdur and is currently housed at the Burdur Museum. The Kecili village is located on the southeast foot of Kestel Dagi, in the Kilde Bogazi Mevkii between the lakes of Kestel (Paludes) and Anbahan. This location corresponds to southwest fringe of ancient Pisidia (Fig. 1). The site was presented to the academic world by G. E. Bean, who published the materials reused in the village cemetery. The Yaniktas sanctuary located about 2 km. northwest of the village was identified by Ozsait during his longitudinal surveys across the region and was evaluated in his publications. The stele of yellowish grey limestone measures 31 cm. wide and 32 cm. tall. On its front side is the figural scene in high relief placed within a naiskos, which has a triangular pediment supported by somewhat-Doric piers (Fig. 2). The high pediment is framed with a moulding. The recessed tympanum features the head of Medusa in the middle (Fig. 2, 6). The scene is composed of two human figures depicted frontally (Fig. 2). Between them is the Cerberus given as an attribute (Fig. 2, 4). On the right is a seated figure of a bearded male. He is dressed with a mantle over chiton and holding a sceptre with his left hand; his right hand is resting on the head of Cerberus. The figure's left leg carries his weight, and he is depicted with long hair (Fig. 4). On the left is a female figure standing (Fig. 2, 5). Her left leg carries her weight while the right leg is slightly bent at the knee and stretched backward. She carries a high polos-kalathos-type headgear over her hair which is tied in a bun. Her veil hangs from her head down to her knees. Over her chiton is a diagonal himation fastened on the left shoulder (Fig. 5). The seated male figure conforms to the iconography of Hades, Plouton and Sarapis with his attributes of the sceptre of dominion and Cerberus. This is the type of Sarapis Alexandria, which was frequently used for Hades Plouton outside Alexandria. A beautiful example is found at Pamukkale Museum: the freestanding figure from the Hierapolis theatre dated to the Severan period (Fig. 7). Particularly the motion of the mantle on the lap and the way it is fastened on the left shoulder is the same as the example from Kecili (Figs. 4, 7). Although the Kecili example conforms to the Sarapis Alexandria cultic depictions, the coiffure, the composition of the costume and absence of headgear indicate a depiction closer to Hades Plouton (Figs. 4, 7). The same is also valid for the female figure. The long chiton and diagonal himation, high polos on the head, and long veil or mantle do not conform to any depiction of Isis but rather repeats that of Persephone/Kore (Fig. 5). Furthermore, lack of any attributes indicating Isis supports her identification as Kore. The careful local style observed on the Kecili stele suggests its production at Pisidian workshops. The closest parallel is found in two pieces embedded in the wall of an old house again at Kecili (Fig. 8). In spite of similarity in composition, this example differs from the example presented here with respect to some details such as the lack of a pediment over the naiskos and the male figure wearing a kalathos. Depictions on coins are of importance for the identification and dating of the Kecili stele as a reflection of seasonally changing cults in the region. Plouton types are found on the coins of Sagalassos, Olbasa, Cremna, Amblada and Seleucia Pieria from the 211 and 3rd centuries A.D. Plouton is depicted usually enthroned, holding a sceptre of dominion or ear of wheat and the other hand on Cerberus. On the other hand, Sarapis is usually depicted as a head on the coins. It is seen as an Alexandria type at Adada, while he is depicted standing on a coin of Caracalla from Pogla. Depictions of Isis are usually busts or heads, and only at Apollonia is she given together with Sarapis and Harpocrates. On each example Sarapis wears a kalathos, thus moving away from the Kecili stele. Plouton/Kore and/or Sarapis/Isis are frequently encountered in the inscriptions or coins in Pisidia, especially in southwest Pisidia during the 2nd-3rd centuries A.D. The best example is two inscriptions on Plouton-Kore worship from near the find-spot of the stele. It is observed that for Plouton and Sarapis the common type preferred is Sarapis Alexandria and that their chthonic aspects bringing fertility to the soil were venerated. Plouton is especially rendered in Alexandria type almost each time but differentiating himself from Sarapis through his coiffure and lack of headgear. On the other hand, Sarapis is seen sometimes standing or sometimes together with Isis and Harpocrates, and he always wears his high kalathos. Isis can be identified with her typical attributes such as horn, sun disk, crescent, lotus or cornucopia. In this context the Kecili stele does not conform to the depictions of Sarapis and Isis in Pisidia and approaches more to Plouton-Kore with its coiffure, costume arrangement and attributes. The closest parallel stele from Kecili also differs because it has a less careful rendering, and it is closer to various deity and heros depictions of the 3rd century AD in rock reliefs at Yaniktas (Fig. 8). The sanctuary located northwest of Kecili was dedicated to Plouton-Kore as is clearly understood from the inscriptions and it probably came into use during the Hellenistic period. The subterranean chamber inside the temple is a perfect example for a chthonic cult, and similar chambers are known from other Demeter-Persephone sanctuaries in other regions. The niched phase of the sanctuary is dated to the 2nd century A.D. The Kecili stele differs from other votive stelae and reliefs in the region because of its high quality and detailed workmanship. The Kore figure features a ratio of 1/6.5 for head/body while Plouton is rendered bigger (Fig. 1). The faces are given a roundish ovoid. The rock reliefs at Yaniktas and the other stele from Kecili feature local workshops, frozen motion, drapes of cloth that are linear and hard, and head/body ratios under 1/5. Thus they differ the from the stele presented here, and they should be dated later. These examples are dated to the 2nd-3rd centuries A.D in publications, but their rendering favours the third century. The high-quality workmanship, naturalistic look, hair in anastole style, drapes reflecting the motion and faces almost round observed on the Plouton-Kore stele suggest, on the other hand, the mid-2nd century A.D. This dating also conforms to the inscription from Plouton-Kore sanctuary at Kaynarkale and probably indicates a rise in the cult during this period.

This exceptional event is considered within the framework of the palaeoenvironmental evolution of the lake basin and on a larger scale, within the evolution of the Adamawa plateau. Sedimentological, mineralogical and geochemical analyses are used to determine the source of the compacted clayey clasts which are packed in this debris-flow and then to cast new light on the mechanism of this sedimentary process. The dark and compacted muddy clasts show the same abundance of siderite and vivianite concretions as the hydromorphic soils (gleys) which are extensive on the western side of the lake. The gleyed soils, dating to between 2540 and 5229 cal yrs BP, correspond to prograding deltaic deposits of the Mandjara River while eastward the more sandy deposits attest to the close presence of the basement rock (granite and gneiss) and colluvial reworking. The deposition of the debris-flow occurred just before the flooding on the depression of the new Lake Assom and testifies to a growing seasonal and/or interannual irregularity of the precipitation. This event is compared to the frequent oscillations of the surface level of the crater lakes of the nearby region of Ngaoundere. In Lake Tizong, a 78 cm-thick pyroclastic debris and allochtonous organic supply were, according to the authors, abruptly deposited, a process which we can, by analogy with Assom, also interpret as debris-flow. This deposit is bracketed by two radiocarbon dates (1490 and 2230 cal yrs BP). In spite of the rough coincidence of the dates of the events of Assom and Tizong, we cannot envisage contemporaneous events, but rather the recurrent influence of the same threshold conditions related to a critical phase of climatic transition.																			2372-5907		978-1-315-81505-3; 978-1-138-00116-9				2014	32						123	141																WOS:000355935900006

Investigating long-term trends and seasonal patterns in these variables is essential in order to describe changes in lake characteristics. In this paper, several modelling approaches which consist of parametric and nonparametric regression models are applied to determine the trends over time and seasonal patterns in each of these two variables, from 1987 to 2005. Two sites of interest are Cailness and Creinch, which are located in the north and south basins, of Loch Lomond, respectively. The results show there is a significant trend in surface water temperature at Cailness. However, no significant trend is suggested in chlorophyll at both sites and there is evidence of constant seasonal patterns for all of the variables, at both sites.					; Mohamad Hamzah, Firdaus/ACV-4654-2022; Ismail, Mohd Tahir/A-7280-2018	MOHAMAD HAMZAH, FIRDAUS/0000-0002-6750-6183; Sabri, Rijal/0000-0002-0824-4283; 													0094-243X		978-0-7354-1241-5				2014	1605						923	927		10.1063/1.4887713	http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4887713													WOS:000341564600158

In late May and early June the seasonal heating of water upper layer produced pronounced thermal stratification before bottom mud was not heated enough. By the middle July the thermal stable stratification produced by was destroyed under the influence of strong wind. Under these conditions stable thermocline-type stratification was formed as a result of diurnal heating of the upper layer by 0.2...1.0 degrees C. Classification of types of stratification was proposed to identify its role on water quality of plane river reservoirs. Parameters of stability of stratified flow in the reservoir in terms of the Brent frequency and Richardson number were estimated. A significant decrease in species production and diversity was associated with the seasonal decline in temperature. Preliminary conclusion about the effect of stratification is that the bundle leads to increased concentrations of cyanobacteria and their dominance, while stirring enhances diatoms competitiveness.

S	Iwasaki, S		Shaw, R		Iwasaki, Shimpei			Adapting Fisheries to Climate Change: Community-Based and Scientific-Oriented Fisheries Management of Saroma Lake, Hokkaido	COMMUNITY PRACTICES FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION IN JAPAN	Disaster Risk Reduction											This chapter presents a case study of Saroma Lake fisheries by highlighting adaptive responses to risk reduction coupled with climate change. Saroma Lake is the southernmost area of seasonal sea ice distribution in the northern hemisphere. Changes in temperature are likely to impact negatively on the ice-covered ecosystem and fishing production in the lake where the fishers need to adapt to the impacts. The case study reveals that innovative efforts performed by the fishers and researchers have been made by applying community-based and scientific-oriented fisheries management. The fishers united together and built an integrated body, leading them to achieve cooperative fishery governance system. The system not only ensures a holistic approach to respond to changes in the lake ecosystem, but also reduces a range of risks through active use of scientific knowledge by employing full-time researchers in their structure as well as strengthening interactions between fishers and outside researchers. The employed researchers work on problems of interest to the fishers and search workable the solutions. Permanent or long-term residency can allow them to interpret concerns of the fishers and act in a leading role in the coordination of adaptive fisheries development. Based on the Saroma Lake experience, this chapter will provide potential initiatives to help develop a pathway for linking fisheries management to risk reduction.																			2196-4106		978-4-431-54246-9; 978-4-431-54245-2				2014							227	238		10.1007/978-4-431-54246-9_13	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-4-431-54246-9_13	10.1007/978-4-431-54246-9												WOS:000386459200014

In this study, we determine heavy metal concentrations (Fe, Al, Cd, Cr, Co, Mn, Cu, Hg, B, Ni, Pb, and Zn) together with their spatial distribution, degree of pollution, and potential ecological risk in Egirdir Lake sediments. This region is wealthy in both floristic and faunistic aspects. Four different stations were chosen as sampling points. Samples were taken every three months, and the seasonal and annual average concentration of the elements was determined. The accumulated average heavy metal amounts were found ordered as Fe>Al>Mn>Cr> Ni> Pb>Zn>Cu>Co>Cd in bottom sediments, respectively. Hg and B were not determined in bottom sediments. Heavy metal contents were measured with ICP-OES. The results from analysis show high positive correlations among metals.

The aim was to monitor the development of these ponds in terms of hydrochemical parameters and the occurrence of algae and cyanobacteria. From each pond a sample of water was taken to analyze and measure the amounts of ammoniacal, nitrite and nitrate nitrogen, chlorides, orthophosphate, alkalinity, calcium, chlorophyll a, CODCr, total nitrogen and phosphorus. Dissolved oxygen, pH, the temperature of water, conductivity and transparency were measured in situ. Algae and cyanobacteria were taken using the plankton net and the identified species were divided into four groups (cyanobacteria, green algea, diatoms and others algea). According to the analyzed chemical parameters, following the method of Government Order No. 61/2003, the water was classified as "cyprinid water". In all the ponds there is a significant fluctuation in pH. The biggest pond, Slunak, is the most stable. Cyanobacteria and algae gradually colonized all the ponds. In total, 61 species occurred (cyanobacteria 8 species and 53 species algae). The most numerous taxa were green algae (Chlorophyta), which dominated in the ponds Slunak, Vrbatec, Mokrak and Jasanak. The exception was the pond Olsovnik, where the other algae prevail (Euglenophyta and Cryptophyta). On the basis of identified taxa algae and cyanobacteria, the ponds are eutrophic.

J	Mieczan, T				Mieczan, Tomasz			DIFFERENTIATION OF MICROBIAL LOOP COMPONENTS IN SMALL ANTHROPOGENIC RESERVOIRS	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The interactions between bacteria and heterotrophic protists are essential for the ecosystem ecology of freshwater. The basic objective of the study was to analyse the seasonal dynamics of changes in particular elements of the microbial loop (bacteria, flagellates and ciliates) in various types of small water bodies. The classification into particular trophic groups of ciliates and the role of the organisms in the functioning of the microbial loop was also analysed. The abundance and biomass of microbial communities has been assessed in eight reservoirs of varied origin (peat pits, clay pits and post-mining reservoirs), in order to test a hypothesis that the microbial communities differed among reservoirs and that differences could be related to fertility of habitats. Fieldwork was done from April to November 2010-2012. From each reservoirs once a month, three samples were collected with a 5-litre planktonic sampler. Samples were taken on two stations: pelagic located in the deepest part of each reservoirs and littoral. The density and biomass of bacteria and protists significantly differed between the studied reservoirs, with the lowest numbers in the peat pits and clay pits and the highest in the post-mining reservoirs. All of the studied reservoirs were generally dominated by ciliates belonging to the orders Oligotrichida and Scuticociliatida constituted > 30% of the total numbers. In all reservoirs bacterivorous ciliates occurred in the highest numbers, while predators ones in the lowest. Generally, concentrations of nutrients (especially total phosphorus) is not a factor having the strongest effect on the abundance of bacteria and heterotrophic flagellates and the number and strength of correlations between microbial loop components. The relations demonstrated between bacteria and protists point to an important process of matter and energy flow from bacteria to higher trophic levels. In peat pits, relations between bacteria and ciliates were stronger. Only in clay pits and post-mining reservoirs the correlation between bacteria and heterotrophic flagellates were found.

Market Garden Production Systems in the Periurban Area of Mahajanga: Determinants of Agricultural Practices of Organic Fertilizer for Technical Innovation	INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON URBAN AND PERI-URBAN HORTICULTURE IN THE CENTURY OF CITIES: LESSONS, CHALLENGES, OPPORTUNITIES	Acta Horticulturae				International Symposium on Urban and Peri-Urban Horticulture in the Century of Cities - Lessons, Challenges, Opportunities	DEC 05-09, 2010	Dakar, SENEGAL	Int Soc Hort Sci				The development of urban agriculture as market gardening is essential because it can provide food and incomes for growing populations. But urban market gardening systems are hampered by various constraints, among which is difficult access to mineral and organic fertilizer inputs. Urban areas offer a diversity of organic resources that could be used in cropping systems: but before proposing and testing fertilizers in urban agriculture, it is necessary to have an accurate description of the farming systems and soil fertility management practices of farmers, as well as the agronomic characteristics of locally available organic resources. In Mahajanga, Madagascar, a study was carried out to characterize market gardening systems with a focus on fertilization practices and their alternatives with the town resources. Cultivation and fertilization management were recorded weekly on a sample of farms (n=12) during two years, and the results were then tested through a survey on a larger sample of farmers (n=30). The market gardens were usually located around a waterhole (close to lakes or in lowlands). After the rainy season, plots of leafy vegetables, 12-14 m(2) in size, were planted progressively following the rice crop and as flood waters dried up. Each farmer had only a small plot of land and had to crop intensively. Most farmers cultivated plants with short growing cycles (e.g., 21 days), predominately Brassicaceae. Concerning soil fertility management practices, organic inputs (manure) and mineral nitrogen (urea) were mainly used. The organic or mineral fertilizer was always spread on the soil surface after crops had been transplanted, and were renewed at each planting cycle or each cut of long-cycle leafy vegetables. It is expected that fertilizers ensure three functions: fertilizer, amendment and mulch. All these functions have to be taken into account to propose new organic fertilizers as municipal wastes compost to respond to the scarcity and high cost of manure and urea.																			0567-7572		978-94-62610-08-8				2014	1021						271	274		10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1021.23	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1021.23													WOS:000343861400023

Investigation of the Vertical Movement of the Great Lake Using Times Series of GPS Data	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 27TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNICAL MEETING OF THE SATELLITE DIVISION OF THE INSTITUTE OF NAVIGATION (ION GNSS 2014)	Institute of Navigation Satellite Division Proceedings of the International Technical Meeting				27th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite-Division of the Institute-of-Navigation (ION GNSS)	SEP 08-12, 2014	Tampa, FL	Inst Navigat, Satellite Div				Height Modernization Program, which has been designed and is being implemented by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) is an ongoing operation focused on forming accurate, reliable heights using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology in conjunction with traditional leveling, gravity, and modern remote sensing information. The traditional method for determining the elevation of vertical benchmarks is differential leveling; the disadvantages of this technique are high cost, time consumption, and nonsystematic errors (Roman & Weston, 2011). With the advance and expansion of space-based technology, GNSS surveying has been used extensively for the production and propagation of survey control. In order for GNSS-derived ellipsoidal heights to have any physical meaning in a surveying or engineering application, the ellipsoidal heights must be transformed to orthometric heights. Accurate heights are required in numerous engineering, scientific and every-day human activities, such as mapping and construction engineering, transportation applications and navigation, where the requirement for accurate heights is not limited to but is used for periodic system calibrations and quality control check; disaster preparedness and management (e.g. evacuation route surveys, flood mapping); measuring, monitoring, and modeling crustal motion, subsidence, glacial isotactic adjustment (GIA) and seasonal changes. In order to assure high accuracy and maintainability of the height system, any change in the location of the benchmarks must be continuously monitored, and any necessary changes recorded. To this end this study analyzes using GNSS (limited to GPS only data in this study) the vertical movement of the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes are a vast hydraulic system with water levels and flows influenced by engineered channels and control structures. The existing problem for The Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River region are the postglacial rebound or glacial isostatic adjustment effect, fluctuations on a short-term, seasonal, and long-term basis (Zilkoski, 1991). The absolute rate of change at a given location must be considered along with the relative rate of change across the region. The study involves reprocessing and readjustment of the International Great Lakes Datum of 1985 (IGLD 85) Height Modernization projects (1997, 2005, and 2010), using OPUS-PROJECT (REFERENCE!!!) in a consistent reference frame (IGS08 or ITRF08) at the epoch of each survey. This allowed for the observation of any changes over time, without including either changes in reference frame or processing software/algorithms. This activity assured a modern, up-to-date evaluation of real movement in the Great Lakes region. Additionally a times series analysis using the longest available spans of continuous references station throughout the Great Lakes region. This allowed for the observation of any long term trends and seasonal variations. Further this study would look at the comparison of the GPS derived vertical velocities and that derived from GIA model. Overall this paper would establish how vertical movement can be accounted for when deriving centimeter level height derived from GPS.																			2331-5911	2331-5954					2014							635	644																WOS:000356331200056

Content As Irrigation Water Quality: Orhaneli, Emet And Mustafakemalpasa Streams Feeding the Lake Uluabat	JOURNAL OF TEKIRDAG AGRICULTURE FACULTY-TEKIRDAG ZIRAAT FAKULTESI DERGISI												The aim of the study is to assess boron content of Emet, Orhaneli and Mustafakemalpa?a streams in Susurluk basin. Mustafakemalpa?a stream consist of a blend of Orhaneli and Emet streams and ends to a very important ramsar site, Lake Uluabat. The water quality data were obtained from Turkish General Directorate of Electrical Power Recourses Survey and Development Administration (EIE). Samples were taken between 1995-2008 for Emet stream, 1984-2008 for Mustafakemalpa?a and 2005-2008 for Lake Uluabat. The water samples for Orhaneli stream were taken from two different locations and the sampling years were 1992-2008 for one location, 2005-2008 for other location. The mean boron contents of those two locations on Orhaneli stream were measured 0.13 and 0.18 ppm and found safe as irrigation water. Boron content in Emet stream increased dramatically after 2004. While mean boron content was 4.68 ppm before 2004, it increased up to 28.24 ppm after 2004. This data reveals that while, earlier than 2004 the stream water should not have been used as irrigation water, later than 2004, it became even more dangerous to habitat and perhaps to human life. In the irrigation seasons (between March and September), mean boron content was 0.90 ppm until 2004 and then increased up to 3.22 ppm after 2004. Pollution in Emet stream moved into Mustafakemalpasa stream and made it unusable as irrigation water. Since there was no data earlier than 2004 for The Lake Uluabat, it was not possible to reveal the change in boron content. On the other hand, data between 2005 and 2008 shows that especially in irrigation season (March-September) mean boron content was 5.60 ppm, which this makes the lake unsuitable for irrigation.

The results show that : In the 350-2500nm range, typical alpine wetland vegetation communities generally have four spectral reflection peak and three reflection Valley. For most of the vegetation, there are obvious green peak in the visible. Due to vegetation chlorophyll content decreased in the late growing season, vegetation green peak may disappear. Within the measuring band for different alpine wetland vegetation communities, the reflectance maximum occurs at infrared wavelengths between 750-1450nm. The difference between different vegetation communities spectral is not the same, smaller in Visible bands, relatively larger in infrared. Using spectroradiometer to messure vegetation communities spectrum, it occurs abnormal fluctuations in the 1850nm and 2500nm vicinity. The results can provide technical support for hyperspectral image interpretation and classification about alpine wetland ecosystems typical vegetation and offer a scientific basis for the remote monitoring of large-scale typical alpine wetland ecosystems vegetation distribution and dynamics.																					978-1-60595-166-9				2014							248	253																WOS:000351909800046

FEATURES OF CHANNEL PROCESSES IN NORTHERN ZABAIKALYE DURING MODERN CLIMATE CHANGES	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												High waters on rivers and channel processes associated with it often lead to numerous emergency situations in a region. On July 27, 2001 at the place of Leprindo Railway Station due to continuous rains at the Kodar Range water-rock mudflow was formed as a result of a breakthrough of a small glacier lake, which destroyed the railway tracks at the Baikal-Amur Mainline site from 1659 till 1661 km. On July 2, 2010 the Chara River flooded 43 houses in the Chara Village. The level of the water increased highly and reached the depth of 4.76 m with the level of flood-lands of 3.6 m. The high water destroyed part of the Chara-Novaya Chara highway. Its embankment was a dam to hold back flood waters. The breakthrough occurred in the culvert that did not cope with the increased flow rate and the flow threw it a few meters away from the place of installation. The length of the washed out area is greater than 50 m. A similar situation occurred in August 2011 and in July 2012. The analysis of archival materials showed that the number of high waters leading to activation of channel processes in recent years increased in Northern Zabaikalye. Studying of channel processes is an essential task at the present stage in connection with the considerable climate changes leading to transformation of hydrogeological and frozen ground conditions. Change of frozen ground conditions influences channel processes, especially within hollows of the Baikal type where the lithogenic base is presented by fine soil-sand, sandy loams, loams. As a result of the increase of the average annual air temperature the temperature of rocks at the depth of zero annual amplitudes increased by 0.9 degrees, the depth of the layer of seasonal thawing of rocks increased. The increase of the latter leads to greater intensity of erosive processes. Within ranges channel processes are greatly affected by coarse-grained flow of material coming from the slopes and ice. The increase of average annual temperatures most significantly affected formation of ice of river waters and ice with the mixed type of feed. Reduction of morphometric parameters of flood ice in the long-term cycle leads to a displacement of the altitude position of nivation formation and to displacement of the level of erosion activities of the watercourse in the initial period of the destruction of flood ice. The activity of glaciers has a considerable impact on processes forming beds of the rivers in Northern Zabaikalye. In some cases above final moraine lines there are glacier-dammed lakes. The increase of average annual temperatures and degradation of long term frozen ground rocks in the areas of glacier-dammed lakes can be a disaster for Northern Zabaikalye, as in the case of Leprindo. Most of the streams of Verkhnecharsky and Muisko-Kuandinsky river basins, especially in their upper courses are not well-studied yet. Identification of potentially dangerous sites of breakthrough taking into account the high seismic activity of the area represents one of the major tasks at the present stage.																			1561-7793	1561-803X				SEP	2013		374					177	+																WOS:000421550800039
J	Sorino, R; Scorrano, S; Giunchi, D; Corriero, G				Sorino, Rocco; Scorrano, Serena; Giunchi, Dimitri; Corriero, Giuseppe			Waterbird Community Structure and Habitat Availability in Lago Salso (Gargano National Park, Apulia, Southern Italy)	WATERBIRDS												The structure of the waterbird community at Lago Salso in Southern Italy, Apulia, was surveyed over a 4-year period (2003-2006), during the breeding season (May-July). Lago Salso is an artificial lake with high water levels. Flooding of the surrounding fields, due to copious seasonal rainfalls, occasionally forms vast swampy wetlands around Lago Salso. The variation in waterbird structure and composition, concomitantly with the occurrence of these flooded habitats, is described. In particular, during 2003-2005 there was little variation in annual species richness and diversity at the lake. However, in 2006 the waterbird community changed in species composition and significantly increased in species richness (from 21 +/- 3.8 to 32 +/- 2.5 species) and abundance values (from 222 +/- 167 to 988 +/- 42.4 individuals) with the presence of wet grasslands. Lago Salso is one of the most Important Bird Areas on the Italian peninsula, and the occurrence of several species with high conservation value almost exclusive to wet grassland has important implications from a conservation point of view. The formations of temporary flooded meadows are rare in the south of Italy, and our results emphasize the need to define management guidelines for the maintenance of such flooded grasslands.

J	Talling, JF				Talling, Jack F.			Systematic variation in the logarithmic ranges in abundance of freshwater phytoplankton populations	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The logarithmic scaling of species abundance in phytoplankton populations enables the relative ranges of species between periodic (e.g. annual) upper and lower limits to be defined and compared. Examples are discussed mainly from published information on four lakes, two tropical (lakes George and Victoria) and two high-latitude temperate (Windermere and Esthwaite Water), differing in seasonality and predominant environmental factors. Although wide logarithmic ranges (>3 orders, log10 units) do exist in the tropical lakes, there are many examples of narrow ranges (<1.5 orders). In Lake Victoria, the latter are characteristic of species with low maximum abundance measured as biomass that do not appreciably deplete the medium (e.g. of nutrients, light) in a density-dependent manner, but are indirectly regulated by resource depletion caused by more abundant species and by physical mixing, the predominant environmental seasonality. In the seasonally equable tropical Lake George, narrow ranges in numerical abundance are predominant. Some are favoured by recruitment from a considerable past accumulation of viable biomass on the sediment. Annual ranges of under one order are rare in Windermere and Esthwaite Water, and probably in most other temperate lakes, although this value is approached by a few opportunistic' species (e.g. some cryptomonads) of wide environmental tolerance and some species (e.g. Planktothrix agardhii) of enriched shallow lakes. There is little information for species of very low abundance. Examples are given of logarithmic plots of a measure of total phytoplankton biomass with time. Annual ranges are markedly less than those of the major individual component species, indicating species replacement.																			0046-5070					JUL	2013	58	7					1503	1511		10.1111/fwb.12151	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12151													WOS:000319946000018

The bluegill population in the river was divided into two groups based on the water flows in their habitats. Fish that inhabited the lotic upstream area exhibited significantly higher C-13 values than those in the lentic downstream area. The N-15 values of females in the upstream area significantly exceeded those in the downstream area, whereas those of males did not differ significantly between the two areas. Females in the downstream area had significantly larger ovaries than those in the upstream area. Males exhibited no such difference in gonad size between the areas. Possible reasons for the differences in carbon sources, gonad sizes, and GSI between the two areas are discussed.

J	Vélez-Castaño, JD; Gómez-Giraldo, A				Daniel Velez-Castano, Jose; Gomez-Giraldo, Andres			Multilayer models to estimate periods of natural oscillation modes in tropical lakes and reservoirs	TECNOLOGIA Y CIENCIAS DEL AGUA												Internal waves are essential to energy transfer processes in stratified water bodies. To understand their effects and implications for the energy balance of a water body, it is necessary to know its spatial structure and period. In tropical zones, the thermal stratification in the water column is not as strong as in zones with climatic seasons. In the latter zones, the stratification can be described with models having few layers because the epilimnion and hypolimnion are easily distinguishable, while in tropical zones significant temperature gradients are observed through most of the water column, so describing the stratification with few layers can lead to unreliable estimates. In this paper, a multilayer model is developed to calculate periods of natural oscillation modes in lakes and reservoirs with stratification typical of tropical zones. The stratification is simplified by assuming uniform density layers and the water body is considered to have a horizontal flat bottom. The model solves the eigenvalues and eigenvectors problem corresponding to sets of celebrities and the spatial structures of natural modes of oscillation. It is shown that a three-layer model is inadequate to estimate the celebrities of the natural modes of oscillation of the Porce II tropical reservoir.

AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Large Lake Peipsi (3555km(2)) is divided between two countries, Estonia (44%) and Russia (56%). The southernmost part of the lake, Lake Pihkva, is almost entirely (99%) in Russia, and is continuously being polluted by the greatest inflow to Lake Peipsi, the insufficiently purified River Velikaya. Research on this lake (Lake Peipsi) in the growing season has been possible as a result of EstonianRussian joint expeditions (20032010) in the month of August. Our study has demonstrated statistically significant variances in the hydrochemistry and zoo- and phytoplankton data between the lake parts. Several parameters used for characterizing the lake's ecosystem were considerably higher for Lake Pihkva than for the larger Lake Peipsi s.s. These include increases in TP concentration (3x); TN (2x); Chlorophyll a (3x); biomass of cyanobacteria (4x); Microcystis (4x); Aphanizomenon (5x); abundance of Chydorus sphaericus (5x); Keratella tecta (8x). However, several values were lower in Lake Pihkva than in Lake Peipsi: water transparency (3x); ratio between zoo- and phytoplankton biomasses (2x); cladoceran mean weight (3x); abundance of Eudiaptomus gracilis (1.5x); abundance of Kellicottia longispina (1.8x). Different natural conditions (topography, catchment area, relative depth) and different pollution loads in the lake parts have resulted in apparently different resistances in their ecosystems and different responses to human activity. At present, on the basis of TP data (up to 200mg m(3)), Lake Pihkva appears to act a polluter of adjacent lake part rather than a purification pond.																			1463-4988					APR 1	2013	16	2			SI		198	204		10.1080/14634988.2013.787876	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2013.787876													WOS:000318973400026

A Dynamic Habitat Mudflat Model for The Coorong, South Australia	20TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2013)					20th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 01-06, 2013	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Univ S Australia, Ctr Ind & Appl Math, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, GOYDER Inst, Govt S Australia, Australian Math Soc, Australian Math Sci Inst, Simulat Australia, Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math				The Coorong is a 2-3 km wide lagoon running parallel to the coast for approximately 100 km from the Murray Mouth in South Australia. It provides an important habitat for a wide range of bird species, and in particular has been listed as a Ramsar wetland due to its exceptional importance for migratory waterbirds. Using an extensive dataset of high resolution bathymetry data with the outputs of a CSIRO hydrodynamic model detailing hourly water level and salinity along the Coorong for given flow scenarios, we developed a dynamic habitat model for key bird species. The GIS-based model predicts the availability and viability of mudflats, defined as soft sediment areas that are either immersed or covered by no more than 12 cm of water, where most waterbird foraging occurs. Mudflat availability varies spatially and temporarily along the Coorong, and is influenced by tide, wind, rainfall and evaporation, some of which are dependent on the distance from the Murray Mouth and are affected by seasonal variation. The modelling of mudflats at different water levels suggests that an average water level of 0.12 m AHD gives the maximum average mudflat area across the majority of the Coorong. We present a model that can be run for any given flow scenario over any time period for any site along the Coorong. However, this model can be easily modified for use in different environments where water level-habitat interactions are important. For the Coorong, it is important for managers to understand the influence of both water level and salinity on mudflat habitats as well as the aquatic habitats for fish, macrophyte and infauna. The spatial model developed for this study allows managers to readily quantify these habitats for specified flow scenarios, and supports informed decisions on the amount and frequency of barrage outflows from the Lower Lakes when excess water is available for environmental improvement and maintenance of the Coorong.																					978-0-9872143-3-1				2013							1596	1602																WOS:000357105901091

The abundance of prokaryotes was determined by epifluorescence microscopy after DAPI staining, and phylogenetic diversity was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with group-specific, fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes. In SW bacteria made up most of the entire community of DAPI-stained microorganisms (54-69%) and in SM bacteria made up only 33-44% of DAPI-stained microorganisms. Archaea corresponded to a small fraction of both bacterioneuston and bacterioplankton. The counts of Archaea and bacteria were significantly higher in SW than in SM. Among all proteobacteria included in the research, gamma-proteobacteria represented the most abundant fraction: 42-72% in SM and 39-61% in SW. Statistical analysis revealed that the abundance of gamma-proteobacteria is positively correlated with temperature and with dissolved oxygen. beta-proteobacteria were the least abundant fraction.					; Burkowska-But, Aleksandra/G-7832-2014; Walczak, Maciej/G-7348-2014	Burkowska-But, Aleksandra/0000-0002-7449-4678; Walczak, Maciej/0000-0002-1039-9516													1230-1485	2083-5906					2013	22	4					1023	1030																WOS:000323402700004

DEVELOPING A REGIONAL METHODOLOGY FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION IN THE NILE BASIN	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY	Proceedings of the International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology				13th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology (CEST)	SEP 05-07, 2013	Athens, GREECE	Univ Aegean, Global Network Environm Sci & Technol				The Nile Basin is the main source of water in the North Eastern Region of Africa and represents one of the most critical and perhaps most important shared water basins in Africa. Runoff is generated in less than a third of the basin. On average 86 percent of the annual flow is generated in the Ethiopian highlands a region known for its high seasonal and inter-annual variability. The region is facing rising levels of water scarcity, high population growth, watershed degradation and loss of environmental services. Many past studies have demonstrated that modelling current and future changes in river runoff presents a number of challenges; the large size of the basin, the complexity of the hydrology the Nile Basin exhibits one of the most extensive system of lakes and wetlands in the world with little known hydrology, the relative scarcity of data, its geographical location and the corresponding dramatic variety of climatic conditions. On top of these hydrological challenges, the climate projections are inherently uncertain. Nevertheless decision-makers in the region need to evaluate and implement climate adaptation measures. Within trans-boundary basins like the Nile, the implementation of such measures may need to address the basin as a whole and evaluate alternatives to avoid regrettable outcomes. Therefore tools and information are required to understand climate change and adaptation impacts at the regional scale. A modelling framework to support climate adaptation on a regional scale has been developed by DHI and the UK Met Office for the project "Adapting to climate change induced water stress in the Nile River Basin". This project was launched in March 2010 as a partnership between the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI), sponsored by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), for assessing climate change impacts and adaptation potential for floods and droughts within the basin. The methodology exploits a novel perturbed physics ensemble of climate models recently developed at the UK Met Office. A systematic procedure was followed to identify a representative sub-set from a larger GCM ensemble based on the ability of the members to reproduce the key climatic processes in a number of regions of Africa while representing the range of outcomes of the full ensemble. These were then downscaled using a regional climate model with the resulting projections used together with a regional hydrological model, to assess the impacts of climate change on flow extremes and water scarcity. In this paper we present both the framework and initial results of climate changes on the flow characteristics in the basin.					; Mathison, Camilla/ABD-5210-2020; Butts, Michael/JZE-3703-2024	Mathison, Camilla/0000-0002-6269-4605; 													1106-5516		978-960-7475-51-0				2013																								WOS:000346067900274

Lake salinity is influenced by subsurface saline intrusions, occasional barrier overwash together with precipitation and groundwater inflow, leading to poikilohaline conditions. Palaeolimnological reconstructions in Murree support the supposition that the lagoon was once superficially connected to the sea around the mid-nineteenth century. Physical, chemical and biological proxies suggest an evolution to more freshwater conditions. Uncertainties about the timing of the transition persist because of an unresolved sediment chronology. The isolation of Murree from the Atlantic Ocean has promoted the formation of dense charophyte beds composed of lagoonal specialist species, which are able to tolerate large variations in salinity.

A sediment column of 155 cm in length was retrieved by hammer corer in the deepest (24 m) central part of the lake. Solid samples were prepared from the wet cores by freeze drying and impregnating with epoxy resin. The inter annual and inter seasonal variations in the trace element composition of annual layers are studied by means of X-ray scanning microanalysis with synchrotron radiation on the VEPP-3 (Novosibirsk) and BESSY-II (Berlin) storage rings. Profiles of minor element distribution were obtained for K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr and Nb along the upper 180 mm of bottom sediments with a spatial resolution from 100 to 20 mu m, using excitation energies of 12 and 20 keV. Were found geochemical indicators marking the beginning (Ca/Sr ratio) and end (Br/Rb ratio) of the annual cycle of sedimentation. Detailed experimental investigations of the internal structure of annual layers allowed us to create a lithological-geochemical model of sedimentation in Lake Shira, and to find climatically correlated minor elements. This model of the annual cycle of sedimentation was used to explain the periodic white layers with high Sr contents in the core. Thick 3-5 cm light carbonate Sr-enriched intervals correspond to an extremely low level of the lake and are repeated every 450-550 years.

This is to overall optimize energy consumption in a control volume while regulating temperature. Modeling heat flow in a medium is a complicated process. It is essential that all aspects of heat flow, such as conduction, convection and radiation has to be covered in order to accurately predict heat flow. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) enables us to iterate a solution many times quickly and therefore we are capable of solving complicated problems in minutes. However, equations such as turbulence equations of fluids and the heat transfer equations have to be changed into iterable forms and combined into one formula to make a functioning CFD model. This paper will concentrate on the process of deriving such formula. The paper will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the model and how it will be used in further research in the future. The modal will be used to simulate heat flow within a frozen lake through a season, with estimation of how much ice will be formed as well as the minimum and max temperature profile of the lake. The results will be compared with analytical results. The paper will be using Finite Difference Method (FDM) with the help of Tailor expansion to derive the model. The derivative will be similar to Probability density modal as well as the combination of Prandtl's one equation model. The basic equation will be confirmed with Navier Stokes equation. The final discussions will outlive why there are inaccuracies in the derived modal, but how it can be neglected in specific scenarios.																					978-7-302-33544-3				2013							4785	4790																WOS:000343761507010

Case: the Andean Basin Condoriri	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 35TH IAHR WORLD CONGRESS, VOLS III AND IV					35th World Congress of the International-Association-for-Hydro-Environment-Engineering-and-Research (IAHR)	SEP 08-13, 2013	Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res, Chengdu, PEOPLES R CHINA	Minist Water Resources, China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Sichuan Univ, Tsinghua Univ, Univ Hong Kong, Chengdu Municipal Peoples Govt	Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res			The Condoriri glacier is closely related to the water supply of the La Paz - El Alto conurbation. This is a complex basin in a mountainous glacierized area with altitudes above 4400 meters above sea level in the Bolivian Andes. In the upstream it has steep slopes receiving melt water from the Andean glaciers and in the downstream it is a combination of bare ground areas and impoundment areas that regulates the discharge storing water during high floods and releasing water during low flows. Considering that glacier retreat may affect the water resources availability is important to analyze the hydrological response of the basin under climate change scenarios. Development of a hydrological model that simulates water discharges in this dynamic glacierized basin is a key step for predicting and analyzing future water scenarios. The present research describes the framework and application of the semidistributed Supertank model, and its application to the Condoriri basin. The current Supertank model was improved by considering different hydrological responses for glacier and impoundment areas. Results show that the model satisfactorily predicts the runoff and the total water availability. However, it overpredicts the discharge at the end of dry season. This overestimation is due to the effect of the Chiar Kota lake, since at the end of the dry season it has low water levels and stores water from the early rains of the new season. Such result may indicate that if current glacier melting water is greater than the lake storage, future water discharge may be reduced and completely regulated by the Chiar Kota lake.

As a case study, the typical snow cover of Qilian Mountains in northwest China was selected in this paper to develop the algorithm to map snow cover using FY-3A/MERSI. By analyzing the spectral response characteristics of snow and other surface elements, as well as each channel image quality on FY-3A/MERSI, the widely used Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) was defined to be computed from channel 2 and channel 7 for this satellite data. Basing on NDSI, a tree-structure prototype version of snow identification model was proposed, including five newly-built multi-spectral indexes to remove those pixels such as forest, cloud shadow, water, lake ice, sand (salty land), or cloud that are usually confused with snow step by step, especially, a snow/cloud discrimination index was proposed to eliminate cloud, apart from use of cloud mask product in advance. Furthermore, land cover land use (LULC) image has been adopted as auxiliary dataset to adjust the corresponding LULC NDSI threshold constraints for snow final determination and optimization. This model is composed as the core of FY-3A/MERSI snow cover mapping flowchart, to produce daily snow map at 250m spatial resolution, and statistics can be generated on the extent and persistence of snow cover in each pixel for time series maps. Preliminary validation activities of our snow identification model have been undertaken. Comparisons of the 104 FY-3A/MERSI snow cover maps in 2010-2011 snow season with snow depth records from 16 meteorological stations in Qilian Mountains region, the sunny snow cover had an absolute accuracy of 92.8%. Results of the comparison with the snow cover identified from 6 Terra/MODIS scenes showed that they had consistent pixels about 85%. When the two satellite resultant snow cover maps compared with the 6 supervise-classified and expert-verified snow cover maps derived from integrated MERSI and MODIS images, we found FY-3A/MERSI has higher accuracy and stability not only for nearly cloud-free scenes but also the cloud scenes, namely, FY-3A/MERSI data can objectively reflect finer spatial distribution of snow and its dynamic development process, and the snow identification model perform better in snow/cloud discrimination. However, the ability of the FY-3A/MERSI model to discriminate thin snow and thin cloud need to be refined. And the limitation, error sources of FY-3A/MERSI snow products would be assessed based on the accumulation of large amounts of data in the future.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-9806-9				2013	8921								89210R	10.1117/12.2031490	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2031490													WOS:000327588700027

The new approach to study sediment records appeared due to automatic technique for scanning microanalysis of cores in situ. X-ray fluorescence analysis on synchrotron radiation (XRF SR) in the Institute of Nuclear Physics, Novosibirsk was adapted. More than 35 elements with step of measurement > 0.05 mm along fresh opened cores and in solid preparates were determined. Variations of several microelements content appeared to be well correlated with environmental parameters, which were used as a geochemical proxies for statistical treatment and modeling. Elements composing organic component of sediments (Br, I, U) are correlative with mean annual temperature variations because of changes vegetation productivity content in catchment and in waterbody. And elements from clastic mineral part (Rb, Sr, Ti, Y, Zr) reflect annual precipitation, runoff and the proportion of the unweathered terrestrial fraction. X-ray density (XRD) indicates water yield regime and sediment flux. Clastic varves are well-known all over the world, they are formed in glacial and non-glacial lakes, for example, Kucherla, Teletskoe lakes in Altai a.o. Analysis shows graded structure from lower mid-grained material (silt) to upper fine-grained part as usual. The last one contains more weathered (clay) material with a touch of organics. Correspondingly Rb and Br content increase, but XRD, Ti, Sr, Zr and other clastic components decrease upward. Carbonate varves are presented in saline lakes Telmen, Shira and other. Carbonate matter, as Ca, Mg and Sr content, evidences seasonal and long-term salinity fluctuation connected with lake level and aridity. Equilibrium thermodynamic modeling allows to quantify the atmosphere - water - sediment - pore solution system for saline lakes. Computer physicochemical simulation adapted for natural rock-water-gas multisystem of Shira lake is executed by "Selector" software, which used method of thermodynamic potentials minimization under local equilibrium state. For example, estimated salinity effect on Sr concentration proves positive correlation between strontianite content and evaporation/ice cover periods. Time series of lithological-geochemical indicators of climate change, based on counting of annual layers and isotope dating, are calibrated by hydrometeorological data to obtain the functions of variability for relevant parameters beyond instrumental and tree ring limits in the past.

Water samples for analysis were drawn at two sampling stations situated in the north-eastern and the north-western part of the lake. The following water parameters were determined: temperature, pH, total alkalinity, total acidity and dissolved O-2 concentration and water saturation by O-2, COD-Cr, COD-Mn and BOD5, concentrations of NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, TN, SRP, TP and reactive SiO2, as well as concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO42-, and total concentrations of Fe and Mn. It was shown that the investigated waters at both sampling stations differed in the abundance of colloidal matter and suspended organic matter, with very similar abundance of dissolved matter, and were those with relatively low trophy level (mesotrophy), in which weak phytoplankton blooms occurred. Only during the phytoplankton bloom in July, the analysed waters were saturated by O-2 to 110 %, being clearly oxygen-deficient in other study times, which is evidence of the prevalence of dissimilation processes over assimilation in the body of surface water.

Bopili			Consequences of Fluctuations in the Ambient Air Temperature at Lake Tanganyika - A Wavelet Analysis	AFRICAN REVIEW OF PHYSICS												We study the horizontal wind speed fluctuation, ambient air temperature and the water temperature according to its depth. Our study clearly shows how Lake Tanganyika is thermally stratified, showing four different water layers. The study shows how waters of upper layers tend to have the same temperature as the deepest water during the dry season. The water stratification tends then to disappear completely in the dry season. The study is based on the fact that water releases energy to heat the ambient air during the dry season and absorbs heat energy during the rainy season. We analyzed the behavior of the Richardson number in order to better understand the mode of transmission of the exchanged energy between water and ambient air. Fourier and wavelet analyses show that fluctuations in the ambient air temperature should play a major role in the behavior of water and of wind and probably of many other physical processes occurring at Lake Tanganyika site. This work shows the existence of a very large heat reservoir that consists of the great mass of waters of the hypolimnion and of another great heat source at variable temperature that consists of the large mass of atmospheric air surrounding the lake. The heat reservoir with variable temperature, namely the atmospheric ambient air, should ultimately determine the behavior of Lake Tanganyika.																			2223-6589						2013	8						449	462																WOS:000215212100060

The results showed that: the water eutrophication levels of Gucheng Lake were mal-distributed in space and time; the lake eutrophication tendency in flood seasons were more obvious than that in dry seasons; the eutrophication levels in the south part of the lake were relatively lower than that in the north and the average comprehensive mutation of fuzzy membership value in the south was about 0.3006 in the dry seasons. Due to the increased pollution load and the hydrodynamic conditions, the eutrophication degree in the estuary areas were higher and the fuzzy membership value was close to 0.235, achieving the medium eutrophication level.																			1022-6680		978-3-03785-742-7				2013	726-731						2051	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.726-731.2051	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.726-731.2051													WOS:000333767500409

In this paper, Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and the R-style hierarchical Cluster Analysis (CA) are applied in the middle and lower reaches of the Pudu River, a severely polluted river in Southwest China. Since the spatially different reaches showing different characteristics have to be discriminately treated, nine water quality monitoring sites are categorized into three spatial groups based on both the Trophic Level Index (TLI) of each site and the results from the Q-style hierarchical CA before the key parameter identification and the source apportionment. These three groups are as follows: Cluster 1 (C1) containing three upstream sites with the heaviest eutrophication status; Cluster 2 (C2) consisting of three downstream sites with less serious eutrophication status; and Cluster 3 (C3) constituted of three tributary sites with relatively the lightest eutrophication status. The data sets on water quality of 11 parameters in three seasons (dry season, level season and rainy season) were got from three field surveys during 2010 similar to 2011. According to the results got using the R-style hierarchical CA, 3 key parameters are identified for the sites in C1 while 6 for C2 and 7 for C3. Then PMF is used to identify four latent pollutant sources and estimate the contribution of the identified sources to the concentration of the key parameters. The results reveal that the sources are different among the spatial divisions: sources of C1 containing industrial effluents, municipal effluents, phosphorus factories and non-point agricultural run-off; sources of C2 comprised of pollution from upper reaches, non-point agricultural run-off, internal sources and domestic wastewater; sources of C3 made up of non-point agricultural run-off, internal sources, industrial effluents, municipal or domestic wastewater. Additionally, the main pollutant sources to the key parameters are different in C1, C2 and C3. Decision makers could pay the most attention to the main sources of the key parameters before making policy.																					978-7-302-33544-3				2013							3470	3480																WOS:000343761504068

MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE FOR PROTECTION OF THE GREAT LAKES COASTAL NAVIGATION AREAS	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY	Proceedings of the International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology				13th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology (CEST)	SEP 05-07, 2013	Athens, GREECE	Univ Aegean, Global Network Environm Sci & Technol				Protecting harbors or navigable areas requires evaluating maritime structures such as armor stones. Armor rocks are impacted by the natural deteriorating elements such as seasonal weather, and repeated cycles of temperature, flowing water, wetting and drying, wave action, and freeze and thaw cycles. The design process for the determination of armor stone sizes is complex and various factors must be considered to fully understand how the design parameters have effect on stone performance. The main objective of this study was to evaluate and quantify major factors affecting the armor stone durability. The effects of scaling on the test results of various samples of rock types used in Great Lakes coastal projects have been investigated. Field monitoring and laboratory testing have been conducted to evaluate the performance of stone subjected to both freezing and thawing and wetting and drying, and to quantify the combined effects of environmental stresses on armor stone. In addition, long-term performance or deterioration of armor stones have been quantitatively monitored and characterized by the changes in dimensions measured. We have developed stone deterioration software (ARMOR), which integrates field observations with numerical tools to provide an assessment of the local freeze-thaw and wet-dry on the stones. The ARMOR software has several numerical models, which can predict degradation of Armor Stone as rocks are impacted by the natural elements. The software includes a statistical technique (homogeneity index) to characterize rock heterogeneity. Two new numerical approaches have been developed to calculate freeze thaw cycles using long-term site weather data. The software also provides a model to estimate armor weight, minimum crest width, armor thickness, and the number of armor units per unit of area. The calculation uses varying values for the seaward slope and wave height by application of the Hudson formula. The degradation model relates the laboratory test results to the modification of the mass distribution and reduction at the project site. Innovative technologies such as geophysical techniques in stone selection and stonecutting (water saw) are examined for the field applications. This paper describes the latest research developments that improve our understanding of environmental impacts on armor stones in coastal areas with reference to breakage and integrity.

The integrated model was applied to simulate the dynamics and spatial distribution of three algal species in Taihu Lake, China. The lake was divided into 8,181 elements using unstructured triangle grids. For each grid, the water volume and substrate flux were computed by the SELFE model, and then the SALMO was applied to calculate the water quality parameters such as dissolved oxygen, nitrate, phosphate, detritus, zooplankton and biomass of three types of algae (diatoms, green algae and blue-green algae). The model was calibrated by genetic algorithm using the data collected at Meiliang bay from 2009 to 2011. The validation results showed that the modeled algal biomass didn't quite follow the observed seasonal patterns, especially for diatoms and green algae, and the simulated concentration of nitrate continuously raised during the modeling period, reaching a peak eventually. The phosphate and dissolved oxygen were generally in agreement with the filed data. It indicated that the integrated eco-hydrodynamic model might be a promising tool for the predictions of algal blooms in Taihu Lake, but added efforts had to be taken for the improvement of model performance before actually applying it to the whole Taihu Lake.																					978-7-302-33544-3				2013																								WOS:000370410302053
J	Skal'skaya, IA				Skal'skaya, I. A.			Successions of zooperiphyton in a small river	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												In the small Latka River, which is characterized by a high heterogeneity of abiotic characteristics and a rich fauna composition, a high diversity of developing zooperiphyton structures was recorded consisting of invertebrates with short life cycles: the larvae of chironomids, caddisflies, mayflies, oligochaetes, nematodes, and other animals. One distinctive feature of seasonal and interannual zooperiphyton succession is the annual prevalence in abundance of spreading chironomid larvae of age I, which belong to the most representative dominating group of amphibiotic invertebrates, including species adapted to different saprobic conditions. The taxonomic and quantitative domination of chironomids make it possible to consider the family Chironomidae a key group in the formation of the zoocenosis structure. Under disturbed habitat conditions (pollution, rainfall floods, and the press of omnivorous invertebrates), the restoration of typical structures occurs rather quickly due to the particular features of biology in species short life cycles. However, no relative stabilization in communities was observed. This is the main difference between the sequence of succession processes in the Latka River and that observed in large water bodies (lakes and water reservoirs), where there are no strict limitations on living-space volume or food availability and abiotic conditions are more stable, thus allowing filter-feeding sessile animals (sponges, bryozoans, and zebra mussels) to develop on solid substrates. These species are able to develop multispecies consortia and form relatively stable long-term communities.

The study included the basins of the Carana stream, which drains the urban area, and Carrapato stream, located adjacent to this city and has geomorphological characteristics similar to the first stream. The work was supported by the interpretation of satellite images, the identification and mapping of drainage networks before and after urbanization, supported by field visits, as well as the basic survey of the discharge of the two basins. The results showed that urbanization was derived from Boa Vista in a slight increase in the extent of drainage area (2.7km) and a significant reduction of the lake basin Carana stream, represented by the drainage of lakes, with the reduction of these areas 6.77to 3.03km(2). It was found that the low gradient portions of the lake drained and the high volume of precipitated during the high season (May-July), determine a low efficiency in the drainage of these environments. It was verified that urbanization and drainage lacustrines environments resulted in altering the hydrology of the Carana stream, which increased the amplitude of annual discharge, with higher flow rates during the wet season and smaller discharges at the top of the dry season.																			1980-5772	2177-4307				MAY-AUG	2012	6	12					59	84		10.5654/actageo2012.0612.0004	http://dx.doi.org/10.5654/actageo2012.0612.0004													WOS:000216340800005

FLOW AND NUTRIENT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM GROUNDWATER TO A DRAINAGE DITCH IN A BEEF CATTLE RANCH IN THE LAKE OKEECHOBEE BASIN, FLORIDA	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												Pastures in beef cattle ranches are identified as one of the major land uses that contribute phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) loadings to Lake Okeechobee (LO), Florida. A study was conducted to quantify flow, 1 and N contributions from groundwater to a 170 m ditch section within a beef cattle ranch located in the LO basin from June 2005 to May 2009. Groundwater depths and total N (TN) and total P (TP) concentrations measured in five wells, installed on each side (bank) of the ditch section, were combined with the ditch stage and N and P concentrations to quantify groundwater flow and nutrient loads. The Dupuit equation was used to estimate the groundwater flow to and from the ditch. The average net groundwater flow to the ditch section, estimated from a range (low and high) of saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) values, ranged from 765 to 1,729 m(3) per year. Annual groundwater flow contributions were positive (to the ditch) for all four years, while the groundwater nutrient contributions were positive for three years and negative (from the ditch) for one year (drought year). Average net annual TP loads to the ditch section ranged from 0.1 (low) to 0.2 (high) kg, while TN loads ranged from 2.1 (low) to 4.5 (high) kg. Extrapolating the results from this study to the LO basin indicated that groundwater was a major contributor of TP loads to the lake.

Data assimilation of space-based passive microwave soil moisture retrievals and the correction for a dynamic open water fraction	REMOTE SENSING AND HYDROLOGY	IAHS Publication				Remote Sensing and Hydrology Symposium	SEP 27-30, 2010	Jackson Hole, WY	IAHS, Int Commiss Remote Sens				The large observation footprint of low-frequency satellite microwave emissions complicates the interpretation of near-surface soil moisture retrievals. While the effect of sub-footprint lateral heterogeneity is relatively limited under unsaturated conditions, open water bodies, if not accounted for, cause a strong positive bias in the satellite-derived soil moisture retrieval. This bias is generally assumed to be static and associated with large continental lakes and coastal areas. Temporal changes in the extent of smaller water bodies as small as a few percent of the sensor footprint size, however, can also cause significant and dynamic biases. We analysed the influence of open water on near-surface soil moisture retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) for three areas in Oklahoma, USA. Differences between on-ground observations or model estimates and AMSR-E retrievals were compared to dynamic estimates of open water fraction derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The comparison indicates that seasonally varying biases of up to 20% soil water content can be attributed to the presence of relatively small areas (<5%) of open water in or near the sensor footprint. The analysis presented here will help determine which of the data fields, either the retrieved parameter or the observed microwave brightness temperature, is most suitable for assimilation with simulated fields from land surface models.

A total of 443 crabs were sampled, of them 249 were males (53.5 %), 138 non-ovigerous females (29.7 %), and 78 ovigerous females (16.8 %). Males were found to be larger than females. The overall males: females sex ratio estimated 1:1.2. The male of Halimede tyche attained 30.7 mm at first maturity, while female was 24.5 mm in size. The gonado-somatic indices of males were higher than that of females. Spawning season in both sexes extended from May to August. An increase in oocyte diameter was recorded in April (280 mu m) and continued to reach the maximum value in June with an average of 397 mu m.

It has a certain distance away from the lake embankment. From June 2010 to May 2011, the water samples of Hengtanghe River were collected in Zhoutie town near the village of Yangxi, Yixing. The variation of river water quality was analyzed throughout the whole year. The results showed that: (1) the annual total nitrogen (TN) concentration was inferior to Class V water quality except August, while other indexes were superior to Class V water quality. (2) Dissolved total nitrogen (DTN) accounted for the main form in TN in the river, while TP was mainly in the form of particulate phosphorus (PP). Chemistry oxygen demand (CODMn) had a higher concentration during June and August compared to other months, and the maximum chlorophyll a (Chla) concentration was monitored in August. There were significantly higher CODMn and Chla concentrations in the hot season than that in the cold season, while the TN concentration exhibited the opposite tendency with CODMn and Chla.

The method has some similarity with seismic exploration both in the theory and data processing methods except for the direct utilization of waveform in seismic exploration. The waveform analysis is a powerful tool to investigate the velocities in the areas of interest, and the importance to use waveform is widely recognized in seismic explorations. However there are few precedent studies dealing with waveform inversion in the application of OAT. This study investigates the effectiveness and applicability of the full waveform inversion method to estimate underwater sound velocity structures. We use an adjoint-state method for the calculation of the gradient in an iterative inversion based on a pre-conditioned conjugate gradient method. We first demonstrate results from a full waveform inversion method applied to a synthetic dataset that reflects the sound velocity structure. The results are then compared with those from a conventional ray-based travel time inversion method to evaluate the effectiveness of the method. The results show that the full waveform inversion method could provide more precise image with higher resolution than the ray-based method. The full waveform inversion method is also applied to a VCS experiment field data in Lake Biwa. In spite of very limited path condition using only direct arrival wave, the full waveform inversion method could describe the horizontal velocity structure possibly due to seasonal thermocline in the lake. We conclude that the FWI method could be the key success factor for the higher resolution at estimation of underwater sound velocity structure.

This study took the East Dongting Lake wetland as research area, and comprehensively evaluated the health status of wetland ecosystem by using of CBERS remotely sensed images. Firstly, the model of decision tree for classification was built by analyzing the spectral features of remotely sensed images, and extracted out the distribution area of different ecosystems such as rivers, freshwater lakes, freshwater marshes, poplar dominant wetland and reed dominant wetland, based on remotely sensed images of dry season and wet season in different years, and the spatial distribution map of wetland types in the East Dongting Lake of different phases were obtained. Then, health status evaluation indices and correlative evaluation system of the East Dongting Lake wetland were set up, and the health status of the East Dongting Lake wetland in different phases were evaluated and graded. The reasons of the deterioration of the East Dongting Lake wetland were obtained by investigation. The research result can provide the scientific decision-making basis for protection of biodiversity and regional ecological security in the East Dongting Lake.

We extracted 89 691 reservoirs, covering about 26 755 km(2) of the land surface. By applying an empirical formula relating reservoir storage capacity and surface area, we estimated the total storage capacity to be about 770 km(3). Also, we delineated more than 180 000 lakes and ponds, with a total surface area of about 79 767 km2. These include 2721 lakes larger than 1 km(2). Through comparison with previous studies, we found that dramatic changes have occurred over the past decades. Reservoir construction and water diversion have changed the spatial distribution and seasonal variation of water resources and have made the river systems fragmented. Additionally, this study found that more than 200 lakes of >1 km(2) on the Mongolia-Xinjiang Plateau and the Eastern Plain have disappeared, but about 50 lakes >1 km(2) have appeared on the Tibetan Plateau. The disappearing lakes on the Mongolia-Xinjiang Plateau and the newly appearing lakes on the Tibetan Plateau could be a result of climate change; whereas the disappearance of lakes on the Eastern Plain, especially in the middle lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huaihe River basin, reflect the impact of human activities, such as land reclamation and urbanization. The database of delineated reservoirs will be employed to estimate the total amount of sediment trapped behind dams.

Thus this paper focuses on detection of those irregularities and to illustrate the importance of breakpoint estimation. The underlying research theme is given by the discipline of Paleoclimatology. The investigation has been realized upon varved lake sediments as one of common proxydata in paleoclimatics. As the discipline provides insights in climate variability, questioning climate changes implies crucial information about mechanisms of rapid climate shifts. The paper shall also outline the importance of such information, since conducting time series modeling without interdisciplinary research constitutes an almost impossible task. Consequently time series analysis turns out in a procedure of modeling supposed components - like trend, cycles or irregularities - of the underlying datagenerating process and to image those in an appropriate degree.

It is about 2km from Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering and Technology. It was Taluk (Sub Division'. s) head quarters and from 1991 it was upgraded as District head quarters after the formation of Thiruvallur District. With rapid growth of town the Population density of Thiruvallur has increased in the past three decades from 300 persons/sq. km in 1951, to 6000 persons/sq. km in 1981 and now it is 12925 persons/sq. km in 2011. The creation of District administrative collector office, headquarters offices for police, judicial courts and Tamil Nadu and Federal Government development department's offices, establishment of multinationals major industries like Caterpillar, Kingfishers, Hindustan Motors, Mahendra Automobiles, Coco cola, Japanese Glass industry, Korean LOTO etc apart from mushrooming growth of about 41 Engineering, Nursing, Education, Medical, Naval, Arts and Science colleges, International Public schools, Governmentt, Private schools and Polytechnics added to the population of this Town. It is well connected by National Highways and Railways and upgraded as District Municipality. This resulted in urban drainage problem and conversion of Agriculture land and lakes for housing, establishment of major Govt and Private Hospitals including special units for Eye care, Cardiology, and Health Clinics, pharmacies etc. The effect of urbanization on environment of this once silent rural temple town which was supporting intensive agriculture activities, green with paddy fields is studied with high resolution satellite data is know the impact on health and environment changes from 2008 to 2011, using 2.5m resolution PAN stereo data of Cartosat 1 merged with 5.8 m resolution Multi Spectral data of LISS 4 of Resourcesat 1 of Indian Remote sensing satellites and Geo Eye satellite image of 2011 from Google Earth web site for the western part of Thiruvallur Municipality Area between North Western Thiruvallur town from the Temple Tank of Sri Veeraragavasamy temple to junction of National Highways connecting Thiruvallur to Tirupathi and Thiruvallur-Poondi-Uthukottai at the West. These data are used to create environment monitoring GIS to understand the use of High resolution Indian satellite data for local urban environmental planning to manage the health and environmental issues. ARC GIS 10 and Lieca photogrammetry software are used with satellite data to create different layer for creating GIS on urban infrastructure like houses, public buildings, roads, municipal surface drainage net work, underground sewerage drainage net work, drinking water pipe lines net work, landfills, solid waste disposal yards, pumping stations, degraded areas, heath services infrastructure, wet lands, low lying areas with bushes, abandoned lakes which are the breeding grounds for mosquito's in rainy season, etc These layers are correlated with the municipal ward map of this segment of the town. The stereo data of Cartosat 1 is useful for mapping the households, roads, agricultural fields, bushy areas, slopes to map the natural drainage of the area and for delineation of micro watersheds. When the layer of municipal ward maps are integrated with the GIS the drainage, drinking water lines, street names and house numbers etc can be added to the attribute data to make this as a complete Environment management GIS. The use of PAN merged data of Cartosat 1 with LISS 4, MSS Resourcesat 1 in natural colour and it's cost effectiveness is studied to explain the usefulness of creation of Environment Health GIS. The non stereo Geo Eye latest data from Google Earth web site or Cartosat 2 can be used for upgrading the land use changes and identify current environmental as on 2011. The study will provide GIS to monitor environmental issues with multi date large scale data for Thiruvallur Town.																			2194-9034						2012	39-B8						87	92																WOS:000358207600017

Sediment loads, which fill the water bodies (lakes, agricultural reservoir, dams, and aquatic ecosystems) are one of the most important environmental problems throughout the world. Water turbidity is a commonly used index of the factors that determine light penetration in the water column. Consistent estimation of water turbidity is crucial to design environmental and restoration management plans, to predict fate of possible pollutants, and to estimate sedimentary fluxes into the ocean. Traditional methods monitoring fixed geographical locations at fixed intervals may not be representative of the mean water turbidity in estuaries between intervals, and can be expensive and time consuming. Although remote sensing offers a good solution to this limitation, it is still not widely used due in part to required complex processing of imagery. The aims of this study were two folds: to map water turbidity and estimate water turbidity level based on Landsat imagery. Based on field measurements and principal component analysis (PCA), was examined the spatial variability of water turbidity in Lake Paldang by using the Landsat satellite imagery collected on 2001 similar to 2007. The result of this study is that when we carried out PCA using Landsat imagery, water turbidity had contributed at PC 2 which was similar to the in-situ data. A correlation formula (water turbidity = 0.3169 x PC2 - 21.477, R-2 = 0.6319) between the in-situ data and PC2. And we can now use formula to map the water turbidity distribution from the synchronously acquired Landsat imagery, and continue the discussion on the inverse water turbidity results of the Landsat imagery. Because results from this type of study vary with season and time of day, it is necessary to monitor continuously in-situ data as well as radiance feature of reflectance in order to determine accurately the environmental factors of water quality.																			0277-786X		978-0-8194-9263-0				2012	8524								85242H	10.1117/12.977323	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.977323													WOS:000312868900049

Application of air compass software for source identification of semi-volatile organic compounds in Whitbourne, UK	AIR POLLUTION XX	WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment				20th International Conference on Modelling, Monitoring and Management of Air Pollution	2012	A Coruna, SPAIN	Wessex Inst Technol, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm, Int Journal Sustainable Dev & Planning				One of the most controversial issues on air pollution field is how to quantitatively identify the emission source of gaseous species in atmospheric environment. Air Compass Software was carefully designed for this special purpose by using C# program. Given that wind direction is measured as an angle (a) relative to true north (0), mean direction was determined by using trigonometric relations to determine the direction of the resultant of individual wind vectors. The emission source strength - wind direction relationship can be represented graphically by plotting R-value of (natural logarithm of partial pressure) vs. against downwind angle (a) during the monitoring period. To apply this relationship, measured atmospheric concentrations must be expressed as partial pressures (P), which can be converted through the use of the ideal gas law with a temperature correction. The aims of this study are to statistically quantify the relationships between emission source strengths and downwind angles of Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds (SVOCs) measured at Whitbourne monitoring stations adjacent to Worcester city, UK from 20/11/2003 to 22/12/2003 (cold-period) and from 5/5/2004 to 26/5/2004 (warm-period). Air compass software proves that emission source strengths of each gaseous species can be significantly influenced by seasons.

To monitor wetness conditions over a long period of time and large areas, passive microwave data is used to study the inundation pattern of large floodplains in Asia, such as the Poyang Lake floodplain. The polarization difference brightness temperature at 37GHz is sensitive to the water extension even under dense forest. However, the mixing of signals from open water, bare soil and vegetation makes it difficult to obtain the soil-water saturation conditions from 37GHz data. That is because 37GHz microwave emission is attenuated by the vegetation canopy, which shows seasonal changes in Asia floodplains. We developed a linear mixing model to eliminate the signal from vegetation and derive the soil-water saturation condition from 37GHz data. Vegetation attenuation factors, in terms of vegetation fractional area and LAI, have been estimated by correlation with the NDVI. Thus the vegetation attenuation function is built according to the relationship between 37GHz and NDVI data of agricultural areas, with the help of Harmonic analysis of time series to obtain continuous NDVI time series. Comparing the soil-water saturated area from 37GHz and water extension area of Poyang Lake from SAR image data at higher spatial resolution, our result shows a good fit with SAR data but relatively higher values.

The ice, especially in shallow lakes, occupies a large proportion of water depth, from 1/3 similar to 2/3 of the depth. Therefore, the impact of lake ice for the lake ecosystem cannot be ignored. The process of freezing can discharge a great amount of pollutants. We examined the concentrations of pollutants in Ulansuhai Lake water from the beginning of freezing until full icebound. We found that the concentration of pollutants rose as the lake froze. For instance, the total nitrogen and total phosphorus concentration of water pollutants were 2 to 10 times and 6 to 10 times higher within the water as compared to the ice. With melting, those pollutants returned to the entire lake volume. The water layer below ice had high concentrations which resulted in a new endogenous pollution source. Using monthly field observation data in 2011, we carried out endogenous pollution estimates in Ulansuhai Lake and determined the influence of the freezing and melting process on the lake's environment. The new treatment was given by combining actual situation with study analysis results.					shi, XIAOHONG/KRP-1855-2024																978-7-89437-020-4				2012							1280	1287																WOS:000396804100121
J	Castro, HU; Holguín, CJ				Uribe Castro, Hernando; Jimena Holguin, Carmen			ABOUT THE RAINY SEASON: THE ROLE OF THE STATE FACING THE CAUCA RIVER JETTY MANAGEMENT IN CALI, COLOMBIA	ELEUTHERA												Starting in the mid-twentieth century, Santiago de Cali has witnessed a process of expanding its city limits and areas that have been incorporated into the official and illegal urbanization dynamics. The illegal occupations are usually called slums, substandard neighborhoods and, more recently, Incomplete Human Settlement Developments, which are located both in the east region and on the slopes of the mountain chain. Some of these settlements were established in particular places such as on a mirror of water in an artificial lake, on mining areas and on river jetties. The various municipal authorities from Cali have not been able to solve the problem of illegal seizures of land, neither have they achieved an effective control of land use. Every rainiy season in the city, makes the issue of settlements located on high-risk urban areas be exposed to the public and makes the different actors talk about it; but once the rainy season is over, the issue is forgotten. In this context, it is important to ask about the role of the State facing the management and search of solutions that besides allowing mitigation of the phenomenon, provide structural answers to the complexity of the problem the phenomenon of the Cauca River jetty presents. Nowadadys, after 30 years of being occupied, this process continues: still the population is settled, the local administration bodies and other bodies responsible for the situation act in a very shy way facing the magnitude the phenomenon has reached in recent decades. Communities demand either to be recognized their ownership of these areas or to be evicted by a plan that includes subsidies and relocation in safer areas in the city. To analyze this, the text is divided into three parts: the first part presents the process of occupation of the Cauca River jetty, the second part presents the State's response over time and the role of its agents, and finally in the third part, some concluding remarks are presented.																			2011-4532	2463-1469				JAN-JUN	2012	6						228	245																WOS:000420362900014

Habitat suitability simulation of the Yangtze River's four major carp species	RIVER FLOW 2012, VOLS 1 AND 2					6th International Conference on Fluvial Hydraulics (River Flow)	SEP 05-07, 2012	San Jose, COSTA RICA	Colegio Ingenieros Civiles Costa Rica, Int Assoc Hydro Environm Engn & Res, Comm Fluvial Hydraul				The Yangtze River's four major carp species (YFMCS)-black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), grass carp (Ctenop haryngodon idellus), silver carp (Hypoph thal michthys molitrix), and big-head carp (Aristichyths nobilis)-are the most important fresh water fish in China. They are migration fishes between Yangtze River and riparian lakes. After construction of Gezhouba Dam and impoundment of the Three Gorges Reservoir, the population and percentage in the total catch of fish of the YFMCS from Yangtze River basin have decreased gradually. These reductions in species population are mainly attributed to the loss of spawning ground in mainstream of Yangtze River caused by dam construction. Considering the spawning characteristics of the YFMCS, a habitat suitability index model (HSI) has been established. Model simulated the 380 km long habitat of the YFMCS in the middle river of Yangtze River. The HSI model was validated by comparing measured data with predictions from the model. And a minimum instream flow and suitable daily discharge increase during the reproduction season for the carp species are suggested. The minimum discharge needed for the YFMCS in the middle reach of the Yangtze River is 3 000m(3)/s. Different daily discharge increases are required for different initial discharges, too small or too large of an increase in daily discharge is not good for carps spawning. Therefore, adjusting reservoir operations to create reasonable water level fluctuations is a key method to improve the habitat suitability of carps spawning sites.																					978-0-203-07635-4; 978-0-415-62129-8				2012							1101	1106																WOS:000347871500147

The results showed that the geometridae insects in Songhua Lake area changed with the seasons obviously. The number of their communities was largest in June; the dominance of major geometridae insects varies with the seasons significantly, namely, the dominant species were different in different seasons; the diversity, evenness and dominant concentration indexes changed significantly in different seasons, that is, all of them were at lower levels in May and September, highest in June and the changes of them were smooth in July and August. This study should be conducive to the effective control of the damage by the pest and lay a solid foundation for better protecting the forest resources of Songhua Lake area.																					978-1-4673-4497-5				2012																								WOS:000310335802086

There may be several or even a dozen quake lakes in the same drainage basin. During the emergency treatment of quake lakes, due to constraints of resources and time, it is often imperative to select one or a few quake lakes of high priority in the same drainage basin for treatment in order for the entire drainage basin to safely pass the flood season. There are many factors involved in the optimization of emergency treatment project of quake lakes and these factors are usually of different nature. This article proposes to use a multi-level, multi-factor optimization method in decision making of emergency treatment of quake lakes based on the concept and operation properties of fuzzy-consistent matrix. This method is convenient and practical when many qualitative factors are involved and the determination of membership function is difficult. A case study was conducted for the 16 quake lakes on the Mianyuan River by using the proposed method. Three quake lakes selected according to case study results went through emergency treatment before the 2009 flood season, helping the entire Mianyuan River safely pass the 2009 flood season.					; Li, Hong-Tao/GRJ-2840-2022; Zhou, Jia-wen/A-7807-2012	Zhou, Hong-wei/0000-0002-3866-0915; 													1793-4311					DEC	2011	5	5			SI		475	491		10.1142/S1793431111001200	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S1793431111001200													WOS:000297520800005

Variation in Optical Properties of Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter in A Shallow Lake During Rainy Season	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY												Variation in optical properties of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in a shallow lake during rainy season was investigated by UV/VIS absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. Two humic-like components mainly from terrestrial origin (C1 and C2) and one protein-like component derived from autochthonous production (C3) were identified by applying fluorescence excitation-emission matrix combined with PARAFAC modeling. The mean values of autochthonous production and chlorophyll concentration increased from 0.28 to 0.30 mu g/L and 165 to 197 mu g/L, respectively. Their correlation was different in temporal pattern, demonstrating that the dominant source of autochthonous chromophoric dissolved organic matter was altered from phytoplankton to other sources such as release from sediment and runoff during the rainy season. Mean values of Cl and C2 increased significantly from 0.36 and 0.35 to 0.42 and 0.37 respectively, coupled with a (355) increasing from 2.86 m(-1) to 3.86 m(-1) suggesting that precipitation process may increase terrestrial chromophoric dissolved organic matter in the lake. The low values of humification index (HIX) ranging from 3.52 to 4.62 were caused by the dominant origin of autochthonous chromophoric dissolved organic matter, although input of terrestrially-derived chromophoric dissolved organic matter could make mean value of humification index increase from 3.82 to 4.35.					; Huang, Qinghui/E-5157-2011; jiang, dingguo/HTM-9585-2023	Huang, Qinghui/0000-0001-5770-6694; Xiao, Yihua/0000-0001-8643-4421													0970-7077					NOV	2011	23	11					4771	4776																WOS:000296218700008
J	Oosterveld, E				Oosterveld, Ernst			Sphagnum platyphyllum back in the Netherlands after 50 years	GORTERIA												In Europe, the centre of abundance of Sphagnum platyphyllum is in Fennoscandinavia. The species also occurs across the lowlands of Western. Central, and Eastern Europe; becoming increasingly montane to the south. Although S. platyphyllum was thought to have been extinct in the Netherlands since 1955, it was discovered in the Drents-Friese Wold National Park on the border between Friesland and Drenthe Provinces during a February 2007 Sphagnum inventory. The specific locality of S. platyphyllum was just south of Aekingerbroek, the source of the River Vledder Aa. Eighteen years ago, this location and the surrounding area was reclaimed from commercial forestry by 'Staatsbosbeheer', an organisation commissioned by the Dutch government for the maintenance, restoration, and development of woodland, nature reserves, and landscape. Before the restoration measures. Sphagnum was absent from the site. Across Europe, Sphagnum platyphyllum populations occur primarily in fens and other wet, muddy, or seasonally flooded sites like pools, ponds, and lake- and riversides. At the Drents-Friese Wold site, S. plaophyllum was found growing in a shallow river bed on poor, sandy soil. Based upon three vegetation relevees conducted by the author, the locality was classified as oligotrophic, acid and weakly influenced by groundwater. The trophic level of this habitat is less eutrophic than S. platyphylum habitats commonly observed outside of the Netherlands. One explanation for this unexpected result is additional nutrient input by weakly nutrient-enriched groundwater. The presence of S. denticulatum Brid. and Eleocharis multicaulis (Sm.) Sm. at the site supports this hypothesis. Another explanation for the relatively low trophic level is a slow but continuous mineralisation of organic matter following the restoration project. A high density of Juncos effusus L. at the site supports this second hypothesis. If the first hypothesis is true, it is likely that S. platyphylum will persist at the site. If the latter hypothesis is true, it is likely that the species will eventually disappear.

Multilevel Empirical Bayes Modeling for Improved Estimation of Toxicant Formulations to Suppress Parasitic Sea Lamprey in the Upper Great Lakes	BIOMETRICS												Estimation of extreme quantal-response statistics, such as the concentration required to kill 99.9% of test subjects (LC99.9), remains a challenge in the presence of multiple covariates and complex study designs. Accurate and precise estimates of the LC99.9 for mixtures of toxicants are critical to ongoing control of a parasitic invasive species, the sea lamprey, in the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America. The toxicity of those chemicals is affected by local and temporal variations in water chemistry, which must be incorporated into the modeling. We develop multilevel empirical Bayes models for data from multiple laboratory studies. Our approach yields more accurate and precise estimation of the LC99.9 compared to alternative models considered. This study demonstrates that properly incorporating hierarchical structure in laboratory data yields better estimates of LC99.9 stream treatment values that are critical to larvae control in the field. In addition, out-of-sample prediction of the results of in situ tests reveals the presence of a latent seasonal effect not manifest in the laboratory studies, suggesting avenues for future study and illustrating the importance of dual consideration of both experimental and observational data.

J	Stanislav, VA				Stanislav, Akhmatov V.			DEPENDENCE OF RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES OF LAKES OF THE CHUYA BASIN (THE ALTAI REPUBLIC) ON THEIR GENESIS.	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												Genesis of reservoirs has a special value at revealing recreational features of lakes in mountain districts, alongside with climatic characteristics. One of the ways of solving this problem is to define genesis of reservoirs by means of geoinformation technologies, aero photos and topomaps. Lakes of one genetic type have similar hydrological, trophic and recreational features. We have allocated 4 basic genetic types of reservoirs (kar lakes, moraine-dammed, and reservoirs of postglacial complex) in the Chuya basin. Their general characteristics are given. Kar lakes are possible to be used only for a halt of tourists. The negative factors for recreation concern low temperature of water, small sizes of reservoirs, absence of fish, limited opportunities for construction, inaccessibility. The attractive advantage is in the high aesthetic appeal of lake landscapes. Moraine-dammed reservoirs provide good conditions for organization of rest at their sides. The aesthetic value of surrounding landscapes and presence of objects of fishery contributes to attractive conditions in the majority of large reservoirs. The main negative factors of these lakes are boggy, bushed or stony lakesides, low temperature of water (it is possible to swim only in shallow, well warmed up zones of reservoirs). The highest opportunities for development of recreation characterise large reservoirs of postglacial complex and flowing thermokarst lakes. The greater water area can offer more varied kinds of rest, including all the described for the previous types of lakes, and possesses greater recreational capacity. Flowing reservoirs adjust the quantity of oxygen in water, wash away and dilute the compounds of nitrogen and phosphorus, nitrates and phosphates, limit the development of seaweeds in epilimnion, thus, constraining the eutrophication process. The greater length of the lakeside line increases the choice options of a favourable place for arrangement of tourist camps and parking, enables to separate incompatible kinds of rest territorially. The majority thermokarst reservoirs during the year get warm enough for swimming, have suitable sides for organizing pebble and sand beaches; and some reservoirs have a good bottom slope in the zone of swimming. Small internal-drainage reservoirs and former river-bed and dystrophic thermokarst lakes do not represent interest for recreation due to their bad sanitary and hygienic conditions, small sizes and absence of fish. During the several last field seasons we have carried out further researches of all types of lakes in the Chuya basin. Their recreational potential is defined; and recommendations to its application are given.																			1561-7793	1561-803X				MAR	2011		344					191	+																WOS:000421476300044

Phosphorus Content and Distribution in Plants of Yeyahu Wetland in Beijing, China	ADVANCES IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING	Advances in Biomedical Engineering				International Conference on Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering	FEB 20-21, 2011	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA					The spatial distribution of phosphorus in the plants of the Yeyahu wetland (Beijing, China)and their relationship with the concentration and form of P in water and sediment was investigated during the growing season. Phosphorus in the water column appeared to be taken up by the wetland soils and plants. The phosphorus content of plants changed along moisture gradients, with highest plant phosphorus content observed in submerged macrophytes (SM) and followed by emergent macrophytes (EM) and hygrophytes (HP). Plant total phosphorus (TP) concentration decreased with distance downstream along the Guishui River, despite additional inputs from pollution sources. Particulate phosphorus (PP) concentrations significantly correlated with plant TP concentrations than other forms of P in water. This may suggest that PP can be trapped by wetland plant roots and stems and then convert it to bioavailable forms by associated microbial communities in the rhizosphere.																			2160-0589		978-0-9831693-9-0				2011							414	+																WOS:000289665600107

The process of building concrete banks on rivers due to human development has become a serious problem in Taiwan of China; most ecosystems used by amphibians are located in lakes and stream banks, yet no related design solutions have been put forth in Taiwan. For this research, we selected eight species of Taiwanese amphibians and discussed their climbing abilities in an effort to better lakes and river banks designs. We evaluated their motility on five appropriate bank degree of slope, and identified the relation between an amphibian's abilities and the surface substrates of the banks, under humidity and temperature alterations, to simulate changes across the four seasons. The results showed that, a case study of the climbing ability of Hynobius on moss with a gradient of 15 degrees can be 1.35 +/- 0.13 (x10(-2)N/g); and it remains 0.46 +/- 0.15(x10(-2)N/g) even on a gradient of 75 degrees When the gradient is 45 degrees, its climbing ability on moss is 1.74, 1.54, 1.40, and 1.17 times of that on clay, cobblestone, wood, and concrete, respectively, therefore, moss is a good material for bank slope of high mountain bank area designs. This research adopted multiple combinations of bank materials and degree of slope, which can serve as reference for technicians involved in future ecological engineering designs of banks.																					978-7-03-030935-8				2011							9	16																WOS:000392162200002

An enhanced understanding and better characterization of the exchange ability has fundamental significance in studying the transport of contamination and the eutrophication of large shallow lakes. In this research, a relation matrix is set up to describe the characteristics of water exchange in Taihu Lake. The Taihu Lake is divided into five areas and the effect of seasonal wind is taken into consideration. The half-exchange time of the lake water and the relation matrix are calculated to describe the characteristics of water exchange.

The eight upstream riparian nations, Ethiopia, Eretria, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo, Tanzania and Kenya are the source of approximately 86% of the water inputs to the Nile, while the two downstream riparian countries Sudan and Egypt, presently rely on the river's flow for most of the their needs. Both climate and agriculture contribute to the complicated nature of Nile River management: precipitation in the headwaters regions of Ethiopia and Lake Victoria is variable on a seasonal and inter-annual basis, while demand for irrigation water in the arid downstream region is consistently high. The Nile is, perhaps, one of the most difficult trans-boundary water issue in the world(1) , and this study would be the first initiative to combine NASA satellite observations with the hydrologic models study the overall water balance in a comprehensive manner.

Identification of the Major Hydrological Threats for Two Clay Pan Wetlands in the South West of Australia	19TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2011)					19th International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 12-16, 2011	Perth, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, Per Convent & Exhibit Ctr, Perth Convent Bur, Curtin Univ, Australian Math Soc (Aust MS), Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math (ANZIAM), Australian Math Sci Inst (AMSI), Maralte Publishers, Econ Soc Australian (ESA), HEMA Consulting, Simulat Australia, Stat Soc Australia Inc (SSAI), Modelling & Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand Inc (MSSANZ), Int Assoc Math & Comp Simulat (IMACS)				This study presents the findings of a wetland ecohydrological model (WET-0D), used to recreate a historical water regime and predict the future water regime for two clay pan wetlands in South West Western Australia. WET-0D simulates the major hydrological fluxes through three conceptual water storages including the open water/lake, and surrounding unsaturated and saturated zones. Groundwater - soil water balance - vegetation (GSV) dynamics are modelled with plant biomass simulated as three functional vegetation groups with differing water uptake strategies and dependence on water availability. The wetland model was driven by a simple catchment water balance model, using historical climate data from the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). To simulate the potential impact of climate change on wetland ecohydrology, statistically downscaled output from a Global Climate Model (GCM), based on the IPCC SRES A2 scenario, was used to drive the models to predict potential future water regimes. This allowed us to gain an insight of the impact of projected drying climate on the clay pan ecosystems. Although both clay pan catchments experience very similar climates, differences in the partitioning of rainfall and subsequent flow generation, due to different vegetation, soil type and topography, results in dissimilar hydrological regimes. Differences in the hydrological regimes alter the way predicted climate change affects water flux and hydroperiod (period of surface flooding of a wetland) in both clay pan systems. Historically, the modelling predicts the lake level in the North East clay pan is more dependent on overland flow, while the South West clay pan is more dependent on shallow groundwater flow from a seasonal aquifer. Under a drying climate the modelling predicts, the South West clay pan will become increasingly overland flow dependent. However, the shallow groundwater inputs to the clay pan prolong inundation by reducing the rate of seepage from the clay pan. The partial clearing of the catchment area for the South West clay pan has maximised groundwater recharge efficiency allowing maintenance of ecological water requirements under a drying climate. The North East clay pan is under greater threat due to the reliance of surface water inflow and the lack of groundwater input due to differences in catchment characteristics.

By 11 000 (14)C BP, deglaciation made the region inhabitable by human groups using Clovis artefacts. Human habitation would also have been possible during the Moorhead low-water stage of glacial Lake Agassiz, starting at 10 500 (14)C BP. Near its confluence with the Rainy River, the valley floor of the Big Fork valley consists of a floodplain complex and two terraces. The multi-component stratified Hannaford site is situated within the active floodplain. Overbank deposits contain artefacts in primary context, whereas artefacts within the point bar deposits are in secondary archaeological context; these deposits are associated with changing alluvial settings as the river moved eastward. Aggradation of the valley fill beneath the lowest surface (T(0), floodplain complex) began by 3000 years ago and is associated with human activities focused on seasonal fishing and the use of riparian resources from 1300 to 650 (14)C BP.

These problems are very unique in a sense that the phenomena were found quite different from what geotechnical engineers had been used to expect in daily practice. A tower of masonry structure that JSA (Japanese Government Team for Safeguarding Angkor) selected for structural conservation was inclined about 5 degrees. Since the deformation of the step stones showed the same inclination. tilting of the foundation was considered as major mechanism for the inclination. of the Tower. After trenching of the soil mound, the compacted soil layer was not inclined but horizontal. This was quite different what we had expected. What was the mechanism to cause the inclination? Further study revealed that the slip-clown of the side step stones along the foundation platform was the true mechanism. JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) made a study of water resource from pumping underground water. They have monitored seasonal fluctuation of shallow water level at more than 50 surface wells and tried to simulate the seasonal changes caused by horizontal flow from higher mountain to lower lake zones. Finally, JICA had installed a facility to pump water more than 8,000 ton/day. After the pumping started, a monitoring well at 3 km from pumping zone showed 1 m of drawdown of water level that was predicted as little effect by the simulation. Since the plain in Angkor has very gentle slope of the order of 0.001, horizontal flow of underground water is very slow and negligible. The seasonal changes of the water level of 4-5 m was caused not by horizontal flow but infiltration of rain water and evaporation water from the deep layers that was not included in the model JICA used.																					978-94-007-0469-5				2011	15						89	113		10.1007/978-94-007-0470-1_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-0470-1_6													WOS:000302881200006

It is a unique phenomenon of reservoir. This article aims to demonstrate and develop the ecological embankment by incorporating ecological elements when designing the wet-dry zone embankment. Take the embankment design of Lake Longevity wet-dry zone as an example, different shore status of fluctuating conditions were analyzed. There were 4 types of embankments: the lawn-type, the rocky beach-type, the stone-type, and the muddy-type. The natural prototype, the nature-type and the artificial-natural type of eco- embankment were carried out by introducing the concept of eco-embankment design according to each different water level conditions. On the basis of ecological priority and people-oriented design principles, the embankment construction mode was soil and water conservation + buffer zone + ecological revetment + lake, which combined with the cultivation of aquatic plants. The essay has come to the conclusion that the construction of wet-dry zone embankment should be satisfy the demand of both man and nature and establish a balanced and dynamic system through the exchange between land and water in accordance with different water levels.																			0567-7572		978-90-66055-34-6				2011	922						327	332																WOS:000314770100042

Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), accounting for about 98% of total nitrogen (TN), was the dominant component in sediment. Ammonium (NH4+-N) was the main component of inorganic nitrogen in the sediment and the pore water while nitrate (NO3--N) slightly exceeded NH4+-N in the overlying water. NH4+-N/DON ratio had an obvious negative correlation with Eh, temperature and FDA while NO3--N/NH4+-N had a positive correlation with those factors. Calculated by the Fick's First Law, the NH4+-N diffusion fluxes were 14.96 +/- 2.56 mg.m(-2).d(-1) and the NO3--N diffusion fluxes were negative, which revealed that NRif-N was the major nitrogen component in internal release with apparent diffusive tendency when NO3--N mainly accumulated in the sediment. Obvious seasonal and spatial variations of nitrogen species and diffusion fluxes were observed. The plant area had lower NH4+-N and higher NO3--N than the centre area due to weak reduction condition, which revealed that the anoxic condition played an important role in adsorption and immobilization of nitrogen by means of plant roots in internal release and also suggested the guidance mechanism for nitrogen nitrification and ammonification. In general, the surface sediment in eutrophic lakes, enriched by nitrogen, was the most active dimension for the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen in which NH4+-N was the major and most effective forms.

Field surveys were conducted in April 2002 during the wet season, and in August 2001 and August 2002 during the dry season. Surface water and groundwater levels were determined by measurements of the land surface altitude, river and lake stages, and depth to groundwater in four observation wells. The groundwater flow system in each season was delineated using MODFLOW, a 3-D finite difference groundwater flow code. Mixing between surface water and groundwater, having different qualities, was simulated for each season using the MT3DMS transport code. Important findings are that the groundwater flow system and water mixing processes are strongly influenced by the presence of the paleo-river channel and saline deep groundwater.																			0144-7815		978-1-907161-20-9				2011	345						62	+																WOS:000297611100010

The steady-state assumption is required because temporal variability, if quantified at all, is usually determined on a seasonal or inter-annual scale. In order to design models that can incorporate finer-scale temporal resolution we first need to measure variability at a finer scale. Automated seepage meters that can measure flow across the sediment water interface with temporal resolution of seconds to minutes were used in a variety of settings to characterize seepage response to rainfall, wind, and evapotranspiration. Results indicate that instantaneous seepage fluxes can be much larger than values commonly reported in the literature, although seepage does not always respond to hydrological processes. Additional study is needed to understand the reasons for the wide range and types of responses to these hydrologic and atmospheric events.

B	Talling, J	Tundisi, JG; MatsumuraTundisi, T			Talling, Jack	Tundisi, JG; MatsumuraTundisi, T		The dynamic ecology of aquatic plant populations and communities	LIMNOLOGY												In this chapter, the main mechanisms and interactions of the components of aquatic plant populations and communities will be examined and discussed, as well as factors that influence their spatial and temporal succession and diversity and distribution in lakes, rivers, reservoirs and wetlands. The factors that limit and control the primary production of phytoplankton, periphyton and macrophytes will be examined, as well as fluctuations in biomass and these organisms' role in biogeochemical cycles and interactions with other aquatic organisms. Examples are presented from case studies of different aquatic plant communities in the Neotropics as a basis for understanding spatial and seasonal succession in different ecosystems typical in this region. Case studies of temperate-zone lakes are presented for comparison. Basic concepts about succession of phytoplankton, periphyton and macrophytes and the effects of disturbances on these communities are discussed as examples in shallow lakes, Amazonian lakes and reservoirs. An ecological system is composed of biotic components, ranging from viruses and bacteria to higher organisms, plants and animals that interact with abiotic physical and chemical components, forming a basic ecological unit - the ecosystem. These organisms, interacting with abiotic factors, come from a wide variety of species that individually form the population. A population, therefore, is defined as a set of organisms of the same species, and a community as a collection of various populations in an ecosystem. Populations and communities present a series of different dynamic processes and attributes. For example, a population has density (i.e., number of organisms/area or volume), a property that cannot be applied to an individual organism. And a community has diversity of species, which is not applicable to a population.																					978-0-203-80395-0; 978-0-415-58835-5				2011							195	247				10.1201/b11386												WOS:000364533700011

The differences between estuaries and coastal lagoons are discussed along with the role of salinity, horizontal gradients, morphometry and seasonal and spatial fluctuations that occur in these systems. Case studies are presented featuring four different types of estuarine and coastal ecosystems in Brazil and South America: the Cananeia lagoon region in the state of Sao Paulo; the coastal lakes in the state Rio de Janeiro; the Patos Lagoon in Rio Grande do Sul, and the estuary of the Plata River (Argentina/Uruguay). Estuaries and coastal lagoons are essential for sustaining aquatic biodiversity. These are transition regions with elevated biological productivity and alternative food chains. These systems are also subjected to numerous impacts, especially human actions. The chapter also discusses the impacts and the measures to mitigate and recover and protect these ecosystems.																					978-0-203-80395-0; 978-0-415-58835-5				2011							477	524				10.1201/b11386												WOS:000364533700018

And snow in covered at Tibetan Plateau can exert have important influence on the study of climate change and hydrological cycle. In this paper, we found that the brightness temperature of horizontal polarization at Nam Cu Lake is very low, which is about 170K at 18.7 GHz, by the analysis of the time series of the brightness temperature observed by AMSR-E. Even if the lake got frozen, the brightness temperature of horizontal polarization of ice is about 220K at 18.7 GHz, which is much lower than that at land. Then we use HUT ( Helsinki University of Technology) snow emission model for a homogeneous snowpack - ice - water system to simulate the brightness temperature at AMSR-E's frequencies which are used in the current algorithms of estimation SWE at the satellite scale. Also from the seasonal variation of the time series of the brightness temperature, we could see that the brightness temperature of lakes increased sharply when being frozen and decreased rapidly when being melting. The HUT model can match well with the observed brightness temperature at 18.7GHz at horizontal channel					Jiang, Lingmei/L-6099-2016	Jiang, Lingmei/0000-0002-9847-9034; Pan, Jinmei/0000-0003-2726-771X													2153-6996		978-1-4577-1005-6				2011							3210	3213		10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049902	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2011.6049902													WOS:000297496303049

This was achieved in warm season by putting eutrophic, high chl alpha content water with a natural phytoplankton assemblage (no cyanobacteria bloom) containing Microcystis into colorless transparent glass jars outdoors for a few days and then with nutrients enrichment. In the experiment, water of 3.5-4.5 mg/L TN, 0.3-0.4 mg/L TP and 120-160 mu g/L planktonic chl alpha from a pond was put into two jars on 12 June 2007. On 25 June, net addition of 3.1 mg/L NO3-N and 0.45 mg/L PO4-P was put into one jar, and by 4 July, a Microcystis bloom had occurred on the surface water of the enriched jar, but not in the other. On 5 July, the nutrients addition was repeated, and subsequently the Microcystis bloom became more significant. On 8 July, the same concentration of nutrients was added to the remaining jar, and by 10 July, a Microcystis bloom had also occurred in the second jar. The nutrients enrichment provides a chance for the Microcystis out-competing the other algae from natural eutrophic water rich of phytoplankton. The experiment demonstrates an easy and repeatable method of achieving a Microcystis bloom from natural phytoplankton communities, which may be useful for the further study of bloom mechanisms.

Experiments were carried out on seasonal frozen Lake Chagan, one representative inland case-2 water body in Northeast of China. Particulate absorption properties analyzed using the field data on July 15th and October 12th 2009 were measured using the quantitative filter technique to produce absorption spectra containing several fractions that could be attributed to two main optical active constituents (OACs) phytoplankton pigments and non-algal particulates (mineral sediments, and organic detritus). Results suggested that the suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration was higher while phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a concentration) was lower in July and that in October. The spectral shape of total suspended particulate matter resembled that of non-algal particulates which contributed greater than phytoplankton in total particulate absorption during both periods. An obvious absorption peak occurring at around 440 nm exhibited an increase in phytoplankton contribution in October. Non-algal particulate absorption at 440 nm (a(NAP) (440)) had better correlation with total suspended particulate matter concentration than that with chlorophyll-a over the two periods. Light absorption by phytoplankton pigments in the Chagan lake region was generally lower than that of non-algal components. Chl. a dominating phytoplankton pigment composition functioned exponentially with its absorption coefficients at 440 and 675 nm specifically, the average values of which in July were 0. 146 8 m(2) . mg(-1) and 0. 050 3 respectively while in October they were 0. 153 3 and 0. 013 2 m(2) . mg(-1) varying regionally and seasonally due to the changes in specific composition, light and nutrient conditions.

It has gradually become the main method of long-distance crude oil transportation of oil industry in the world because of its advantages, such as high safety, low energy consumption, great throughput, low cost and good economic benefit. It is inevitable to cross some rivers, lakes and swamps when the long-distance pipeline is constructed. But long-distance crude oil pipeline river-crossing is a technical problem all the times. So using the safe, advanced, easy to operate and manage, and low cost design project for river-crossing is directly related to the management and safe running of the pipe network. Recently, the directional drilling crossing technique is applied to the engineering of long-distance pipeline river-crossing widely. In 1970s, the technique starts to be used, with the unceasing construction and development of long-distance pipeline, the technique has obtained a further consummation. The directional drilling crossing is an advanced pipe laying technique without excavation and backfill. During the construction period, the river channel will not be excavated, so the waterborne traffic is not influenced and the structures of dike and riverbed are not destroyed. And the crossing project can be constructed in any seasons and with short construction period, few floorage, small investment, quick speed and high safety. This paper takes Qing-Tie long-distance crude oil pipeline as the real background. The basic natural situations and production running problems of the pipeline and Chai River are introduced. The feasibility of using the directional drilling crossing technique to cross Chai River is studied seriously. And the laying route and operating technique parameters are worked out. In addition, the directional drilling crossing method is compared with heavy excavation, shield pushing and drilling blasting from the technique degree of ripeness, construction period and engineering investment.

Eutrophication generally causes water quality deterioration, which makes it urgent to seek for a highly efficient eutrophic water treatment system. The constructed wetland is an effective and useful treatment system because of its simple technology and low operational cost. A field-scale constructed wetland was built at Jiuxi town in China as the primary treatment measure before eutrophic lake water was drained to a riverine landscape. Water quality indices were determined from July to September 2009, and treatment operated regularly during the rainy season. The results showed the removal efficiency of total nitrogen (39-62%), ammoniacal nitrogen (61-84%), total phosphorous (5-10%), chlorophyll a (93-98%), and indicate that the technology had a potential for chlorophyll a as well as ammoniacal and total nitrogen removal.																			1018-4619						2011	20	9					2251	2257																WOS:000294979300010

The process of low temperature freezing has a good concentration effect on the pollutants in water body. A reasonable explanation of frozen concentrate effect was given from three aspects known as the liquid-solid phase equilibrium theory, crystallography theory and thermodynamics theory. Drawing inspiration from the phenomenon and its mechanism of frozen concentration effect, a tentative idea that we can use natural cool energy in wastewater treatment field was put forward. A reasonable technological process of freezing purification was designed, in which, more than 80% of TN, TP and COD in the original water can be removed through single stage frozen; more than 94% of TN, TP and COD can be removed through second stage frozen; more than 97% of TN, TP and COD can be removed through third stage frozen. Furthermore, parts of related parameters are optimized: the best cold area and water depth ratio is 2.22 and the best removing thickness of ice is 13.5cm in the experiment.

It was particularly important to choose appropriate water quality evaluation method for the quantitative determination of water category correctly, in order to provide a reliable scientific basis of water pollution control for the rivers and lakes. As the introduction of back-propagation (BP) artificial neural network model, generated training and testing samples of BP neural network with water classification standard evaluation index, determined the neural network structure and input the reasonable parameters for training and testing. Select a south small town of Taihu Lake Basin as the study area, set Xueyan town for example, manually monitored the water one year from March 2009 to February 2010 with laying water monitoring stations full coverage of Xueyan town. Analyze the water samples with national experiment method in timely and use the trained BP neural network model for water quality evaluation. The results were agreement with the one using the single factor evaluation method got, even more objective and accurate to some extent. All the results showed that the water pollution indicators were total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen.

Drilling Challenges in the Bitumen-Saturated Grosmont Formation	JOURNAL OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY					60th Annual Technical Meeting of the Petroleum-Society/10th Canadian International Petroleum Conference	JUN 16-18, 2009	Calgary, CANADA	Petr Soc				The Upper Devonian Grosmont formation, located in the West Athabasca oil sands deposit, contains an estimated 318 billion barrels of bitumen. The reservoir is a heavily karsted and fractured, bitumen-saturated dolomite with up to 38% porosity and permeabilities commonly measured in the darcies. These properties make the Grosmont an excellent candidate for steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). Grosmont SAGD development will be exposed to similar operating conditions as McMurray SAGD projects, and will have similar logistics, well construction and materials challenges. However, there are many additional challenges, including severe loss circulation, that further complicate well design. This paper presents the challenges experienced by Laricina Energy in drilling Grosmont wells at Saleski and Burnt Lakes over the last three seasons. It will also address additional areas for future research and development in the drilling of vertical and horizontal wells.																			0021-9487					DEC	2010	49	12					19	27		10.2118/143003-PA	http://dx.doi.org/10.2118/143003-PA													WOS:000285225000003

Chaoborid larvae may easily be included in zooplankton samples, especially if samples are taken with net hauls. Five larvae included in a sample had a significant negative effect on the density estimate of daphnids, cyclopoid and calanoid copepods, and cyclopoid nauplii. When chaoborids were included in the samples, a three-hour preservation lag caused a >5% underestimation of population density estimate of cyclopoids and a six hour lag resulted in a 10% error. In field studies, chaoborids usually prefer small cladocerans such as bosminids as prey, but in the restricted space of the sample containers escape ability of cyclopoids was diminished. As a result, cyclopoids were the main prey of chaoborids. Chaoborids had no effect on the mean individual size of any of the taxa, but in the reference samples the mean size of daphnids and calanoids was reduced. This, as well as the reduced density of cyclopid nauplii in the reference samples, was attributed to predation by cyclopoids. The results emphasized that zooplankton samples should be preserved immediately after the sample haul.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	2010	25	4					599	606		10.1080/02705060.2010.9664409	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2010.9664409													WOS:000284243100012

The first archaeological excavations were conducted by E. Laszowski in 1911 and 1912. He defined the perimeter of the exterior defense walls and the position of two towers on the southern edge of the hill fort - a triangular keep and a smaller quadrangular one. The excavations were not continued until a century later. During two field excavation seasons, in 2008 and 2009, almost the whole triangular keep was excavated. It was confirmed that the keep, preserved at the ground level, had a ground plan in the form of an equilateral triangle. This form is extremely rare in late mediaeval architecture, and there are only three (known) similar examples in this part of Europe (Salek, Kosice - Hradova, Boldogko). Akeep of impressive dimensions, located in the southern section of the burg had, besides its defensive function, the role of a status symbol. A rare architectural solution, richly produced pieces of architectural mouldings, the form of the in situ arrow loops, as well as the results of historical analyses suggest that Krcingrad was constructed during the late 13th or the beginning of 14th century.																			0350-7165					NOV	2010	43	1					289	307																WOS:000438313200015

MICROCYSTIN MC-LR IN BRAZILIAN AQUACULTURE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS	WATER MICROBIOLOGY: TYPES, ANALYSES AND DISEASE-CAUSING MICROORGANISMS	Microbiology Research Advances											The growth of aquaculture production systems, mostly the sports-fishing kind, coupled to lack of control, brings about concerns on the quality of water and food produced. Current paper determines which factors may trigger the growth of cyanobacteria with subsequent concentrations of microcystins in collected water samples, at the surface and in the water column, from ten aquaculture systems, during the dry and rainy seasons. The above is undertaken by measurements of biotic (counting of Chlorophyceae, cyanobacteria and MC-LR) and abiotic (total nitrogen and total phosphorus) factors. Since water of ten aquaculture production systems had MC-LR concentrations highly correlated with M. aeruginosa biomass, most MC-LR microcystins were produced by this species. MC-LR concentrations and M. aeruginosa counting were positively correlated with N:P rates and suggest that parameters may affect not only the M. aeruginosa biomass but also MC-LR concentrations.

The factors that initiate these changes are also discussed. Fieldwork was performed during the 2008 hydrological year. Field data were collected during each of the four seasons. Water samples were collected and laboratory tested in order to determine the concentrations of a number of ions such as chloride, calcium, nitrate, phosphate, and ammonia. The quality of water in Lake Sarbsko is characterized by substantial spatial and temporal differences. North-south and east-west differences are associated with the lake's position relative to the Baltic Sea, its tributaries, and its sole exit channel. Temporal changes in water quality are associated with human impact in the form of agriculture and tourism as well as with periodic natural phenomena such as seawater intrusions.

BIODIVERSITY, SUCCESSION AND SEASONALITY OF TROPICAL FRESHWATER PLANKTON COMMUNITIES UNDER SEMI-FIELD CONDITIONS IN THAILAND	FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS AND AQUACULTURE RESEARCH	Environmental Science Engineering and Technology											Although biodiversity has often been indicated to increase towards the equator, taxonomic expertise and research efforts have focused mainly on temperate regions. Hence, biodiversity and limnology of tropical freshwaters are presently poorly understood. Also in Thailand, literature on limnology is scarce, and many of the studies carried out are published in the grey literature or in local (university) journals with extremely limited circulation. Two outdoor microcosm studies were previously carried out in Thailand to evaluate the fate and effects of the insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and the herbicide linuron (UN) on tropical freshwater communities under semi-field conditions. The present chapter lists and discusses the periphyton, phytoplankton and zooplankton species communities encountered in the controls of these experiments. The periphyton community was studied in the UN experiment using microscopic slides that were placed approximately 10 cm under the water surface of the microcosms. After an incubation period of four and six weeks, the periphyton community existed solely of Chamaesiphon sp. whereas in later stages (eight and ten weeks incubation), contributions of chlorophytes and diatoms increased. The LIN phytoplankton community was dominated by Chlorophyta with a radiation of Scenedesmus species, whereas a bloom of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa was noted in the CPF experiment. The large cladoceran Diaphanosoma sp., one of the dominating cladocerans in the UN experiment, was absent in the CPF experiment and replaced by smaller cladoceran species. Possible underlying influences of tropical seasonality and climatic conditions on the observed community structures, primary producers-zooplankton interactions and implications for conservation of tropical freshwaters are discussed.					; Daam, M/G-6303-2015; van den brink, Paul/AAT-7144-2020; Daam, Michiel/G-6303-2015	van den brink, Paul/0000-0002-7241-4347; Daam, Michiel/0000-0001-9203-5400															978-1-60741-707-1				2010							225	248																WOS:000276109600009

As a result of research, the seasonal variability of hydrographic objects in young glacial areas, known from literature (Drwal, 1979, 1982; Drwal and Borowiak, 1996; Zwolinski, 2008), was confirmed. The variability of objects results in a change of hydrographic structure and this in turn causes a change in the regime of the functioning of the hydrographic system. Two catchments under the influence of the same atmospheric conditions and with comparable (absolute value and percentage) areas without outflow readable on geographic scale (1:50 000) have a different elementary structure depending on the season. This phenomenon has a varied intensity and is caused by different conditions of the geographic environment and different hydrometeorological conditions (humid and dry season). The causes of the differences between the investigated catchments can be attributed to differences in underground alimentation. The Okalica catchment is characterised by the occurrence of a considerable number of outflows of underground waters. Additionally, the vast area without outflow in the southern and western part of the catchment belongs to a larger area without outflow of Linia (Wozniak, 2008), which is the place of alimentation of underground waters not only of the Leba drainage basin but also of the neighbouring Lupawa, and a contact of the underground waters of these drainage basins cannot be ruled out. In the Borucinka catchment, the majority of streams are alimented by precipitation water and in dry season the area of catchment with surface outflow diminishes considerably. Thus, it can be stated that the identification of the hydrographic structure in different seasons can be treated as an information of the process of water circulation.																					978-83-89293-94-7				2010		69					119	128																WOS:000391352700010

It is possible to develop various kinds of tourism here. Development of the tourist sector may become one of the prime projects of development of inter-regional cooperation within the limits of the Siberian federal district. There exists a decision of Federal authorities to create in the Irkutsk region a special economic zone of tourist-recreational type, "The Gate of Baikal". The basic problem is that the material base of the sector has been essentially obsolete and does not correspond to the international standards. The airport "Irkutsk" is one of the bottlenecks. Another problem is alignment of seasonal prevalence of tourist flows. In the tourist sector, the practice of private-state partnership seems to be quite effective.																			2080-1653	2449-903X					2010	16						213	217																WOS:000448630100020

So, we present and analyze the temporal and spatial variations of CH4 VMRs over Lake Baikal, the only freshwater body, the unique large and high latitude lake, based on the retrieved monthly CH(4)data from SCIAMACHY spectra. The result showed that monthly CH4 concentrations in atmosphere extended between 1744.780ppb and 1818.495ppb. The value in March was a relative higher value, and then increased from April to August. After this growing, the CH4 concentration decreased to September. But, there was an increased trend in October. Overall, the temporal pattern liked the ocean pattern during the growing season, and was in line with permafrost in other time. Moreover, the spatial distribution of CH4 VMRs showed that the values were higher in North Lake Baikal, followed by South, Center. The crucial controlling factor for the seasonal variation of CH4 concentration and spatial difference was both temperature, the amount of organic matter in the sediment and stability of hydrate. This exerted a direct influence on diatom and CH4 source plus (hydrate). Furthermore, the monthly CH(4)concentrations by air transport were few for the size of basin over Lake Baikal and mountain barriers. So the source over Lake Baikal was itself. Based the average annual mean (8 months) atmospheric CH4 concentration and the area of the Lake Baikal (31494Km(2)), the annual CH4 flux (at all atmospheric altitude levels) was roughly estimated to be 40.03Mg yr (-1) (mean) during the period (March-October, 2003).

The number and the scale of dammed lakes are extremely rare in the world. Besides the backwater of the dammed lakes can flood the road traffic, villages and farmland on the upstream, it can severely threaten the safety of the people's lives and properties on the downstream. Once the dammed lakes burst out, they can cause severe flood disaster. Therefore, it is urgent to monitor the dammed lakes, study their distribution and analyze their development by means of remote sensing (RS) and geography information system (GIS) after the earthquake. In this paper, 145 high-resolution images were processed and 31 severely-afflicted counties were studied through RS monitoring and field investigation. By the time of May 28,2008, 257 dammed lakes existing more than 14 days were identified and there were 34 dammed lakes with capacity of more than 100 000m(3). Based on these conditions, the distribution and development of dammed lakes were discussed and the findings showed that: (a) The dammed lakes induced by Wenchuan earthquake mainly scatter in Beichuan, Wenchuan, Shifang, Mianzhu and Anxian counties, and there exist 154 dammed lakes in these regions, which is 59.92 percent of the total. (b) 95.3 percent of the dammed lakes are within 10km of three major fault zones of Longmen Mountains and the relationship between the number of dammed lakes and their distance to fault zone accords with the law of logarithmic decrement. (c) Most of dammed lakes are distributed in the upper reaches of Minjiang River, Tuojiang River, Jianjiang River and Fujiang River, etc. in rosary. (d) The distribution of dammed lakes in the study areas is dominated by seismic intensity, lithology, slope and altitude. In the next 5-10 years, collapses, landslides and debris flows in the study area will occur frequently and severely and they are likely to block river channels and form dammed lakes. As rainy season comes, the risk of dammed lakes forming and bursting is increasing. So it is necessary to reinforce the real-time monitoring of dammed lakes, make risk assessment and formulate the emergency countermeasures.

To verify the extent of phytoplankton changes with small changes of zooplankton due to changes in the fish stock, three approaches to the estimation of size of zooplankton were developed: the average length of zooplankton, the percentage of cladocerans >0.71 mm in the total cladoceran biomass, and the length of the average biomass. The percentage of cladocerans >0.71 mm shows a statistically-significant correlation of their seasonal averages to the seasonal averages of chlorophyll concentration and, furthermore, a steeper long-term increase in chlorophyll than that of total phosphorus at a decrease of percentage of cladocerans >0.71 mm. The newly-developed method of estimating the length of average biomass from size classes of biomasses is more objective than that of the percentage of cladocerans >0.71 mm and includes both Cladocera and Copepoda. The values of the old and new method show highly-significant correlations. Both methods showed a long-term decrease of the size of zooplankton in two reservoirs over decades not related to the changes in biomass. The reason for this decrease and that of the lower efficiency of transport of energy in reservoirs as compared to fish ponds are discussed as well as weaknesses of the so-called biological indication.																			1875-1261		978-90-481-9264-9				2010	3						45	70		10.1007/978-90-481-9265-6_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-90-481-9265-6_4													WOS:000281253400004

MITIGATION OF GROUNDWATER-DOMINATED LAKEBED PLAYAS CROSSED BY THE RUBY PIPELINE, UTAH AND NEVADA	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL PIPELINE CONFERENCE 2010, VOL 3					8th International Pipeline Conference (IPC 2010)	SEP 27-OCT 01, 2010	Calgary, CANADA	ASME, ASME, IPTI				The Ruby Pipeline is a 42-inch diameter pipeline that will transmit natural gas 675 miles from Opal, Wyoming, to Malin, Oregon. The pipeline alignment crosses landforms designated as playas at several locations in Utah and Nevada. Federal agencies reviewing environmental documents requested mitigation based on the concept that playas collect and hold rainwater on impervious clay bottoms for long periods of time, and that an open-cut trench could drain ephemeral lakes by penetrating impervious clay bottom soil layers and permanently alter the surface water hydrology of the playas. Trench plugs, segregation of excavated impervious soil, limited construction right-of-way, impervious backfill, and construction during the 'dry' season were the recommended mitigation measures, presumably to reduce the potential for surface water collected on the playa to drain into the subsurface through a trench cut across the playa. The surface-water hydrology concern may pertain to playa environments in semiarid areas such as the southern High Plains of the United States, notably northern Texas. The playas crossed by the Ruby Pipeline are lakebeds of major ancient lakes (Lake Bonneville in Utah, and Lake Lahontan and Lake Meinzer in Nevada) that were hundreds of feet deep and occupied extensive, topographically closed drainage basins. These lakebed playas are dominated by shallow groundwater. Surface water collects on the playa surfaces but is not responsible for playa formation or preservation. The water tends to be salty in lakebed playas in Utah and Nevada compared to fresh water in the ephemeral playa lakes in northern Texas. This brief case history describing playas dominated by groundwater instead of surface water may help advance the understanding that mitigation useful for surface-water dominated playas is not needed for groundwater-dominated playas. Geotechnical investigation included soil borings, test pits, laboratory testing, and surface geophysical surveys (seismic refraction and refraction microtremor [ReMi] methods).																					978-0-7918-4422-9				2010							159	165																WOS:000320009000019

In order to set up the appropriate toxicological criteria for the leachate, leachate toxicity tests with various organisms need to be conducted. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the toxicity of leachate using the protozoan community, and the toxic effects of varies seasonal leachates were also compared. Leachates from two municipal solid waste landfills in Wuhan, China were used to develop short-term acute toxicity testing. Bioassays were conducted recording toxicity against various seasonal protozoan communities as median effective concentrations (EC50 values) of species after 24 h exposure. Various seasonal protozoan communities were all sensitive to the leachate samples and the species of the communities decreased with an increase in the leachates concentrations. The EC50 values of Landfill A oscillated between 1.03% and 2.24%, and the EC50 values of Landfill B were between 2.79% and 6.60%. Fluctuation of physicochemical parameters and EC(50)s of leachates depended rather on landfill age than season of the year (seasonal variations). The results from the bivariate correlation analyses between EC50s and physicochemical parameters implied that the toxicity of leachate might reliably depend on the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N).

Modelling the Role of Fluctuations in Volume on Self-purification of Natural Water Bodies	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION												We present a simple mathematical model for examining the role of seasonal fluctuations of volume on self-purification of natural water bodies such as a lake ecosystem. The evolution of self-purification process, activated by natural mechanisms of flushing by clean water and degradation of pollutants by aeration, is influenced by a number of parameters depending on lake-specific characteristics. These parameters have been identified in the formulation of the model. The model consists of an initial value problem which has been solved analytically. Numerical results are presented graphically to highlight the effect of these parameters on clean-up time corresponding to all pollution levels. Results for a few simpler situations derived as particular cases from the general solution are also included and discussed.																			0972-9860	1875-8568					2010	7	4					63	69																WOS:000211157900008

The Mekong giant catfish Pangasianodon gigas is one of the largest freshwater fishes in the world, measuring up to 3 m in length and weighing in excess of 300 kg. The catfish is one of the most important fisheries species of the Mekong River Basin in the Southeast Asia; however, the catch number of wild catfish in the Mekong River has declined due to development of the river and over-fishing (HOGAN 2004) and the catfish currently is listed in CITES Appendix I and on the IUCN Red List of threatened species as a Critically Endangered Species. Hatchery-reared juvenile and young immature catfish were released into lakes and reservoirs as well as the Mekong River to enhance the stock (MEYNELL 2003). The behavior, movement patterns, and survival rate of these catfish after release into natural conditions remains largely unknown (MEYNELL 2003), although that information is quite useful for fishery management and conservation decision making (LOWE et al. 2003, HUMSTON et al. 2005). We started to investigate the movement patterns of the catfish using acoustic telemetry in 2001 (ARAI et al. 2005). To assess the movement patterns of the catfish during the rainy season in 2003, 8 fish tagged with acoustic transmitters were released in Mae Peum reservoir, northern Thailand in 2003 (MITAMURA et al. 2008). Although 7 of 8 tagged fish had expelled the transmitters during the study period (8-136 days), the remaining one fish was monitored for more than 14 mo during both the dry and rainy seasons, which provided the movement patterns in relation to the seasonal environmental condition. There are not so many studies that continuously monitored the same fish over a year due to the same difficulties, such as fish mobility, vastness of the study site, and transmitter detachment (LUCAS 1989). The objective of this study was to report the seasonal movements of one catfish in relation to environmental conditions.																			0368-0770		978-3-510-54080-8				2010	30		9				1369	+																WOS:000312418900013

With a discharge capacity of as much as 25 percent of the peak flood of the Yangtze River, they are critical to flood control of the Jingjiang reach. Even after completion of the Three Gorges project, the flood passages still play an important role in flood control of the Jingjiang reach. However, the tensions in flood prevention, seasonal water shortage, etc. are conspicuous over the years. Flood prevention is still under the strain of heavy work though it has been alleviated after construction of the Three Gorges project. With the impounding of the Three Gorge reservoir and the erosion of the Jingjiang channel, the three flood passages dry up for a longer time, leading to more serious seasonal water shortage in this area. The three flood passages are badly in need of harnessing and improvement. In this paper, the scheme of "controlling secondary branches and reinforcing main branches in combination with building plain reservoirs" is discussed for the integrated regulation of the three flood passages, and its effect is also analyzed.

The size at first sexual maturity presents variations along the river (upstream, the lake and downstream). Females are slightly smaller than males. Data of gonadal maturition and gonado-somatic index both indicate that breeding varies according to the hydrological and seasonal conditions. The oocyte diameter at spawning is 1.8mm; relative fecundity reaches 31834 oocytes per kg body weight.

The research involves mapping transformed businesses, as well as searching for the answer to how the tendency of the periods of high season and the changing of the visitors' segments affect catering industry. In addition to this, the study draws a comparison between the motivation of setting up businesses and the year of their launch. In the Lake Balaton Resort Area, which serves as the locality of the particular research, it can be observed that the importance of the service industry is on the increase, which ensures the possibility of an alternative source of income to the local inhabitants. In the first place, it directly affects the labour force, driven out of the primary sector jobs, who are on the verge of having the service industry as the only chance to get a job. The study is aimed at commercial concentration and the changing of the catering industry, besides the breakdown of the region's businesses into separate branches. The main question of the examination is whether the economic priority of tourism may be sufficient enough in the future to kick-start the development of this specific rural region, or further diversification of branches should be required in the interest of development. While mapping the characteristics of the layers of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, we have been looking for the answer to how economic-sociological processes that are present in the Lake Balaton Resort Area influence their successfulness. The development of tourist destinations, the improvement of living standards and the enhancement of the Balaton identity can be supported by the self-employment and creating jobs. To achieve that, it is inevitable for the local inhabitants to pool their interests and co-operate.																			1821-2506						2010	2	1					84	102																WOS:000219217900006

Gleaning Information from Multiple Data Sources to Determine Watershed Water Quality Conditions	21ST CENTURY WATERSHED TECHNOLOGY: IMPROVING WATER QUALITY AND ENVIRONMENT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS					21st Conference on Century Watershed Technology - Improving Water Quality and Environment	FEB 21-24, 2010	Univ Earth, Guacimo, COSTA RICA		Univ Earth			The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) is the principal environmental agency for the State of Kansas. KDHE is responsible for administering safe drinking water and water pollution control rules and regulations and assuring that Kansas' water resources meet water quality standards. Since the early 70's Kansas' has collected water samples from lakes, rivers and streams. Samples are collected at fixed locations, at fixed frequencies and analyzed for a variety of bacteriological, chemical and physical properties. Program administrators selected sample collection sites that were important in determining the effectiveness of water pollution control programs. Initially about 100 water sample collection sites were located where important rivers entered and exited the state and below large waste water discharges. Since inception of the network, additional sampling sites have been added to address special needs. Typically, these special need sites remained in the network. At the present time, the total number of sample collection sites exceeds 300. Other organizations such as United States Geological Survey, Kansas Biological Survey, and Kansas State University conduct studies of a few years in duration. These studies typically focus on smaller watersheds, with more frequent base flow and event sampling. This paper illustrates analytical procedures used in Kansas to glean information from datasets derived from different water quality sampling protocols and purposes to evaluate water quality conditions of river basins and watersheds. Simple techniques are applied to water quality datasets derived from various sources to determine total maximum daily loads and progress in abating pollutant loads; determine geographic, seasonal and longitudinal water quality characteristics to discern program outcomes and guide future program initiatives, and communicate with watershed stakeholders.																									2010										10.13031/2013.29446	http://dx.doi.org/10.13031/2013.29446													WOS:000395656400058

In order to understand the contribution of landcover in this area for agricultural, piscicultural activity, and environmental protection, landcover classes should be classified by using remote sensing data. The aim of this study is to increase distinction between landcover classes for classification purpose. To improve the feature texture for pre-classification data, the ALOS PALSAR is fused with ASTER data. Both data are acquired in dry season in which the vegetation is little influenced by flooding. The fused data is created by injecting the feature texture of ALOS PALSAR into ASTER data. However, spectral character is distorted due to mixed spectrum. This is reduced by choosing optimal fused algorithm. The ten landcover classes are selected as signatures to classify and calculate confusion matrixes. Those confusion matrixes reveal that the distinction between the landcover classes in fused data is better than that in ASTER data.

And, since the availability of past data for one source of time series images may be limited, so we need to develop multi-temporal and multi-source method for wetland ecosystem monitoring. To perform this type of analysis, the image spectral characteristics comparison between different aquatic macrophytes and different sensors should be studied firstly. We used TM images, Beijing-1 images and HJ-1 images for this analysis and based on the determination of aquatic plant functional types (PFTs). The objectives of this study were: (1) single-sensor single-date aquatic PFT analysis; (2) multi-source single-date diagnostic spectral characteristics analysis and comparison for different aquatic PFTs; (3) multi-source multi-temporal diagnostic spectral characteristics analysis for different aquatic PFTs. From this analysis we found that: (1) For the single-date TM data, the diagnostic spectral band and indexes are Band 2, 4, 5, NDVI, and MNDWI; the best temporal for discriminating different Nonpersistent Emergent Wetland PFTs are in low water level periods, and water infilling and subsiding periods for seasonal submerged and floating aquatic macrophyte. Multi-spectral Decision Tree classification method lead the more good results for most of PFTs; (2) the same type of aquatic PFTs have similar and comparable reflectance characteristics between multi-sensor optical data which could satisfy the time series analysis by compensating more available past images; (3) phenological curves and relative canopy moisture curves extracted from time series remote sensing images provide important information for distinguish different PFTs.																					978-1-4244-7302-1				2010																								WOS:000296522300217
J	Watkins, J				Watkins, Jim			Use of satellite remote sensing tools for the Great Lakes	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Satellite-based sensors provide synoptic measurements of surface parameters useful in detecting physical and biological conditions of the Great Lakes. Satellite surface temperature measurements using infrared spectra are compatible with buoy measurements and the time series now covers more than two decades in length. This time-series tracks seasonal warming patterns and localized upwelling events. The use of visible spectra for remote sensing of water clarity and particle composition is improving with new algorithms to separate chlorophyll-a, inorganic particles, and dissolved organic matter. The use of satellites to measure these variables holds promise for future quantification of phytoplankton production, calcite precipitation (whiting), and suspended sediment from rivers and resuspension events.

China's natural wetland area accounts for about 4% of the area of the natural wetlands worldwide. Based on the data of global lakes and wetlands, in this study we conducted modeling work of CH4 emissions from natural wetlands in China by using terrestrial ecosystem model (TEM) of the 1995-2005. The results show that China's terrestrial natural wetland based CH4 emission is 7.48Tg/a, which is mainly distributed in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and in northwest region of China accounting for 68% of the emissions nationwide. Lake wetlands, marsh/floodplains and seasonal wetland are the major three types of wetlands are the major sources of CH4 emissions in China, accounting for 65% of total emissions. Monthly simulations of CH4 emissions from 1995-2005 show that regional maximum on CH4 emissions are closely related to soil temperatures and in the period of June, July and August, of which the emission maximum is in July. These simulation based estimates will be of great importance to China's climate change and greenhouse gas control study.					xu, kai/LYO-5385-2024																978-1-4244-7302-1				2010																								WOS:000296522300019

Dynamics of Phytoplankton Pigment Characteristics in the Biya Head Water	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												Concentrations of phytoplankton photosynthetic pigments were measured at the Biya head water (in the immediate vicinity of Lake Teletskoe) every 10 days from July 1998 through December 2001. Comparison of phytoplankton pigment characteristics at the river's head waters and at the surface of the lake's pelagic zone for the ice-free period shows that the monitoring data give a clear picture of the formation and functioning of the lake phytoplankton. Analysis of seasonal fluctuations of pigment characteristics and their proportions revealed characteristic stages in the development of lake algal cenoses. We have demonstrated similarities and differences in the seasonal dynamics of the phytoplankton between Lake Teletskoe, a deep oligotrophic lake in the south of West Siberia, as compared with the general pattern observed in temperate lakes. According to the concentration of chlorophyll a, the trophic status of the lake's pelagic zone and the Biya head water is ultraoligotrophic-oligotrophic. Yellow: green pigment ratio ranks Lake Teletskoe among "carotenoid lakes". Low coefficients of linear correlation between chlorophyll a, water level and biogenic matter concentration shows that the relationships analyzed are far more complex than has been inferred from the combined effect of abiotic and biotic factors.

The research was done in 8 earthen ponds, with 2 ponds of 0.7 hectares and 6 ponds of 0.3 hectares. According to the results of the semi industrial research center in the Fasandoz plain in western Azerbaijan province, sampling shows that the biomass of artemia average 40 tons per year. According to the energy efficiency of the cyst and adult artemia compounds, the energy balance sheet is calculated as a function of biomass and protein. The amount and energy efficiency (ratio of data to saving) is estimated as a function of biomass as 0.048, and as a function of protein as 0.018. The most consumed energy is in response to application of hen fertilizer (47.74 percent) and gasoline (29.4 percent), and the least energy is consumed as required for releasing cysts (0.001). To produce brine shrimp in Uremia Lake, the bisexual Artemia urmiana should be used. Recommendations are provided for the optimal consumption of energy harvest of cysts in artemia breeding pools. In ponds designed to produce artemia, a large amount of lime should be added in the preparation stage, to increase the alkalinity of the water, such that with frequent fertilization until the end of the cycle, there is no reduction of pH in the water. The results indicate that at high salinity, artemia populations will decrease in the ponds and fewer cysts will be produced. Cytogenesis of Artemia urmiana occurs at low temperatures, such that cytogenesis should not be attempted during warm seasons.																			0469-6255	1848-6320				JUN	2009	56	1-2					65	71																WOS:000450824400009

The use of traps and the need for conservation of Synodontis fisheries in Asa Lake, Ilorin, Nigeria	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												The basket conical traps are commonly used to catch Synodontis species by the fishermen in Asa Lake, Ilorin, Nigeria because these species are caught alive to attract higher market values. Fleets of these traps randomly set at the bottom shoreline by fishermen at three different locations around the lake from the dam site to the river source were examined for Synodontis catch in 12 months. The specimen of Synodontis schall and Synodontis gambiensis were encountered with the latter occurring in August to October corresponding only with the flood season around the lake. S. schall occurred throughout the seasons but more abundantly in the traps during the dry season. All the specimens of Synodontis caught were found alive with mean standard length ranging from 7.8 to 16.75 cm for S. schall and 16.8 to 22.48 for S. gambiensis. Their corresponding weights ranges are 12.50 to 77.45 g and 49.75 to 92.76, for S. schall and S. gambiensis, respectively. Gravid specimens of both species were caught between the months of June to August in both the fixed and the lost traps. A total of 18 lost traps were recovered during the 12 months of research particularly during the flood seasons. There were no lost traps in November to March. The period of low catch ( October and November) also corresponded with the season when the juveniles of S. schall became abundant in the lake. The total fish catch in the wet and dry season was significantly different (P<0.05) in both species. 'Ghost fishing' a phenomenon that usually occurred when the set traps were lost due to high floods around the lake and the need for conservation of these valuable water resources are discussed.																			1684-5315					MAY 18	2009	8	10					2379	2384																WOS:000266581800059

The Use of Decision Analysis and Watershed Modeling to Investigate E. coli Potential Sources and Solutions in Lake Tuscaloosa Watershed, Alabama	JOURNAL OF WATER MANAGEMENT MODELING												Lake Tuscaloosa, an artificial impoundment that serves as a public water supply, is located in Tuscaloosa and Fayette counties in the State of Alabama, in the Southeastern United States. Recent studies and monitoring of the lake show high levels of E. coli bacteria in the upper parts of the lake (near the main stream entrances) during periods of high stream flow. These high levels of E. coli are a concern for many different interested parties in the area. The city is under pressure to strengthen its management, monitoring, and control of existing and future pollutant sources (mostly land development) around the lake that is in its jurisdiction. Additionally, the city has to consider other sources of bacteria in the watershed outside of its jurisdiction as potential causes of these elevated bacteria levels. The decision analysis framework and modeling schemes developed as part of this research examine flow, E. coli sources and transport issues, along with potential solutions. The decision analysis framework assisted at different stages of the project during the collection and management of the information that helped in the analysis of the problems and solutions. The flow and E. coli watershed models assisted in the analysis of the available data for the watershed to identify locations, seasons, and flow ranges associated with the E. coli discharges. Developing a strategy to maintain the E. coli levels below the permissible limits in the watershed was challenging because many factors and information were needed for consideration during the data analysis and decision making parts of the research.																			2292-6062						2009							1	22		10.14796/JWMM.R235-01	http://dx.doi.org/10.14796/JWMM.R235-01													WOS:000409903400001

This task becomes complex in wetlands located in arid or semiarid environments - playa-lakes, sebkha or similar - because flooding is intermittent or very variable in frequency and extent. After arduous negotiations between the farmers and the regional government, an official demarcation of the protected area of Gallocanta Lake was recently adopted. The boundaries, based on the present extent of the lake, do not take into account the fluctuations that occur in more humid periods. At Gallocanta Lake, the extent of both the water surface and the fringes of wet soil and wild vegetation undergo dramatic changes even over short time periods. The satellite images bear witness to this variability, and their study has revealed facies on the lake shore as well as seasonal and interannual changes in soil moisture. These data, along with expert assessments and other research efforts, provide indicators for inclusion into the management guidelines and procedures for this saline wetland and its surroundings.

This research aimed at the characterization of the ecosystems of the Lower Brates ecopedotope, belonging to the lower Prut Meadow. at the confluence of the river Prut with the Danube, These ecosystems were born from the former Brates Lake and riverside areas drainage. Soil analysis has been performed according to, Soil Taxonomy Romanian System" (SRTS, 2003) and the Pedological Studies Elaboration Methodology (ICPA, 1987), while the ecological interpretation of soils was done after the methodology by Chirita in 1974. The soils of this ecopedotope are represented by soils from Regosol class represented by the calcaric, mollic, gleyc and salic alluviosols subtypes, used as arable land, and the Hydrosol class, including mollic and calcaric gleysols, used mainly as pastures and natural hay fields but also as arable land. Soil profiles were studied in the field, while their main physical, chemical and biological traces were determined in the lab which allowed the elaboration of ecological records/files, the values of soil trophic indicators and ecological soil diagnosis. Most factors and ecological determinatives under analysis could be included within the classes of medium and low favorability for agricultural crops. The dry seasons, inadequate use of the soil, and the medium and fine soil texture were found to be the main factors of negative ecological impact, that lead to an inappropriate use of the high trophic potential of the Lower Prut meadow ecosystems.																			1222-4227						2009	26						65	69																WOS:000271828400013

Many studies have attempted to better understand the factors controlling ultraviolet attenuation in freshwater environments (MORRIS et al. 1995, SMITH et al. 1999, RAE et al. 2001) and made prediction models of UV attenuation based on biogeochemical properties using dissolved organic carbon (DOC), CDOM, and suspended particles. However, those results were in dystrophic and clear lakes, and hence more studies are needed to evaluate the gradients of physical and biological factors of UV attenuation in other types of lakes. Many subtropical and temperate lakes to be preserved and conserved by human society have a relatively low DOC concentrations and variable suspended matter; therefore, they have more variable UV attenuation depending on supply and behavior of the DOM and the suspended matter in lakes. Lake Biwa offers a broad range of optical conditions within a single water body as well as relatively low DOC. Considerable data are available from the past decade on optical properties in Lake Biwa (HODOKI & WATANABE 1998, VINCENT et al. 2001, BELZILE et al. 2002). These studies found that UV attenuation in the lake was characterized by dependency on the contributions of particle absorption in the high turbidity of the littoral zone and CDOM absorption in the low turbidity of the offshore zone. However, those studies did not consider the seasonal supplies and losses of the DOM and suspended matter. For better understanding of factors that control UV penetration in the lake, the spatial and seasonal variations of the DOM and suspended matter in the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles of the lake need to be studied. We investigated seasonal changes in UV and visible light (VL) attenuations in the pelagic and littoral zones of Lake Biwa and examined the absorption factors that contribute to UV attenuation using measurements of biogeochemical parameters in the lake water.																			0368-0770		978-3-510-54079-2				2009	30		8				1202	1206																WOS:000274244900010

This simplifying assumption is adopted in the light of the strong affinity of P for the soil solid phase and the high particulate P concentrations generally measured downstream of various agricultural catchments. Recent studies centred on the Lake Geneva catchment show that there is a considerable spatial and temporal variability of P species exported in surface runoff associated with storm-flow events. This variability in P export results from interactions between different types of flow, whose structural and soil moisture conditions (globally driven by seasonal trends) mainly control the water flow pathway on the catchment, and a set of P stocks of variable mobilities and availabilities that are distributed according to land use and topography. P losses from soils do not necessarily imply export at the outlet of the catchment basin, since intervening buffer zones (e.g. field margins, meadows, marshlands, etc.) modify the transfer of P. These buffer zones are capable of storing permanently or temporarily a portion of the transferred P and restoring it at least partially during subsequent storm-flow events, sometimes with transformation of the P species. The hydrographic network (particularly that part associated with sediments and banks) acts sometimes as a sink and sometimes as a source of P. All these compartments modify the quantities exported at the outlet, their speciation, and the timing of export. On this basis, we propose a conceptual model of the transfer of P in small catchments, integrating the role of morpho-pedological pattern and other characteristics of the landscape. For each storm-flow event, the model defines a hydrochemical pattern of outlet P losses, allowing an annual cycle of P emission to be defined, along with the corresponding dominant species of P, and the potential impact on lake waters. This kind of model throws into relief the various scales and components needed for control water quality at the respective scales of agricultural plots, inter-field structures and hydrographic networks, as well as the different human actors involved.																			0182-0745		978-2-903581-54-1				2009	33	1-2					183	206																WOS:000266370800011

We report the result of long-term trend analysis of time series of Chlorophyll-A in Lake Biwa. The concentration of Chlorophyll-A is a barometer of phytoplankton growth. The higher the concentration, the worse the water quality and the more probable we have the danger of red tides and blue-green algae. Data has been observed through the water quality investigations conducted by Shiga Prefecture and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. Data are generally observed from April 1979 to March 2003, measured at the fixed points once in a month, though the data lengths and the observed items vary. The first part of this presentation works on the removal of seasonal pattern from a given time series. Because the periodic pattern due to yearly climate change or some general social activities is a nuisance for trend-analysis, it should be removed in advance. For this aim, we employ unobserved component time series models where the observation is decomposed into several unobserved components. Stochastic constrains on the smoothness of the variability of the components lead to constrained least squares solution, which can be represented in a Markov form, a state space representation. Based on the trend estimates obtained by the observation sites, we show a contour plot of the Chlorophyll-A concentration for a given time point via spatial smoothing and interpolation. Station-wise plots of the estimated trends of Chlorophyll concentration reveal that the clarification of north Lake Biwa made progress in 1980s while the south lake finally purified around 2000. This can be visually confirmed by the spatially smoothed contour plots. One of the background for the recent low concentration of Chlorophyll-A can be sought for the decrease of effluent impact, most of which could be accounted for the improvement of sewerage system of the towns around the lake. After this preliminary stage, we obtain the trend series of measured substance by every monitoring point. In the next step, we examine the significance of the estimated trend via formal statistical tests. We report the results of two different kinds of unit root tests, ADF test and KPSS test that are standard tools in the context of econometric time series analysis. Unit root tests are originally the tools to determine whether the process is non-stationary or trend stationary. In this paper, however, we are not interested in such a distinction. For example in ADF test, the null hypothesis is non-stationary (or the existence of stochastic trend). Even when the null is rejected, as long as the coefficient of the linear trend is significant and its sign is negative, we confirm that there is an evidence of decreasing trend in Chlorophyll concentration. On the other hand in KPSS test, the null is trend stationary. Even in case the null is not rejected, we demonstrate the existence of trend via the significant (and negative) coefficient of the linear trend. Generally speaking, we witnessed the existence of (downward) trend at almost every site with respect to the concentration of Chlorophyll-A. If we regard the estimated trend as data, the results often support the existence of deterministic trend. On the other hand, when we use the seasonally adjusted data, stochastic trend is supported in many cases. The reason is rather obvious. If we rely on the extracted trend only, sometimes we work on very smooth data. Then data does not contain much variability, and the deterministic time trend is sufficient to describe the time series data. Seasonally adjusted series, to the contrary, contains irregular part, so it becomes more difficult to separate the irregular part from trend. In such a case, stochastic trend is so flexible that it can show better fit to the data. It is conjectured that by this reason the stochastic trend is preferred for the seasonally adjusted data.

By factor analysis and spatio-temporary correlation analysis etc, the spatio-temporary simulations to main lake water pollution components, including eutrophication, were carried out. The lake water pollution components were classified into two types, primary pollution component (PPC) and secondary pollution component (SPC). The living pollution, nitrogen pollution etc, belong to the former, and eutrophication, ion property etc, belong to the later. The equations of the pollution components were constructed, and inversely their seasonal and spatial changes were analyzed. Finally the relation of simulated eutrophication values with N:P was modeled in this paper, which was similar to general rule of shallow lakes. Results showed that a good combination of spatio-temporary study with factor analysis etc was very helpful for the classification, identification and modeling of water pollution components, and was favorable to evaluate water pollution and deeper study on the mechanism of Lake Eutrophication.

Similar size/frequency behaviors have been observed for lake systems around the world. In our study areas in North and South Dakota, linear power-law relationships on lake area, developed from Landsat images, hold over about two or three orders of magnitude. We have developed a hydrologic model, capable of simulating lake complexes comprised of tens-of-thousands or more individual closed-basin lakes and wetlands. What is new about this model is (i) a novel system for calibration based using observed power-law relationships for tens-of-thousands of lakes, as well as individual lakes, and (ii) a stochastic approach that is able to simulate the 100-year response of a lake/wetland complex through numerous periods of drought and deluge with lake area kept as a stochastic variable. The model has been calibrated successfully using data for seven lakes and eight sets of power-law data for different seasons and climatic extremes. The analysis over the last century shows two orders-of-magnitude variability from extreme drought (e.g., Dust Bowl Drought) to the extreme deluge beginning in 1993. Analyses also show how linear power law will eventually fail for the very small lakes that come and go according to short-term moisture availability.																					978-7-5625-2417-5				2009							161	165																WOS:000282291900040

In this study the bioacrosol were collected at 600 m and 2 in above ground in Kanazawa city at the Kosa coming season, April in 2007. In the culture media based on seawater and lake water, the bioaerosol at 600 m indicated the microbial growth only in the seawater medium, but no growth in the lake water medium. The bioaerosol at 2 m grew in the both media. The halophilic bacteria would maintain viable activities in the atmosphere. Furthermore, the microorganisms in the bioaerosol at 2 m indicated the better growth in this order of 0%, 3%, and 10% of NaCl concentration, and no growth was detected in the 20% NaCl medium. According to the PCR-DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) analysis, same bacterial species were detected in the every NaCl concentration of culture medium, and other bacterial species could grow only in the culture media with 3% or 10% NaCl concentrations. Therefore, the halophilic or halotolerant bacteria would survive in the aerosol at 2 m above ground, and may be related to the microbial transport across the ground-atmosphere.

Acigol Basin in a place where semi-arid climatic conditions are dominant. Vegetation is very scarce in base land. And Acigol Basin is characterized by Acigol Lake which is playa. The total annual precipitation in the coasts of lake is 368-392 mm. The annual mean temperature is 13 OC. The highest level of Acigol lake is approximately 842,74 m. The level is belonging to the year of 1970. On the other hand the lowest level of Acigol lake is approximately 836,47 m which is belonging to the year of 2001. Because of the fact that Acigol Lake is located in straight base of tectonic and karstic depressions, seasonal level changes are seen in a large area. And the lake has started to be smaller day by day same 160 km2 in the year of 1970 and about 50 km2 in 2008 caused by drought and depletion of lake water. The role of the changes which appeared in the last 33 years (1975-2008), is important on this condition. Especially, extrem temperatures and increasing evaporation, decreases in precipitation, extreme consumption of water and the use of water in farming caused desertification in the basin where semi-arid climatic condition are dominant. Salt, salt crystal and coastal dunes appeare or form in the area where the lake level decreased. These formations are dragged along the east side of the basin by westerly blows and dust clouds are formed. These dust clouds damage fruit gardens, farming area and the vegetation in environment, seriously.																			1302-7212	1305-2128					2009		18					1	20																WOS:000447881700001

The aim of this study is to understand the record of water level fluctuations in Lagunillo del Tejo over the last two-and-a-half centuries. This information could be used in future studies to interpret longer sedimentary sequences. We analysed photosynthetic pigments, diatoms and cladoceran remains in sediment sequences recovered from the deepest part of the lake. The paleoecological proxies traced two different communities which have switched their prevalence during the past: (I) a planktonic community of algae, including diatoms, chlorophytes, cryptophytes and cyanobacteria, and phototrophic bacteria associated with higher lake level and water column seasonal stratification; (2) a littoral community with the higher levels of macrophyte pigments and associated epiphytic diatoms and chydorids, all of which indicate lower lake level. The levels of coherence between different proxies, each having an independent mechanistic link to lake-level variability, enhance the reliability of palaeolimnological inferences. The high-resolution stratigraphical data from the upper part of the core was compared with lake-level inferences froth instrumental rainfall series (1859-2005) to establish the correspondence between Lagunillo del Tejo sediment sequences and climate record.

Pond A (Microcystis) bloomed seriously but pond B did not. The data of o-P and chlorophyll suggested that phosphorus was the principal limiting nutrimental element and its vertical flux should be regarded as an important driving factor for algal growth. In pond A, the accumulation of algae-derived detritus after bloom disappearance in overlying water stimulated excretion of algal fraction APA, mainly produced by attached bacteria responsible for detritus decomposition, whereas bacterial fraction APA preferred to function in surface water. Interestingly, completely contrary phenomena were observed in pond B. In season, even though no obvious difference for size-fractionated APA in both ponds, the total APA in pond A peaked earlier showing higher activity and efficiency (low K-m and high V-max values) as a result of algal-derived detritus input. In summary, it is suggested that the excretion of alkaline phosphatase with strongly catalyzing efficiency and high activity should be taken as important contributor to algal-derived detritus decomposition, further fueling nutrient recycle and accelerating algal development next year. Furthermore, some inhibitors and surfactants were testified to be good tools to identify the origin of dissolved alkaline phosphatase.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2009	18	6					982	988																WOS:000267869500011

These human communities develop some fishing techniques for extract a diverse fish species, for self-consumption and for the exchange of some goods and services in the Leticia port. Drag techniques generate a higher level of economic benefits than the gramaloteo arts; because the last one catches small size of fishes which are sold at lower price, further this benefits generated by the gramaloteo technique are restricted by the high costs in the extraction season. The fish species studied in this paper (Hypophtalmus edentatus, Pseudoplatystoma fasciatum, Prochilodous nigricans y Mylossoma aureum) are relevant for the local market and consumption. When these species are catched, the trophic structure is modified for the aquatic ecosystem, and changes the biomass composition, the production and the respiration of each trophic component.

In this study, a new logic for land cover classification at regional scale has been introduced. The critical features of this classification are that: it's indeed distinguished from land use classification system and driven by remote sensing so that repeatable and efficient re-classifications of existing land cover will be possible; spectrum and primary attributes of plant-canopy structure (i.e. permanence of aboveground live biomass, leaf longevity and leaf type) are adopted as the primary criterions of land cover classification; based on the phonological difference among broadly defined vegetation, some typical land cover is easily distinguished by using the characteristics of seasonal dynamic; mixed land cover is differentiated by its constituent characteristics and influence on land surface processes. Taking the areas between Yangtze River Basin and Weihe River Basin in China as a case and using time-series MODIS 250 m data (i.e. NDVI and reflectance), a two-level hierarchical land cover classification scheme was produced for the areas. At the initial stage, the entire study area was mapped into seven classes, i.e. evergreen cover (woody), seasonal green cover (woody), seasonal green cover (herbaceous), seasonal green cover (crops), seasonal green cover (mixed), grey cover (non-vegetated and terrestrial) and blue cover (aquatic or regularly flooded). The sub-classes includes Coniferous evergreen forest, Broadleaf deciduous forest, Single cropping in one year, Continuous double cropping in one year, grassland, Wetland, Urban or Built-up land, Barren or Sparsely land, River, Lake, Mixed Cover of Crop and tree, etc.																					978-1-4244-4562-2				2009							1123	+																WOS:000277622400213

During the grow-out season 2006, water quality problems such as increased mortality rates and off-flavour of the final product caused economic losses. To set criteria for improved site selection, water quality information of surface and near-bottom water was correlated with morphometric reservoir data, fish production data as well as the observed production difficulties. The data revealed good linkage between reservoir information and fish production data as well as production problems. The production problems correlated (P < 0.01) with single water quality parameters so that suggestions for risk management indicators can be made. By ranking the data, threshold values for better production practice were determined. Thereafter, reservoirs of a minimum surface area of at least 3 ha would be recommended as well as reservoirs with good water exchange rates (> 1 per year) to avoid oxygen problems. Reservoirs of larger surface area (> 5 ha) produced significantly larger fish that grew faster and showed lower mortality rates.																			1355-557X	1365-2109				DEC 22	2008	40	1					18	25		10.1111/j.1365-2109.2008.02054.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2008.02054.x													WOS:000261975300004

At the time, the project termed 'Breakthrough' was one of the largest private industrial construction projects in the United States. To make the project as cost-effective as possible required that the project be implemented over a three year, three phase program to coincide with the harvesting season. Under these constraints, the requirement was to get the project operational as fast as possible, which required a fast track approach utilising specially tailored unique project management, procurement and construction methods. This very aggressive, fast track, complex project demanded that engineering, procurement and construction were conducted almost in parallel, in an environment where both the existing raw sugar milling and refinery facilities were in operation. This paper discusses the project and construction management approach, together with the numerous challenges which were encountered along the way.																			0020-8841					MAY	2008	110	1313					265	+																WOS:000255841400019

Assessment of exposure risk of polychlorinated biphenyls to interior least terns (Sterna antillarum)	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Risk of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure and effects were assessed for a colony of federally endangered interior least terns (Sterna antillarum) nesting on the Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge (NM, USA). The colony feeds from an area on the Refuge (Hunter Marsh/Oxbow Complex) wherein fish with elevated concentrations of total PCBs have been documented. Concentrations of total PCBs in whole fish averaged 0.94 mg/kg with a maximum concentration of 2.77 mg/kg, wet weight. Estimated daily PCB intake rates by adult birds throughout their 180-d breeding season ranged from <0.01 mg/kg/d to 0.98 mg/kg/d, yielding hazard quotients that ranged from 0.01 to 21.68. Polychlorinated biphenyls pose a moderate risk to the colony of interior least terns that breed at the Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge, but the exposure rate is not likely to threaten their overall breeding success.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				MAR	2008	27	3					617	622		10.1897/07-172.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/07-172.1								17967068					WOS:000253374500016

S	Badger, TC		Baum, RL; Godt, JW; Highland, LM		Badger, Thomas C.			Peat flow in Mercer Slough, Lake Washington	LANDSLIDES AND ENGINEERING GEOLOGY OF THE SEATTLE, WASHINGTON, AREA	Reviews in Engineering Geology											Over the past four decades, ongoing deformation of an 18-m-thick peat deposit within the flat-lying Mercer Slough has resulted in damaging deflections, and near-collapse in three cases, of pile-supported Interstate 90 bridges and a major water line on the east side of the slough. The peat is partially underlain by a dense sand unit, which includes a highly pressurized aquifer that produces artesian flow 1-2.5 m above the ground surface. Inclinometers on the east side of the slough show the peat flowing toward the structures and then apparently directed west along the interstate centerline. Large displacements recorded in several inclinometers near the center of the slough suggest a length of deforming peat that approaches 600 m, which is likely initiating retrogressively. Potential causal mechanisms include poor engineering characteristics of the peat, presence of high hydrostatic pressure transmitted within and beneath the peat, seasonal water-level variations of Lake Washington and induced hydraulic gradients within the peat, dredging of the Mercer Slough channel, puncturing of the underlying aquifer by numerous pile foundations, and fill placement along the eastern margin of the slough. The peat is flowing around the pile/shaft foundations; however, excessive lateral loads are still being applied to the foundations in a poorly understood and unpredictable manner. The most severe deflections have occurred in the outermost structures where the peat is primarily flowing transverse to the structures.																			0080-2018		978-0-8137-4120-8				2008	20						153	166		10.1130/2008.4020(09)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2008.4020(09)													WOS:000271425100010

Study on the water quality model of sballow lake in the city - Kuncheng Lake as a example	2008 PROCEEDINGS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEM SCIENCES: ITESS 2008, VOL 3					International Conference on Informational Technology and Environmental System Science	MAY 15-17, 2008	Henan Polytechn Univ, Jiaozuo, PEOPLES R CHINA		Henan Polytechn Univ			As one of the components of the basic establishments, shallow lakes play an important role in the construction of ecological environment in the cities. With the development of urbanization, the aquatic environment of shallow lakes becomes more and more worse. Therefore, it is the high time to take some measures to amend the aquatic environment. There are many methods in improvement of the aquatic environment. Among them, numerical simulation is an important one. This paper introduces EFDC (Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code) to study hydrodynamic movement and water quality change of Kuncheng Lake in Suzhou. COD (Chemical oxygen demand), TP (Total phosphorus) and NH4+-N (Ammonia) are adopted as water quality factors to simulate water quality change. The results show that the velocity in the lake is very slow and water inflows from the west, then outflows to the east. Contaminations mainly come from the runoff of the river in the west of the lake. The COD is higher in the west. The high value of TP is in the southwest and mainly affected by the contaminations from Mocheng River. Concentration of NH4+-N is higher in the southwest and comes from Mocheng River during flood season, and the high value is in the northwest, mainly effected by contaminants from Zhangjia Port during dry season. It is suggested that there be effective measures to isolate, Kuncheng Lake from the encroachments by sewage of two rivers and control water exchange between the lake and the rivers. These results should be instructive to the environment management of Kuncheng Lake.																					978-7-121-06304-6				2008							553	558																WOS:000257018700110

However, all the examinations of this river together with small F streams concern mainly areas of the Drawienski National Park which is located in the upper part of Drawa river. In order to determine influence of sewage and agricultural pollutants on waters of middle and lower Drawa River, physical. and chemical parameters of water were determined in the area of Drawa river basin. In this area there are places, where values of physical, chemical and biological parameter show a strong influence of anthropogenic factors. Sites, which were particularly polluted, showed high concentration of biogenic substances and were covered with macrophytes typical for fast eutrophication. Many sites were characterized by changes of species and quantitative composition of fish, which are indicators of clean waters. The main reasons of disadvantageous changes in the aqueous environment are: sewage, agricultural fertilizers and effluents from fish breeding ponds. Results of investigations show, that Drawa River, and especially some of its tributaries and lakes located in its course are characterized by unfavourable environmental conditions. Outflow grounds of agricultural waste, industrial and even domestic waste landfills are located within their catchments, which is surprising in the XXI century. Moreover catchments are located near Drawienski National Park (DNP). Slopica river which estuary to Drawa is located in DNP is a good example of described situation. Within the catchment area of Slopica occur all factors, mainly anthropogenic, degrading its ecosystem. Realization of the packets of ,,ecological" programme Agriculture and Environment is a proper method to decrease emission of pollutants flowing down from agricultural areas to waters. Most important activities are: aftercrops and supplementary afercrop, maintenance of meadows and extensive pastures, limiting chemical fertilization. Very essential for the protection of waters is creation of buffer zones, in form of plant belts separating the water reservoir from agricultural tillage. Probably, examined water courses in the result of changes, mainly caused by anthropogenic stress will undergo slow, but total degradation. These changes probably will lead to morphological transformations, depriving all chances on existence of desirable for the environment species of flora and fauna, especially valuable fish species.

Measurements of temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and salinity parameters were taken on monthly basis from the surface level to 30 m depth (in stratification period to 60 m) between December 2003 and November 2004. Epilimnion temperatures of the warm monomictic type Lake Burdur ranged seasonally between 6-25.3 degrees C despite hypolimnion remained constant year round at 6-8 degrees C, not forming a mixture at all. In the lake thermal stratification were detected between months May and October. Dissolved oxygen trend relative to depth is clinograde type, as in eutrophic lakes. In both periods, in which the stratification occurring or not, generally below 20 m a sudden drop of oxygen concentration and below 24 m anoxic conditions were found to be dominant. According to annual averages, elilimnion covered 0-7.5 m, while thermocline was between 7.5-12.5 and hypolimnion lower depths. According to measurements on 17.07.2004 to 60 m, pH at surface was determined as 9.15, at 35 m 9.35 and at 60 m again 9.15; conductivity at surface was determined 28.9, while at 60 m 30.86 mS/cm; salinity was found to be 17.8 at surface, 19.6 at 50 m, 19.1 ppt at 60 m.

Evaluation of armor stone performance and deterioration	ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS IN COASTAL REGIONS VII	WIT TRANSACTIONS ON THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT				7th International Conference on Environmental Problems in Coastal Regions	FEB 19-MAY 21, 2008	New Forest, ENGLAND	Wessex Inst Technol, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm				Evaluating long-term performance and deterioration of armor stones are essential for maritime structures to protect harbors or navigable areas. Armor rocks are impacted by the natural elements such as seasonal weather, and repeated cycles of temperature (e.g., flowing water, wetting and drying, wave action, freeze and thaw, etc.). The rock's behavior in the field may vary greatly from the controlled laboratory test results. The design process for the determination of optimal armor stone sizes is complex. Numerous investigators have studied the development of relationships for the minimum stable weight of a rubble-mound armor unit for given wave conditions. The main objective of this study has been to evaluate major factors involved in armor stone durability. To consider the combined effects of environmental stresses on armor stone, several testing procedures have been developed to evaluate the performance of stone subjected to both freezing and thawing and wetting and drying. Long-term performance or deterioration of armor stones have been quantitatively monitored and characterized by the changes in dimensions measured. A degradation numerical model has been developed that relates the laboratory test results to the armor stone mass reduction at the project site. The paper describes the latest results and developed tools for the armor stone evaluations. New approaches are introduced that may be used to evaluate the quality and durability with reference to breakage and integrity.

The quest for a biological optimum escapement for sockeye salmon	RECONCILING FISHERIES WITH CONSERVATION, VOLS I AND II	American Fisheries Society Symposium				4th World Fisheries Congress	MAY 02-06, 2004	Vancouver, CANADA					A study was made of the way in which sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka runs are managed in North America by regressing escapement on catch. The intercept is a provisional estimate of the escapement needed to maintain the run under the prevailing management system. Since they are very close to stated escapement goals, managers are today able to secure a preset number of spawners. In order to preserve bio diversity, management must consider other attributes in addition to numbers, like spatial distribution of the escapement and conservation of minor age groups. The fishing power of the fleet is high enough to remove all salmon present in a district during a long fishing period. An alternative strategy would be continuous fishing throughout the season with sufficient reduction in units of gear. Optimum escapement goals cannot be based solely on the needs of the commercial fishery; but other user groups must be considered.																			0892-2284		978-1-888569-80-3				2008	49						1815	+																WOS:000254264800148
S	Morgan, KT		Fares, A; ElKadi, AI		Morgan, K. T.			Impact of best management practices in a coastal watershed	COASTAL WATERSHED MANAGEMENT	Progress in Water Resources											Draining of wetlands to adapt the coastal plain for agricultural and urban use has occurred in many locations throughout the United States. The Kissimmee River, Lake Okeechobee, and Everglades are part of a vast wetland system that historically extended over 200 miles from the Kissimmee chain of lakes, near Orlando, ending in the mangrove estuaries of Florida Bay, south of Miami. This nutrient-poor wetland system supported a diverse and large community of species across huge seasonal and interannual variation in rainfall. The combination of a subtropical climate and supply of potentially arable land has proven to make South Florida a desirable place to farm and live. With agricultural and urban development of the landscape, several areas of Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades have experienced increased nutrient loading, particularly phosphorus, resulting in shifts in the algae and plant communities found within lakes, marshes, and near-shore marine environments. Reducing this "phosphorus enrichment" is the primary goal of Lake Okeechobee and Everglades restoration efforts brought about by the Everglades Forever Act (EFA). Site-specific best management practices (BMPs) to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of runoff leaving agricultural lands have improved the water quality of associated wetlands. Another method used to reduce phosphorus for complying with the EFA includes the development of man-made wetlands, called stormwater-treatment areas (STAs) where phosphorus removal is achieved through the accumulation and burial of peat sediments. These restoration actions should reverse environmental impacts of increased P loading while maintaining the original goals of supporting agricultural production and urban development.																			1461-6513		978-1-84564-091-0				2008							333	348				10.2495/978-1-84564-091-0												WOS:000294864800013

Role of catchment litter in wetland P cycling-recent experience from Western Australia	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Many wetlands in south-western Australia are situated in the interdunal depressions of coastal sand dunes, and have catchments with significant native vegetation. While farming and urbanisation are common sources of nutrients, natural processes such as P release from catchment litter and its potential as a P source for these waters have rarely been investigated. Such information is important not only in understanding the wetland ecology, but also in setting restoration targets for eutrophic waters in the region. This review focuses on recent works conducted in a number of small wetlands near Perth, Western Australia, covering the issues of litter production, rates of decomposition and P leaching, subsequent interactions of leachate with soil and microbial biomass, and the mobility of nutrients. The export of P from catchment litter to wetland was estimated using a new "in-lake" method, developed to quantify P transfer through primary (atmospheric and groundwater) and secondary processes (e.g. circulation and sediment-water interactions).

Their runoff waters are collected into two main channels (North and South) and taken to the liquid-effluent treatment plant. After mine closure in December 2007, dump runoff waters are diverted into the open-pit mine to contribute to the filling of the future open pit lake. The chemistry of dump runoff waters changes seasonally in response to hydrological events. Here we present a coupled hydrological and geochemical model to predict daily stream flows and chemical quality. The coupled model accounts for three end-member waters and reproduces most of the chemical data measured at the South channel during 2006. Once calibrated, the model has been tested and verified with data collected during 2007 and not used for calibration.

It is found that the lake water mass features a high concentration Of O-2, the upper 20-m layer being most aerated. It is shown that the year-to-year variability of the concentration of O-2 dissolved in the lake water depends on the amount of organic matter coming with groundwater and surface runoff. The oxygen and phosphorus regimes of the lake at low and abundant entries of puberal red salmon for spawning are considered.

Land cover analysis at a regional scale exploiting low and medium resolution ENVISAT ASAR data:: Application to Poyang Lake area (Jianxi Province, PR China)	IGARSS: 2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM, VOLS 1-12: SENSING AND UNDERSTANDING OUR PLANET	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS				IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 23-27, 2007	Barcelona, SPAIN	IEEE				Located in Jiangxi Province, Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China and constitutes a major hydrological subsystem of the middle Yangtze River (Changjiang) basin in central China. An impressive amount of low to medium resolution ENVISAT data covering the Poyang Lake's 2004 and 2005 hydrologic years were acquired and analysed within the framework of the Flood DRAGON Project. Land cover mapping was realized synergistically using: 1) a land cover map derived from a colour composition containing seasonal ENVISAT ASAR Global Monitoring Mode image sums, and; 2) a land cover map derived from a colour composition containing filtered, seasonal ENVISAT ASAR Wide Swath Mode image sums. Confronted and validated with the hydrodynamic characterization derived from Landsat reference data, these preliminary classifications lead to a land cover map with 13 classes covering 20,000 km2 (170 km from North to South and 120 km from East to West) and was realized at a 1/200 000 scale, but can be used from 1/150 000 to 1/500 000. The results highlight the great potential of ASAR medium and low resolution products for wide-area mapping. Worldwide, large archives of such data already exist which should enable access to the prerequisite amount of data required for such large-scale, land cover characterization.																			2153-6996		978-1-4244-1211-2				2007							3374	+		10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423568	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423568													WOS:000256657303179

The South Pole Acoustic Test Setup (SPATS) will be installed in the Antarctic ice during the polar season 2006/2007 after which the collected data will be used to reveal the acoustic properties of the South Polar ice cap. The developed piezoceramic based ultrasound sensors and transmitters that are part of this system have been extensively studied during calibration measurements in water, using a commercial hydrophone as reference. Also, a SPATS system test was accomplished in Lake Tornetrisk, Abisko (Sweden). This allowed verification of the DAQ system, transmitter range and sensor performance. Here the results of the calibrations and the Abisko lake measurements are reported.

The yield environmental index was 3.7, 2.5 and 1.7 t ha(-1) in Delta, MVZ and GLZ, respectively. GC8-35 showed good response with 4.5 and 3.9 t ha(-1) in the Delta and MVZ, respectively. The variety was very sensitive to unfavourable environment with yield decreasing to 1.62 t ha(-1) in GLZ, as indicated by the coefficient of regression of 1.4190 (> 1) and the negative constant of interception. With the highest general average of 3.3 t ha-1, GC8-35 variety showed exceptional capacities to exploit their production potential, as shown by the deviation of +21.6 and +56% in Delta and MVZ, respectively. This variety (GC8-35) had a specific adaptation to favourable environments. Fleur 11 showed a good performance with 4.2 and 2.6 t ha(-1) in Delta and MVZ, respectively. It had exceptional capacities to exploit the favourable environments. It showed a deviation of +23.5, +4 and +13.5 % in GLZ, MVZ and Delta zones, respectively. These results reinforced by the coefficient of regression very close to unit confirm the good plasticity of Fleur 11 (broad adaptation capacity). Hative de Sefa gave moderate yield of 3.6 and 2.0 t ha(-1) in the Delta and MVZ, respectively, with however the best response in unfavourable zone (2.4 t ha(-1)). This variety, weakly exploited favourable environments with deviations of -20 and -2.7 % in MVZ and DELTA zones, respectively. It showed specific adaptation to unfavourable environments. The variety 78-936 gave also moderate yield of 3.4 and 2.9 t ha-1 in the Delta and MVZ, respectively, with however a particularly high sensitivity to unfavourable environment, its yield decreasing to 0.4 t ha(-1). This variety showed negative deviation in all sites. The variety 55-437 yielded more than 3 t ha(-1) in the Delta and MVZ, whereas 73-33 reached 3 t ha(-1) only in the Delta. With a negative or zero deviation in the Delta and MVZ, these varieties showed a weak specific adaptation to unfavourable environments, in which they achieved +5.8 % deviation.

GLUCOS, the Great Lakes Urban Coastal Observing System, is a buoy-based sensor network that will support research on the interactions between Milwaukee Harbor and the lake, and other processes in coastal Lake Michigan. The initial system configuration will consist of two large (Endurance) buoys designed to be deployed in fixed positions to gather long (up to 1 year) time series of data, and five smaller (Pioneer) buoys designed for rapid deployment over shorter periods of time (up to 2 months). The more transportable Pioneer buoys can be easily deployed in different array geometries to support changing scientific requirements in a single field season. The Pioneer buoy components of GLUCOS have been built and field tested, both individually and as a multi-buoy array in Lake Michigan near Milwaukee Harbor. The current design of the Pioneer buoys and the results of the Pioneer field tests are the subjects of this paper.

An improved cell based model to predict the spread and growth of Caulerpa taxifolia in southern Australian waters	MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY					International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07)	DEC 10-13, 2007	Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND	Lincoln Univ, HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ), Univ Canterbury, SGI, Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Hoare Res Software Ltd, IMACS, IEMSS, Environm Modelling & Software, IBM				This study explores increased complexity in cell models using a simplified, one dimensional interaction model as the foundation. Increased complexity leads to multiple dimensions and parameters. In turn this creates issues relating to integration. The questions what to include? and how to include? cell based interactions for an improved model become the focus of this study. In exploration of this, we further develop a grid cell based model of the spread and growth of the green alga Caulerpa taxifolia (Vahl) C. Agardh for Australian waters by adding new levels of complexity relating to cell interaction. C. taxifolia is a marine, green, seaweed that is prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical waters throughout the world. However, invasive strains of the seaweed have been found in southern waters in Australia and they appear to be having some impacts on some native marine species. C. taxifolia is very difficult to contain and spreads at rapid rates. The main aim of the study is to model the spread of C. taxifolia, by taking into account biological and environmental factors of growth and in doing so predict the likely direction of spread in an estuary or lake. Foundation models have been developed based upon the discrete form of the diffusion equation but which relied only on the current biomass. These models only considered average growth and spread and ignored environmental factors influencing the advancement of the seaweed in the waterway. This study implements ways to improve the predictive capabilities of models by including spatial and temporal aspects of growth and spread and by including C. taxifolia responses to seasonal weather patterns and temperature and nutrient changes. In addition, the spread of the plant due to the bathymetric and biological factors are considered. The new dimensions of cell interaction, particularly the inclusion of the growth function, which varies seasonally, produced results that better reflected the observed data. Also, incorporation of vegetation distribution in the lake, used to indicate nutrient rich areas where C. taxifolia might thrive, wind direction and speed information and depth limitations have allowed for a significant improvement in the cell models predictive capabilities. In the case of seasonal fluctuations, variations outside the carrying capacity of cells created new problems with interpreting and comparing simulated results with the observed data. The model was validated using the real growth data for several estuarine lagoons in New South Wales, Australia. We test the model on two waterways, Lake Conjola (including Berringer Lake) and Narrawallee Inlet, both of which are located in New South Wales, Australia. Accurately representing the spread and growth using available information becomes particularly important in these waterways where locating outbreaks for eradication requires a large amount of resources. It is hoped that identifying the direction and distance of the spread will lower both the logistical and the financial aspects of eradication.

Its concentration varies seriously with different season. The chlorophyll-a concentration inversing models in different season were studied using different temporal TM images. The models were built in 3 steps: Firstly, 10 images were selected according to the principle of almost synchronously with in situ measurement; secondly, remote sensing images were preprocessed. Atmospheric corrections were carried out use 6S model, and then, the images were geometric corrected; lastly, the optimum models for chlorophyll-a concentration inversing were discussed for multi-temporal TM images. The water quality parameters were measured on 21 sample points in Tat Lake, China monthly as the monitoring network. The chlorophyll-a concentration inversing models were built using semi-empirical approach by the integrated use of multi-temporal remote sensing data and in situ data. The spectrum character of chlorophyll was analyzed following other's studying. Then the different composed bands and component modes such as TM4/TA43, (TM4-TA43)1(TM4+TM3), TM3*TM4/ln(TM1), etc. were discussed for building the regression models. The inversing accuracy was evaluated by relatively error. The optimum models were selected for each month by comparing the different models. It could be concluded that: The mode of multi-temporal equations might be the same or similar for different month. But the coefficients were quite different; the reflectance of TM3 and TM2 band were the most often used parameter for model building; the estimated accuracy increased with raising chlorophyll-a concentration. For example, when the chlorophyll-a concentration was lower than 0.009mg/l, the estimated value was not so accuracy. But when the chlorophyll-a concentration raised to 0.05mg/l the relatively errors for all samples were less than 30%.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-6349-4				2007	6279		1-3						62795H	10.1117/12.725430	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.725430													WOS:000245033602018

Its surface is approx. 15,0 ha. The volume of the lake is 170 000 m(3), and the maximum depth is approx. 2,4 m. Total chatchment area is approx. 16 km(2), however direct catchment area is only 0,8 km(2). The grounds of total catchment area are agricultural terrains, meliorated and dewatered by filed ditches. This zone this is transformed in the result of the human activities in the visible way and for economic reasons, numerous industrial institutions are located here. The lake is considered to be a flow through reservoir. In the limits of city buildings of water contributing catchment superficially are intercepted by city's sewage system. Wastewater from Gniezno Tanning Plant for many years hase been discharged to the lake. The present condition of the lake may be considered as hypertrophy, and some zones have the polysaprobic character (Janczak, 1995). Polymiktic Jelonek Lake, mixes many times within a year, and its small volume inflicts that it is subjected to environmental stresses. Point contaminants as well as area caused processes of very quick eutrophication. This process may be seen by huge quantity of algae blooming. The investigations of the dissolved oxygen content in the water of Jelonek Lake in Gniezno are presented in the paper. The recognition of oxygenic situation and the changes of the dissolved oxygen content in water of the lake in the cycle of vegetative season and day cycles as well as spatial distribution in the superficial layer was the aim of investigations. Determined oxygen content was from 4.1 to 14.8 mg/l at comparatively small day and seasonal changeability and spatial differentiation. Gained average values of oxygen content in sampling points (10.1 to 12.1 mg/l) good oxygenic situation good of the lake classing the water to first the class of the quality of superficial water (above 7 mg/l according to old but without alternative regulations). However it is not possible to justify: is it the result of natural processes, or is it, in some degree, result of recultivation activities - water aeration.

Particulate metal concentrations are higher, comparable to those reported for other moderately polluted water bodies world-wide. Particulate metal concentrations during the dry (drought) season are the same those in the wet (flood) season. The assessment resulted in geo-accumulation indices that show that the contamination of particulate metals follows the order: Cd > Hg > Pb > Zn > As > Mn > Cu > Ni in the dry season, and Cd > Zn > Hg > Pb > Mn > As > Cu > Ni in the wet season. In both seasons, cadmium (Cd) contamination is the worst in lower reaches of the Xiang River.																					978-0-415-45136-9				2007							1503	1506																WOS:000252215500316

The relationship between blood parameters and spermatological properties in rainbow trouts	INDIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL												This study was made to determine both blood parameters and spermatological properties and their relationship in Rainbow trouts. Materials and Methods This study was conducted in 2004, with young rainbow trouts raised on floating cages on the Ataturk Dam Lake at the Department of Fisheries of Harran University Bozova High School. Male rainbow trout (n=10) was used for the study. Their size ranged from 208.3 to 452.5gr in body weight and between 25.0 and 32.0 cm in total length. Physico chemical parameters of Ataturk Dam Lake on sampling dates were found out. Fishes were fed with moistpellets contained 45.85% proteins. Food was provided twice in a day at a daily feeding rate of about 1% of the fish biomass (based on the weight of crude ingredients without water). Blood and sperm samples were taken towards to the end of spawning season (20 and 27 March 2004). Thoma Microscope Slide was used for determination of RBC and WBC and found cell count per mm of blood. Total Hb was determined using Cyanothaemoglobin and PCV was determined using Micro-haematocrit. Erythrocyte indices MCV, MCH and MCHC were calculated. Sperm samples (milt) were taken from the fish by applying gentle manual pressure to the abdomen with out any anaesthesia. After collection, sperm samples were transported to the laboratory under cold conditions (7-10 degrees C). Milt volume was determined by the measuring pipette and expressed as ml. Motility was asset-sed by a procedure similar to that of Tekin et al., (2003) and expressed as a per cent of motile spermatozoa. One drop milt (0.5 mu l), was placed close to another drop (10 mu l) of activator (0.03% NaCl) on a slide placed under a microscope (x 400). Then, the two drops were mixed and the forward motility of spermatozoa was observed at 7 degrees C. The duration of forward motility was timed by chronometer from the initial contact between the solution and milt until forward motility of at least 5% of the spermatozoa in the field of view and expressed as seconds. Spermatozoa concentration was determined using haemocytometer and expressed as number of spermatozoa x 109 ml. Sperm pH were determined with a pH indicator strips (pH.: 0-14; Merck, Germany). Minitab 9.1 was used analysis. In addition, descriptive static and correlation analysis was used to compare spermatoiogical properties and blood parameters. Results and Discussion Mean blood parameters are shown in Table 1. The mean Haematocrit was 51.50% and was similar to the rate of 43.75% reported by Aydin et al., (1995) in O. mykiss. The mean Hb was 5.72 g/100 ml., Mean Hb was found to be 6.86 g/100 ml in O. mykiss (Atamanalp and Yanik, 2003), mean RBC Count was higher to results reported by Atamanalp and Yanik (loc. cit). Many factors like blood sampling and fish activity may be,the cause for variations. Mean MCV (552.50 mu(3)) and MCH (48.0 mu g) values of the study were found lower than those determined in a previous study. (Atamanalp and Yanik loc. cit). MCHC and WBC values were 18.91% and 6.77 10(4)/mm(3), respectively and these values were slightly higher than the values reported in O. mykiss by Atamanalp and Yanik (loc. cit). The mean milt volume of.1.6ml was lower than the value reported by Tekin et al., (2003). Low milt volume could be due to sampling period. The mean spermatozoa motility was 74.50.% (Table 1). This observation were in agreement with range of 70-90% were in other studies (Buyukhatipgolu and Holtz, 1984; Tekin et al., loc. cit). In this study, motility duration was found to be 93.80 +/- 58.64 seconds. It was similar to the mean of 94 seconds reported by Tekin et al., (loc. cit). The mean sperm pH (7.96) was higher than that reported by Tekin et al (loc. cit) This situation may be due to mixing of urine with the sperm. It was determined that significant positive relation exists among the spermatozoa and Hb, MCHC and WBC levels (P < 0.05; Table - 2). Consequently a negative correlation was found between spermatozoa motility and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Sperm pH showed a positive correlation with Hb, MCHC and WBC. Spermatozoa concentration and MCH has a significant positive correlation.					; Şahinöz, Erdinç/ABF-2239-2020; Dogu, Zafer/ABF-1991-2020; ARAL, FARUK/JYO-5760-2024; aral, faruk/AAX-6022-2021	Dogu, Zafer/0000-0002-5428-8340; ARAL, FARUK/0000-0003-2297-6509; SAHINOZ, ERDINC/0000-0003-0646-6939; 													0019-6479	0974-9365				DEC	2006	83	12					1268	1270																WOS:000244216800008
J	Çelik, K; Schindler, J				Celik, Kemal; Schindler, James			The vertical distribution of phytoplankton assemblages of Lake James, North Carolina in relation to mixing depth and nitrate and phosphate concentrations	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Phytoplankton, nitrate (NO3-) (mg L(.)1), and phosphate (Po-4-(3-)) (mg V) concentrations were studied in Lake James, NC, during 1997 and 1998. Depths of 2.0, 10, and 30 m were chosen for sampling to determine the vertical distribution of phytoplankton. At 2.0 and 10 m, the species diversity of Heterokontophyta was mainly represented by Mallomonas caudata (Ivanov); Chlorophyta by Chlamydomonas polypyrenoideum (Prescott); Bacillariophyta by Melosira granulata (Ehrenberg) Ralfs and Asterionella formosa (Hassall), respectively. At 30 m, the species diversity of Cryptophyta was mainly represented by Rhodomans minuta (Skuja); Bacillariophyta by Cyclotella glomerata (Bachmann), Synedra ulna (Nitzsch) Ehrenberg, and Tabellaria fenestrata (Lyngbye) Kutzing; and Cyanophyta by Chroococcus limeticus (Lemmermann) and Oscillatoria limnetica (Lemmermann). The purpose of this study was to determine the vertical distribution of phytoplankton in relation to nitrate and phosphate concentrations and the mixing depth in the water column of Lake James, North Carolina, USA.

The model is verified by using data from natural water pond on Chengdu from one year. It is effectively model opened loops located on bottom. Maximum cooling capacity of lake is predicted in case that outlet water is delivered from the bottom and water enters in such a way that temperature of ambient water most closely matches the inlet water temperature. The model is a valuable tool for determining the cooling capacity and performance of lake and pond source cooling system.					xiang, fxiang/KHC-4997-2024														1005-9784	1993-0666				JUN	2006	13			1			97	101																WOS:000239607300025

The influence of weather and solar elevation on perceived colour of Blue Lake, Mount Gambier, South Australia.	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA												Previous studies of the remarkable seasonal colour changes of Blue Lake, Mount Gambier, South Australia have speculated on the roles of weather and solar elevation in this phenomenon. In this study the influence of weather and solar elevation on apparent colour is examined. Solar elevation and some weather variables were found to have a statistically significant influence, particularly when Blue Lake is undergoing transition from its blue to grey stage. However, the proportion of the overall variation in colour explained by solar elevation and weather was only 16%, so it is concluded that in-lake properties are probably the main determinants of colour.

ECOLOGICAL UNBALANCE OF ROMANIAN COAST INLAND WATERS. CAUSES AND EFFECTS	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												The natural and anthropogenic, both continental and marine pressure, due to the geographical position and anthropogenic impact, like hydrotechnical works (road, railway, building works and consolidation, freshening) industrial pollution (chemical agents, detergents, pesticides), waste water products and deposits; agricultural (crops fertilising, private vegetable gardens, zootechnique activities), tourism, (recreation, sailing, nautical sports, seasonal bathing areas), use of therapeutical sludge, overexploitation of natural resources (mainly fish production) have had a big influence on the present ecological statement of the inland water at the Romanian Black sea coast. Adding to these causes, the wrong applying or the lack of environment legislation control it is easy to explain the human impact consequences in the area of coastal inland waters. Samples of water and sediments have been collected from natural lakes net belonging to the Danube delta, central and southern coastal zone (Tasaul, Corbu, Siutghiol, Tabacarie, Agigea, Techirghiol, Costinesti, Tatlageac, Limanu, Mangalia), a swamp Herghelia, and a lagoon Sinoe. The stations were settled on important anthropogenic impact points or on connection places between border areas of interest, as well as between important areas from the point of view of the system, sources, objectives, breaks through important points. The results obtained in Tasaul, Siutghiol, Techirghiol lakes and Sinoe lagoon can be compared with the former years hydrochemical and hydrobiological analyses. The other inland waters have been assessed after more than 15 years of research gaps. Results obtained assessing the ecological statement of coastal inland waters, realised under the NIMRD 'G. Antipa' Constantza and NIMR 'Danube Delta' Tulcea coordination, stress the necessity to take urgent measures of rehabilitation for water) quality and natural resources of coastal inland areas with a huge social and economical importance. Solutions proposed for ecological recovery, according to the European legislation concerning the environment protection, conservation and use, have as the target sustainable development in the coastal zone and human health maintaining improvement.

Hydrogeochemistry of a wetland area of southwestern Sicily (Italy)	E-WATER												The "Preola" and "Gorghi tondi" lakes are the most noticeable wetlands in the Mazara del Vallo territory (south-west Sicily). There are four karst origin lakes located in a natural depression formed by gypsum dissolution and subsequent collapse of the "Calcarenite di Marsala", a few meters above sea level. Erosion of the depression sides and human activity has caused visible colluvial deposits, which have contributed to a natural filling process of the lakes. A hydrogeological map of the area and the reconstruction of a water circulation model supplying the lakes have been drafted from geochemical and hydrogeological data. It is apparent from delta O-18 values that the well waters are mainly fed by local meteoric water circulating within the calcarenitic aquifer. However, the lake waters chemical composition are very likely controlled by evaporation processes and a complex mixing between seawater and groundwater, depending on seasonal variation in the hydrodynamic equilibrium.																			1994-8549						2006		4																						WOS:000422338900001

Hydrological and Nutrient Budget Modelling of Surface Water of the Achankovil River, Western Ghats, India	ASIAN JOURNAL OF WATER ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION												An attempt has been made to develop a hydrologic and nutrient budget for Achankovil river watershed (area 1484 km(2)) in Western Ghats of India. The work was carried out in the year 2002 during three seasons i.e. pre-monsoon (February), monsoon (June/July) and post-monsoon (October). The water budget was determined using the formulae dm/dt = Sigma input - Sigma outputs + Sigma (sources sinks) The inflow (precipitation, tributary and Achankovil river baseflow) and out-flow (evapo-transpiration and discharge from tributaries and Achankovil river) segments were measured following the standard procedure for three seasons. The result indicates that significant amount of water leaving (60.35 x 10(8) m(3)) the watershed to the adjoining Vembanad lake and ultimately into the ocean, which exceeds the water, entering (54.83 x 10(8) m3) the basin. The outgoing water (congruent to 9%) surplus may be due to overestimation of transpiration and the lack of estimation of the water input from the intermittent streams in the present study. Nitrogen and phosphorus balances are also calculated by LOICZ-CABARET budget model. 20,976.86 x 10(6) m mol/yr and 19,655.1 x 10(6) m mol/yr of nitrogen and phosphorus were lost or utilized within the Achankovil river basin during the study period. More detailed study on short term and variation will certainly help us in dealing with the various sources and the contribution by main stream as well as intermittent streams.

China. This study consists of one of the first assessment of low resolution ASAR data, ENVISAT low rate mode, for land applications. Sixteen ASAR GMM images, which give a good overview of an on going situation over very large area with a high temporal revisit, was analysed, and GMM's potential for flood risk management has been assessed. A new processing chain was created including preprocessing steps (calibration, import and geo-referencing), radiometric enhancement and water bodies extraction. GMM analysis allowed the distinguishing over the very sensitive Poyang lake ecosystem, three major land cover types: permanent water bodies between February 2004 and April 2005, areas of seasonal water level variations, and wet lowlands mostly consisting of marshes. These are in very good concordance with results obtained from reference optical high resolution data. Water body extraction was performed on ASAR GMM images and a map of the annual dynamic of the Poyang Lake was elaborated. In the near future, more GMM data will be integrated within the database in order to improve the revisit frequency at critical period. Hence these first results will be compared with optical (MERIS) and radar (Envisat Wide Swath mode and Precision mode) data and, in parallel with hydrological and meteorological data over the Poyang Lake area and Changjiang catchment.																			0379-6566		92-9092-922-7				2006	611						227	+																WOS:000238285000028

J	[Anonymous]				[Anonymous]			Les '4 saisons'	BALLETTANZ												The French people said "Non" and the German parliament said "Ja" - European unity may be in jeopardy but at the Montpellier Danse Festival recently the potential for agreement was convincingly demonstrated by (honorary) Frenchman Angelin Preljocaj and Raimund Hoghe of Germany. The former's "Les 4 saisons..." and the latter's "Swan Lake, Four Acts" both take up classic works that already mean so much to so many. While Hoghe's piece is a requiem, resonant with the tragedy of history, Preljocaj's work, based on Vivaldi's "Four Seasons," is a cheerful flight into fantasy, rejoicing in harmony and beauty, baroque flamboyance and carefreeness. Hoghe stages collective guilt and the struggle for normality and acceptance. With his cry for love he remains an angel to French audiences, his hunchback symbolising folded rather than broken wings. Preliocaj, the emigre from Albania whose work is so often characteristically violent, here stages French-style guilt-free freedom with perfect angels. While the French piece cheerfully suggests we try happiness, the German work emphasises our right to mourn, to ceremony and gentleness. The similarities are there in the parallels: in its deliberate symmetry, "Swan Lake" expresses an implicit connection with baroque joie de vivre, and the light touch of "Les 4 saisons..." is the fruit of violent struggle.																			0947-0484					AUG-SEP	2005		8-9					8	11																WOS:000231173900002

The concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cu, Mn, As, Ni, Co, V, Mo, Sc, Ni, Bi, Sb, Cr, W, Fe, S, and Al were determined by ICP-AES in the less than 100 pm grain-size fraction. Markedly elevated concentrations (milligrams per kilogram) of some of the metals, Pb (21867), Zn (18635), As (1757), Cd (139), and Cu (632) were recorded. Enrichment factors (EF) of studied elements were determined in the downstream, mine-affected, and non-mine drainage section of the river against average shale and average upper continental crustal (AUCC) abundance. Some elements notably Pb, Cd, Zn, S, Sb, Bi and As show very high EF (e. g. 541 for Pb) in the mine-affected section of the river as compared to the AUCC abundance. These are presumably associated with sulfide minerals such as galena, arsenopyrite, sphalerite, and bismuth found in abundance in the mine-debris piles of Balya Mine. However, high levels of Pb (avg. 1515 mg/kg) are also observed in the non-mine debris drainage section of the river, which shows an EF 124 as compared to AUCC. The result indicates the contribution of metal sulfide bearing lithologic units and element migration via wind from the mine-debris piles. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out to examine patterns and similarities between concentrations of studied elements. The first component with a high percentage of variance value (51.1 %) explains the dispersion of positively correlated Pb-Zn-Cu-As-Sb-Cd-Mn-S and their association with the mineralogical composition of the mine-debris piles. The second component represents the Ni-Co-Cr association with a low percentage variance (17.2 %) value indicating the contribution of ultrabasic rock units in the downstream section of the river.					; Budakoglu, Murat/ABB-3058-2020	Budakoglu, Murat/0000-0003-1533-2457; 													0077-7757					JAN	2005	181	1					39	51		10.1127/0077-7757/2005/0181-0009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0077-7757/2005/0181-0009													WOS:000226937000005

Process-based Simulation Library SALMO-OO for Lake Ecosystems	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING					International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA					Over the past three decades numerous lake ecosystem models incorporating algal population dynamics have been developed and published. However, most of these models have been constructed, calibrated and validated ad hoc to suit one specific lake application. Even though many models, including SALMO (Recknagel and Benndorf, 1982), were designed and validated as being generic for a range of lake properties they were always rigid in their process equations and parameter values. This paper discusses the concept, implementation and testing of SALMO-OO towards a more generic simulation library for lakes by taking advantage of object-oriented design and Java programming. A library of four process models for phytoplankton growth have been implemented in SALMO-OO, with one growth model from the library presented here as a case study to demonstrate its increased generality and flexibility for simulations of lakes with different trophic states. The initial focus was on phytoplankton models that were of the form of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The phytoplankton growth models were selected from the literature where different combinations of growth equations and classical growth-limiting functions regarding nutrients, light and water temperature were applied. Those models that displayed a similar model rationale to the original SALMO were implemented in the full object-oriented version of the model (SALMO-OO). Combinations of different growth functions were tested within the simulation library. The validation of SALMO-OO was based on comparisons of calculated and measured algal biomass data of two lakes with meso-and hypereutrophic conditions. The results show that the SALMO-OO model can effectively simulate eutrophic systems very well, and improvements made to parameter values produced significantly improved results, compared to the original SALMO model. The SALMO-OO model does struggle to describe mesotrophic conditions, however the application of a growth model from the simulation library greatly improved this result. Another area of concern with the original model was that the algal functional groups simulated did not fully reflect the typical seasonality observed in eutrophic or mesotrophic systems. Significant improvements were made to the original SALMO model by adopting the more realistic parameter values from the algal growth model of Hongping and Jianyi (2002) whilst retaining the same structure. Experiments with the new parameter values from this growth model improved simulation results of SALMO-OO for the algal groups: blue-green algae, green algae and diatoms. Five parameter values were adopted from Hongping and Jianyi (2002), the most notable were the maximum growth rate (PHOTXMAX), half-saturation constant for P uptake (KP) and the preference factor (PF) values for zooplankton grazing. The original SALMO model was developed as a generic model and the new SALMO-OO model aims to strengthen this attribute. By improving the original model through the simulation library, SALMO-OO gained more flexibility for the simulation of a broad range of lakes with different trophic states, which demonstrates its generality. In addition to the algal growth models, a simulation library for algal grazing is currently being tested. This will further strengthen the flexibility and generality of SALMO-OO. Also a multiple parameter optimisation based on evolutionary algorithms will be integrated in SALMO-OO. This will calibrate parameter values within their range of variance to improve the accuracy of simulation results. It is concluded that the object-oriented implementation of ODE based ecosystem models significantly improves its knowledge base, functionality and accuracy.																					978-0-9758400-2-3				2005							318	324																WOS:000290114100046

The seasonal dynamics of clostridial vegetative cells and spores in sediments with different ecological conditions were revealed. The cell numbers of the dominant BAB species were shown to depend on the redox potential of the sediments, the amount and composition of C-org, and the trophic state of the basin in general. C. pasteurianum was found to predominate in eutrophic lakes and reservoirs (5-11 X 10(6) cellS/Cm-3), C. butyricum and C felsineum predominated in mesotrophic ones (2-11 x 10(6) cellS/Cm-3), and C. acetobutylicum was predominant in acidic chthonioeutrophic lakes and reservoirs (0.1-0.5 x 10(6) cellS/Cm-3). The lowest cell numbers of BAB s were found in river sediments, whereas the highest numbers were recorded in the sediments of polysaprobic zones (0.1-1.0 x 10(3) and 0.5-2.0 x 10(7) cells/Cm-3 respectively).

This monitoring program is a part of a LIFE program in Nestos River Delta. The monitoring program started in August 2003 and still continues on a monthly basis. Samples were taken at two depths, one at the surface and the other at the bottom of the water column, and two points in every lake. The first sampling point for each lake was near the shore and the other at the center of the lake. Physical parameters, such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity and pH, were measured in-situ. Water samples were taken for the determination of nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, orthophosphate, TKN and BOD in the laboratory. Meteorological data were obtained from nearby meteorological stations. The first year of monitoring showed that the concentrations of nitrite, nitrate and ammonium salts were low. On the contrary the concentrations of ortho-phosphate were high and were season-dependent. Furthermore, a modeling effort was undertaken to determine the effect of agricultural practices in the catchments of the lakes on their water quality. The paper describes the monitoring and presents data and results of the study.

Structural damage in urban areas due to reservoir filling	Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, Vols 1-5: GEOTECHNOLOGY IN HARMONY WITH THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT					16th International Conference on Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering	2005	Osaka, JAPAN	Int Soc Soil Mech & Geotech Engn, Japanese Geotech Soc				Reservoir filling operations in hydropower or irrigation projects induce changes in regional flow and groundwater conditions, which may cause geotechnical, hydrogeology and water quality impacts in engineering projects. In special, projects where reservoirs reach important urban areas, rising water table may change soil matric suction and cause soil collapse and structural damage. During design phase, this is a most important issue, for design, construction and owner engineers to evaluate the extension and magnitude of the impacts or damage that will be imposed to buildings, roadways and utilities. This paper presents the methodology that was used in a case history in mideastern Brazil, of a 20,000 people urban area, located at the border of a reservoir lake that will be filled after the rainy season of 2004-2005. The paper presents the geotechnical characterization of the soils in the area of the project and their collapse potential. Also is presented the methodology to estimate structural damage and repair costs for the dam owner, to prepare an action plan for the post filling period. It is estimated that 99% of the buildings will present slight damage and approximately 1% will present moderate damage. To evaluate the average individual construction value, homes were inspected in their construction standards and apparent age, to estimate the order of magnitude of repair costs due to angular distortions that would be caused by soil collapse. Based on preliminary inspections to evaluate home conditions, the relative average repair costs were estimated in the order of 2.4% to 5.0 % of current construction value and total repair costs are expected to reach the range of US$ 300,000 to US$ 600,000.																					978-90-5966-027-4				2005							2801	2804																WOS:000246615103200

Recent government policies caused an increased search for new frontiers for soybean plantations. To assess the impact of those new developments into the Amazon floodplain, since 2002 a project has been carried out in a floodplain lake, Curuai Lake, set near Santarem, Para State. The first step in the project was to use a series of Landsat-TM images to seasonally monitor water exchanges of the Terra Firme Rivers and Amazon River and the floodplain lakes. Based on this study a suitable site was selected to install an automatic monitoring system, which allows for quasi-continuous in situ measurements of a pool of atmospheric and aquatic variables. The collected data is sent through a satellite link to researchers. These data are submitted to a series of analyses and stored in a database. As the program continues, there will be base line information against which environmental impacts can be checked and enforcement undertaken to guarantee a sustainable development for the region.

Use of Recurrent ANN and Hybrid EA for the Prediction of Phytoplankton Abundance and Succession Before and After Eutrophication Control of Two Shallow Lakes	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING					International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA					Eleven years of water quality time-series of the two Dutch lakes Veluwemeer and Wolderwijd were subject to predictive modelling by recurrent supervised artificial neural networks (RNN) and hybrid evolutionary algorithms (HEA). The modeling aimed at forecasting changes of the phytoplankton community in response to the control of external nutrient loadings and fish abundances as consecutively implemented to both lakes since 1979. The water quality time-series of both lakes were structured for the RNN and HEA modeling in order to reflect following three different management periods by both training and validation datasets: no management (1976-1978), lake flushing and waste water treatment (1979 onwards) and lake flushing, waste water treatment and food web manipulation (1991-1993). This approach facilitated a comparative analysis for the two lakes and the three management periods. Firstly recurrent RNN achieved reasonably accurate results for 5-days-ahead forecasting of abundances of blue-green algae Oscillatoria and green algae Scenedesmus in both lakes. Secondly hybrid evolutionary algorithms (HEA) achieved similar good forecasting results but also provided model representations for both algae species in the form of rule sets. HEA has been designed to evolve both the structure of rule sets as well as the parameter values imbedded in the rule sets by means of a genetic algorithms. With regards to the different approaches for eutrophication management the modeling results have shown that only the combination of external nutrient control with food web manipulation has changed the lakes from hypereutrophic to mesotrophic conditions reflected by the change from the dominance of blue-green algae Oscillatoria to the dominance of green algae Scenedesmus. Even though both modeling techniques have forecasted the succession of two functional algal groups represented by Oscillatoria and Scenedesmus only HEA provides rule sets for the explanation of these ecological changes. The results revealed that phosphorus limitation by means of seasonal lake flushing and wastewater treatment in combination with increased zooplankton grazing by food-web manipulation diminished the abundance of the harmful Oscillatoria but enhanced the abundance of harmless Scenedesmus. These findings consent well with literature findings e. g. by Benndorf (1995) that the eutrophic lakes requires primarily efficient nutrient control that secondarily can be finetuned by food-web manipulation.

In order to test models for source-rock deposition and to improve our understanding of critical processes, we have applied a computer model to simulate deposition of organic carbon in Lake Tanganyika that combines a water-body circulation model with an ecosystem model. Lake Tanganyika is deep, highly elongated, and subjected to strong southerly winds along the axis of the lake during the dry season, May through August. Our simulations show that deep-water upwelling in the southern lake results from northward wind-driven surface flow during May through August, which causes nutrient enrichment in surface waters and results in strong phytoplankton blooming. During the wet season, weak upwelling, nutrient enrichment, and phytoplankton blooming in the northern lake result from oscillation of the lake. Our simulations suggest that although surface phytoplankton productivity is higher in the southern lake, flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) to the lake bottom is lower than in northern lake. Because the mixing depth is deeper in the southern lake, more oxygen is supplied to the deep part of the lake, which promotes the decomposition of organic matter. In addition, advection of organic matter to the deeper part of the lake was identified as an important process. Organic-matter flux is relatively insensitive to variation in seasonal wind direction. It is highly sensitive to variation in wind velocity, which affects the strength of lake water circulation, with weaker winds resulting in decreased POC flux to the lake bottom and stronger winds resulting in increased POC flux.

The Mekong - Applications of Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) simulation to the benefits, costs and consequences of water resources development in a large river basin	MODSIM 2005: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING: ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT AND DECISION MAKING					International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM05)	DEC 12-15, 2005	Melbourne, AUSTRALIA					The world's tenth largest river in terms of annual flow volume, the Mekong is comparatively undeveloped in terms of its exploitable water resources, so that its hydrological regime remains largely natural and unregulated. However, this is about to change given the scale of water resources schemes proposed over the next two decades. These include over 23 cubic kilometres of reservoir storage behind a cascade of hydropower dams already under construction on the mainstream in Yunnan, China, and the additional hydropower regulation on major tributary systems that is planned in Laos. There are further proposals to divert substantial volumes of flow from the main stream into the water stressed regions of northeast Thailand, while the potential for irrigation expansion, particularly in Cambodia, is considerable. The wider socio-economic benefits of such development are potentially offset by costs and penalties. Examples of the benefits are accelerated economic growth, an increase in irrigable land and local electricity supplies. As for the costs and penalties, changes to the volume and timing of the flood regime could have significant and negative impacts upon the seasonal refilling of the Great Lake (Tonle Sap) in Cambodia, the fishery of which is reported to support almost half of the economically active population of the country. These changes could be man-induced or the result of climate change. The risks to the sustainability of the fishery are an emerging cause for international concern. Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) was developed as a coherent measure of expected loss given that actual loss exceeds some Value at Risk (VaR) threshold. To date the concept has been primarily used to support quantitative risk assessment for investment decisions and portfolio management, using stochastic financial models to minimise the risk of unacceptable monetary loss. Intriguingly, the models and concepts are potentially adaptable to water resources planning and operational problems. This paper explores the application of CVaR within the context of identifying the risk of macro-economic damage to the fishery resources of Tonle Sap given reduced volumes of flow on the mainstream Mekong during the flood season. Emphasis is placed on simulating the linkages between the seasonally available flows in the Mekong mainstream, Tonle Sap water levels, annual fish catch and its economic value. We present scenarios using real hydrological and fish catch data along with exploratory concepts of contingency fund costs in terms of national and international aid requirements. The objective is to estimate the potential economic loss at a prescribed level of probability and to illustrate how VaR and CVaR may be calculated in this context. We demonstrate the properties of these risk measures through their behaviour under continuous and discontinuous loss distributions. We show that CVaR has advantages over VaR even under a relatively simple modelling approach. In the case where a loss distribution has discontinuities, VaR is potentially a poor measure of risk as it can vary unacceptably with a small increase in probability level. CVaR is stable in these situations. Here we find that when the loss distribution is continuous the CVaR is only marginally higher than the VaR. However, for the more realistic model where the loss distribution is discontinuous, the CVaR is substantially greater. We demonstrate the potential use of these two risk measures on a simple set of models of the Tonle Sap fishery in Cambodia. The sustainability of this fishery is crucial to the country in order to avoid even further dependence on international donor aid. Estimating the financial risk to which the national government and potential aid donors might be exposed given any damage to the fishery is the essence of this exploratory study of VaR and CVaR.

J	Itoh, N				Itoh, N			Sedimentary photosynthetic pigments as indicators of phototrophs in changing aquatic environment of Lake Hamana	BUNSEKI KAGAKU												This thesis focuses on the potential of photosynthetic pigments of phototrophs in lake sediments as a biomarker that indicates the changes in aquatic environments in the past. Using chlorophyll derivatives formed through grazing of algae by zooplankton, and accumulated in sediments as grazing indicators, difference in the accumulation efficiency of each pigment could be attributed to selective grazing by zooplankton and seasonal variations in algal assemblages. The vertical distributions of photosynthetic pigments and Mo in the Pb-210-dated sediment core demonstrated that the anoxic zone has existed in the central basin of Lake Hamana over at least the last similar to250 years, and that the primary production by algae and phototrophic sulfur bacteria and the extent of anoxia have closely related. The construction of training walls in the Imagire-guchi Channel during 1954 similar to 1956 introduced the most dramatic change over a wide extent of Lake Hamana. By comparing the composition of photosynthetic pigments in sediment cores obtained from the central and 4 attached basins of Lake Hamana, it has been found that the exchange of water by seawater intrusion in each enclosed basin has strongly affected the extent of anoxia indicated by the ratio of total bacterial carotenoids to total algal carotenoids in the sediments.

J	Ransom, D; Slack, RD				Ransom, D; Slack, RD			Observations of bird communities in relation to reservoir impoundment	TEXAS JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												This study describes trends in terrestrial avian communities in response to construction of Aquilla Lake in north-central Texas. Reservoir construction and filling resulted in substantial loss of area in each of four major habitat types. Pre-impoundment surveys began in 1979, with follow up post-impoundment surveys in 1984, 1987 and 1992. Mean bird density, species richness and species diversity were highest among all seasons during the pre-impoundment survey, but declined markedly by the first post-impoundment study. Similarity in bird species composition was greatest among the post-impoundment avian communities. Northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis) were the two most common species encountered in all seasons across study phases. Comparisons with data from two adjacent North American Breeding Bird Survey routes suggest that declines among six species may have been related to reservoir construction. Over time, post-impoundment bird communities on Aquilla Lake had fewer bird numbers, had fewer bird species, and were more similar to one another in species composition.																			0040-4403					AUG	2004	56	3					187	196																WOS:000226017500001

This paper focuses on this subject by studying surface water in Jenin Governorate, which is one of the major governorates in the country. Water resources in Jenin Governorate are groundwater, surface water and cisterns. Even though groundwater is the main resource, still surface water can have a substantial contribution to water supply if it is used. Currently this resource is not used neither in Jenin Governorate nor in other parts of Palestine mainly because of the Israeli restrictions. The area is discharged by several surface water bodies flowing either westwards to the Mediterranean Sea or eastwards to the Jordan River and the Dead Sea. The vast majority of the Governorate is discharged westwards. In this paper surface water in Jenin Governorate is discussed. The results reached are preliminary and subject to modifications when more data are available. Many researches and projects are still needed regarding surface water in Palestine, in order to develop this sector theoretically and practically.																					3-540-20771-6				2004							63	73																WOS:000189496600007

Water samples and gauging were carried out every two weeks with additional gauging carried out intensively during storms and storm water samples were collected automatically using automated water samplers. These samples were correlated with two continuous water level data recording stations at two main river inputs feeding the reservoir. Reservoir sedimentation rate was measured using sediment traps collected monthly. Two main river inputs to the reservoir were monitored- the Jarum and Pelarit. The minimum concentrations of sediment at Pelarit were always lower than that at Jarum. However, the sediment concentrations increase immediately once storms occur. The quarrying activity in the Pelarit catchment only contributed its sediment during rainy days. The rainy season's suspended sediment concentration range was 4.8 mg (.) l(-1) - 1,396.8 mg (.) l(-1), while the dry season concentration ranges from 1.2 mg (.) l(-1) to 73.6 mg (.) l(-1). The average sediment concentration in wet season of Jarum river ranged from 102.4 mg (.) l(-1) to 248.8 mg (.) l(-1); while the baseflow concentration range was 6.8 mg (.) l(-1) to 128 mg (.) l(-1). The estimated sediment yield for 2001 was 310.2 t (.) km(-2 .) yr(-1) and 92.3 t (.) km(-2 .) yr(-1) at Pelarit and Jarum, respectively. The trend in sediment discharge is significantly affected by the rainfall and runoff in the catchment area. Pelarit river have a much higher rainfall-runoff compared to Jaruni river. The total amount of runoff at Pelarit was 1,093 mm (62% of rainfall) and only 574 mm (36% of rainfall) at Jarum. The high sediment concentration and sediment load are reflected in the gross sedimentation rate in the reservoir. The gross sedimentation rate varies from 42.3 g (.) m(-2 .) d(-1) in the deepest part of the reservoir, to about 142.5 g (.) m(-2 .) d(-1) and 85.0 g (.) m(-2 .) d(-1) near the inlet of Pelarit and Jarum river, respectively. Sedimentation rate near the river mouth is directly related to the sediment discharge of the river. Sedimentation rate decreases southward, as the distance from the inlet increases towards the outlet.					A.

Declaration draws attention to the importance of water in supporting development and eradicating poverty, the quality of water in Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water in the World, is degrading as a result of poor management of agricultural land-use. The objective of this study was to determine exports of sediments, nitrogen and phosphorus in Kibaale microcatchment. Kibaale river was sampled upstream and downstream intensively at two days interval during the growing seasons for four years. For other remaining periods of the year the river was sampled every two months. The transfer of sediments and nutrients was determined by the use of the AnnAGNPS model. Results show sediments and phosphorus export rates were relatively high on degraded rangelands mixed with annuals, and on woodlands for nitrogen. Perennial mixed with annual crops were second for sediments, and third for phosphorus and nitrogen. Grasslands were ranked fourth in export of sediments, phosphorus and nitrogen. Runoff was generated equally from degraded range mixed with annual crops, perennial mixed with annuals, woodlands and grasslands. But most of the sediments and TP were coming from degraded ranges mixed with annual crops (66.94% of sediments and 65.52% of TP), followed by perennials mixed with annual crops (26.71% of sediments and 25.25% of TP). About 70% of N into Kibaale was equally coming from degraded range, annual and perennial crops. Similarly, grasslands and woodlands yielded equal quantities of TN into the River Kibaale (about 15%). The Forest contributed very little for all parameters.

The amount of some heavy metals deposited onto the surface of lake and especially protected territories of Pribaikalye has been calculated per month and on average per year. A good correlation with the estimates obtained before is observed on the basis of calculation data. The pollution impact on Lake Baikal by heavy metals from separate enterprises and groups of enterprises located in the Baikal Region has been estimated. The results obtained can be used for improvement of ecological situation of the region regulating work regime of enterprises.

We studied seasonal variations of gonadotropin (GtH) content of the plasma and pituitary as well as ovarian development. Plasma GtH titres increase in April in the Pearl River and in May in the Liao River in central China. Annual cycles of plasma GtH levels in both rivers are the same, with a gradual decrease after ovulation with the lowest values observed in September (in the Liao River) or October ( in the Pearl River). Plasma GtH levels increase gradually in the early stages of ovarian development, with the highest values observed during the late stages of development, and with the lowest GtH titres observed during ovarian regression in both rivers. GtH content of the pituitary remained very high through the spawning period, with the highest titres observed in March in the Liao River, and in July in the Pearl River. As with plasma GtH, the lowest concentrations of pituitary GtH were observed during stages when the ovary was regressed. We analyzed the relationships between plasma and pituitary GtH and reproductive conditions, such as gonadosomatic index (GSI), hepatosomatic index (HSI), oocyte diameter (OD) and oocyte weight (OW). The results indicate that annual changes of GtH content of the plasma and pituitary paralleled GSI, OD and OW, but were negatively correlated with HSI in feral female catfish.																			0378-1909					NOV	2003	68	3					283	291																WOS:000186334300009

Three formations were identified representing widely contrasting paleoclimates; they are attributed to the end of the Late-glacial period, the Younger Dryas period of maximum aridity, and the early Holocene period of maximum humidity. A range of methods was used to analyze the sedimentology of these essentially siliciclastic formations, including the quantum model of FOLK (1971). The proportion of eolian deposits could thus be identified and quantified. Six eolian stocks are distinguished by analogy with present-day regional eolian dynamics. They reflect different dynamics (deflation, accumulation by saltation, and suspension deposits from a nearby or remote area). Their co-occurrence or alternatively their absence serve as markers of varying degrees of aridity (seasonal or permanent, local or regional, slight or intense). Whereas paleoclimatic studies are usually based primarily, if not exclusively, either directly (paleolimnology) or indirectly (paleobiology) on the presence of water, we widen and reverse the scale of reference by using aridity to define a climatic situation. Thus, the uninterrupted input of fine dust during the early Holocene period of maximum humidity calls into question the often suggested idea of a "green Sahara".																			0372-8854	1864-1687				SEP	2003	47	3					307	328																WOS:000185890300003

It receives Nile water, brackish lakewater and highly polluted industrial waters. Vertical water samples were collected seasonally from the bay for studying the distribution of total dissolved copper (TDCu), total suspended matter (TSM) and total particulate copper (TPCu). The depth differences of TDCu values were associated with variations in salinities between the water layers. The increase in TDCu content at low salinity in the mixed zone is due to local anthropogenic input from Lake Edku. The stepwise regression model shows that pH was the main factor controlling the TDCu variations, especially at Tabia Sector (TS). Copper was transported mainly to the bay in particulate form, following the considerable input of TSM. During friction of the in-and outflowing water layers with different salinities at the Maadia Sector (MS), a complicated adsorption/desorption behavior of TSM could be expressed as a result of changes in pH, ionic strength and solution composition. The enrichment of TPCu near the outfalls decreased gradually seaward. A significant positive correlation existed between TPCu and TSM in the surface layer of TS.																			1155-4339					MAY	2003	107		2				1165	1168		10.1051/jp4:20030507	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/jp4:20030507													WOS:000183782500105

Two sampling events were conducted, one during high-flow conditions in May, and one during low-flow (baseflow) conditions in September. Field data include water samples, streambed mineral precipitate samples, and streamflow measurements at each station, along the 20-mile reach starting in Peekaboo Gulch and continuing down Lake Creek to its confluence with the Arkansas River. Hydrothermal alteration zones in four of Lake Creek's tributaries - Peekaboo Gulch, Sayres Gulch, East Sayres Gulch, and La Plata Gulch - are sources of metals to the watershed. Mineral precipitation has occurred over much of the watershed in response to changes in the hydrogeochemical environment, for example by dilution and neutralization caused by influxes of clean tributaries. Preliminary data indicate that the precipitates are composed primarily of aluminum and iron oxyhydroxides, but also include concentrations of other trace metals, such as copper, nickel, and zinc, likely as co-precipitated or sorbed phases. The deposition of mineral precipitates occurs during both high and low flow, and is presumed to continue year-round. However, preliminary findings provide some interesting comparisons of hydrogeochemical characteristics between the two flow regimes. Low-flow conditions exhibit lower pH over a longer reach of the watershed than high flow, which translates to increased metals mobility and in turn deposition of mineral precipitates over a shorter reach of the watershed. Under high-flow conditions, dilution and neutralization occur higher in the watershed, causing mineral precipitation to occur farther upstream than during baseflow. Despite the overall improvement in water quality brought by high flow, the chemical loadings of most constituents increase during high flow. Water quality standards for most constituents are exceeded more frequently during low-flow conditions.																					90-5809-593-2				2003							233	241																WOS:000186710100027

This research is relevant to resource managers, from fire to recreation, who are responsible for a multitude of land uses and conditions. A mail questionnaire was used to collect data from three types of homeowners in the Big Bear Lake area of the San Bernardino National Forest, in San Bernardino County, California. Based on a half-day meeting with fire managers from federal and local authorities and a focus group with local residents many of whom were active in Fire Safe councils, we learned about various educational and mitigation programs offered and/or enforced by the appropriate authorities. The Forest Service implemented a fire safety program with special use cabin permittees that enforced defensible space standards, primarily through a periodic home and property inspection. Special use cabin permittees were required to comply or be subjected to fines. Permanent and seasonal homeowners in the area were not targeted with the same fire safety program; although many fire safety and fuel mitigation programs were administered locally. The results of this research shows special use cabin permittees, most of who are seasonal home users, and permanent homeowners who live in the area full-time have high levels of experience with defensible space. These two types of homeowners exhibit strong positive attitudes toward defensible space over mechanical fuel reduction and prescribed burning. However, when asked if defensible space should be implemented in the local area all homeowner types held fairly high levels of approval for this fuel reduction technique.																									2003	317						128	133																WOS:000224411500018

All the major ecophysiological groupings of bacteria were present in both lake sediments. Data were assembled from year-round studies of both lakes, which clearly demonstrated the pronounced seasonality induced by the presence of extensive ice cover. Organic inputs to Heywood Lake sediments were 3x those to Sombre Lake sediments. Aerobic mineralization processes dominated both lake sediment environments and anaerobes mineralised <10% of the sedimenting organic carbon. However the significance of each anaerobic group differed markedly between lakes and this is discussed in the context of lake environment and surrounding catchment.																					90-5782-079-X				2003							37	42																WOS:000183287900005

Greece. Samples were taken in two seasons and the average concentration of the elements was calculated. The accuracy evaluated by comparing total trace metal concentrations with the sum of the five individual fractions, proved to be satisfactory. Based on the results determined at one sampling point in Koronia and two sampling points along the lake Volvi, it seems that the two lakes have not yet been polluted. There were no significant changes in the individual seasonal concentrations of elements in this monitoring period. Cd, Pb, Cu and Cr are associated with the oxidizable, carbonates and residual fractions. Zn and Fe are associated with residual and reducible fractions. The metals that we most easily extracted in the samples analysed in both lakes are Pb, Cr, Cd, Cu and also Mn in the case of Koronia lake.																			1106-5516		960-7475-24-0				2003							208	215																WOS:000239952800028

In this study, a circular water surface sampler (WSS) and a knife-leading edge surrogate surface (KSS) were used to measure directly the sulphate and sulphur dioxide (SO2) dry deposition loads and fluxes. Sampling was carried out on a daily basis during the dry season. The dry deposition velocity of SO2 has been calculated using on-site measured sulphate flux and ambient SO2 concentration data. The average dry deposition flux for sulphate was 57.60 mg/m(2)/day; for particulate sulphate, it was 12.76 mg/m(2)/day; and for SO2 gas, it was 34.27 mg/m(2)/day. The average dry deposition velocity of SO2 calculated from the measured flux and concentration was 0.07 cm/s. Results in this study area reveal that the gas phase deposition contributed significantly more than the particulate phase to the overall deposition of sulphur compound.																			1369-5886		1-85312-982-8				2003	13						255	262																WOS:000189463700026

Termites were maintained in the laboratory for nine months, seven months, four/five months and zero months, respectively, and then examined for survivorship, termite biomass and soldier production after incubation for an additional five weeks at 30degreesC. Within collection periods, there was no association between survivorship and soldier production or between mean dry biomass and soldier production. However, termites maintained for longer periods in the laboratory had significantly greater survivorship, termite dry biomass and soldier production than recently collected termites. It is unclear whether termite age or season of collection influenced these results.																			0361-6525						2003	41	1A					197	202																WOS:000180458700022
J	Faulkner, B; Cleverly, G; Seemendi, S				Faulkner, B; Cleverly, G; Seemendi, S			A water-resources and water-quality management plan for the city of Tallinn, Estonia	JOURNAL OF THE CHARTERED INSTITUTION OF WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												The increasingly common occurrence of eutrophic conditions in shallow lakes and reservoirs, including the presence of potentially toxic blue-green algae, has given rise to water-quality concerns throughout the world. The need to undertake active catchment management to improve raw-water quality is a key component of the new EC Water Framework Directive. This paper describes the investigations which were undertaken in Tallinn (the capital of Estonia, the northernmost of the Baltic States) to develop an integrated approach to catchment and lake management, in order to improve the quality of the surface-water resource which provides 90% of the total drinking-water needs of the city. Several tools, including 'geographical information systems' and spreadsheet-based financial and water-resources models, were developed to investigate the source of the water-quality problems. Practical solutions comprising an innovative and cost-effective catchment-management approach to overcome the seasonal raw-water quality issues, whilst also reducing treatment plant operating costs, are described. Some of the recommendations have been tested by Tallinn Water following the investigations, and some improvements in raw and treated water quality have been attained.																			0951-7359					AUG	2002	16	3					207	213																WOS:000177904600009

The first three principal components (PC) explained 73.5% of the variation. Minimum and average air temperature, wind speed, sulfates and hardness had greatest weights on the first PC, which explained 35.9% of the data variation. Rainfall, nitrates, TN/P-PO4 ratio and conductivity contrasted with chlorophyll b, maximum air temperature, and nitrite and explained 19.8% of the data variation. Cloudiness, water temperature, CO2 and pH contrasted with light and chlorophyll a and had greatest weights on the third PC, which explained 17.8% of the data variation. A biplot of PC1 vs PC2 showed a meteorological gradient that, together with a chemical gradient in the water, grouped the samples into cold-dry and warm-rainy seasons. Also, a secondary gradient of nitrate and ions, contrasting with maximum air temperature and nitrite, was defined. Finally, a third gradient of cloudiness, water temperature, CO2 and pH, contrasted with percent light attenuation and chlorophyll a, suggested a significant time lag between physical inputs and biological outputs, Canonical correlation between variables pointed out the preponderant effect of climate on the physicochemical features.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				MAR	2002	17	1					75	83		10.1080/02705060.2002.9663870	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2002.9663870													WOS:000173783200009

The adult beetles invade the rice nurseries and the first direct-seeded fields at the beginning of the rainy season; they have a gregarious behaviour and their feeding activity, together with the mines bored by the larvae, determines a change of colour from green to pale yellow in the damage areas, which resemble outbreak areas of rice leafhoppers, Oviposition takes place only on young rice plants in the tillering stage. Females emerging after the end of February enter a reproductive diapause and leave the rice fields to 'hibernate'. Temperature summations for the egg, larval, and pupal development, as well as for the preoviposition period have been calculated. There is no yield loss up to a larval density of 0.6 per leaf and this economic injury level is seldom exceeded in the Alaotra lake region. Life tables carried out under field conditions show that chalcid parasitoids are the main mortality factor and are responsible for the collapse of entire outbreak areas. Since the discovery of the rice yellow mottle virus in 1989 in the Alaotra lake region and the disease transmission by chrysomelids, the pest status of D. gestroi has changed and control measures have to be applied. However, to avoid interference with the action of the parasitoids. chemical applications should be limited to rice nurseries.																			0931-2048					FEB	2002	126	1					54	500																WOS:000174256700010

The water level is still so high that there is evident risk of a serious flash flood. There was a need for forecasts of the water level. There were no telemetric hydrological data available. So the only possibility was to use precipitation data from meteorological stations and water level observations. Three different forecasts were developed: a monthly forecast for the rainy season, a monthly forecast for the dry season and a flash flood forecast. It was found that three daily reporting meteorological stations were enough for the flash flood forecast. The flash flood model has been tested using observations during Hurricane Mitch. Correlation coefficients of the water level forecasts in the model and observed water levels were r = 0.99 for the 1-day forecast and r = 0.98 for the 2-day forecast.																			0144-7815		1-901502-66-X				2002		271					307	311																WOS:000176122100047

These flooded areas become large lakes. Such a flood lakes is referred to as a Haor. The largest flood lake (Haor) in Bangladesh is Hakaluki Haor, which extends over as much as 700 km(2). Local People use Hakaluki Haor as grassland, for farms and for conditional paddy fields that fill during the dry season. During the rainy season, Hakaluki Haor acts as a water reservoir and allows transportation via boat or bamboo raft. In the present paper, in order to clarify the hydrological and hydraulic behavior of Hakaluki Haor during the rainy season a numerical inundation model was developed, in which one-dimensional and two-dimensional unsteady flow equations are applied to rivers and the flood plain, respectively. In addition, the behavior of Hakaluki Haor and the possibility of developing this area after simulating the flooding process of 1988 are discussed.																					981-238-090-6				2002							528	533																WOS:000180463100096

Firstly, a time-series TM-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data set was made for the Kamafusa Lake catchment based on 11 Landsat Thematic Mapper images and one image-based atmospheric correction algorithm-COST method. Secondly, the application of this data set in analyses of vegetation cover changes and their influences on stream water quality variation were conducted. The results showed that the concentrations of suspended solids and total nitrogen in stream water were closely correlated with the vegetation cover and depended on different land use coverage during the field surveys from April to October. Thirdly, the concentration-discharge relations (model 1: C=kQ(n)) were summarized through literature reviews, and relationship of constant k or n with vegetation cover changes was analyzed. Finally, an improved model 2: C=k'Q(n) NDVIm was proposed by incorporating the consideration of vegetation cover changes. The results showed that the model 1 is applicable to short-term period, such as storm event and snow-melting period, and the model 2 is applicable to long-term period, such as non-storm period in growth seasons. During the long-term period, the vegetation cover changes should be taken into account when studying the stream water quality variation.

First and foremost, the garden is a place where one can find the wealth of Indonesia's fruit species gathered together in a single location. Among the species are some of the finest varieties collected from the various regions in the archipelago. This unique plant collection constitutes an extremely valuable repository of genetic information relating to the cultivated fruits of Indonesia, thereby conserving the rich natural diversity of the region and safeguarding the nation's botanical heritage. Mekarsari is also a research centre for scientists, farmers, students, extension specialists, and hobbyist, gathering information on new horticulture technology. Research facilities include a laboratory, greenhouses, nurseries, and a library. Researchers at the garden have identified some promising new fruit varieties with improved qualities, either from natural selection or breeding programs. New techniques are being developed in cultivating miniature fruit trees in containers to alter the fruiting season, and eventually produce harvest all-year-round. Newly released superior varieties are being disseminated in the form of seedlings and grafted plants to the farmers and fruit growers. The Fruit Garden is conceived also as a tourist attraction; a place to come with the family to admire the fruit collection and ornamental gardens. Leisure facilities include restaurants, shops, fruit stalls, viewing tower, tour ride around the garden, the opportunity to pick your own fruit and vegetables, a lake and water recreations.																			0567-7572		90-6605-885-4				2002		575					191	197		10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.575.19	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2002.575.19													WOS:000177028100019

Samples were taken from surface water (river, pond, lake, canal and reservoir) and ground water. Ground water was found to be suitable to drinking or irrigation. Quality of surface water varied with sampling locations and water sources. Among surface-water samples, the concentration of NO3--N was highest for water taken from the Turag River (3.6 mg/L) followed by water from the Belai River (2.5 mg/L). The P concentration was also highest for water of the Turag River (0.34 mg/L). Discharge of municipal waste water from houses along the river, in addition to inflow of N fertilizer applied to agricultural fields, was proposed to the contamination of the Turag River. Progress of eutrophication or pollution in small rivers in Gazipur District may cause a serious impact on environment and human health in future. Detailed and comprehensive assessment is strongly requested.						Mochizuki, Toshihiro/0000-0002-7084-6584													0023-6152					OCT	2001	46	1					75	82																WOS:000173062200009

Our studies indicated that Taxodium seedlings directly planted in water less than 1 m deep and Salix spp. cuttings planted in perennial water in wetlands, grew well and could become revegetation agents. Floating planters of Taxodium and Salix spp. also grew well. The storage capacity of a I in high Salix gilgiana tree was 13.4 mg for N and 1.72 mg for P per day in the growing season. Total absorption of Zn by the tree form of T. distichum 3 months after planting was 9.3 mg/100 gdw (dry weight) and that of Cu was 2.3 mg/100 gdw.

J	Shentsis, I; Ben-Zvi, A				Shentsis, I; Ben-Zvi, A			Considering diversity in precipitation variability when updating seasonal flow forecasts	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The Israel Hydrological Service forecasts the flow to Lake Kinneret by use of a hydrometeorological model which relates seasonal flow volumes to predicted annual depths of precipitation at representative stations. Issued forecasts include an array of 10 values assigned with the exceedance probabilities of 5-95%, as well as their average, which is an estimate of the expected value. A naive forecast is issued at the beginning of the precipitation season, and subsequent updating forecasts are issued during the season. Predicted annual depths of precipitation in an updating forecast are composed of the observed depth until the updating date and an array of predicted depths for the subsequent sub-season. No explicit relation was found between corresponding prior and subsequent depths concerning any updating date. But, the distribution of subsequent depths was found related to the category (i.e. low, medium, or high) of the corresponding prior depth. Empirical, parametric and nonparametric tests revealed a number of significant diversities in the distributions of later depths with respect to the corresponding categories of earlier depths. This diversity could result in considerable differences in the forecasted flow volumes, and is particularly important in cases of extreme situations, when management decisions are tied to revisions before the end of the precipitation season.

Over 100 individuals marked with aluminium rings, coloured leg bands and wing-tags were monitored regularly. Nests were sought in suitable habitats and their nest contents examined during the breeding periods. This study sought to determine the breeding strategies of African Snipe and the factors that influence the reproductive success of the species. African Snipes, numbering about 600 birds were found to be resident in the study area and to breed in wet tussock grass. At the onset of the breeding season, adult birds exhibited breeding behaviours, which included, courtship display flights and nest construction. In 1997 aerial displays were observed from March-April while in 1998 these were observed from January-December. Nests were cup-shaped and were placed in clumps of tussock grass whose base was covered with shallow water or mud. Clutches of 3 to 4 eggs were laid in each nest and these hatched after 16 to 22 days in 1997 and 18 to 20 days in 1998. The duration of the breeding season was 122 and 208 days respectively.																			0030-6525					JUL	2001				15			233	237																WOS:000171793700040

There was marked preference for terrestrial or aquatic foraging by different species, some, such as Cattle Egret, preferring terrestrial habitat whereas others preferred semi or fully aquatic habitats. Eight microhabitats were identified along the shores, two of which were created only during the wet season. Of the eleven species for which there are adequate data eight used more than half of the microhabitats at some point. Most species showed low microhabitat niche breadth values (ranging from 0.018 to 0.641 in the wet season and 0.042 to 0.536 in the dry season) indicating that they had a degree of specialisation. However, niche overlap values revealed that spatial resources are shared by most species. This might be the result of the limiting nature of the lakeshore habitat in the study area, in terms of available foraging space.																			0030-6525					JUL	2001				15			136	140																WOS:000171793700025

J	De Boer, DH; Archibold, OW				De Boer, DH; Archibold, OW			Slumping activity and forest vegetation along the northeastern shore of Waskesiu Lake, Prince Albert National Park, Saskatchewan	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Changes in forest cover along the shore of Waskesiu Lake, Saskatchewan, can be related to slumping. This study evaluates the impact of slumping along the lakeshore on the structure of the vegetation. The oldest trees in the undisturbed forest were approximately 100 years old, whereas the trees which had established on recent scars were typically less than 10 years old. Tree rings were used to determine the ages of the reaction wood in bent trees that had survived the disturbances; this indicated that recent slumping events occurred in 1973, 1979, and 1984. These years either received higher than normal precipitation or had above normal lake levels. Recent slope disturbances were characteristically colonized by a sparse cover of herbaceous plants and tree seedlings which contrasted with the adjacent slopes which supported a mixed forest cover dominated by White Spruce, Balsam Fir, and Paper Birch. Herbaceous ground cover on the slumps was composed of 35 herb and grass species compared to 14 species on the intervening slopes. Similarly. the shrub cover was more diverse on the slumps (9 species) than on the adjacent slopes (4 species). The greatest density of herbs and grasses occurred near the base of the slumps, where soil moisture conditions were more suitable for plant growth. Slumping is most likely caused by subsurface seepage, with annual fluctuations in lake level and seasonal wave activity possibly contributing to the process. As well as causing higher lake levels, wet years can also promote slope instability by increasing the water content of the surficial materials. However. there is no simple relationship between precipitation. temperature, lake level and the occurrence of slumping.						de Boer, Dirk/0000-0002-7674-1417													0008-3550					JAN-MAR	2001	115	1					106	114																WOS:000170068800014

Fieldwork was carried out during two separate field campaigns in 1998-99, timed to correspond with the wet and dry seasons of the region. Measurements included: current velocities; conductivity and temperature time-series at fixed depths; fine- and micro-scale conductivity and temperature profiles; wind speed and direction; and water level. The field data collected during the field program confirmed the following hydrodynamic features: (a) a predominantly semi-diurnal tide throughout Maracaibo Strait and Tablazo Bay with an anti-node in Tablazo Bay, (b) a tidally modulated saline under-flow extending well into Maracaibo Strait, and (c) a dome-shaped, saline hypolimnion and a large-scale anti-clockwise circulation in Lake Maracaibo. The data also indicated a possible internal hydraulic control near Zapara Mouth. The field program did not observe any saline underflow south of the strait and into the lake.

For reclamation to proceed, the Kansas Surface Mining Section (SMS) had to comply with the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks (KDWP) regulations to protect the Gray bat. Critical habitat for the Gray bat is defined by the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks (KDWP) as any area within five miles of the City of Pittsburg, Kansas that includes a tree lined, corridor shaped, body of water with quality suitable to support aquatic insects. The Koehler site contained such a habitat. To accomplish the goals of the SMS, protection of public health and safety from hazards associated with abandoned coal mined lands and to comply with the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) requirements, consultation with KDWP began in the first stages of project planning. After several meetings, field visits, and other consultations, a list of design and construction criteria was agreed upon by both agencies. The criteria included relocating the strip pit lake and planting a woody buffer zone around the lake's shoreline. The lake was designed to maximize fish and insect reproduction. A 100 foot buffer of native trees and shrubs was planted around the shoreline to eventually help protect foraging bats from predators and enhance feeding opportunities. At the end of the fourth growing season, "Anabat" bat detectors were placed at both ends of the strip pit lake. Over 200 bat calls, including the Gray bat, were recorded over a 12 hour period. Interagency cooperation and careful planning resulted in meeting the goals of both agencies which were elimination of a serious public safety hazard and maintenance of critical habitat for the gray bat.																					1-885189-07-9				2001							221	226																WOS:000178264200030

However, compatibility with cool-season grasses is unknown. Seven cool-season perennial grasses were seeded into Kura clover in a rotational grazing experiment. The objectives of this study were to evaluate botanical composition, forage yield and quality of binary mixtures of cool-season grass with Kura clover. Field studies were conducted on a Nester (fine sandy loam) soil at Lake City Experiment Station, Lake City, MI. Botanical compositions in the first year of the study heavily favored grasses (avg. 74%) and Kura clover accounted for less than 20%. Crude protein (CP) concentration was negatively related with grass composition (r = -0.69**), however, positively related with Kura clover composition (r = 0.60**). Perennial ryegrass (Loliumperenne L.) was superior in total forage yield and good forage quality, while reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) was the least desirable species.																					85-7133-010-7				2001							104	105																WOS:000184566200043

First, we examine the consistency of measurements by HF ground wave radars with different designs, but operating on the same physical principles. This is done using data from the commercially available SeaSonde (Codar Ocean Systems) and from the Multifrequency Coastal Radar (MCR), which is a research system. Data from the two systems are compared for co-located units at Santa Cruz and Moss Landing CA on Monterey Bay. We conclude that the two systems make current-vector-field measurements that are consistent to an accuracy of better than 10 cm/s and that the data from two such systems can be Integrated to form reliable composite current maps. Second, we present results from an air-sea interaction Investigation using the MCR systems on Monterey Bay during 1997 and 2000. We show that near surface currents are correlated with the wind with correlation coefficients 0.6 and are rotated 35 to 45degrees with respect to the wind in the sense of the Ekman spiral. We also show results of near shore observations on Lake Michigan during the EEGLE campaign of 2000. These measurements show the capability of HF radars to operate over fresh water. During a sediment resuspension event in April 2000 we observed near shore circulation dynamics as a plume traveled around the southern end of Lake Michigan and up the eastern shore encountering southward moving water and reversing the local flow along the shore near St. Joseph MI. The HF radar observations and model results using a Princeton Ocean Model (adapted to Lake Michigan) are in good agreement, telling the same story of near shore dynamics.																					0-933957-28-9				2001							942	948																WOS:000178200800147

These surveys, the general literature, and the findings of a Canada/US park air issues workshop give an overview of the issues facing national parks. Seasonal average temperature and precipitation values generated by four global circulation models under a doubling CO2 scenario were interpolated for each park. 1994-1996 average annual wet sulphate and nitrogen deposition and precipitation pH were interpolated from the national air pollution monitoring system. These data place national parks within the context of continental scale climate change scenarios and national pollution levels. In Canada, the air issues threatening national park ecosystems are, in order of importance, 1) acidification, 2) climate change, 3) toxics, especially persistent organochlorines, 4) UV-B, 5) the interacting and cumulative effects of several air issues, 6) enrichment from airborne nitrates and CO2 increases and 7) ground level ozone. The air issues affecting park visitors are 1) particulate matter. 2) ground level ozone, 3) UV-B, 4) noise from aircraft and traffic, and 5) light from towns obscuring the night sky. Canada's boreal and Arctic national parks are severely threatened by climate change due to the relatively high levels of warming predicted at higher latitudes, coupled with drought prone, fire dependent boreal forests or widespread permafrost in the Arctic and sub-Arctic, and wildlife dependent on particular snow and ice conditions. Despite recent reductions in Canada's sulphate emissions, the national parks in south-eastern Canada remain at risk of acidification due to continued high levels of nitrate emissions from automobiles, and loss of buffering capacity in soils and lakes after decades of acidification.																					0-7923-6918-1				2001	9						97	107																WOS:000169572400011
C	Wilhelm, FM; Schindler, DW		Williams, WD		Wilhelm, FM; Schindler, DW			Gammarus lacustris (Crustacea:Amphipoda) zooplankton predation in a Canadian Rocky Mountain lake	INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY, VOL 27, PT 2, PROCEEDINGS	INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY - PROCEEDINGS				27th Congress of the International-Association-of-Theoretical-and-Applied-Limnology	1998	DUBLIN, IRELAND	Int Assoc Theoret & Appl Limnol				The freshwater amphipod, Gammarus lacustris, is common in lakes and ponds of northern North America, Europe and Siberia where it is important as food for fish and waterfowl. Although G. lacustris is generally considered a herbivorous scavenger, it is known to prey on lake zooplankton in small (100mL and 1-L) experimental chambers (ANDERSON & RAASVELDT 1974, KORTELAINEN 1990). In such a small volume, crowding and altered behaviour of prey or predators may significantly influence predatory interactions and confound conclusions. ANDERSON & RAASVELDT (1974) concluded that G. lacustris could alter the zooplankton community structure of alpine lakes and ponds, similar to other invertebrate predators, such as Chaoborus, Hesperodiaptomus arcticus and Mysis relicta. We examined the consequences of G. lacustris predation on the zooplankton community of Snowflake Lake, a small alpine lake in the Canadian Rockies, in field experiments in which G. lacustris was added to large (2,800-L) in situ enclosures at densities of 40, 200 and 400 ind. m(-2) in the presence of the natural lake zooplankton assemblage. hll treatments were run in triplicate and three enclosures without G. lacustris served as controls. The experiment ran For 35 days scarring on 15 July 1996, approximately 1 week after ice-out. Daphnia middendorffiana was the only cladoceran present in the lake. its density was highest in the control enclosures and decreased significantly with increasing G. lacustris density (RM-ANOVA P < 0.05). Daphnia density in the lake was most similar to densities in the enclosures with low (40 ind. m(-2)) C. lacustris density, although G. lacustris density in the lake corresponded to the medium density treatment. This discrepancy may be due to the greater vertical separation between Daphnia and the vertically migrating G. lacustris in the water column of the lake (11 m), compared to the enclosures (3 m), suggesting that deep water may serve as a pelagic refugium for zooplankton from G. lacustris predation. Hesperodiaptomus arcticus adult density was also highest in the control enclosures and decreased with increasing G, lacustris density However, this trend was not statistically significant because of high variability between replicates. Continuation of the experiment may have led to a clearer resolution of the influence of G. lacustris predation on H. arcticus density, but the experiment was constrained by the open-water season and late-season access to Snowflake Lake. H. arcticus nauplii and copepodite densities declined to near zero in all enclosures over the course of the experiment as would be expected with recruitment to the adult stage. Cyclopoids (mainly Acanthocyclops vernalis) and rotifers (mainly Keratella hiemalis) were eliminated from ail enclosures within 10 and 20 days, respectively. We attribute this decline to direct predation by H. arcticus, which has previously been shown to regulate rotifer abundance and prey on cyclopoids in alpine lakes. The reduced abundance of D. middendorffiana and H. arcticus, both large zooplankters, with increasing G. lacustris density suggests that G, lacustris predation may structure zooplankton communities in similar manner to planktivorous fish. Although all three species are often found together in lakes of the Canadian Rockies, their coexistence may be possible because a pelagic deepwater refugium allows zooplankton to escape G. lacustris predation.

J	Zairi, M; Rouis, MJ; Ismail, A				Zairi, M; Rouis, MJ; Ismail, A			The Ichkeul lake: natural equilibrium and anthropic effects	HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU												In Tunisia, runoff waters mobilisation constitutes a key element for economic activity. Consequently to the recent economic progress and demographic growth, three dams were constructed and three others are projected in the Ichkeul catchment. Ichkeul Lake, located at this zone forms the natural outlet of numerous wadis in the region. With its three international classifications, this lake is found to be faced to a perturbation which may irreversibly affect its biotope equilibrium. The Ichkeul catchment covers a surface of 2080 km(2) of which 90 to 100 km(2) are occupied by the lake. It presents a well developed hydrographic system. The continental waters are yielded to the lake by eight main wadis: Morra, Douimis, Sejnane, Ghezala, Melah, Joumine, Mellah and Metrif. The Tinja wadi ensures the marine water supply from Bizerte Lake during the dry period. In the wet season the flow is reversed and waters circulate from Ichkeul lake to Bizerte Lake. The dams controlled area of the catchment is 833 km(2). It represents 40% of the total catchment surface. The water supply of the three constructed dams is estimated at 250 million m(3) representing approximately 70% of the total lake water supply. The second problem which may affect the lake water quality is related to domestic and industrial waste waters that reach the lake through the numerous wadis or by direct discharge. These waters are containing a lot of organic compounds at high concentrations. The cities neighbouring the lake (Menzel Bourguiba, Tinja and Mateur) have a total of 77,000 inhabitants. The waste water generated from these cities is estimated at 24,000 m(3)/day. These waters are discharged into Bizerte Lake from Menzel Bourguiba city and into Ichkeul Lake from Tinja and Mateur. Up to the end of 1997 no domestic or industrial waste water plant existed in the region.					; Zairi, Moncef/AAF-6082-2020	Moncef, Zairi/0000-0002-3768-1597; 													0018-6368						2001		3-4					112	118		10.1051/lhb/2001046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/lhb/2001046													WOS:000169393800020

Initially we considered twelve stations situated along a transept, then the experimentation was carried out on three stations located at different depths. It's possible to observe a trend, particularly for manganese, to accumulate in the deeper zone of the lake. Most of the elements are present as stable species indicating that the take Martignano is an unpolluted environment; manganese is present overall in mobile form. This high level of mobile manganese depends on redox potential conditions, so MnO2 can be reduced and solubilized. Noticeable seasonal variations are not observed, except for manganese in central zone of the lake. The variations observed for manganese can be attributable to an imperfect correspondence of sampling point rather than a seasonal phenomenon.

J	Demoulin, A; Vliegen, B; Charlier, R				Demoulin, A; Vliegen, B; Charlier, R			Tectonic vs. shallow origin of geodetically inferred ground movements: an NE Ardenne (Belgium) case	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												In order to get a better insight into the temporal pattern of height change variations in a moderately seismic intraplate area, a 1 km long section has been weekly leveled from April, 21, 1997 to January, 12, 1998 in NE Ardenne (Belgium). As this section is located very close to a small reservoir of 25 X 10(6) m(3), it also allowed the influence of lake level variations on the nearby ground motion to be studied. The measured height difference variations show a maximum amplitude of 3.45 mm, with weekly values not exceeding 1 mm. A two-dimensional (2D) finite element modeling confirms that waterload variations in the lake are the primary cause of movement of the section, inducing maximum ground subsidence of about 2 cm and seasonal tilting of 3-4 mu rads within a range of 2-3 km. We also show that a fault passively alters the spatial distribution of the waterload-dependent movements. The removal of this component from the observed ground motion leaves oscillating residual displacements characterized by an amplitude of 1-1.5 mm and a 'period' of about 2 months. We demonstrate that these displacements are independent of rainfall and probably of groundwater fluctuation too. Although most of the residual motions take place on the fault straddled by the leveling section, no credible mechanism can be found to ascribe these motions to a tectonic process.

J	Olago, DO; Odada, EO				Olago, DO; Odada, EO			An inter-basinal comparison of the sedimentology of Late Holocene to recent sediments in the Rift Valley, Lake Turkana, Kenya	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Grain size variations, sediment chemistry and general mineralogical assemblages of sediments in take Turkana reflect provenance. Allogenic sediments in Lake Turkana are mainly supplied by the Omo and Kerio-Turkwel Rivers. Minor inputs are from seasonal streams and strong southeasterly winds. The depth profiles of the grain size distributions in lake sediment cores exhibit enantiomorphism, which is interpreted as being diagnostic both of shifts in the equilibrium energy regime of the transporting media and of the dominant provenance of particular size grades within the specific basins of the lake. The North Sub-basin is dominated by fine-grained sediments, which reflect the texture of the volcanic rocks of the Omo River drainage basin. The Central Sub-basin sediments reflect, as sources, the coarser metamorphic terrane of the Kerio-Turkwel Rivers drainage basin. Kaolinite and fine-grained iron oxides are brought into the lake mainly by the two large fluvial input systems: the Omo River in the North Sub-basin and the Kerio-Turkwel Rivers in the Central Sub-basin. Some fine-grained overflow of this material makes its way into the South Sub-basin. Illite in the North and Central Sub-basins is strongly related to transport of material from near-shore sediments and, in the Central Sub-basin and northern reaches of the South Sub-basin, from the Kerio and Turkwel Rivers input. Smectite and calcite are mainly authigenic, in the South Sub-basin, however, the relatively coarser detrital particles are derived from silt and sand-sized in situ biogenic (calcitic and siliceous) debris and aeolian-transported particles from regions southeast of the lake. The aeolian fraction accounts largely for the ubiquitous and distinct very fine sand size grade, and consists of quartz, feldspar and blue-green amphiboles. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Limited.

Samples were taken with a Core-Sampler (Kajak-type) along two transects from 5 m to the maximum depth of the lake (24 m) in November 1994 and May 1995, and compared to a study from 20 years ago. The crustacean fauna typically consisted of Cladocera, Copepoda, and Ostracoda with benthic, planktonic and diapausing representatives. Density and biomass of crustaceans showed high variation with water depth and season. The average density of crustaceans in the soft sediment reached 105,289 ind. m(-2) with a biomass of 409.9 mg DW m(-2) in November; in May these values were much lower (25,333 ind. m(-2) and 66.1 mgDWm(-2)). Comparisons with an earlier study, when the hypolimnion was anoxic, suggest that changes in distribution patterns, densities, and species composition were due to a change in trophic state. The recovery of the hypolimnion reflected a trend towards oligotrophy. In contrast, the crustacean community in the hypolimnion still indicates eutrophy.

We have measured the concentrations and inventories of Beryllium-7 in 28 soil profiles (the maximum diffusive mass depth of 5 mm corresponding to an in situ depth of 10 mm). The soil profiles are from different watersheds on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau located on the eastern slope of the Himalayas in different seasons during the years of 1994 and 1995. The results showed that Be-7 activities in all of the soil profiles presented an index decrease with soil depth. Its inventories in the soil profiles varied with the seasons. Be-7 concentration profiles were modeled to determine the seasonal accumulation/erosion rates for soil particles. Cs-137, Ra-226, and Ra-228 distributions in the soils, due to their origins and decay characteristics, are much different from 7Be. The results from two other soil profiles indicated that the maximum diffusive depth of Cs-137 was 30 Cm in situ. Cs-137 activities decreased with soil depth and its inventories varied with changes of eroded and accumulated area. The experimental results of geochemical speciation in the soils showed that more than 85% of Be-7, Cs-137, Ra-226, and Ra-228 were bound to organic, Fe-Mn oxy-hydroxide and residual fractions. They can be moved with soil particles and used as tracers for erosion and/or accumulation of soil particles. 7Be geochemical speciation in the soils agreed with its trace for seasonal particle transport. It can be used as a geochemical tracer for seasonal erosion of surface soil. Cs-137 geochemical speciation was suitable for trace of soil particle accumulation as well as sediment dating. Ra-226 and Ra-228 were combined in crystalline skeleton of clay minerals and mainly remain as a residue in the soils and very little was bound to the soluble, exchangeable, carbonate fractions. The differentials of Ra-226/Ra-228 activity ratios in different geochemical speciation in the soils can be used as a parameter to trace accumulation and/or erosion of soil particles.

Eight artificial habitats composed of crushed rock substrate were established in littoral areas of an embayment of 13, E. Jordan Lake, North Carolina, that historically exhibited low abundances of juvenile large-mouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), Response of juvenile largemouth bass to habitats was assessed by night shoreline electrofishing at treatment sites and associated controls on 4 occasions during the growing season in each of 3 years, Significantly more age-0 largemouth bass were collected on the artificial substrates than at control sites during 3 of 4 sampling periods. Densities of age-0 largemouth bass in shoreline areas where habitat was added increased over the course of the study relative to those recorded at long-term monitoring sites. These results demonstrate that juvenile largemouth bass will utilize artificial substrates, and that habitat enhancements of this type may be useful in systems where treatment of adequate amounts of shoreline is feasible.																									2000							46	58																WOS:000175525900006

Wide fluctuation in annual precipitation characterize Israel's climate. The phenomenon of a succession of years of drought is extremely serious since it results in an accumulating water deficit. It is particularly serious if the distribution of precipitation during the rainy season is poor. For this purpose, a thrifty and balanced water economy must be administered But decision-making concerning water potential is in the hands of politicians, who prefer short-term considerations, which impair the ability to build an efficient water economy. While the supply of water in Israel has not increased, and may even decrease as a result of climatic changes and political agreements, the demand for water continues to rise as a result of population growth, accelerated urbanization, improvement in the standard of living, and industrialization. Last year, Israel is experienced the worst recorded drought in decades, which has caused water levels in Lake Kinneret and the country's main underground reservoirs to drop below their respective red-line marks. For the first time, there is an imminent threat to the supply of drinking water. The shortage will also have a severe effect on the ecology of Israel, which has never enjoyed an abundance of moisture, and which faces a long list of pollutants and problems. This drove the Israeli Minister of Agriculture and the Water Commission to take action and to declare 1999 a 'Drought Year'. It is precisely agriculture, which is controlled by the government through water pricing and allocations of water, that will feel the immediate effect. The purpose of this study is to show the connection between uncertainty regarding future water potential in an extreme environment, and government policy in determining allocations of water to the various consumers.																									2000	2000	1					91	96																WOS:000088719600016

The goal was to learn the nannoplankton photosynthetic capacities by means of laboratory experiments where photosynthesis-irradiance (P-l) curves were constructed using an integrated system with a polarographic electrode and light and temperature control. Experimental data were fitted to exponential models. The maximum photosynthesis rates (Pmax) ranged from 0.28 to 3.96 mu mol O-2 mg Chi a(-1) h(-1) in Chapultepec Lake and from 0.07 and 2.99 mu mol O-2 mg Chl a(-1) h(-1) in Xochimilco Lake samples. The highest production in Chapultepec occurred in the rainy season while in Xochimilco it was in the dry season. Saturation irradiance (Ik) varied from 18 to 295 mu Em(-2)s(-1). The highest photosynthesis rates occurred when some Cyanobacteria genera were dominant (Microcystis spp, and Oscillatoria spp. in both lakes and Merismopedia spp. and Anabaenopsis sp. fur Xochimilco Lake). Biomass expressed as chlorophyll a concentration had its maximum valuer; in the rainy season. 220.9 mg m(-3) in Chapultepec and 136.2 mg m(-3) in Xochimilco.

Saimaa (4400 km(2)) was investigated by hydrobiologists from the University of Jyvaskyla in 1980-83 and 1996. A total of 22 species was observed; 19 of these in the stony belt and 17 in the vegetated sites. Common and abundant species in both main habitats were Leptophlebia vespertina and Caenis horaria. Characteristic species of the exposed stony belt were Heptagenia dalecarlica, Centroptilum luteolum and Caenis rivulorum and in the vegetated bays Cloeon spp. and Arthroplea congener. Nymphs of Ephemera vulgata were rare in the stony belt but locally abundant in the sublittoral sites. In the exposed stony sites, the mean density of nymphs ranged in June from 1-19 ind./m(2) and the bathymetric range of stone dwelling species was widest in the clear-water areas (Puruvesi). Ln the shallow sheltered sites of Orivesi and Etela-Saimaa, the mean densities of nymphs exceeded 100 ind./m(2), but in other areas the differences in densities between exposed and sheltered localities were small.																					9985-830-29-6				1999							31	37																WOS:000081720700004

We investigated the response of cultured individuals of this species to an artificial acute stress during the spawning period by measuring levels of cortisol, sex steroid hormones in blood plasma. In addition, physiological changes of the hormone levels were studied in wild individuals caught in the lake at different spawning stages of the natural condition. The acute stress increased cortisol level in males. However, in females, the initial cortisol level in the plasma was higher than that in males and did not changes significantly with the confinement time. In the natural condition, cortisol levels were higher in females than in males and did not change until the last sampling. In males, the cortisol levels increased from the time of spawning until just before death. We concluded that during the breeding season, female sockeye sah-non are not refractory to stress in the breeding period, because their sex steroid levels decreased in response to stress. In females, cortisol levels probably reach maximum levels before the blood samples are taken.																					89-85670-37-9				1999							465	470																WOS:000081156600073
C	Martin, AJ; McNee, JJ			CSU; CSU	Martin, AJ; McNee, JJ			Mining-related impacts to Lago Junin, Peru	TAILINGS AND MINE WASTE '99					6th International Conference on Tailing and Mine Waste 99	JAN 24-27, 1999	COLORADO STATE UNIV, FT COLLINS, CO		COLORADO STATE UNIV			Field sampling was conducted at Lago Junin, Peru, in May/June, 1997 and February/March, 1998, representing the dry and wet seasons, respectively, in order to characterize the physical and geochemical limnology of the lake system. The sampling strategy was designed to assess the magnitude and extent of mining-related impacts. Low concentrations of trace metals measured in surface waters during the dry season contrasted greatly from the high values observed during the wet period. The seasonal variability can be attributed to increased loadings associated with the river discharge and changes in lake circulation resulting from hydroelectric dam operations. Such mechanisms are responsible for the periodic degradation in water quality in the inner and main basins, and the continual widespread accumulation of metal-rich sediments. High-resolution pore water profiles of dissolved Fe, Mn, SO42- and H2S illustrate that the organic-rich sediments (20-25 wt.% organic carbon) in the main basin become anoxic within a several millimetres of the sediment-water interface. The pore water profiles of Cu, Zn and Pb exhibit consumption profiles at depths consistent with sulphate reduction zones, suggesting they are sequestered as authigenic sulphide minerals. Diffusive influxes calculated for Cu, Zn and Pb suggest that diffusion mechanisms contribute insignificantly to the accumulation rates of these metals. The efflux of disserved Zn associated with the remobilization of labile particulates in the interfacial horizons could contribute significantly to the water column inventory of dissolved Zn at this site. The predominantly mining-related deposits in Upamayo are characterized by large remobilizations of copper and zinc in the deep acidic (pH < 4) pore waters, resulting in minor releases of these metals to the overlying water column. The acid-generating properties are believed to stem from sulphide oxidation reactions which are accelerated by periodic wetting and drying episodes associated with the annual cycle of lake drawdown and recharge. Assuming the input of mining-related contaminants into the inner and main basins of Lago Junin can be restricted, via either river clean-up or modifications to dam operations, a passive approach to lake restoration is recommended for these areas.																					90-5809-025-6				1999							657	670																WOS:000078186900071

On the other hand, there are many lakes in these rural regions, playing an important role in irrigation and fish breeding. These lakes are rarely identified on topographic maps. The aims of this study are to set up fast and reliable methods to achieve both flood extent delimitation and lakes identification by SAR remote sensing analysis. The Thai Nguyen province, Northern Vietnam, has been chosen as study area for the present study. In this context, two RADARSAT-1 SAR images have been programmed and acquired in 1996 for Thai Nguyen province, one image during the rainy season in August, the other one during the dry season in December. The paper summaries the different methods used for flood extents and lakes mapping.																					90-5809-029-9				1999							301	305																WOS:000079334400045

Two methods of investigation were compared: net samples and a newly constructed funnel trap. The trap consists of eight funnels, each one attached to a collecting vessel. The vessels contained an air reservoir which allowed the water insects, depending on atmospheric oxygen to survive. 15 species were found but Sigara falleni, S. striata and Cymatia coleoptrata (Hemiptera, Heteroptera, Corixidae) dominated at 95%. Both methods represented a comparable species composition and population structure of the dominant species. Compared to the net samples, the funnel trap proved to be more precise in recording the seasonal development Df the Sigara population and the impact of a flood on the population size. Brighter funnel colours showed better catching results, probably simulating the lit water surface, which is regularly visited by the animals for breathing. The funnel trap is a useful tool to investigate population dynamics of aquatic Heteroptera and could easily be applied to other insects.																			0344-9084						1999	12	1-6					245	248																WOS:000089179800051

JERS-1 SAR data were mainly used together with other data such as JERS-1 AVNIR, ERS-1 SAR Landsat TM, NOAA. AVHRR and others, as well as topographic maps and hydrologic records. The detection of. shorelines at different water levels from 1 m to 10 m (the maximum water level) was partially accomplished and the interpolation of the shorelines at I-m intervals was implemented using a linear function. The water depth of the lake at the minimum water level was estimated by applying a regression model with the correlation between brightness temperature of NOAA AVHRR and shallow water depth with less than I m. The results obtained from the study would be very useful for water use planning and flood management of Tonle Sap Lake.																					92-1-119940-9				1999							82	85																WOS:000169104700015

This reconstruction shows that between 21,000 and 17,500 C-14 yr B.P. a shallow lake affected by short term fluctuations was expanded all the surface of the salar of Coipasa, presently practically dry. Between 18/17,000 and 16,000 C-14 yr B.P., a dryness of the basins of the Bolivian Altiplano occurred probably. By 15,500 C-14 yr B.P., a lacustrine transgression associated with an increase in salinity suggests a climate with very strong contrasting seasons; the lake reached its hydrological lacustrine optimum between 13,000 and 12,000 C-14 Sir B.P. with a salinity comprise between 12 and 39 g.L-1. A dry event occurred between 12,000 and 9500 C-14 yr B.P., followed by a slight lacustrine oscillation between 9500 and 8500 C-14 yr B.P.																			0003-5521						1999	103	2					201	221																WOS:000081435200001

These plans were verified and validated using dependent and independent data sets of G. paripes and Tanypodinae from both lakes using bootstrap simulation. Simulation results revealed that actual precision levels were heavily dependent on the degree of larval aggregation, as depicted by k Value of the negative binomial distribution For the highly aggregated populations of G. paripes in Lake Jessup, actual precision levels were lower than those intended. Conversely, higher precision levels were obtained for Tanypodinae, which were much less aggregated in these lakes. Lake-wide increases in sample sizes would lead to weak improvement of estimation. The present sampling plans (165-180 samples per lake) resulted in an actual precision level of approximate to 0.50 for G. paripes, demonstrating the need for further modification of the sampling plans. This study revealed that fixed precision sequential sampling plans were liberal for the highly aggregated chironomid larval populations and conservative for the less aggregated populations.

The impetus for the analysis was a lack of yield response of processing tomatoes to fertigation in 1995 compared to other years or sites. In the historical analysis, 2 years, 1964 and 1995, were identified as having a high frequency of very low daily vapour pressure deficits during the growing season. The site of the experiment where low VPD was recorded was about 5 km north from the shore of Lake Erie.

The results showed that the bass from Lake Naivasha are paratenic hosts of Contracaecum sp, and final hosts for the acanthocephalan Polyacanthorhynchus kenyensis, The nematode occurred in large numbers in fish caught in the more saline Oloidien Bay but only in small numbers in those in the main lake. Bass in the main lake, however, were more heavily infected with acanthocephalans than those in Oloidien Bay. One of the major pathological effects of the acanthocephalan was perforation of the liver by the spiny proboscis. Seasonal variation was not apparent for either of the parasites. The intensity of infection by Contracaecum sp. increased with the size of the host and female fish were more heavily infected than males.																					88-323-0824-X				1998							671	679																WOS:000076408600107

Site disturbance often reduces or removes the soil organic matter, soil microbes and plant litter that are the sources of these nitrogen pools. This is especially true in the thin, nutrient poor, relatively young high elevation soils of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This paper describes an ongoing study intended to characterize several aspects of this nitrogen supply. These aspects include: (1) the amount of nitrogen in various pools that support plant growth for extended periods of time land delineates sustainable from non-sustainable), (2) the seasonal release rate or turnover of nitrogen required for a healthy, dynamic plant community, (3) the soil sampling depth required to adequately characterize the condition of a disturbed site and (4) the estimated nitrogen release rate of various fertilizers, organic soil amendments including composts and mulches that might be used to "bootstrap" disturbed soil ecosystems to approximate predisturbance conditions. In 1995, we sampled 21 sites throughout the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each site usually consisted of paired, well-vegetated and poorly vegetated areas. Total carbon and nitrogen, mineralized nitrogen tan index of seasonal availability) and available nitrate and ammonium were evaluated and compared. In 1996, we conducted a much more intensive survey on two Sierra Nevada soils (volcanic and granitic) over a range of vegetation cover classes. We have identified threshold amounts of total and mineralizable nitrogen that are significantly different between well-vegetated and poorly vegetated sites. Our results indicate that anaerobically mineralized nitrogen is correlated with plant cover on two Tahoe Basin soils. We suggest that a 1-10 cm depth is optimum for screening site fertility. The data indicate that, in wildland systems, extractable nitrate and ammonium are not reliable indicators of plant cover. The ongoing fertilizer/amendment component of this study uses laboratory soil leaching columns to compare N release rates and microbial respiration various materials in order to determine the suitability of those materials as long-term sources of nitrogen to disturbed sites.																			1092-2806						1998	29						65	74																WOS:000073814100005

Using beach seines in 1987 and hydroacoustics and gillnets in 1990-1992, we assessed the status and habitat use patterns of the present population. Growth of cisco was rapid during the first 4 years of life, after which it remained steady at approximately 1 cm annually. Cisco represented more than 95 % of all fish caught in the gill nets, and cisco density and biomass in the pelagic zone ranged between 820-1890 fish.ha(-1) and 149-317 kg.ha(-1). Mean littoral zone densities of cisco varied seasonally between 0 and 347 fish.ha(-1) and biomass ranged between 0 and 161 kg.ha(-1), corresponding to an avenge of 9.2% of fish community density and 17.5 % of its biomass, respectively. Cisco avoided littoral waters in late July, when temperatures at 1 m depth exceeded 22 degrees C. Sampling location also, significantly affected cisco abundance and biomass in the littoral zone, indicating that cisco were primarily captured over steeply sloping sandy sediments. Our data suggest that the littoral zone can be an important habitat for lacustrine eisco populations.																			0071-1128		3-510-47052-4				1998	50						161	170																WOS:000078180200016

EUS is a concept that expresses the idea that at any point in time, there are limits to the degree of environmental pressure the earth's ecosystems can handle without unacceptable of irreversible damage to these systems, or to the life support functions that they enable. In this paper, EUS is used as a conceptual framework for identifying and describing the conflicting claims between recreation and nature conservation in a former estuary called Lake Grevelingen (the Netherlands). In order to determine the level of recreation possible within the boundaries of the EUS, the population sizes of individual species (birds) have been chosen as indicators. For each indicator species, a weak and a strong sustainability level in population size were determined. The 'distances' between current population size and both sustainability levels are measures for sustainability. Our case study of Lake Grevelingen shows that sustainability levels are dynamic in time and space, with levels of ecosystem vulnerability varying during the season. It is concluded that EUS can be of help in visualising the dynamic (im)balance between recreation and nature conservation.																					90-73348-81-1				1998							333	341																WOS:000076263500024

The final 7km stretch of this road traverses a hilly terrain with a deep gorge which posed a great deal of constructional difficulty. The main rock types, phyllite and metagreywacke, have weathered significantly under the humid tropical climate to produce highly erodible clayey/sandy silt. Major problems experienced during the rehabilitation of this road included instability of cut dopes and embankments. Field studies carried out in connection with a redesign of the cut slopes resulted in excellent cut slope performance. However, within four years of completion of the road rehabilitation project, extensive longitudinal cracking was noticed on a short section of the carriageway as a result of incipient embankment failure. This crack development, which was closely monitored over a 6-month period spanning the peaks of the dry and wet seasons, was mainly attributed to movement at the contact between sections of the road placed on cut and fill. Considerable erosion at the outlets of some of the drainage structures also caused undermining of sections of the carriageway. Considering the relatively short stretch of the carriageway affected by the embankment failure, the most cost-effective rehabilitation strategy was identified as widening the carriageway into the hillslope at the affected sections, in addition to expansion of drainage provisions and improvement of erosion control structures in the failed stretch of the road.																					90-5410-990-4				1998							3161	3167																WOS:000078260900439

At this arid site the surface roughness varies between extremely smooth (salt lakes, clay pan) and wry rough (alluvial fans, eroded salt formations). The moisture varies from very dry (alluvial fans) to wet (wet clay, salt crust with water ponds) with seasonal changes in certain areas. While the surface geometry is stable for certain surface types (alluvial fans, thick salt crusts) it changes for others as a result of the changing water level and erosion by wind and rain. The changing surface roughness, moisture, and vegetation conditions cause large variations of the backscattering and coherence. This information is used to distinguish different surface types. Furthermore, interferometry was used to map the topographic height. In a second part of the study, the potential of the degree of coherence to retrieve information on the vegetation density and the surface erosion was evaluated.

Effects of chemical N and P fertilizers, organic manure, water management and a nitrification inhibitor(thiourea) on N2O fluxes were studied. Total annual N2O emission from agricultural land of rice-wheat rotation in Tai-Lake region was also estimated. The results showed that application of chemical N, P fertilizers and organic manure greatly increased N2O emissions from rice or wheat fields. The N2O emission induced by chemical fertilizer N accounted for 0.19-0.48% and 0.56-0.63% of the total N applied in the rice-growing and wheat-growing season respectively. N in degradable organic compounds induced N2O-N loss rates were in the range of 0.81-1.90%. Applying a nitrification inhibitor and retaining a layer of water on the field surface reduced N2O emission significantly from rice fields. Based on our two years' observation data in Wu county of Tai-Lake region, it is calculated that the total annual N2O emission from agricultural land of rice-wheat rotation in Tai-Lake region was about 8.2 x 10(9)g N2O-N.																					0-306-46026-2				1998	55						51	59																WOS:000078164000006
J	Miller, RJ; Death, RG				Miller, RJ; Death, RG			Seasonal and spatial dynamics in the phytomacrofaunal community of Lake Henley, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The invertebrate communities associated with dense beds of exotic macrophytes were sampled monthly between June 1993 and June 1994 from three sites in Lake Henley, a small artificial lake in the Southern Wairarapa, North Island, New Zealand and from a small stream flowing into the lake. All communities were dominated by either the gastropod Potamopyrgus antipodarum or by oligochaetes. Community composition was similar at sites within the lake monoculture but changed seasonally. These changes appeared to be predominantly a result of seasonal fluctuations in the presence of filamentous algae on the macrophyte beds. Communities sampled from the stream site had a number of taxa in common with the lake communities but were quite distinctive in terms of the relative abundance of these component taxa. The diversity of the lake phytomacrofauna community, although comparable to similar studies in other New Zealand lakes, had a lower proportion of insect taxa perhaps because of the low floral diversity, the lack of depth variation, the absence of a nearby colonising source or the young age of the lake.																			0028-8330					DEC	1997	31	4					423	434		10.1080/00288330.1997.9516776	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1997.9516776													WOS:000071258900002
J	Miller, BB; Tevesz, MJS; Smith, JE				Miller, BB; Tevesz, MJS; Smith, JE			Post-Chippewa oxygen isotope record from Cowles Bog, southern Lake Michigan basin	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Previous studies of sediments and molluscs recovered from vibracores at Cowles Bog, a fen located in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, along the south shore of Lake Michigan, reveal long and short term water level fluctuations during the last 6000 years. Low water events are indicated by zones of organic detritus, in which occasionally, iron oxide and calcium carbonate nodules, as well as selenite crystals have been precipitated. Oxygen isotope data from aragonitic shells of the gastropod Amnicola limosa (Say) collected from a sediment core provide a record of Middle to Late Holocene environmental changes for the fen. These data are in good agreement with previous interpretations of water level fluctuations based on changes in lithology and molluscan faunal abundance and composition. Below 366 cm the molluscan record is either absent or represented by shell fragments. The condition of shells in this interval suggests that the molluscs may have been exposed to subaerial weathering and reworking of older Holocene lake sediments, possibly during the low water Chippewa phase in the Lake Michigan basin (10 000 YBP to 6000 YBP). Above 366 cm the core is characterized by a well preserved molluscan fauna. Relatively light isotopic values for the interval between 366 cm to 300 cm correlate with the transition from nonfossiliferous sands, peat and diamict to silty marl and calcareous sand, with a molluscan fauna dominated by taxa associated with permanent water bodies. The event producing these alterations, the Nipissing Transgression, marks a change from subaerial to 'permanent' lacustrine conditions that were not characterized by high net evaporation. Evidence for another series of environmental changes occurs between 284 cm and 198 cm. This evidence includes the: (1) appearance of aquatic molluscs at 280 cm that are associated with water bodies subject to significant seasonal water level changes; (2) intermittent accumulations of iron oxide nodules, calcium carbonate nodules, and organic layers interbedded with crudely horizontal layers of fine, calcareous, sand, suggesting periodic water level oscillations; (3) onset of major excursions in the oxygen isotopic values between 260 cm to 198 cm. Relatively high delta(18)O (PDB) values, possibly indicating evaporative enrichment of the water, correlate with a prominent shell debris layer at a depth of about 235 cm. Taken together, this evidence suggests that the core site was in the process of becoming isolated from Lake Michigan. This isolation occurred during a series of low water events during the later part of the Nipissing Transgression.																			0921-2728					OCT	1997	18	3					299	305		10.1023/A:1007913926722	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007913926722													WOS:A1997YD26300009
J	Dutil, LT; Couillard, CM; Belanger, D				Dutil, LT; Couillard, CM; Belanger, D			A processing plant survey of external lesions of American eels (Anguilla rostrata) from Lake Ontario and the St Lawrence River, Canada	PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE												Signs of decreasing landing and recruitment were observed in the last decade in American eels (Anguilla rostrata) from the St, Lawrence River basin, Canada. In order to verify if the declines were associated with high prevalence of diseases among commercial catches, a total of 12 243 eels captured in five commercial fishing sites were inspected at two processing plants in 1992. They were all examined for external lesions and palpated to detect vertebral deformities, Eels from Lakes Ontario, Saint-Francois and Saint-Pierre were mainly resident eels, while those from the Richelieu River and the St. Lawrence Estuary at Kamouraska were mainly mature migrating eels, Prevalences of every lesion observed were low (less than or equal to 1%) at every site. Scratches all over the body were found only on eels from Kamouraska. Cutaneous ulcers were observed more frequently in the Richelieu River. Higher prevalences of vertebral deformities were found in mature migrating eels captured in Kamouraska and in the Richelieu River, Vertebral deformities were also observed more frequently among eels captured at the end of the 1992 fishing season in Kamouraska. Higher length, weight and/or age of mature migrating eels may be associated with higher prevalences of vertebral deformities among this group. These results do not indicate that the health of the American eels commercially captured in the St, Lawrence basin is severely impaired, However, the magnitude of diseases among the biological population is probably underestimated by such a survey.

These samples were carried out in surface and bottom in only one sampling station with a shower pipe specified for shallow environments. Brachionus plicatilis was the dominant organism with Thermocyclops decipiens, Arctodiaptomus dorsalis and Moina sp. The found taxonomic composition is very similar to another eutrofic tropical lakes with hard and alkaline waters. Community diversity showed small values and it was more associated with evenness in surface and bottom and it was affected by dominance of B. plicatilis. Width niche for this organism and I. decipiens was small in both depth. Directional overlap niche index between these two taxa were small too. Cluster analysis for samples showed four groups in surface and bottom organized in accordance with absolute abundance and influenced by B. plicatilis for representing of total zooplankton 56.6% in surface and 70.8% in bottom. For taxa were formed two groups: in first were joined those dominants and abundant taxa and in the second the rare taxa.																			0034-7744					MAR	1997	45	1B					549	563																WOS:A1997XF97200024
J	Johnson, E				Johnson, E			Late quaternary bison utilization at Lubbock Lake, Southern High Plains of Texas	PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST					Symposium on Southern Plains Bison Procurement and Utilization from Paleoindian to Historic at the 52nd Plains Anthropological Conference	NOV 02-06, 1994	LUBBOCK, TX					The history of bison utilization at the Lubbock Lake Landmark is a long one, spanning thousands of years and many cultures. Bison kill/butchering locales are known for the Paleoindian through Middle Archaic periods, when small cow/calf herds were butchered around or near the waterway in the valley axis. Game animal processing stations containing modern bison remains are common from the Late Archaic through Historic periods, also centered along the waterway. These two modes of the procurement pattern represent primary butchering activities (locales) and secondary activities (stations). The basic butchering tool kit appears similar through time, composed primarily of amorphous lithic flake tools and bone expediency tools. The role of bison in the subsistence base varied through time, ranging from a component of a broad-based meat-related subsistence, to a targeted large-game animal, to a component of a mixed meat-plant subsistence. The repeated use of lubbock Lake through time and available seasonality data indicate the Landmark to have been a well-known location within a seasonal round of activities regardless of social organization or climatic regime. The Lubbock Lake record acts as the regional model, but additional research is needed to assess the model and reshape if where necessary.																			0032-0447					FEB	1997	42	159					45	61		10.1080/2052546.1997.11931837	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2052546.1997.11931837													WOS:A1997WZ00200005
C	Abbate, G			ESA	Abbate, G			Heat island study in the area of Rome by integrated use of ERS-SAR and Landsat TM	THIRD ERS SYMPOSIUM ON SPACE AT THE SERVICE OF OUR ENVIRONMENT, VOL 1	ESA SPECIAL PUBLICATIONS				3rd ERS Symposium on Space at the Service of Our Environment	MAR 14-21, 1997	FLORENCE, ITALY	European Space Agcy				Modifications of natural land cover together with localized industrialization and enormous increase in motor traffic greatly contribute to air pollution and degradation of environmental and climatological quality in urban areas. As concentration of world population in urban areas shows an increasing trend, there is no doubt that climatological elements (i.e. temperature, ventilation, sun/shading, relative humidity) have to be integrated in urban planning and building to improve quality of life. The present study is aimed at contributing to a better understanding of climate characteristics in the "heat and roughness island" of Rome and surrounding rural areas. The satellite point of view (time synchronized dense grid of data over the whole area) allows a double-sided approach: 1) the city as a whole, with its overall interactions with neighboring areas; 2) local features within the city. As for point 1), three Landsat TM images of a large area around Pome (including sea coast, Bracciano lake, Tevere valley and Castelli Romani) for different season and meteorological conditions have been compared for all bands. Effects of interaction with the regional circulation were observed. As for point 2), multitemporal radiometric and texture properties of various land cover types (different types of building, urban fabric and vegetation) have been analysed in nine ERS-1 SAR.PRI images (acquired during 1992 under different meteorological conditions) together with Landsat TM thermal bands and NDVI. The aim is to obtain a classification of urban land-cover to be compared with temperature patterns as derived from TM thermal band. Combination of SAR data with NDVI looks very promising to this purpose.																			0379-6566		92-9092-656-2				1997	414						305	310																WOS:000073315300053

The data indicate that short-term temporal changes in contaminant distribution and redox conditions are affected by hydrodynamic effects and potential aerobic degradation mechanisms. Seasonal effects are responsible for physical erosion and reaeration of the top segment of the plume, resulting in washout of predominantly trichloroethylene (TCE). Based on hydrogen and redox measurements, the dominant terminal electron accepting process (TEAP) was iron-reduction, conditions which were shown to sustain both abiotic and biotic dechlorination in laboratory microcosms.																					1-57477-031-4				1997	4(3)	3					173	178																WOS:A1997BH89U00042

The main impacts are associated with hydrodynamic considerations such as changes in seasonal stratification and temperature regimes, as well as general circulation and mixing in the lake. Secondary effects on loadings are also expected, due to potential changes in precipitation and distribution of wetlands. Impacts of these changes are described in the context of water quality models applied to the Great Lakes.																					0-7844-0272-8				1997	27						931	936																WOS:000081412000157

Persistent contamination of mow and rain manifested itself in the water quality deterioration of rivers and lakes in Russia on a regional scale, To study the extent and the rate of ground water acidification in regions of European part of Russia, an analytical treatment of variation in ground water quality over space and time was performed. Subsequently, a comprehensive research was carried out for a number of water catchment areas, differing by geological, hydrogeological, and landscape conditions as wr ll as by the degree of human impact on the environment. The research comprised an investigation of rain and snow chemical composition, along with their transformation in soil and aeration zone, an investigation of hydrochemical behavior of ground water taking into account seasonal variations and different types of hydrogeological regimes. The character of buffer action, as well as the kinetic properties of the process were studied under conditions of excess content of certain ions (i.e., hydrogen, sulfate and other ions), taking into account mineralogical characteristics of the rocks.

Lake water quality has been subject to slow degradation during the years, and the trophic level of the lake has consequently been impaired. Long term protection of lake water quality, as well as avoidance of recreation standards exceedance during the tourist season are the main environmental concerns in the case. Analysis of monitoring data showed a very peculiar behaviour of the system, heavily affected by infiltration of lake water, carrying a wastewater flow that becomes more and more diluted as it approaches the treatment works. Hydraulic modeling of the system has shown that under present conditions,little can be done to improve its hydraulic behaviour: structural interventions are needed to significantly improve its efficiency and protect water quality.

The samples were from populations in Central and Western Finland, two from lakes and two from rivers. The results show that females with visible glair glands had significantly wider first pleonites land thus wider tails also) than females with no glair gland development (Le. non-reproductive females). The widening of the tail before egg-laying can be seen as a possible evolutionary adaptation. We discuss the possible implications of this particular morphological adaptation on the reproductive strategy of Astacus astacus.																					0-9642382-3-3				1997							378	383																WOS:000090095400036

In particular. the processes affecting water quality on the Yukon River at Marsh Lake and at Carmacks are examined based on a time series collected between 1981 and 1992. Hysteresis diagrams, which aid in determining the effects of snowmelt and rainfall on water quality, were used to determine the processes affecting water quality. These time series were also examined for the presence of trends and seasonal effects were assessed prior to modelling the series and forecasting the water quality of the river at these two locations. No trends in water quality variables were observed. However, differences between sites with respect to seasonality and concentration were observed. Univariate Box-Jenkins time series modelling techniques were used to fit models to observed patterns and then to forecast water quality for the following year.																			0838-1984		0-660-16680-1				1997		16					153	174																WOS:000165068800010

Site specific evaporation data are required to assess the long-term stability of tailings impoundments for mine site decommissioning and abandonment. A stable water cover on the tailings containment area is desired as it is an effective method to minimize acid generation in sulphide waste material. Meteorological data are being collected at four mine sites for evaporation modelling. The meteorologic stations are located at Pocket Lake near the Giant mine (62 degrees 30' N, 114 degrees 24' W) and at the tailings ponds at the Salmita mine (64 degrees 03' N, 111 degrees 11' W), the Nanisivik mine (73 degrees 02' N, 84 degrees 33' W) and the Cullaton Lake mine (61 degrees 15' N, 98 degrees 28' W). Evaporation rates art modelled with hourly weather data using the Penman Method, a combined energy balance/aerodynamic mathematical model. A basic water budget gives an estimate of evaporation rates using the change in lake levels and precipitation. An isotopic mass balance method also gives estimates of seasonal evaporation rates based on the enrichment of naturally occurring heavy isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in water. Evaporation pan data from the Yellowknife airport weather station are compared with the modelled data.																			0838-1984		0-660-16680-1				1997		16					115	133																WOS:000165068800008

Information necessary for estimating fluxes of methane includes plant species and primary production. Measuring and monitoring the spatial and temporal variations in these parameters should facilitate modeling fluctuations in global greenhouse gas amounts. Three ERS-1 and two Landsat-TM datasets, acquired over large wetland sites in the Western Sandhills of Nebraska, were obtained during the 1995 growing season, The SAR images were despeckeled, and both ERS and TM were resampled to a 30m spatial resolution, rectified to a UTM coordinate system, and segmented to exclude uplands using a digital National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) dataset. In-situ reference data were obtained at various sites within the study area in conjunction with satellite overpasses. The ERS data were classified in an attempt to identify and map the distribution of wetlands at two levels: 1) specificity roughly equivalent to that of the NWI; and 2) at the species level, with emphasis on Typha, Scirpus, and Phragmites. The TM scenes were also classified and compared to the SAR result. Finally, a combined ERS and TM dataset was classified. Both SAR backscatter and TM reflectance were correlated to field measures of above-ground biomass. Results were considered with regard to C-and L-band CW and VH) scatterometer data acquired at close-range over experimental plots containing Typha and Phragmites. Landsat-TM seems better than ERS for generalized classification and mapping, and for emulating the NWI product. However, TM is limited with regard to identification of individual wetland species, and sparse stands of emergent, floating, and submergent macrophytes. ERS seems better than TM for detecting individual species, and sparse stands of emergent, floating, and submergent macrophytes. But, the ERS multi-temporal classification is not easily adapted for most practical mapping applications. Wind must be considered when classifying ERS in shallow lake systems. Potential exists for ERS/TM classification, but more work is needed Biomass estimation, while encouraging, needs refinement. C-and L-band scatterometer data suggest that polarization is more important in distinguishing Typha and Phragmites than frequency.																			0379-6566		92-9092-656-2				1997	414						197	202																WOS:000073315300032

The need for potable water for industry and households, as well as use of hydropower, are increasing. Many provinces with a high population such as West Java, Central Java and East Java, as well as the eastern parts of the country with low levels of rainfall such as Sumatra Island, Kalimantan and Lombok, suffer from serious water shortages, especially in the dry season (March-August). One industrial project for increasing the economic value of natural resources is to produce methanol from natural gas containing CO2 at Natuna but this process would require large amounts of high purity water per day. Another concept is to develop agriculture and its associated industries in the eastern parts of the country such as West Nusatenggara, East Nusatenggara and East Timer, as well as fisheries in Maluku. Water demands can be divided into four categories: category A: direct potable water; category B: raw drinking water; category C: fisheries water; and category D: agricultural (irrigation), city (household) and industrial waters, and use of hydropower. Indonesia has many types of water resources such as rivers, lakes and dams, rainfall and groundwater. However, according to the balance of water demand and supply, some areas have a negative value in the dry season. The ways of improving the water supply include construction of dams to store water during the rainy season and sea water desalination. Almost half the country suffers from water shortages in the dry season; these will increase by the year 2015. Most of these areas are surrounded by the sea, therefore sea water desalination is considered to be a suitable method for overcoming the deficit in water. On the basis of its geographical location and the number of people living in isolated areas of the country, a small nuclear power plant with a long term fuel cycle is considered to be an appropriate source of electricity and energy for desalination.

Following addition of 100 tons agricultural limestone (CaCO3) to the treatment lake in February 1985, mean annual ANC rose from 20 mu eq l(-1) to 668 mu eq l(-1) then decreased. In October 1987, ANC in the treatment lake was decreasing, so 15 additional tons of limestone were added. Pre-limestoning there were few significant (p < 0.05) differences between MZB assemblages in the two lakes, but 4 years post treatment the following differences (p < 0.05) were detected in the treatment lake: more Chironomidae, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Hyalella azteca, total MZB numbers and higher Mollusca wet weight than in the reference lake. From 1984 to 1988 in the treatment lake the annual means of the following community characteristics increased (p < 0.05): totals of Chironomidae, Ephemeroptera (including Caenis spp.), Odonata, Trichoptera, Sphaeriidae, collectors and MZB numbers; Chironomidae and Ephemeroptera taxa richness and total taxa richness; total and Mollusca wet weight. However, the treatment lake ecosystem is neither self-sustaining nor stable because limestone must be added every 2 to 3 years to maintain ANC above 50 mu eq l(-1) In the reference lake annual means of ANC, specific conductance, calcium and magnesium decreased (p < 0.05) while Secchi depth increased (p < 0.05), suggesting continuing acidification.																			0018-8158					JAN 12	1996	317	2					115	126		10.1007/BF00018735	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018735													WOS:A1996TY88100004

The crop coefficient (kc) were reestimated in order to meet the actual water consumption.

Micrometeors and micrometeorites 50 mu m to 1 mm in diameter constitute an intermediate population between interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) and meteorites,and represent almost 80% of all the meteoritic mass (excluding rare, large impactors with mass m greater than or equal to 10(11)kg) accreting onto Earth. Deceleration in the Earth's atmosphere causes frictional heating in micrometeorites, as a function of the entry angle, mass and initial velocity of the particle. The atmospheric entry of these large cosmic particles gives evidence that only those with very low geocentric velocities survive partially melted and unmelted without vaporising, suggesting that the large micrometeorites arrive to Earth by non-gravitational effects, as the Poynting-Robertson (P-R) effect and the solar pressure radiation, from asteroids of different belts and low-inclination comets. In a preliminary test study, wind-blown Antarctic gross-particles (up to 300-400 micron) have been trapped during December 1994-January 1995 in collectors inside meteorological containers and aerosol samplers nearby Campo Icaro (74 degrees 42' 43 '' S; 164 degrees 06' 58 '' E) in Antarctica. Mineralogical analysis shows that the large micrometeorites are conspicuously rare and the collected particles are constituted by single crystal fragments of feldspars, quartz, biotite and amphibole as observed in order of abundance. A mechanism of concentration of cosmic dust in polar regions by sedimentation processes occurring into seasonal meltwater lakes on glaciers close to coastal regions, is thought to be a decisively more efficient mechanism than the eolian transport of these large micrometeorites.																					88-7794-084-0				1996	51						253	266																WOS:A1996BG69F00021

The model is based on full non-linear hydrodynamic equations modified according to Boussinesq and hydrostatic assumptions. It is combined with mesoscale meteorological model (Savijaarvi, 1995). The meteorological model simulates diurnal dynamics of near-surface winds due to variation of temperature contrast between land and lake. The peculiarities of lake-wide circulation of an average day during the dry season (end of May - middle of September) are studied using simulated winds as an input to the circulation model. Thermal effects apparently play a significant role in generating wind circulation pattern over Lake Tanganyika region. Numerical experiments show significant role of land-lake breeze system, intensified during the dry season. This is reflected in the variations of currents in the lake, driven mainly by these strong regular winds.																					90-5410-861-4				1996							661	666																WOS:A1996BH13B00101
J	Cho, KH				Cho, KH			Long-term changes of streamwater chemistry at a catchment of the Reinhardswald Forest (North Hesse)	FORSTWISSENSCHAFTLICHES CENTRALBLATT												In the course of the hydrologic years 1985 through 1991 long-term changes of water chemistry in stream samples collected at intervals of 14 days were investigated at the Elsterbach Catchment of the Reinhardswald in North Hesse, Germany. Regression analysis revealed a great effect of discharge on the quality of streamwater. The seasonal Kendall Test with the flow-adjusted residual concentrations of the 7 year series of element concentrations in streamwater showed a declining trend in the sum of anion concentrations of strong acids (SO42-, NO3-, Cl-). This was particularly true for sulphate because of strongly reduced deposition rates. By contrast on the cation side there was a significant decrease in the sum of base cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+) while the sum of acid cations (H+, Mn2+, Al3+, Fe3+, NH4+) remained statistically unchanged. In relation to the decline in sulphate, the alcalinity of streamwater increased significantly.																			0015-8003					DEC	1995	114	6					362	374		10.1007/BF02742240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02742240													WOS:A1995TR63100005
J	Kullberg, RG				Kullberg, RG			Decreased diversity caused by differential inhibition among artificial phytoplankton communities in an undisturbed environment	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												Cultures of freshwater algae were assembled into artificial communities consisting of 2, 3, 4 and 8 species. The same species were also grown simultaneously in unialgal cultures in separate containers. Different combinations of algae in the same-sized artificial communities were grown three limes for 17 weeks. Data obtained from the algae grown separately were treated in the same manner as those from algae grown in the artificial communities. The algae grown as unicultures in separate containers were found to grow in a descending order of abundance: a hierarchical order. When they grew as part of a community, several things happened: (1) all species were inhibited in growth; (2) the inhibition among the species was not uniform; (3) the species often exchanged numerical position in the hierarchy; and (4) the hierarchical order always increased, the degree of hierarchy being determined from the formula -Sigma p(i)Inp(i). The greater hierarchy in the communities means there was less evenness of numerical distribution and, therefore, less diversity. This study corroborated Connell's intermediate disturbance hypothesis from the aspect of the increase in hierarchy. Normally, this hypothesis has referred to the reduction of the number of species in an undisturbed community.																			0967-0262					NOV	1995	30	4					267	272		10.1080/09670269500651041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09670269500651041													WOS:A1995TM98700004

The parameters were statistically treated by procedures of time series analysis. A seasonal succession of examined features is described. It is established that development of the diatoms peaks in February, and that of the green and the blue-green algae peaks in June and August, respectively. Seasonal growth of the blue-green algae is substantially influenced by water temperature, Mn2+, O-2, CO2, and solar radiation; that of the green algae is effected by water temperature, solar radiation, CO2, Mn2+, and cloudiness; that of the diatoms is controlled by SiO32-, Mn2+, K+ + Na+, CO2, and water temperature.

Some aspects of implantation of a colonial Cyanobacteria Microcystis farlowiana Drouet & Daily in Lake Bourget	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Microcystis farlowiana is a colonial Cyanobacteria found in Massachussetts in 1942, also in the southern swamps of the Lake Bourget in 1949. Presently, it can be found in this lake at depths between 2 and 30 meters. Colonies, forming little balls whose diameter in between 0.5 and 2 centimeters, are gathered to form large lenticulare masses lying on the bottom of the lake. They seem to undergo seasonal movings which could be due to currents in the lake bottom. Since they were first described, colonies showed variations of colour and size : they were first floating, then subbenthic; now, they are epibenthic, and localized in photosynthesis unfavourable regions.																			0003-4088					JUN	1995	31	2					85	91		10.1051/limn/1995012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/1995012													WOS:000208074700001

The biomass was separated into vegetative and pod yields. Pods were further divided into hulls and seeds. Pods/plant, seeds/ plant, and seeds/pod were counted. Total biomass yield and all components except seeds/pod differed significantly for spacing treatments. Growing seasons and cultivars significantly affected yields; however, none of the years x spacings or cultivars x spacings interactions were significant. Plants of these two determinate cultivars exhibited significant plasticity in individual plant response to spacing for both vegetative and reproductive yields.

Water samples were concentrated either by Moore's gauze technique or by filtering through diatomaceous earth. Five enrichment media: yeast extract-Bengal rose broth (YER) with bile-oxalate-sorbose broth (BOS); 67 mmol/L phosphatebuffered saline (pH 7.6; PBS); PBS enriched with 1 % mannitol and 1 % peptone (PBSMP); PBS with lyzed 0.5 % sheep blood (PBSB); Wauters broth (W); and five plating media: Mac Conkey agar (MC); Salmonella-Shigella agar (SS); 5 % sheep blood agar (BA); lactose-sucrose-urea agar (LSU) and irgasan-novobiocin agar (IN) were used. The following strains were isolated: Y; intermedia B1 O:4,32-4,33 Lis Xz (four strains), Y, intermedia B1 O:57 Lis Xo (one strain), Y. intermedia B2 O:57 Lis Xo (one strain), Y. enterocolitica BL O:10-34 Lis Xz (one strain), and Y. frederiksenii undetermined biovar, O:16-16,29 Lis Xz (two strains). The incidence of isolation of Yersinia spp. was 7.14 %. YER-BOS proved to be the best enrichment method since it allowed the highest recovering of Yersinia spp. strains. Among plating media, the best results were obtained with MC. Apparently the isolation of Yersinia spp. can be related to environmental variables such as temperature differences between cold and warm seasons. Negative results obtained during virulence assays suggest that isolated strains lack the pathogenic potential against man.																			0015-5632	1874-9356					1994	39	6					459	462		10.1007/BF02814062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02814062								8549992					WOS:A1994RY65400002

The diversity of substrates among the sampling stations was reflected by the mold community. The similarity index confirmed the observed differences between the types of substrate from each station, and was a good parameter based on the molds community structure of comparison between different stations. The prevalence genera were the common molds: Penicillium spp., Aspergillus spp., Cladosporium spp. and non sporulating fungi. Seasonal variations were not observed. There were high mold densities down to 6cm in the sediments and progressive reduction to 20cm depth. The prevalence of non sporulating fungi at more polluted stations suggested this group of microrganisms as a possible indicator of organic poluttion. The indices of ricchness and diversity responded to changes in the fungi community mainly at the more polluted stations.

FISHERY DYNAMICS AND DEVELOPMENT IN KASTORIA LAKE, MACEDONIA, GREECE	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												The stochastic time series analysis of ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model was applied to the commercial fishery of the Lake Kastoria, Macedonia, Greece. The analysis is based upon the annual census data from 1960 to 1990 using back-calculation to test the integrity of the proposed models for each species. The annual catches of most species in the lake decline over the period 1960-1990 with several large non-seasonal peaks. This fact has influenced the model form for each species. In the present paper the ARIMA as described by Box and Jenkins (2) was applied to describe the fisheries dynamics and development through the years 1960-1990 and to provide certain mathematical expressions for the future fishery production for each species of economic importance.																			1018-4619					SEP	1993	2	9					528	533																WOS:000208652000008

It was shown that the population is characterized by monocyclicity. The crustacean's heterogeneity is manifested in the process of seasonal migrations: for most of the year, in the initial stages of development (dormant egg, embryogenesis, nauplial development), the population is found at the bottom. Copepodid development rakes place in a short time in May-June in the pelagic zone. These characteristics of the crustacean's life cycle in Pskov Lake are a behavioral adaptation aimed at raising the population's stability in the ecosystem under strong pressure from planktophage fish.

The general characteristics of the fisheries exhibit a high level of complexity which can be reduced by considering two types of fisheries: a migration fishery and a lacustrine one. A study of the seasonal variability shows complex relationships between capture, effort and cpue, and the hydrological regime. The interannual evolution of these fisheries from 1976 to 1988 is analyzed. The total annual landings are maximum in the years 1979 and 1980, then decrease until die 1983/84 fishing season and seem to stabilize at a relatively low level in the last years. The main factor for these variations seems to be natural fluctuations in the fish populations.																			0065-6755						1993	12	3-4					443	465																WOS:A1993NT90500006

Initially the laboratory infested water hyacinth plants were transferred in 1 acre pond near the Railway, Bus station, Gorakhpur where feeding marks on the plants were seen. Later, from Janurary, 1988 the inoculated plants were transferred to 1,700 acres Ramgarh Lake, Gorakhpur where feeding marks were noticed from May, 1988 onwards. A total of 5,12,101 individuals of the weevil on 28,445 inoculated plants each having an average of 18 insects (eggs, larvae, pupae and adults) were released in the lake until April, 1989. Post-release observations revealed 44.92 individuals per plant during May 1989. Due to constant feeding by the grubs, the petioles were seen breaking off. This resulted in complete elimination of the weed from the lake. During May, 1990, the weeds noticed on the periphery were observed attacked by the weevils and on an average 54.4 individuals per plant were recorded. After the rainy season these plants collapsed as had happened during 1989. Releases of 5, 12,010 individuals of the weevils in 1,700 acres suggests a dose of 300 individuals per acre. Two years field observations reveal that the quality of water in the reservoir plays an important role in the rate of multplication of weevils and control of the weed.

Particulate organic matter (POM), particulate inorganic matter (PIM), particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) concentrations were highest upon initial inflow of river water, as a result of the riverine transport of allochthonous seston into the lake, and during the initial draining phase, coinciding with the postflood development of phytoplankton biomass and accumulation of detritus from the decomposition of the inundated vegetation grown during the preceding period of exposure. However seston concentrations were lowest shortly after the termination of flood inflow, presumably due to sedimentation and river water dilution. Seston food quality, based on POM : PIM, C : N and Algal-AFDW : POM ratios, was higher during the early high water phase than during the filling and draining phases.																			0018-8158					SEP 29	1992	242	2					95	104																WOS:A1992JR31600004

Neither the rise nor decrease in levels were forecasted, leading to public demand for improved water level information to be used for planning and water resource management. The development of improved water level statistics must address the user's needs and should consider the physical aspect of the water fluctuations being modeled (annual fluctuations, seasonal fluctuations, storm rises, etc.), matching the type of statistic to the type of risk evaluation and the planning horizon. In order to develop new water level statistics, the experts must reach a consensus on the statistical model, incorporate conditionality, and properly adjust recorded data to reflect the existing hydraulic and hydrologic regimes. The effective use of the new statistics will depend upon the development of decision-making techniques for each interest and their communication to the user in non-technical terms.																			0380-1330						1992	18	1					199	201		10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71286-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71286-6													WOS:A1992HP68100018

The spawning season of the ayu in the lake was from early October to late November, when the water temperature falled 18-23-degrees-C. Ayu spawned mainly at shore line shallower than about 30 cm in depth and the substrate of redds were consisted of fine gravel (phi 2-150 mm). The number of spawned eggs, wind velocity and direction, and wave size at each spawning ground were measured daily from late September to early November. In most cases, spawning behavior appeared to commence with crosswinds. Spawning behavior was most frequently observed at a wind velocity of 4-5 m/sec. These results suggest that crosswinds result in waves which trigger the onset of spawning behavior in landlocked ayu in Lake Ikeda.																			0021-5392					JAN	1992	58	1					25	28																WOS:A1992LC66700004

The IP released into NaHSO3 aqueous solution might be those adsorbed to Fe rather than A1 which were present on the surface of sediment. From the model experiment for release, it was suggested that IP released from sediment was weakly-adsorbed IP. This method which is used to estimate weakly-adsorbed IP was applied to river waters. Seasonal variations of this weakly-adsorbed IP on the surface of sediment particles in different size and the relation between this IP and dissolved inorganic phosphorus in overlying water were studied.																			0369-4577					JUN	1991		6					859	867		10.1246/nikkashi.1991.859	http://dx.doi.org/10.1246/nikkashi.1991.859													WOS:A1991FV24400023

Besides the analytic investigation of adipose musculature, histological investigation of liver, kidneys, intestines and brachiae was also carried out to compare the existing alterations with the level of residua. Histological features indicating acute or chronic poisoning due to chlorinated hydrocarbons were not observed during the investigations. The level of chlorinated hydrocarbons was fairly low and it reaches the food-hygienic limit value in none of the cases. DDT was found in a very low percent of fish while the occurrence of its metabolite, of DDE, was significantly higher. Seasonal fluctuation was not found in case of the demonstrated residua. It has been pointed out that the level of demonstrable chlorinated hydrocarbons decreased significantly in fish, as compared to the levels found in the sixties, and it was lower than the limit values spelling danger for the health of man and of the fishes.																			0025-004X					JUN	1990	45	6					359	361																WOS:A1990DU39100009
J	WANZIE, CS				WANZIE, CS			WATER-RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (WRM) AND WILDLIFE CONSERVATION IN THE LAKE CHAD BASIN	MAMMALIA												The Lake Chad Basin, like any other semi-arid and arid regions of Africa, has had a series of periods of droughts in recent years. These droughts have resulted in the loss of vegetation, hence desertification and the silting of streams; all phenomena which have in turn greatly reduced surface water. In order then to make water available for various uses in the subregion, man has constructed dams, drained certain areas in order to irrigate others, as well as sunk boreholes. The concentration of animals in such areas, especially in the dry season, has only resulted in the over-utilisation of limited areas of the ecosystem and the deaths of animals. In order then to conserve life in general and wildlife in particular, the writer has tried to point out the dangers of a continuous water resources management in the Lake Chad Basin. Possible precautions have also been suggested should more of such projects be envisaged for the future.																			0025-1461						1990	54	4					579	585		10.1515/mamm.1990.54.4.579	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mamm.1990.54.4.579													WOS:A1990FD34500003

The influence of Lymnaea ovata population from the Onega lake (Russian SFSR, USSR) on biomass and production of stone peryphyton has been demonstrated. A study of growth, metabolism, numbers and biomass dynamics of L. ovata was used for calculation of food consumption of the mollusks. At the beginning of vegetation period mollusks consumed nearly 100% of peryphyton production, in the middle of the season this value decreased to 25%. The role of detritophagous mollusks in transformation of sedimented organic matter has been demonstrated with Valvata sibirica from Schutchye lake (Buryat [Azerbaijan SSR (USSR)] taken as an example. During the season mollusks consume 19-39% of all the sedimented detrite at 12% efficacy of assimilation. Production of population constitutes less than a half [42%] of assimilated matter.																			0044-4596					JUL-AUG	1989	50	4					551	557																WOS:A1989AK79800012

The fungus colonizes branches or seedlings during their first season, and the density of its coverage increases every year thereafter. The fungus was absent from striped maple at a site near Lake Placid, NY [USA], and there is some evidence that its frequency of occurrence has declined elsewhere in the last few years. A pure culture of the fungus was unable to hydrolyze several plant cell wall polymers. It was able to use simple lipids, however, and its presence increased the erosion of the cutinized layer of striped maple stems. The fungus does not penetrate the stem surface, and its occurrence is not correlated with twig length or volume. It was absent from three sympatric maple species.

THe stomach contents of the oyster composed of 52.8% of diatoms, 45.7% of detritus and 1.5% animal matter. Among phytoplankton, the following is the order of importance: Navicula, Coscinodiscus, Nitzchia, Pleurosigma, Rhizosolenia, Amphora and Peridinium; and among zooplankton, bivalve veliger ranked first, followed by the ciliate tintinnids. Plankton was also collected from the natural bed to correlate with th gut contents of oyster. The oyster showed prefernce especially for diatoms like Pleurosigma, Coscinodiscus and peridinum, even though these diatoms were found in low quantities in the natural bed area. Two peaks of feeding intensities were observed one during December-January and the other during May-June. Oyster fed poorly during monsoon season (October-November) due to prevalence of low saline conditions in the lake.																			0370-0097					SEP	1988	97	5					463	470		10.1007/BF03179954	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03179954													WOS:A1988Q475500009

Barley crops planted at fortnightly intervals during each season showed that optimum grain yields could be obtained if drilling was completed before the end of November. Barley sown in December suffered a significant yield loss; it showed a definite positive response to N fertilizer application. Grain yields increased with increase in N fertilization from zero to 100 kg N ha-1. Plant height, numbers of tillers and spikes, lengthof spikes and number of grains spike-1 were also directly related to N level. However, grain yields were highest at the lowest seed rate of 100 kg ha-1 in all seasons.

The fertility of the cycling females was also to be established. Sixty three-year-old Nganda heifers and their crosses with the other local types, namely the Ankole, the Nkedi and the Nkolomojo, were monitored for ovarian activity in order to establish their cyclicity. The results indicated that 51.7 per cent were found to be pregnant and from their gestation stages it was obvious that sexual maturity had occurred at about two and a half years of age. In all 88.4 per cent of the heifer had already achieved sexual maturity by three years of age. Only 11.7 per cent of the heifers were anoestrus at that age. The RIA results showed progesterone levels which were consistent with the rectal palpation results. The rather low age of sexual maturity in over 50 per cent of the heifers is probably due to the good climatic conditions existing in the traditional area of the Nganda type of cattle. This area around Lake Victoria has no marked dry season. In the area small numbers of cattle are kept by the farmer, some supplementation is practiced, prophylaxis treatments are done and farmers are more open to advice of good management practices.																			0044-605X	1751-0147					1988				83			46	57											3202073					WOS:A1988Q783900006

The present paper deals with experimental catch statistics of this species obtained in 1982 and 1983. Pelagic zone in northern sector of the lake is the richest in Clarias fishes, the poorest being the littoral zone in southern sector. From fishing station in northern pelagic zone, 33% of total number and 32% of total weight of fishes landed were caught, whereas from southern littoral station, it was respectively 15% and 16%. Statistics from southern pelagic station (27% in number and 27% in weight) and from northern littoral one (26% in number and 25 in weight) show an identical and intermediate richness in Clarias gariepinus. Between 1982 and 1983, there is no significant change in the global abundance and biomass of those fishes. But, abundance and biomass fluctuate according to variations of natural conditions due to different seasons, especially amount of rains and water levels reaches its peak, typically in April-May and in November-December. During rainy seasons, individual weights of most .ETA.larias caught raise because many of them have mature gonads and so are ready to reproduce. Catches also are higher during those seasons because mature Clarias become more active and enter their reproductive migration out of lake into swampy zones and little temporary streams around lake.																			0243-7678						1987	8	2					149	164																WOS:A1987G764400006

Among three incubation temperatures 2.degree. C, 18.degree. C, and 37.degree. C, the highest bacterial counts were obtained consistently at 18.degree. C. With incubation at 2.degree. C the highest counts occurred when the water temperature in the lake was 10.degree. C or lower, and psychrophilic bacteria were recovered only at such times. Most of the 2.degree. C and 18.degree. C isolates were psychrotrophs. Some of the 18.degree. C isolates were incapable of growth at either 2.degree. C or 37.degree. C, the extreme recovery temperatures examined. Turnover times and heterotrophic potentials for the substrate of interest were calculable for seven of the eight mineralization experiments. Substrate turnover occurred more quickly and the potential for glucose mineralization was always greater at the higher test temperature, for a given sampling. Cold water temperatures did not preclude glucose mineralization.																			0022-1260	1349-8037				OCT	1986	32	5					383	391		10.2323/jgam.32.383	http://dx.doi.org/10.2323/jgam.32.383													WOS:A1986H157000002

During the early period, 46,987 geese and 76,143 ducks were bagged during 48,610 hunter-visits. Hunting seasons were 30 to 60 d in length. Greater White-formed Geese, Anser albifrons, followed by Northern Pintails, Anas acuta, and Cackling Canada Geese, Branta canadensis minima, were the most important birds in the harvest. Average harvest was 1.0 goose and 1.6 ducks per hunter-visit. A short (30-d) and late hunting season drastically curtailedharvest in 1937. Reduced hunting activity in 1941 was attributed to military mobilization. During the 1978-83 period, 34,416 geese and 63,458 ducks were bagged during 69,170 hunter-visits. Hunting seasons during this period were mostly 93 d in length. The most important bird in the harvest was the Mallard, A. platyrhynchos, followed by White-fronted Goose and Northern Pintail.

Wind-induced advection of Emerald Bay populations of Bosmina longirostris into Lake Tahoe was hypothesized to be the mechanism for Bosmina''s reappearance in the main body of that lake in late 1978 following an absence of more than three years (Threlkeld 1981). Landsat satellite imagery is examined here to determine if a significant spatial-temporal interaction in water quality in Emerald Bay and Lake Tahoe consistent with this hypothesis occurred during the period when Bosmina reappeared. Densitometer measurements of Landsat MSS band 4 and 5 images were compared by ANOVA; significant station-season interactions were detected, and enlarged Landsat film images revealed plumes, streaks and other surface features which may have been associated with the hypothesized mixing events in Lake Tahoe. A major limitation of this method is the need for pre-flyover ''water truth'' data for interpretation of detectable surface features.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1985	127	1					3	8		10.1007/BF00004657	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00004657													WOS:A1985APM0100001

Results of the modeling effort on Crest Lake were analyzed to determine the compatibility of the basic Vollenweider model with short-term applications to highly eutrophic southern lakes. Input parameters such as rainfall and wind speed were considered on a daily basis to see if the model could represent the short-term variations observed in the lake. Model simulations were compared to total P observations collected on the lake at intervals as short as 1 day. Results indicated that the model can be used as a tool for analysis of system responses on a seasonal basis, but short-term variations on the weekly or daily time-frame were poorly represented by the model. Intensive temporal and spatial sampling within the lake verified the validity of the completely mixed assumption for short-term applications. Nine sampling locations within the lake, distributed with area and depth, displayed a mean coefficient of variation of only 10.9% when averaged daily for the 54 day intense sampling period. Short-term variations were poorly correlated with meterological inputs, suggesting that variability be best represented by a stochastic approach if a practical management tool is desired for situations where variability be best represented by a stochastic approach if a practical management tool is desired for situations where variability is critical. The seasonal trends were well represented by the model, reflecting the rapid response of hypereutrophic systems to alterations in P loadings.																			0167-6369	1573-2959					1984	4	1					85	98		10.1007/BF01047624	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01047624								24259149					WOS:A1984SY57800008

No significant differences were found in prevalences or mean intensities of A. brevis metacercariae between male and female perch in Heming Lake. Prevalence levels remained high in most age-classes of Heming Lake perch, and mean intensity differences were not significant for all ages beyond 1 yr old. Slight variations from these Heming Lake results were found in other lakes. Prevalence levels of A. brevis in Heming Lake perch remained more or less constant during the open water seasons. Mean intensities dropped significantly from June-July and increased in Aug. and Oct. Monthly fluctuations were probably the result of recruitment of the parasite and a loss of heavily infected hosts. The variance to mean ratios of A. brevis in perch from Heming, Home, and Demarch Lakes showed that these parasite populations were overdispersed, and the distribution of each fitted the negative binomial. The use of variance to mean ratios or other statistics dealing with overdispersion in predicting loss or recruitment for all parasite systems were questioned.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1983	61	9					2104	2109		10.1139/z83-276	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z83-276													WOS:A1983RQ38200024

J	NIKOLAEV, SG				NIKOLAEV, SG			LIFE-CYCLE AND PRODUCTION OF CHIRONOMUS-PLUMOSUS (DIPTERA, CHIRONOMIDAE) IN THE SEVAN LAKE	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The majority of the C. plumosus population in the Sevan Lake presently has 1 generation/yr. The population inhabiting the upper littoral zone has 2 generations/yr. In 1947 also only part of the C. plumosus population in the Sevan Lake had 2 generations and most larvae developed throughout the year. In spite of changes in the lake thermal regime due to the decrease of its water level, the life cycle of the species remained the same while its phenology changed. The production of mixed and monocyclic C. plumosus populations was calculated for Sevan Lake. The seasonal production/biomass (P/B) coefficient of the Sevan populations is much lower than that of the polycyclic populations from the other water bodies. The P/B coefficient of the monocyclic population equals 2.3 and is close to those for other species of chironomids, confirming that the ratio of the production of 1 generation to its maximal biomass is a specific value characteristic of the Chironomidae as a whole.																			0044-5134						1981	60	5					711	717																WOS:A1981LR59800008

Population dynamics was characterized by distinct maxima of numbers for juveniles and adults. Sexual reproduction in Daphnia pulex tenebrosa began from the 2nd half of July; the number of generations and litters was less than in the Middle zone; fecundity was the same. Life span was 2-3 times less than in water bodies of moderate latitudes. Interannual changes in the population dynamics and structure were noted only for D. longiremis. No changes in the fecundity of this species were noted during the season. Crustacean growth in tundra water bodies was somewhat peculiar: they attained sexual maturity at a small size, and subsequent increase in size proceeded in parallel with the increase in fecundity. Positive correlations were noted between the population numbers and fecundity and between the body length and fecundity.																			0044-5134						1978	57	5					664	672																WOS:A1978FA29300004

GENERAL-COMMENTS	CAHIERS ORSTOM HYDROBIOLOGIE												The algal populations of Chad lake [Africa] which were investigated from 1971-1975 show 2 phases in the evolution of the phytoplankton. In the first, the lake still maintains on hydrologic unity (Tchad normal) and from algal density, the dominance of algal orders, the specific diversity and the constant milieu and from the importance of seasonal variations, a stable zonation with 4 ecological distinct zones may be defined. In the 2nd phase (petit Tchad), the northern part of the lake evolves to a saline pool facies, the archipelago of the southern part to a swamp facies and the open waters of the southern part to a river facies marked by the alternation of a flood nearly without plankton and of rich low water period. The stock of phytoplankton in the lake is about 45,000 ton for a Tchad normal phase. In the 2nd phase, the weight of algae is 4-5 times higher, although the flooded areas are smaller. Only the limnoplankton were examined in these estimations, and phytobenthos and periphyton were not discussed.																			0373-9422						1977	11	3					189	199																WOS:A1977FG13800001

Spawning started with the Chari flood and lasted for about 5 mo. (April-Aug.). From scale readings and length frequency distribution it was shown that growth stopped during the cool season. Maximum age was slightly over 1 yr, mortality occurring after spawning. Variations of food and feeding habits were found, according to hydrological events and biotopes. In the Chari river, M. acutidens fed on zooplankton during low water and on aquatic insects during the flood period. In the open waters of the southeastern part of lake Chad, the main part of the diet was terrestrial insects throughout the year.																			0373-9422						1977	11	4					255	268																WOS:A1977FH22800001

The observations suggest a change in the apparent thyroid activity of these species from those in earlier studies, and that the annual mortality of alewives is not directly related to an inability to produce sufficient thyroid hormone.																									1977	34	8					1242	1244		10.1139/f77-182	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f77-182													WOS:A1977DN47900019

The breeding waters were found to contain about 7.32 mgm/litre oxygen (at 30[degree]C) and 1.65 mgm/litre sodium chloride, with a pH about 7.5. 3. A study of the night activities and seasonal density of adults. It was noticed that females start their activities just after sunset (at 8 p.m.). The peak of their biting activity seems to be around 11 p.m. to midnight.

J							Jonglei Invest Team	THE PROBLEMS OF FISHERIES IN THE AREA AFFECTED BY THE EQUATORIAL NILE PROJECT	SUDAN NOTES AND RECORDS												The proposed regulation of the Upper White Nile will affect seasonal water levels differently at different parts of the river. Effects on fisheries potential are unpredictable owing to insufficient knowledge of the biology of the fish. Great seasonal variations in numbers occur but migrations cannot be accounted for by consideration of variations in food supply or in oxygen content of water. Shallow Lakes (e.g., L.No) do not serve as all-the-year-round reservoirs of fish as sometimes stated. Seasonal movements of Tilapia and Heterotis are different from those of Mormyrus and Citharinus. Oxygen contents in the river and lagoons show wide variations due in part to photosynthesis. Oxygen contents at the surface were commonly low especially in the main stream. Gill, trammel and seine nets were used with varying success and proved suitable for introduction into the region. Methods and costs of production of fish meal and dried fish under local conditions are described. Analysis of a sample of local fish meal showed good content of protein, oil and nicotinic acid but negligible vitamin A.																			0375-2984						1951	32	1					5	36																WOS:000205876700001

Flooding as a Method for Controlling Extensive Areas of Fly Breeding	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE NATIONS HEALTH												This report is concerned with fly control experiments along the shores of Laguna de Bay, a lake about 10 km. southeast of the City of Manila. During February, 1929, a sp. of alga multiplied enormously in the waters of this lake. As the water receded, great quantities of this plant were deposited over a large area extending along the western basin of Laguna de Bay, and certain portions of the bank of the Pasig River and its tributaries. During April and May, 1929, this decomposing material furnished an ideal breeding place for flies, which resulted in an unprecedented nuisance in the surrounding territory and even in Manila, some 10 km. away. Beginning on May 11, 1929, laboratory and field experiments were conducted for the purpose of finding an effective and practical method of destroying the immature stages in the algae. In experimental areas, spraying with chemical solutions, burning, stamping, and surface scraping proved impracticable and inefficient. However, the complete flooding with water of 850 sq. m. of breeding area drowned the great majority of the larvae and pupae. Shortly thereafter the rainy season commenced, and the flooding of the entire breeding area resulted in the complete control of the fly nuisance, thus confirming the results of experiment. It is suggested that a trial of artificial flooding, with certain necessary modifications, might be worthy of consideration in the control of fly breeding in extensive garbage and manure dumping grounds of such tropical cities as Manila.
