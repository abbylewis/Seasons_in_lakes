Females Exceed Males in Mercury Concentrations of Burbot Lota lota	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Examination of differences in contaminant concentrations between the sexes of fish, across several fish species, may show clues for important behavioral and physiological differences between the sexes. We determined whole-fish total mercury (Hg) concentrations of 25 male and 25 female adult burbot Lota lota captured in Lake Erie during summer 2011 and of 14 male and 18 female adult burbot captured in Great Slave Lake (Northwest Territories, Canada) during winter 2013. On average, females had 22 % greater Hg concentrations than males. This difference was probably not due to a greater feeding rate by females because results from previous studies based on polychlorinated biphenyl determinations of these same burbot indicated that males fed at a substantially greater rate than females. Based on our determinations of Hg concentrations in the gonads and somatic tissue of 5 ripe females and 5 ripe males, this difference was not attributable to changes in Hg concentration immediately after spawning due to the release of gametes. Furthermore, bioenergetics modeling results from previous studies indicated that growth dilution would not explain any portion of this observed difference in Hg concentrations between the sexes. We therefore conclude that this difference was most likely due to a substantially faster rate of Hg elimination by males compared with females. Male burbot exhibit among the greatest gonadosomatic indices (GSIs) of all male fishes, with their testes accounting for between 10 and 15 % of their body weight when the fish are in ripe condition. Androgens have been linked to enhanced Hg-elimination rates in other vertebrates. If androgen production is positively related to GSI, then male burbot would be expected to have among the greatest androgen levels of all fishes. Thus, we hypothesize that male burbot eliminate Hg from their bodies faster than most other male fishes and that this explains the greater Hg concentration in females compared with males.

Using image analysis software, geocoded Landsat TM data were used to create TNDVI maps based on the formula TNDVI = Sqrt[(band4 - band3/band4 + band3) + 0.5]. The images taken in the flood season were classified to produce a map depicting water and land. The images taken during springtime were processed and classified based on TNDVI. Composite images were created based on the time difference analysis, combining the flood season maps and spring vegetation maps to produce a map in which potential snail habitats were identified. When compared with ground survey data collected in the spring of 2000, the correspondence rate between potential snail habitats identified by image analysis of 1998-1999 Landsat TM data and ground survey data was over 90% in both regions. Results indicate that ecology based Landsat TM image analysis provides a new way to predict snail distribution under specific environmental conditions associated with the extent of the annual flood season, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Behaviour of anadromous brown trout (Salmo trutta) in a hydropower regulated freshwater system	MOVEMENT ECOLOGY												Many Norwegian rivers and lakes are regulated for hydropower, which affects freshwater ecosystems and anadromous fish species, such as sea trout (Salmo trutta). Lakes are an important feature of many anadromous river systems. However, there is limited knowledge on the importance of lakes as habitat for sea trout and how hydropower affects the behaviour of sea trout in lakes. To investigate this, we conducted an acoustic telemetry study. A total of 31 adult sea trout (532 +/- 93 mm total length) were captured by angling in river Aurlandselva, Norway, and tagged between July 20 and August 12, 2021. The tags were instrumented with accelerometer, temperature, and depth sensors, which provided information on the sea trout's presence and behaviour in lake Vassbygdevatnet. Our results indicate that there was a large prevalence of sea trout in the lake during the spawning migration, and that the sea trout were less active in the lake compared to the riverine habitats. An increase in activity of sea trout in the lake during autumn might indicate that sea trout spawn in the lake. However, the discharge from the high-head storage plant into the lake did not affect the depth use or activity of sea trout in the lake. Furthermore, the large prevalence of spawners in the lake during autumn will likely cause an underestimation of the size of the sea trout population in rivers with lakes during annual stock assessment. In conclusion, our results could not find evidence of a large impact of the discharge on the behaviour of sea trout in the lake.					; Dahlmo, Lotte/JXX-4351-2024	Nilsen, Cecilie Iden/0000-0002-8634-639X; Dahlmo, Lotte Svengard/0000-0001-5092-1316													2051-3933					OCT 14	2023	11	1							63	10.1186/s40462-023-00429-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40462-023-00429-7								37838718					WOS:001084763600001

This study examined the effects of elevated [CO2] and temperature on the availability of soil N and P in a paddy field in the Taihu Lake region, China. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was planted at two levels of atmospheric [CO2] (375 mu mol L-1 ambient; 575 mu mol L-1 elevated) and two temperature levels (ambient; ambient + 2 degrees C). The results were as follows: Compared to ambient, the interaction effects of elevated [CO2] and temperature significantly decreased soil NH4+-N contents by 20.3%, 20.6%, and 18.7% in the jointing, heading, and ripening stages (p < 0.05), respectively, while soil NO3--N content had no clear variation trend under different [CO2] and temperature conditions. Elevated [CO2] significantly increased soil available P content by 14.3% in the jointing stage, and elevated temperature significantly decreased soil available P content by 18.8% in the jointing stage. Compared with ambient [CO2], elevated [CO2] significantly increased wheat biomass in jointing and heading stages (p < 0.05). The positive effect of elevated [CO2] on wheat biomass was more significant at ambient temperature (AT) than at elevated temperature (ET) in the middle and late plant growth stages. These results explained that the availability of soil N and P varied under elevated [CO2] and temperature conditions. The application of N and P should be adjusted to meet the need of wheat plants after the wintering stage.

Modeling waterfowl damage to crops surrounding the Quill lakes in Saskatchewan	HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS												Waterfowl using the Central Flyway congregate on staging lakes before fall migration. The Quill lakes area of Saskatchewan Province, Canada, contains many staging lakes, which are surrounded by annual cropland. Crop losses to waterfowl occur every year, but the severity fluctuates greatly from year to year. We obtained historical crop compensation data, waterfowl-staging surveys, harvest chronology, and weather records from various agencies. Using GIS, we referenced all data types to potential claim-land parcels (0.65 km(2) for the damage model and 5 km(2) for the density model). We constructed empirical landscape-level logistic regression models, weighting factors influencing the magnitude of crop loss and density of waterfowl damage claims. Crop type, yield, abundance of waterfowl, and distance to feed stations (where bulk grain is provided to keep waterfowl off the nearby fields) were important to both the magnitude and density of damage. Oats were more susceptible to waterfowl damage than field peas, barley, or spring wheat. The end date of combining crops had a major influence on the magnitude of claims but had little effect on their density of claims. Magnitude was large in years when harvest was protracted and coincident with waterfowl staging. Distance to staging lakes was important to the density model, indicating that areas in close proximity to staging lakes experience chronic losses over time. In high-magnitude years, waterfowl damaged the more productive fields farther from staging lakes. Our results are consistent with the marginal value theorem and central place foraging: the relative benefits to foraging greater distances from a central place increases as resources are depleted near the central place.																			1934-4392	1936-8046				SPR	2015	9	1					87	100																WOS:000354473400008

We conducted 36 waterbird surveys over a year at Dianchi Lake, and found that it supports diverse habitats for breeders (16 species), migrants (27 species) and winter visitors (29 species). Among artificial wetland types, we found that mixed vegetation, low emerging plant and mudflat wetlands supported higher species richness and density than the other wetland types. Our findings had the following implications: management of Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau lakes should take the requirements of different waterbirds into consideration; and maintenance of low emerging plants and mixed vegetation, as well as mudflats, is crucial to accommodate the diverse habitat requirements of waterbirds.					; Rongxing, Wang/OBO-6972-2025	Wang, Rong Xing/0000-0001-5960-1650; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2016	36	6					1087	1095		10.1007/s13157-016-0823-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-016-0823-y													WOS:000389630100009
J	LYDERSEN, E				LYDERSEN, E			EFFECTS OF COLD AND WARM YEARS ON THE WATER CHEMISTRY AT THE BIRKENES CATCHMENT, NORWAY	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												During the last years, several scientists have been concerned with the consequences of global warming. In the Birkenes catchment, situated in southernmost Norway, several warm years have occurred during the last decade. In this climatic region, warm years primarily mean warmer winters with mean air temperatures close to or higher than 0 degrees C. Small temperature changes are therefore decisive for the quality of precipitation, i.e. whether the precipitation enters the catchments as snow or rain, which accordingly has large consequences for the residence time of water and its pathways through the catchment. Another important effect of higher winter-temperatures at Birkenes, is that stronger and more frequent seasalt episodes seem to occur. This may enhance the negative effects to aquatic organisms, because the most extreme concentrations of acute toxic Al-forms in streamwater are related to seasalt episodes during warm winters, when the precipitation comes as rain and thus leaves the catchment relatively fast through the uppermost soil layers. When seasalt-enriched water enters into the uppermost soil horizons, a large amount of sodium will be temporarily retained due to cation exchange processes, where sodium may substitute for H+ and cationic Al. At Birkenes, but also in similar acidified areas with high seasalt input, seasalt episodes are probably of greater importance for the periodic variations in streamwater H+ and Al-n+ than commonly recognized. Higher winter-temperatures may also change the timing of the highest streamwater fluxes of nitrate. This may have local consequences for the primary-production in the fjords, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Thus, global warming may have negative consequences for the surface water chemistry in near-coastal areas that also receive high amounts of acidifying atmospheric compounds, and may change the eutrophication status of many fjords.																			0049-6979					OCT	1995	84	3-4					217	232		10.1007/BF00475341	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00475341													WOS:A1995TD80700002
J	Salamova, A; Hites, RA				Salamova, Amina; Hites, Ronald A.			Dechlorane Plus in the Atmosphere and Precipitation near the Great Lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Air (vapor and particle) and precipitation samples were collected at five sites (two urban, one rural, and two remote) on the shores of the Great Lakes from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2009 as a part of the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network (IADN). The concentrations of the syn and anti isomers of Dechlorane Plus (DP), a highly chlorinated flame retardant, were measured in these samples. The highest concentrations of these compounds were generally observed at the rural site at Sturgeon Point, New York, which is located near DP's manufacturing facility in Niagara Falls, New York, and at the urban site at Cleveland, Ohio. A multiple linear regression model was applied to the concentrations of these compounds in the vapor phase, particle phase, precipitation, and for the three phases combined. This regression resulted in an overall (three phases combined) doubling time for the anti-DP isomer of 9.5 +/- 3.6 years, but for the syn- and total DP (syn + anti) concentrations, the overall regression was not statistically significant. These results suggest that there has been no significant change in the atmospheric concentrations of these compounds over the 2005-2009 time period. The effect of distance from the source in Niagara Falls was highly significant; for example, doubling the distance from Niagara Falls decreased the DP concentrations by about 30%. The effect of the number of people living and working within a 25-km radius of the sampling site (population density) was also highly significant but small; for example if this population doubled or halved, then the atmospheric DP concentrations would increase or decrease by only a few percent.

Contribution of bacterial cells to lacustrine organic matter based on amino sugars and D-amino acids	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Amino sugars (ASs), D-amino acids (D-AAs), and bacterial cell counts were measured in two Swiss lakes to study the contribution of bacterial cells to organic matter (OM) and the fate of ASs and bacterial amino biomarkers during OM degradation. Concentrations of individual ASs (glucosamine, galactosamine, muramic acid, and mannosamine) in the particulate and total OM pools were analyzed in water-column profiles of Lake Brienz (oligotrophic and oxic throughout the entire water column) and Lake Zug (eutrophic, stratified, and permanently anoxic below 170 m) in spring and in fall. Generally, carbon-normalized AS concentrations decreased with water depth, indicating the preferential decomposition of ASs. For Lake Brienz the relative loss of particulate ASs was higher than in Lake Zug, suggesting enhanced AS turnover in an oligotrophic environment. AS ratio changes in the water column revealed a replacement of plankton biomass with OM from heterotrophic microorganisms with increasing water depth. Similar to the ASs, highest carbon normalized D-AA concentrations were found in the upper water column with decreasing concentrations with depth and an increase close to the sediments. In Lake Zug, an increase in the percentage of D-AAs also showed the involvement of bacteria in OM degradation. Estimations of OM derived from bacterial cells using cell counts and the bacterial biomarkers muramic acid and D-AAs gave similar results. For Lake Brienz 0.2-14% of the organic carbon pool originated from bacterial cells, compared to only 0.1-5% in Lake Zug. Based on our estimates, muramic acid appeared primarily associated with bacterial biomass and not with refractory bacterial necromass. Our study underscores that bacteria are not only important drivers of OM degradation in lacustrine systems, they also represent a significant source of OM themselves, especially in oligotrophic lakes.

Meso-scale distributions of lake zooplankton reveal spatially and temporally varying trophic cascades	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The horizontal distribution of crustacean zooplankton is known to vary spatially in large lakes. Patterns in smaller dimictic lakes and variation through time (hourly and monthly) are less well established. Currents, chlorophyll and predators are all factors that vary through time, potentially affecting zooplankton distribution in stratified waters. Along an intermediate-length transect extending from the littoral area to the pelagic zone, we measured crustacean zooplankton size and horizontal position, as well as chlorophyll, currents and predators. We also assessed zooplankton vertical distribution patterns near each transect end. Horizontally, zooplankton were highly spatially structured in high summer, especially during daytime, when they preferred pelagic regions. A regular diel vertical migration pattern in early summer was replaced by an inverse one, suggesting a strong role for predation. Chlorophyll and zooplankton were inversely related, indicating a strong grazing interaction. The weakest signal was detected for currents. Results indicate that there can be large spatial fluctuations in zooplankton abundance apparently driven by predation. Furthermore, zooplankton distribution correlates inversely with chlorophyll only in the absence of a higher trophic level. We expect that plankton distribution in many small dimictic lakes will similarly be dominated by biotic factors, indicating that spatial variation should be taken into account when trophic interactions are considered.

A total of 36 (Karabuk) and 30 (Duzce) ostracod taxa were found from 148 out of 162 sites. All taxa are newly reported for Karabuk whereas 16 species are new for Duzce. In Duzce, total numbers of species and sites were higher at altitudes 0-400 m and lower at altitudes 401-1200 m a.s.l. than in the Karabuk region. However, they were equal at altitudes 1201-1400 m. Most species were found in troughs followed by streams, springs and ponds. Canonical Correspondence Analysis explains about 74 % of the relationships between species and environmental variables in both regions where water temperature was a significant (p < 0.01) predictor explaining the variance of ostracods assemblages. The most common five species (Candona neglecta, Heterocypris incongruens, H. salina, Ilyocypris bradyi, Psychrodromus olivaceus) with 4534 individuals comprise more than 67% of the total abundance of all living ostracod species in both regions. Heterocypris incongruens showed the highest values of ecological optimum and tolerance for electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen. Based on the occurrence patterns, UPGMA showed five clustering associations among the species. Results suggest that species habitat preferences may depend both on species ecological tolerance and optimum values and on the suitability of conditions in each of the habitat types sampled.					; YILMAZ, Sinem/AAG-8136-2021; KÜLKÖYLÜOĞLU, OKAN/A-6441-2018	Yavuzatmaca, Mehmet/0000-0002-0398-6763; 													1863-9135					APR	2017	190	1					63	86		10.1127/fal/2017/0872	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2017/0872													WOS:000403976900005

The catchments varied with respect to underlying geology, soil type and land cover. Average concentrations of SRP were in the range 0.5-11.2 mu g P l(-1), and estimated loads ranged from 0.01 to 0.14 kg P ha(-1) a(-1). The higher concentrations and loads were associated with catchments containing improved pasture. Mean streamwater concentrations of nitrate varied from 55 to 660 mu g N l(-1), while loads were in the range 0.8-9.6 kg N ha(-1) a(-1); no general dependence on catchment properties was discerned. Concentrations of SRSi were similar in all the streams (0.8-2 mg Si l(-1)), and annual loads were in the range 10-26 kg Si ha(-1) a(-1). Loads of all three nutrients were greatest during the winter, because of higher discharges, but in some catchments containing improved pasture, considerable transport of P also took place during the summer. Concentrations of nitrate in streams draining unimproved moorland catchments are approximately twice those reported for samples taken from similar streams in 1973 and 1974, possibly because of increased atmospheric deposition of inorganic nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate). Concentrations of SRP in such streams were similar to these reported for the earlier samples. Comparisons of stream loads of SRP and nitrate with estimated inputs suggest that catchment soils retain substantial amounts of these nutrients. Implications for surface water eutrophication of changes in P retention by soils are discussed.

Here, we used a synergic map-ping framework to characterize summer floods in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Plain and the effects on croplands in 2020, from both flood extent and intensity perspectives. We found that the total flood extent was 4936 km(2) from July to August, and for flood intensity, 1658, 1382, and 1896 km(2) of areas experienced triple, double, and single floods. A total of 2282 km(2) croplands (46% of the flooded area) were inundated mainly from Poyang and Dongting Lake Basins, containing a high ratio of moderate damage croplands (47%). The newly increased flooding extent in 2020 was 29% larger than the maximum ever-flooded extent in 2015-2019.

River discharges to the reservoir were halved, yet the rivers still incised the tops of deltas left exposed along the rim of the reservoir by the lake-level fall. Erosion of the deltas enriched the rivers in sediment such that upon entering the reservoir they discharged plunging subaqueous gravity flows, one of which was imaged acoustically. Repeat bathymetric surveys of the reservoir show that the gravity flows overtopped rockfalls and formed small subaqueous fans, locally raising sediment accumulation rates 10-100-fold. The timing of deep-basin deposition differed regionally across the reservoir with respect to lake-level change. Total mass of sediment transferred from the lake perimeter to its bottom equates to similar to 22 yr of river input.

J	KEAST, A				KEAST, A			FEEDING OF SOME GREAT LAKES FISHES AT LOW TEMPERATURES	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Field studies on low temperature feeding in freshwater fishes were carried out as follows: Fish Lake, near Picton, Ontario, Jan.-March 1966 and 1967, 1200 fish netted from under the ice at a temperature of 4 C; Little Cataraqui Creek near Collins Bay, April 1966, groups of fish (total, 544 individuals) netted at intervals of several days as the water temperature rose from 6.8 to 11 C; Upper Jones Creek, near Mallorytown, 2 extensive collections (total, 1005 individuals) made between April 27 and 30, 1966 (at a water temperature of 8 C), and May 15 and 17 (15 C). Some members of all 6 sp. in Fish Lake contained food but the percentage varied from 50% in Umbra limi down to 10% in Fundulus diaphanus. Hence feeding was erratic. Within species the smaller individuals invariably contained more food (0.005-0.02 g of alimentary contents per gram body weight) than larger fish (0.002-0.005). The same was true of smaller, as compared with larger, bodied species, with the exception of F. diaphanus. After the thaw in Little Cataraqui Creek active feeding commenced at different temperatures in the various species: it was already under way at 6.5 C (when the study started) in Ictalurus nebulosus and Pomoxis nigromaculatus, but did not start in Lepomis gibbbosus and Ambloplites rupestris until the water temperature reached 8.5 C. Prior to this the stomachs of species were shrunken, mucous-filled, and drawn far forward in the body cavity. Few Perca flavescens, active winter feeders, fed in April, immediately prior to spawning. In most of the Jones Creek fishes there was a marked increase in weight of alimentary contents (gram per gram body weight) between 8 and 15 C. Exceptions were the larger Semotilus atromaculatus, which were spawning, and U. limi and Eucalia inconstans, which were sampled before their peak daily feeding times. To the differences in weights of alimentary contents at 8 and 15 C must be added acclerated digestion rates at 15 C. In all the waterways studied the fish consumed a much smaller range of prey items at low temperatures than at higher ones. This applied in midwinter, compared with summer, in Fish Lake, and in April and Oct., compared with summer, in Jones Creek. A few foods, e .g. chironomid larvae and Cladocera, were especially prominent in the diet at low temperatures, and species food specializations were suppressed. There was probably not, however, any increase in interspecific competition at temperatures approaching zero, because of the relatively low metabolic requirements of the fish.																									1968	25	6					1199	+		10.1139/f68-105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f68-105													WOS:A1968B308800009

The species-area relationship, which is closely linked with the more general species-energy theory, is one of the most well-known patterns in geographical ecology, but the underlying causes remain contentious. The more individuals hypothesis (MIH) articulates a causal path from resource availability to population abundance to species richness. The MIH has been tested with a range of taxa including plants, invertebrates and land birds but never with migratory waterbirds. 2. Using multiyear simultaneous survey data of wintering waterbirds in 10 lakes at Poyang Lake, China, and remotely sensed habitat condition measurements, we applied structural equation modelling (SEM) to test three causal paths: (A) good habitat conditions (e.g. habitat availability and heterogeneity) attract more species (high richness); (B) habitat conditions promote abundance (more individuals); and (C) habitat conditions promote abundance, which in turn increases richness. 3. We also modelled responses of species richness and abundance to habitat conditions using generalised additive mixed modelling (GAMM) to assess their co-variation. 4. While our analysis confirmed the first two paths, we found no support for the third, which is the central postulate of the MIH. In addition, in agreement with GAMM, SEM indicated that species richness was more closely related to habitat quality than to abundance. Our findings suggest that wintering waterbird species richness and abundance are two intrinsic community indices that covary with environmental variables.					; Guangchun, Lei/ABC-8081-2021	Saintilan, Neil/0000-0001-9226-2005; WEN, LI/0000-0003-3783-3826													0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2016	61	2					206	218		10.1111/fwb.12694	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12694													WOS:000368034500003

As an extension of Ricker''s concept, it has been shown that density-dependent relationships in the spawning period are of paramount significance in nerka''s abundance dynamics. Moreover, it should be stressed that spawner''s low density ensures abundant mature recruitment, whereas their high density causes a low progeny return. Optimal abundance of spawners is suggested to be established for a given river, and their passage to the spawning grounds is to be regulated to prevent their overpopulation.																			0134-3475						1990		4					3	11																WOS:A1990EC96500001

Influence of meteorological conditions on the formation of ice regime of the Lake Onega	LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW												The formation of the ice regime on large lakes is mostly determined by the complex meteorological processes occurring over the water area. Previous studies of the air temperature influence on the ice regime formation on the Lake Onega were based on observational data on the state of the ice cover in the Petrozavodsk Bay, as well as the materials of the rare missions of aerial reconnaissance performed in the second half of the XX century. So, it was necessary to revise the previously established dependencies using the present-day satellite data for 2000-2018, and to determine the nature of influence of other meteorological factors, among which a thickness of the snow cover on the Lake area. The authors obtained regularities of changes in the characteristic dates (complete freeze-up - +/- 5 days/degrees C and final clearing of ice - +/- 3 days/degrees C) of the ice regime on the Lake Onega, depending on changes in the average air temperature that preceded these dates (autumn and spring) for the period of two months. The regression equations to calculate these dates on the basis of the previous three - and four-month periods from the data of 2000-2018 are also given. Relative to the above mentioned results for the previous period, a certain shift by a month ahead of two- and three- period exerting influence on the date of the complete freeze-up is noted. Dependencies to calculate the cumulative daily temperatures for the period of the ice regime formation (the beginning of the formation of ice phenomena, complete freeze-up phase, the beginning of the breakup phase, clearing of the ice) were also deduced. Together with the data on the expected air temperature over the Lake these dates provide a potential possibility to estimate (predict) the characteristic dates of the ice regime. The significant influence of the average snow cover thickness on the process of destruction of the ice cover was shown, and the nature of the statistical relationship (along with the air temperature) was also determined.

Survival and growth responses of juvenile salmonines stocked in eastern Lake Ontario tributaries	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												To evaluate the species-specific and stream-specific suitability of juvenile salmonine habitat in the southern Lake Ontario watershed, we studied the effects of multiple environmental gradients on the first-summer apparent survival and growth of various combinations of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, and coho salmon O. kisutch stocked in tributaries. Costocking of either Oncorhynchus species had no detectable effect on the apparent survival or change in cohort biomass of Atlantic salmon, but their growth rates were reduced slightly when they were stocked with rainbow trout. Generally, Atlantic salmon outperformed their putative competitors. Summer temperatures were near the physiological optimum for Atlantic salmon but may have limited the success of rainbow trout and especially coho salmon. Total salmonine biomass was maximized at sites in which only Atlantic salmon were planted. Apparent survival and biomass elaboration of Atlantic salmon varied inversely with stream size, temperature, and the abundance of wild salmonines and piscivores, whereas growth rate responded positively to moderate increases in summer temperature, agricultural development, and nutrient enrichment. These regional and species-specific differences in stocked salmonine success may, in part, be explained by variations in temperature, geomorphology, and anthropogenic influences. We recommend that the feasibility of restoring Atlantic salmon continues to be evaluated, especially in those tributaries considered to be of marginal quality for other salmonines.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	2007	136	1					56	71		10.1577/T06-127.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T06-127.1													WOS:000244312900006

However, limited knowledge is available on the spatial-temporal variation and driving factors in OC burial of lake sediment during the Holocene. Based on the environmental proxies, grain-size end-member modelling analysis (EMMA) and wavelet transform of the Fuxian Lake sediments, the key factors of the organic carbon accumulation rate (OCAR) and the driving mechanism of climate in the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) region have been discussed during the Holocene. The results show that there was significant correlation between the environmental proxies and the OCAR, and 1000-a, 500-a and 100-a quasi-periodic signals were present in the environment proxies. The ISM intensified with an increase in low-latitude solar insolation (LSI) during the earlyto mid-Holocene. It brought the warm-humid climate, the increased biological productivity and the OC input of the lake catchment. Therefore, climate change was the primary influencing factor on OCAR at this stage. In the late-Holocene, the weakening LSI and frequent human activities of the Fuxian Lake catchment caused a decrease in vegetation coverage and an increase in soil erosion, and it indicated that the intense human activities and climate change had to work together to affect the OCAR of the lake catchment. The results would provide some references for predicting the carbon sequestration potential of a lake under the influence of climate change and human activities, and it can also provide theory guidance for controlling carbon storage of lake ecosystem under global warming.

J	O'Connell, M; Huang, CC; Eicher, U				O'Connell, M; Huang, CC; Eicher, U			Multidisciplinary investigations, including stable-isotope studies, of thick late-glacial sediments from Tory Hill, Co. Limerick, western Ireland	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Multidisciplinary investigations of a 10-m-long, marl-rich, Late-glacial core from Tory Hill, Co. Limerick, have enabled environmental change, including estimates of summer temperature (ST), to be reconstructed for the Late-glacial period, The sequence opens with fine, partially laminated silt/clay that has varve-like microstructure. A cold steppic environment from the final phase of the pleniglacial is represented here. It is estimated to span almost 2000 years (ca, 16.9-15 cal. ka B.P; ca. 14.6-12.7 ka B.P.). Substantial development of woody vegetation is limited to the early part of the Late-glacial interstadial (cf. Bolling). This consists mainly of juniper and birch, including tree birch (Betula pubescens), as well as herb-dominated communities. These developments in vegetation and also the evidence from a variety of other proxies, including stable-isotope records (delta(18)O and delta(13)C), show that the thermal maximum was achieved early in the interstadial bur ST probably did not exceeded 14 degrees C. Within this relatively warm period, the various biological, chemical and physical proxies suggest at least one substantial but short-lived climatic oscillation, The later part of the Bolling/Allerod interstadial (after ca. 14 cal. ka B.P.; ca. 12 ka B.P.) began with a considerable and more or less sustained fall in temperature. The low temperature regime was maintained until immediately before the Younger Dryas when a modest but distinct amelioration is recorded by all proxies. This feature, referred to as a 'pre-Younger Dryas warming' (pYDw) and which is seen in land, ocean and Greenland ice-core records from the northeast Atlantic region, has not been previously highlighted in the literature. The Younger Dryas stadial, when ST may have fallen to ca. 6 degrees C, has a distinctive pollen assemblage characterised mainly by Gramineae, Thalictrum and Artemisia, but, for reasons not readily explainable, the early part of the stadial is not well defined in the stable-isotope record. As in most records from the northeast Atlantic region, the transition to the Holocene is sharp and clearly recorded. The importance of Juniperus in the Irish Late-glacial record, as an indicator of temperature change, is discussed and also the possible role played by Ephedra and Secale species at Tory Hill. The apparent absence of temperature gradients within Ireland is commented on, and the evidence for much lower ST in Ireland compared with Great Britain is discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

A new framework for surface FT-cycle retrievals using L-band microwave radiometry based on a deep convolutional autoencoder neural network is presented. This framework defines the landscape FT-cycle retrieval as a time-series anomaly detection problem, considering the frozen states as normal and the thawed states as anomalies. The autoencoder retrieves the FT-cycle probabilistically through supervised reconstruction of the brightness temperature (TB) time series using a contrastive loss function that minimizes (maximizes) the reconstruction error for the peak winter (summer). Using the data provided by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, it is demonstrated that the framework learns to isolate the landscape FT states over different land surface types with varying complexities related to the radiometric characteristics of snow cover, lake-ice phenology, and vegetation canopy. The consistency of the retrievals is assessed over Alaska using in situ observations, demonstrating an 11% improvement in accuracy and reduced uncertainties compared to traditional methods that rely on thresholding the normalized polarization ratio (NPR).

Despite marked differences in overt goiter frequency in sexually mature adult salmon collected from Lakes Ontario (43.7%), Erie (93.5%), or Michigan (0%), serum thyroid hormone levels and thyroid histology were similar in fish from the 3 lakes. Two gonadotrop-like basophil cells, globular and vacuolar, were found in the pituitary, particularly in sexually maturing and mature adults and jacks. Whereas in salmon from Lakes Ontario or Michigan the globular cells were vacuolated, in Lake Erie salmon they were not; this observation may be correlated with the absence of obvious secondary sexual characteristics in Lake Erie salmon. Serum free fatty acids, serum triglycerides and cholesterol concentrations in Lake Ontario salmon fell progressively from the condition in fish collected from the Lake in May 1978 to that of fish collected during their potamodrous migration in Nov. 1978 and Jan. 1979.																				1095-8649					1980	16	5					539	562		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1980.tb03732.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1980.tb03732.x													WOS:A1980KJ76200007

Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that short rods about 1.2-2 mu m in diameter predominated in the natural microbial community. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with chemical analysis revealed a characteristic P peak in the bacteria-like mineral particles, which suggests their biogenic origin. Most strains of the thermophilic microorganisms were gram-positive spore-forming rods and can be assigned to the genus Bacillus. Assays for potential enzyme activity demonstrated that most of the strains tested were active at high temperature.

J	Woolway, RI; Simpson, JH				Woolway, R. Iestyn; Simpson, John H.			Energy input and dissipation in a temperate lake during the spring transition	OCEAN DYNAMICS												ADCP and temperature chain measurements have been used to estimate the rate of energy input by wind stress to the water surface in the south basin of Windermere. The energy input from the atmosphere was found to increase markedly as the lake stratified in spring. The efficiency of energy transfer (Eff), defined as the ratio of the rate of working in near-surface waters (RW) to that above the lake surface (P (10)), increased from similar to 0.0013 in vertically homogenous conditions to similar to 0.0064 in the first 40 days of the stratified regime. A maximum value of Eff similar to 0.01 was observed when, with increasing stratification, the first mode internal seiche period decreased to match the diurnal wind period of 24 h. The increase in energy input, following the onset of stratification was reflected in enhancement of the mean depth-varying kinetic energy without a corresponding increase in wind forcing. Parallel estimates of energy dissipation in the bottom boundary layer, based on determination of the structure function show that it accounts for similar to 15% of RW in stratified conditions. The evolution of stratification in the lake conforms to a heating stirring model which indicates that mixing accounts for similar to 21% of RW. Taken together, these estimates of key energetic parameters point the way to the development of full energy budgets for lakes and shallow seas.

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from dead plant material and surface soil leaches into water bodies when snow melts. In our study, water samples from nine sampling sites along the Heilongjiang watershed were collected in February and June 2014 during which period snowmelt occurred. The goal of this study was to characterize changes in DOM and bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) associated with snowmelt, the effects of DOM, environmental and geographical factors on the distribution of BCC and interactions of aquatic bacterioplankton populations with different sources of DOM in the Heilongjiang watershed. BCC was measured by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DOM was measured by excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. Bacterioplankton exhibited a distinct seasonal change in community composition due to snowmelt at all sampling points except for EG. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that BCC was more closely related to DOM (Components 1 and 4, dissolved organic carbon, biochemical oxygen demand and chlorophyll a) and environmental factors (water temperature and nitrate nitrogen) than geographical factors. Furthermore, DOM had a greater impact on BCC than environmental factors (29.80 vs. 15.90% of the variation). Overall, spring snowmelt played an important role in altering the quality and quantity of DOM and BCC in the Heilongjiang watershed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ghesini, S; Müller, G; Marino, M				Ghesini, Silvia; Mueller, Gabi; Marino, Mario			First record of the subterranean termite Reticulitermes grassei in Switzerland	BULLETIN OF INSECTOLOGY												Switzerland has no native termite species. Historically, drywood termites have been introduced on six occasions, and subterranean termites were introduced on two occasions (Reticulitermes lucifugus and an undetermined Reticulitermes species). Only one of these introductions resulted in establishment; however it was subsequently eradicated. A new subterranean termite infestation was found in 2018, in the winter garden of a house on the lake of Zurich (northeastern Switzerland). Mitochondrial DNA analysis (cytochrome oxidase subunit II and 16S ribosomal RNA genes) showed that these termites belong to the Franco-Iberian species Reticulitermes grassei, and are genetically similar to populations from southern Spain. Termites were probably introduced with olive and palm trees that were planted in the affected property and in a neighbouring one. Damage was limited to the wooden floor and walls of the winter garden. The infestation was initially treated with diatomaceous earth followed by the insect growth regulator diflubenzuron. The infestation is nearing eradication.																			1721-8861					JUN	2020	73	1					149	151																WOS:000525828400017

Watershed- and reach-scale drivers of phosphorus retention and release by streambed sediment in a western Lake Erie watershed during summer	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Reducing phosphorus (P) concentrations in aquatic ecosystems, is necessary to improve water quality and reduce the occurrence of harmful cyanobacterial algal blooms. Managing P reduction requires information on the role rivers play in P transport from land to downstream water bodies, but we have a poor understanding of when and where river systems are P sources or sinks. During the summers of 2019 and 2021, we sampled streambed sediment at 78 sites throughout the Maumee River network (a major source of P loads to Lake Erie) focusing on the zero equilibrium P concentration (EPC0), the soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration at which sediment neither sorbs nor desorbs P. We used structural equation modeling to identify direct and indirect drivers of EPC0. Stream sediment was a P sink at 40 % and 67 % of sites in 2019 and 2021, respectively. During both years, spatial variation in EPC0 was shaped by stream water SRP concentrations, sediment P saturation, and sediment physicochemical characteristics. In turn, SRP concentrations and sediment P saturation (PSR) were influenced by agricultural land use and stream size. Effect of stream size differed among years with stream size having a greater effect on SRP in 2019 and on PSR in 2021. Streambed sediment is currently a net P sink across the sites sampled in the Maumee River network during summer, but sediment at these locations, especially sites in headwater streams, may become a P source if stream water SRP concentrations decrease. Our results improve the understanding of watershed- and reach-scale controls on EPC0 but also indicate the need for further research on how changes in SRP concentration as a result of conservation management implementation influences the role of streambed sediment in P transport to Lake Erie.					; Hood, James/AFL-8629-2022	Bartsch, Lynn/0000-0002-1483-4845; Perner, Patrik/0000-0002-6142-518X; Kreiling, Rebecca/0000-0002-9295-4156; Johnson, Laura/0000-0002-2432-2624; Gierke, Kenna/0000-0002-8358-7825; Manning, Nathan/0000-0003-0394-9652													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAR 10	2023	863								160804	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160804	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.160804		JAN 2023						36567200					WOS:000923691100001

Oscillations in summer and winter months throughout the 2005-2016 period were assessed using multispectral images from Landsat-5, -7, and -8, and changes in the reservoirs were characterized and correlated against local climate data of each reservoir. For quantitative comparisons of the time-series measurements, a robust density slicing approach was employed to classify the range of values of the raster cells in the near-infrared band of Landsat images for each lake into three desired classes (deep water, shallow water, and dry area) based on the natural breaks inherent in the dataset. Statistical analysis shows that the overall accuracy of the classification is about 94%, which demonstrates the efficiency of the density slicer to accurately estimate surface water area changes from an individual Landsat band. Shrinkage in the surface water area over the study period reveals the concrete impact that the drought along with other factors have on the 10 selected lakes. The San Angelo lakes located in west central Texas experienced a nearly consistent pattern of change during most of the study period; whereas the Dallas lakes in northeast Texas followed the oscillating pattern of drought and correlated closely to the local conditions. Shockingly, the extreme drought caused complete vanishing of several lakes, and consequently Texas had to remove them from its recreational plans. Our new findings can certainly help with the water resource management in Texas and our study approach can be adapted for monitoring lake oscillations in other areas across the world. This geospatial study demonstrates the societal benefits from incorporating remote sensing and GIS in investigating geo-environmental problems associated with severe climate changes.																			1548-1603	1943-7226				AUG 18	2019	56	6					894	910		10.1080/15481603.2019.1582154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2019.1582154		MAR 2019											WOS:000467109800001
J	Theriot, EC; Fritz, SC; Gresswell, RE				Theriot, EC; Fritz, SC; Gresswell, RE			Long-term limnological data from the larger lakes of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Long-term Limnological data from the four largest lakes in Yellowstone National Park (Yellowstone, Lewis, Shoshone, Heart) are used to characterize their limnology and patterns of temporal and spatial variability. Heart Lake has distinctively high concentrations of dissolved materials, apparently reflecting high thermal inputs. Shoshone and Lewis lakes have the highest total SiO2 concentrations (averaging over 23.5 mg L-1), apparently as a result of the rhyolitic drainage basins. Within Yellowstone Lake spatial variability is low and ephemeral for most measured variables, except that the Southeast Arm has lower average Na concentrations. Seasonal variation is evident for Secchi transparency, pH, and total-SiO2 and probably reflects seasonal changes in phytoplankton biomass and productivity. Total dissolved solids (TDS) and total-SiO2 generally show a gradual decline from the mid-1970s through mid-1980s, followed by a sharp increase. Ratios of Kjeldahl-N to total-PO4 (KN:TP) suggest that the lakes, especially Shoshone, are often nitrogen limited. Kjeldahl-N is positively correlated with winter precipitation, but TP and total-SiO2 are counterintuitively negatively correlated with precipitation. We speculate that increased winter precipitation, rather than watershed fires, increases N-loading which, in turn, leads to increased demand for TP and total SiO2.

J	Morgenstern, T				Morgenstern, Tamara			Flagler's Whitehall: Beaux-Arts Grandeur in the American Tropics	ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY												In a second career begun in his retirement, Henry Morrison Flagler (1830-1913), the cofounder of Standard Oil and one of the wealthiest citizens in the United States, embarked on the development of the tropical wilderness of Florida. Starting in St Augustine, he built a network of luxury hotels and railroads that became the infrastructure for modern Florida. Creating a counterpart to the premier summer resort of Newport, Rhode Island, Flagler transformed Palm Beach, an undeveloped barrier island, into a winter playground for the new American aristocracy, starting with the Georgian-style Royal Poinciana Hotel. It was Whitehall, however, the mansion built for Flagler in 1900-02 as a wedding gift to his third wife, Mary Lily Kenan, that became the resort community's monumental showplace. Designed by the New York firm of Carrere & Hastings in the Renaissance-derived classicism of the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, the stately white palace fronting Lake Worth embodied Flagler's cultural aspirations as a patron of the arts. As the first major client of Carrere & Hastings, Flagler was critical in launching the career of one of the most prominent architectural firms of the Gilded Age. This article examines Whitehall in the context of Flagler's business practices and personal goals, consistent with Andrew Carnegie's 'Gospel of Wealth'. Architectural opulence not only boosted Flagler's mercantile purposes, but also reflected a belief, nurtured by his relationship with Carrere & Hastings and other close associates, about the importance of classical architecture and the arts in the development of society.																			0066-622X	2059-5670					2021	64						113	136		10.1017/arh.2021.6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/arh.2021.6													WOS:000721322400010

One example is how cabbeling, the generation of dense water by mixing water masses on different sides of the temperature of maximum density (T-md), affects the vertical transport. Using high resolution numerical simulations of the development of a stratified parallel shear flow, we show that when the temperature stratification passes through T-md, cabbeling modifies the three-dimensional aspects of the instability with the net effect of forming an emergent, stable stratification after a brief period of strong mixing. This stratification effectively separates the quiescent upper layer from the turbulent one below, thereby limiting transport and mixing between them. We propose a simple model for the vertical fluid flux during the mixing regime, and discuss a potential mechanism responsible for the emergent stratification as well as its sensitivity to the bulk Richardson number.

The aim of this study was to determine chemical (organic carbon, total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations) and biological (nanoflagellates, ciliates, phytoplankton, rotifers, crustaceans) parameters under the ice cover in three eutrophic lakes (Masurian Lake District, Poland), differing in their morphometry and fisheries management. All the studied groups of organisms showed high variability over a short time. Taxonomic composition of planktonic communities, except for rotifers and phytoplankton, was similar in all lakes. Nanoflagellates were dominated by autotrophic forms, while ciliates were primarily composed of small oligotrichs and prostomatids. Nano-sized diatoms and mixotrophic cryptophytes were the most important components of phytoplankton and they formed an under-ice bloom in one lake only. Rotifers were mainly represented by Keratella cochlearis, Polyarthra dolichoptera and Asplanchna priodonta. Among crustaceans, copepods clearly dominated over cladocerans. Our research suggests that winter was a very dynamic period. In the under-ice conditions, pelagic organisms were strongly dependent on each other. The shallow lake and the deeper, small lake differed significantly in nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations, ciliate and phytoplankton biomass and the ratio of autotrophic to heterotrophic biomass. These results suggest that morphometric parameters may affect planktonic organisms during the ice-covered period.					; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/I-3874-2018; Kapusta, Andrzej/GVS-3584-2022; Kalinowska, Krystyna/S-8299-2018; Stawecki, Konrad/AAP-2235-2021	Stawecki, Konrad/0000-0002-8904-8996; Kapusta, Andrzej/0000-0001-8979-5468; Napiorkowska-Krzebietke, Agnieszka/0000-0001-8361-0290; Bogacka-Kapusta, Elzbieta/0000-0002-6146-5229; Hutorowicz, Joanna/0000-0003-1263-5073; Kalinowska, Krystyna/0000-0002-5099-5371; Chybowski, Lucjan/0000-0001-6025-4991; 													1730-413X	1897-3191				SEP	2017	46	3					271	282		10.1515/ohs-2017-0029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/ohs-2017-0029													WOS:000412129200003

Pena Blanca Lake received at least 750 g/m2 of oak litter during the summer of 1959. About 329 kg cal/m2 were delivered to the lake in oak litter extracts of which 26% were probably from carbohydrates, 54% from phenolic compounds, and 20% from unidentified compounds. Oak leaf extracts were experimentally effective as an energy source for microorganisms used as food by filter-feeding organisms (Xenopus laevis) and snails. Efficiency of the extract-microorgan-isms-Xenopus and snail food chain was 3.28%. Based on an estimated ecological efficiency of 0.56% for the food chain: litter extract-micro-organisms-zooplankton-young Micropterus salmoides, Micropterus biomass production may have increased 0.4 g/m2 by organic compon-ents in oak litter extracts contributed to Pena Blanca Lake in 1959. This increase represents 16.7% of the average annual fish harvest for 1959, 1960, and 1961.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1968	13	2					343	+		10.4319/lo.1968.13.2.0343	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1968.13.2.0343													WOS:A1968B515400014
J	Erwin, SO; Schmidt, JC; Nelson, NC				Erwin, Susannah O.; Schmidt, John C.; Nelson, Nicholas C.			Downstream effects of impounding a natural lake: the Snake River downstream from Jackson Lake Dam, Wyoming, USA	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												A sediment mass balance constructed for a 16-km reach of the Snake River downstream from Jackson Lake Dam (JLD) indicates that river regulation has reduced the magnitude of sediment mass balance deficit that would naturally exist in the absence of the dam. The sediment budget was constructed from calibrated bed load transport relations, which were used to model sediment flux into and through the study reach. Calibration of the transport relations was based on bed load transport data collected over a wide range of flows on the Snake River and its two major tributaries within the study area in 2006 and 2007. Comparison of actual flows with unregulated flows for the period since 1957 shows that operations of JLD have reduced annual peak flows and increased late summer flows. Painted tracer stones placed at five locations during the 2005 spring flood demonstrate that despite the reduction in flood magnitudes, common floods are capable of mobilizing the bed material. The sediment mass balance demonstrates that more sediment exits the study reach than is being supplied by tributaries. However, the volume of sediment exported using estimated unregulated hydrology indicates that the magnitude of the deficit would be greater in the absence of JLD. Calculations suggest that the Snake River was not in equilibrium before construction of JLD, but was naturally in sediment deficit. The conclusion that impoundment lessened a natural sediment deficit condition rather than causing sediment surplus could not have been predicted in the absence of sediment transport data, and highlights the value of transport data and calculation of sediment mass balance in informing dam operations.

The biomass of the flesh of C. japonica comprised 97% of the total biomass of the macrozoobenthos in summer. Total biomass of C. japonica in the lake was estimated 30986 t fresh wt. The concentration of suspended solids immediately above the lake bottom, where C. japonica filters the water, was 1.5 to 4 times higher than that in the surface water. In laboratory experiments, the filtration rate was 5.0 litres g dry flesh wt-1h-1, the excretion rates of ammonia and of feces and pseudofeces of C. japonica were 200 .times. 10-6 g N g dry flesh wt-1h-1 and 33.4 mg dry wt g dry flesh wt-1h-1, respectively at 27.degree.

S.; Jain, Vineet			Possible zonal asymmetry of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall after ∼5 ka BP as revealed by palaeo-salinity in the eastern Arabian Sea	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Data from a high-resolution sediment core off Goa in the eastern Arabian Sea (EAS) show that the Holocene surface-salinity variation off Goa contains four alternating high- and low-salinity events. These events are in contrast with the Bay-of-Bengal (BoB) surface-salinity variation after 5 ka BP, suggesting an asymmetry in the rainfall associated with the Indian summer monsoon over the eastern and western parts of the Indian subcontinent and its surrounding seas. This zonal asymmetry in rainfall is also seen in modern rainfall data. The historical rainfall over the Indian subcontinent indicates that the Northwest India and West Peninsular India and their rainfall subdivisions, which feed freshwater to the EAS, are mutually strongly correlated, but they are not correlated with Northeast India and North Central India and their subdivisions, which feed freshwater to the BoB. This mid-Holocene zonal asymmetry in rainfall over the eastern and western parts of the subcontinent appears to have sustained through to modern times. The Holocene salinity events off Goa are closely comparable to the evolution of Harappan Civilization in the Indus Valley, suggesting that the Holocene salinity variation in the EAS is connected to, and is a reliable indicator of, rainfall over the Harappan Civilization Region.																			2347-4327	0973-774X				JUL 20	2022	131	3							161	10.1007/s12040-022-01897-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-022-01897-y													WOS:000828249500001

Currently, the Metropolitan Wastewater Treatment Plant is the largest point source of phosphorus above the lake. In this study, the Environmental Protection Agency's EUTRO5 model was used to evaluate phosphorus control alternatives at the Metro Plant, using data from 1988, 1990, and 1991. Model results indicate that under summer low-flow conditions, the most optimistic improvement in Lake Pepin water quality would be to reduce the average chlorophyll a levels from 60 mu g/L to 50 mu g/L, still well above the goal of 30 mu g/L.

J	Nemoto, F; Fukuhara, H				Nemoto, Fumiko; Fukuhara, Haruo			The antagonistic relationship between chlorophyll a concentrations and the growth areas of Trapa during summer in a shallow eutrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY												The relationship between concentrations of chlorophyll a in an open water area and growing areas of the macrophytes Trapa spp. and Nelumbo nucifera was investigated to clarify the role of macrophytes in phytoplankton growth in summer in a eutrophic shallow sand lake, Lake Honsagata, Japan. The chlorophyll a concentrations formed peaks in June 2007 and July 2008 in summer with cyanobacterial blooms composed of mainly Microcystis, Anabaena, Phormidium, and Oscillatoria, which decreased toward August and were maintained at different annual levels. The decline of blooms in August was caused by the rapid growth of macrophytes. The composition of phytoplankton and the level of bloom development in summertime differed characteristically from year to year. Also the total vegetation area of N. nucifera and Trapa spp. showed annually marked changes. A significant negative correlation between the concentrations of chlorophyll a and the growth areas of Trapa spp. in August was detected, indicating that the floating-leaved plants, Trapa spp., produced irregular, clear and turbid water states in this shallow eutrophicated lake. These antagonistic relations are explained based on a likely scenario of allelopathic effects on the development of cyanobacteria by Trapa spp. vegetation and the nutrient absorption competition among them. Our study demonstrated the potential of Trapa spp. to control cyanobacterial blooms producing harmful toxins.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				DEC	2012	13	3					289	299		10.1007/s10201-012-0376-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-012-0376-6													WOS:000310896200004

However, its prevalence and genomic characteristics in the Republic of Korea (ROK) remain unexplored. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of and analyze the LSVs by examining 266 honeybee samples from the ROK. Our findings revealed that LSV exhibited the highest infection rate among the pathogens observed in Korean apiaries, particularly during the reported period of severe winter loss (SWL) in A. mellifera apiaries in 2022. Three LSV genotypes- 2, 3, and 4 -were identified using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene analysis. Importantly, the infection rates of LSV2 (65.2%) and LSV3 (73.3%) were significantly higher in colonies experiencing SWL than in those experiencing normal winter loss (NWL) (p < 0.03). Furthermore, this study provides the first near-complete genome sequences of the Korean LSV2, LSV3, and LSV4 strains, comprising 5,759, 6,040, and 5,985 nt, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on these near-complete genome sequences demonstrated a close relationship between LSVs in the ROK and China. The high LSV infection rate in colonies experiencing a heightened mortality rate during winter suggests that this pathogen might contribute to SWL in ROK. Moreover, the genomic characteristic information on LSVs in this study holds immense potential for epidemiological information and the selection of specific genes suitable for preventing and treating LSV, including the promising utilization of RNA interference medicine in the future.

Lake Ortrasket has an area of 7.3 km2 and a mean depth of 22 m and is located 100 km from the coast halfways along the course of the River Ore. The river ends in a semi-closed low salinity estuary with an area of ca. 50 kM2 and a mean depth of 16 m. Sedimentation of phosphorus, iron and organic carbon were measured with sediment traps in Lake Ortrasket and in the Ore Estuary. Characterization of particulate phosphorus in river water, sediment trap material and sediments were performed by the sequential extraction procedure proposed by Hieltjes & Lijklema (1980). Apart from being an efficient trap for suspended particles including particulate phosphorus, Lake Ortrasket was shown to serve as a source for particulate material during spring 1991. The Ore Estuary, on the other hand, constitutes an efficient trap for the total supply of river-borne phosphorus during the spring flood period. Phosphorus was shown to be closely related to iron in particulate material in both the lake and the estuary. Adsorption of phosphorus on settling inorganic particles seems to be an important process, which is particularly pronounced in the estuary.																			0018-8158					MAR 5	1993	253	1-3					233	248		10.1007/BF00050745	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00050745													WOS:A1993KY82400020

Lakes ranging from oligomesotrophic to hypereutrophic were examined, providing an obvious nutrient gradient. With the shift from mesotrophic to eutrophic levels, diatom multi-ecotypes dominated by epiphytic and facultative planktonic taxa were replaced by nutrient-tolerant planktonic taxa, such as Cyclotella meneghiniana Skvortzow, C. atomus Hustedt, Cyclostephanos Round, and Stephanodiscus Ehrenberg etc., reflecting the nutrient changes in the lake. The relationship between diatoms and summer water quality indices was explored further using numeric analysis. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with forward selection and a Monte Carlo permutation test revealed that of all 25 summer water environmental variables, total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll a (Chl a), Secchi depth (SD), dissolved inorganic phosphorus, Cl-, SO42-, Mg2+, CO32-, and water depth were significant variables (P<0.05) in explaining diatom distributions. Of these, TP, Chl a, SD, and Cl-, were the most important variables. The result of the correlation analysis also showed that a significant correlation exists among these variables, implying that these indices are either interconnected or independent in explaining the diatom data. For phosphorus-limited sites, TP was the most significant variable affecting the diatoms, also affecting changes in Chl a, SD, and iron concentrations. The independence of Chl a may be related to algal competition induced by lake eutrophication, resulting in the feedback to diatom community. In addition to TP, SD can be related to sediment disturbance by wave action and the growth of macrophytes in large shallow lakes. These relationships between diatom ecotypes and water quality provide the basis for a future quantitative reconstruction of historic lake nutrient evolution in the study area and will also provide a wealth of modem ecological knowledge that can be used to interpret fossil diatom records.

Oxythermal habitat parameters and identifying cisco refuge lakes in Minnesota under future climate scenarios using variable benchmark periods	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Fish habitat in lakes is strongly constrained by water temperature (T) and available dissolved oxygen (DO). With climate warming both of these water quality parameters will change. A fish habitat simulation model was developed to calculate an oxythermal habitat variable, TDO3, i.e. water temperature at 3 mg/L of DO, from simulated daily T and DO profiles and used to determine potential refuge lakes for lake herring or cisco (Coregonus artedi) in Minnesota. Daily T and DO profiles were simulated using a deterministic, unsteady, one-dimensional (vertical) year-round lake water quality model (MINLAKE2010) that was developed specifically for transparent deep lakes. Profiles for thirty Minnesota cisco lakes were simulated with the MINLAKE2010 model using recorded (1961-2008) weather data or projected future climate scenarios (CGCM 3.1 and MIROC 3.2) as model input. The average of daily TDO3 values (called ATDO3(VB)) over a 31-day sliding or variable benchmark period (VB), was first calculated from daily TDO3 values. The annual maximum of ATDO3(VB) was retained for each simulated lake and year, and the average of 47 ATDO3(VB) values (called AvgATD3(VB)) obtained for the 1962-2008 simulation period was compared to oxythermal stress criteria for cisco determined from the analysis of field data. Isopleths of AvgATD3(VB) were interpolated for the 30 simulated lakes on a plot of Secchi depth vs. lake geometry ratio used as indicators of trophic state and summer mixing conditions, respectively. Marking the 620 Minnesota lakes with identified cisco populations on the plot of AvgATD3(VB) allowed to partition the 620 lakes into the three tiers depending on where they fell between the isopleths: lakes with AvgATD3(VB) <= 11 degrees C (Tier 1 lakes) were selected to be most suitable for cisco; lakes with 11 degrees C < AvgATD3(VB) <= 17 degrees C (Tier 2 lakes) had suitable habitat for cisco; and non-refuge lakes with AvgATD3(VB) > 17 degrees C (Tier 3 lakes) would support cisco only at a reduced probability of occurrence or not at all. About 160 existing cisco lakes were thus projected to be suitable refuge lakes (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) under the two future climate scenarios. The remaining lakes were projected to loose their cisco supporting ability. The methodology to identify the refuge lakes was applied to a cisco kill that occurred in 18 cisco lakes in Minnesota in the hot summer of 2006, and was able to identify the majority of these lakes as non-refuge lakes.

J	Riis, T; SandJensen, K				Riis, T; SandJensen, K			Growth reconstruction and photosynthesis of aquatic mosses: Influence of light, temperature and carbon dioxide at depth	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 The mosses Sphagnum subsecundum and Drepanocladus exannulatus dominate the vegetation in the oligotrophic, softwater Lake Grane Langso, Denmark, even at great depths where light and temperature are low. We used seasonal changes in morphology to reconstruct the annual growth and the longevity of the mosses and measurements of photosynthesis and respiration to evaluate the importance of light, temperature and CO2 for the growth patterns at depth in the lake. 2 The reconstruction technique revealed that the mosses had a relatively fast growth rate (90-250 mm shoot(-1) year(-1)) and were short lived (0.7-2.9 years). The shoots of both moss species grew faster in deep than in shallow water. Growth experiments in summer confirmed that Sphagnum grew more slowly and decayed more rapidly in shallow than in deep water. 3 Fast growth of mosses in deep waters can be accounted for by lower temperature, extensive CO2 supersaturation and nutrient enrichment in the hypolimnion during summer stratification. Maximum rate of light-saturated photosynthesis in July was 3.3-fold higher and of dark respiration 1.3-fold lower in Sphagnum from 9.5m incubated at the ambient 8 degrees C than in Sphagnum from 0.7m incubated at 20 degrees C. The net daily carbon fixation was greater in deep than in shallow water despite the much lower irradiance at depth. Extensive CO2 supersaturation stimulated photosynthesis several-fold relative to the rates observed in air-saturated water. Tissues of Sphagnum were richer in nitrogen in deep than in shallow water during summer, but the importance of nutrient availability to annual moss growth remains unclear. 4 Reconstruction techniques are recommended for comparative studies on annual and interannual growth patterns of mosses within lakes and among lakes of different altitude, latitude and water chemistry. This information can be based on just a single collection and can therefore include remote sites with adverse climate.

J	STAUFFER, RE				STAUFFER, RE			VERTICAL NUTRIENT TRANSPORT AND ITS EFFECTS ON EPILIMNETIC PHOSPHORUS IN 4 CALCAREOUS LAKES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The influence of vertical nutrient transport on epilimnetic phosphorus was studied comparatively in four calcareous Wisconsin [USA] lakes during 1972. In the two lakes with steep metalimnetic nutrient gradients (Mendota, Delavan), upward fluxes by entrainment and eddy diffusion exceeded all other influxes combined; here epilimnetic total-P concentrations increased during period of high windpower and thermocline migration, and decreased during comparatively stagnant intervals. In the two lakes lacking upper metalimnetic P gradients (Green, Fish), higher windpower had little or no effect on epilimnetic phosphorus. In each of the four lakes epilimnetic P declined in early summer until a quasi steady-state was achieved between P influxes and P sedimentation. In Mendota and Delavan steady-state feature higher concentrations of total-P, and much higher epilimnetic concentrations of particulate-P and chlorophyll, than in Green and Fish Lakes- mainly on account of the high fluxes of molybdate-reactive, biologically-available P through the seasonal thermocline. The flux analysis illustrates why mean lake TP concentration after ice-out is an inconsistent measure (not sufficient statistic) for estimating nutrient potential and chlorophyll standing crops during the following summer in stratified lakes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 16	1987	154						87	102		10.1007/BF00026833	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026833													WOS:A1987K536700008

Lee			In-cloud characteristics observed in northeastern and midwestern US non-orographic winter storms with implications for ice particle mass growth and residence time	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS												The spatial distribution of surface snowfall accumulation is dependent on the 3D trajectories of ice particles and their residence times through regions of ice mass increases and decreases. We analyze 42 non-orographic, non-lake-effect winter storms in the northeastern and midwestern United States from the Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS) and Profiling of Winter Storms (PLOWS) field campaigns. In situ aircraft measurements (1 Hz, similar to 100 m horizontal distance) yield key data on vertical air motions, relative humidity with respect to ice (RHice), and number concentration. When suitable airborne radar data are available, we sort the in situ measurements by distance from cloud radar echo top.In total, 90 % of updrafts (vertical air motion >= 0.5 ms-1) were <= 1.3 km across. Measurements obtained within 3 km of cloud echo top were nearly twice as likely (13 % versus 7 %) to have vertical velocities capable of lofting precipitation-sized ice compared to points sampled at lower levels. Below the near-cloud-top generating cell layer, most of the storm volume has RHice <= 95 % consistent with sublimation.Rather than ice precipitation growth within broad areas of vertical air motions, observations indicate that ice growth in these storms primarily occurs episodically within layers of overturning cloud-top generating cells with scales <= a few kilometers. Below the generating cell layer, conditions for ice growth are rarer, and the ice particles usually either persist or shrink during most of their descent. The observed distributions of ambient in-cloud conditions provide benchmarks for evaluations of winter storm model output.

In line with reduced phosphorus and nitrogen loadings, total organismic productivity decreased and lakes have now historically low nutrient and biomass concentrations. This caused speculations that restoration was overdone and intended fertilizations are needed to ensure ecological functionality. Here we show that recent re-oligotrophication processes indeed accelerated, however caused by lake warming. Rising air temperatures strengthen thermal stabilization of water columns which prevents thorough turnover (holomixis). Reduced mixis impedes down-welling of oxygen rich epilimnetic (surface) and up-welling of phosphorus and nitrogen rich hypolimnetic (deep) water. However, nutrient inputs are essential for algal spring blooms acting as boost for annual food web successions. We show that repeated lack (since 1977) and complete stop (since 2013) of holomixis caused drastic epilimnetic phosphorus depletions and an absence of phytoplankton spring blooms in Lake Zurich (Switzerland). By simulating holomixis in experiments, we could induce significant vernal algal blooms, confirming that there would be sufficient hypolimnetic phosphorus which presently accumulates due to reduced export. Thus, intended fertilizations are highly questionable, as hypolimnetic nutrients will become available during future natural or artificial turnovers.

To reduce the effects of aquaculture on aquatic communities, pen culture facilities, which are widely distributed in Yangtze-connected lakes, were removed in 2018. We surveyed and compared waterbird communities in Caizi Lake during the four months before (2017-2018) and after net pen removal (2021-2022) to evaluate their effect on the diversity and species composition of wintering waterbirds. After net pen removal, the richness and number of individual waterbird species increased, whereas the Shannon-Wiener diversity index did not change because the increase in the bird number throughout the year was mostly associated with a few species. The response of individual numbers of different guilds to the removal of net pens differed. The number of deep-water fish eaters, seed eaters, and tuber feeders increased, whereas that of invertebrate eaters decreased. The species composition also changed, particularly in the northeastern and southwestern parts of the lake. Differences in waterbird communities between the winters of 2017-2018 and 2021-2022 indicated that net pen removal had a positive impact on waterbird communities.

Formulation of a wind specification for Titan late polar summer exploration	PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE												Titan's polar regions, and its hydrocarbon lakes in particular, are of interest for future exploration. The polar conditions have considerable seasonal variation and are distinct from the equatorial environment experienced by Huygens. Thus specific environmental models are required for these regions. This paper, informed by Cassini and groundbased observations and four independent Global Circulation Models (GCMs), summarizes northern summer polar conditions (specifically, regions north of 65 degrees N, during the 2023-2024 period, or solar longitude L-s similar to 150 degrees-170 degrees) and presents a simple analytical formulation of expected, minimum and maximum winds as a function of altitude to aid spacecraft and instrument design for future exploration, with particular reference to the descent dispersions of the Titan Mare Explorer (TiME) mission concept presently under development. We also consider winds on the surface, noting that these (of relevance for impact conditions, for waves, and for wind-driven drift of a floating capsule) are weaker than those in the lowest cell in most GCMs: some previously-reported estimates of 'surface' wind speeds (actually at 90-500 m altitude) should be reduced by 20-35% to refer to the standard 10 m 'anemometer height' applicable for surface phenomena. A Weibull distribution with scale speed C=0.4 m/s and shape parameter k=2.0 embraces the GCM-predicted surface wind speeds. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Brostoff, WN; Sharifi, MR; Rundel, PW				Brostoff, WN; Sharifi, MR; Rundel, PW			Photosynthesis of cryptobiotic soil crusts in a seasonally inundated system of pans and dunes in the western Mojave Desert, CA: Field studies	FLORA												Cryptobiotic soil crusts form the dominant cover of a unique system of dunes and intermittently inundated pans and playas situated on the Pleistocene Lake Thompson bed, in the western Mojave Desert, CA. Recent work has reported on basic ecological parameters including distribution, abundance, and species composition of these algal (cyanobacterial)dominated crusts as well as on their photosynthetic rates in laboratory studies. As a step toward building an ecological model for a natural resource management plan, we determined the photosynthetic rate of the crusts under field environmental conditions. We examined the relationship between the environmental conditions of crust moisture content (MC), temperature, and ambient CO? concentration on photosynthetic rates during the mid-spring and the late autumn. Maximal photosynthetic rates (P-max), which did not vary greatly with season, were 3.57 and 3.99 mu mol CO2 M-2 s(-1) for crusts on dunes and in pans, respectively. Mean photosynthetic rates for three types of crust on dunes, smooth and flat, pedicillated, and unconsolidated, were 1.31, 1.47, and 1.29 mu mol CO2 M-2 s(-1), respectively. P-max of crusts on dunes and pans occurred at soil MCs of 110% and 20%, respectively, both lower and higher MCs resulted in decreased rates of photosynthesis. The relation between atmospheric CO2 concentration and net photosynthesis was linear (r(2) = 0.88 and 0.97 for crusts on dunes and pans, respectively) through at least 1000ppm CO2, We measured positive net photosynthesis at temperatures from 0 to 46 degrees C and found no clear optimum within this range when crusts were provided with optimal moisture and light conditions. Photosynthetic rates in this field study were somewhat lower than those measured in the laboratory, but both optimum MC and the relation between ambient CO2 and net photosynthetic rate were similar. Respiration rates were generally less than 10% those of photosynthetic rates. Based on data herein and climatic information, we estimated the potential net primary productivity of crusts on dunes to be 11.7g Cm-2 yr(-1). The photosynthetic rate of the unconsolidated crust type, for which no data have been published, was similar to the other crust types. This finding, together with previous information that the chlorophyll values of this and other crust forms were similar, suggests that ecological studies, as well as conservation and restoration efforts, give these the same attention as the other crust types.

Our investigation is based on high-resolution, continuous plant macrofossil remains and mollusc records, complemented by pollen, geochemical analysis and radiocarbon dating of Valea Morii, located in the Feleac Hills (Transylvanian Depression) in NW Romania, Central Eastern Europe. Based on our palaeocological data we have distinguished three stages of wet habitat conditions: two stages between 4000 and 2450 cal yr BP and one in the last 800 cal yr BP, and one dry stage between ca. 2450 and 800 cal yr BP. These local habitat conditions appear to reasonably reflect regional climate characteristics. High-resolution analysis of two replicated cores documented a mostly comparable pattern of local plant and mollusc succession, and stable isotope values from ca. 500 cal yr BP. The appearance of C. mariscus during the last two centuries may be related to increased wetness and associated active CaCO3 precipitation, which allowed this plant to colonise the springfed fen studied. However, it can be not excluded that the occurrence and spread of a Cladium mariscus population at this site during the last two centuries might have been partly favoured by the warming of the climate after the Little Ice Age. The potential of carbonate oxygen stable isotope values as an indicator of major trends in climatic change, both temperature and humidity, in mountain spring-fed fen deposits is shown. Carbon isotopes in the carbonates were found to be useful in reconstruction of changes in vegetation, soil development and the dissolution of bedrock carbonates, primarily as a reaction to changes in climate humidity.					; Tantau, Ioan/B-8788-2011; Gałka, Mariusz/ABB-1744-2020; Apolinarska, Karina/AAZ-3588-2020	Tantau, Ioan/0000-0002-7197-916X; Apolinarska, Karina/0000-0002-3507-5139; Galka, Mariusz/0000-0001-8906-944X; Feurdean, Angelica/0000-0002-2497-3005; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				SEP 1	2018	504						170	185		10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.05.027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2018.05.027													WOS:000446269900013

Holocene subalpine forest-parkland dynamics in Big Cottonwood Canyon, Wasatch Mountains, Utah, USA	HOLOCENE												Understanding long-term responses of subalpine forest-parklands to Holocene climate variability in local context is critical for better managing those ecosystems under future climate change. Available records suggest that western North American subalpine forest-parkland ecosystems responded to Holocene climate in various ways at different places. Here we present a Holocene record of upper montane forest-parkland dynamics from Silver Lake in Big Cottonwood Canyon, Wasatch Range, on the Great Basin's eastern margin. Our results show that at the end of the Younger Dryas, Silver Lake was surrounded by open Pinus/Picea parkland mixed with Artemisia subalpine steppe. By similar to 9.0 cal ka BP Picea began to expand in response to early Holocene summer warming and enhanced winter moisture. Picea-dominated forests prevailed from similar to 8.0 to 5.0 cal ka BP, after which time a more open Picea parkland developed. By similar to 3.5 cal ka BP Pinus increased under cooling conditions, and Picea gradually rebounded to form the mixed conifer forest present today. The Silver Lake long-term record of moderate shifts within an upper montane ecosystem is consistent with other regional sites in the timing of major vegetation changes reflecting large-scale climatic forcings, but distinct in response to local factors including the importance of enhanced lake-effect snowpack and the absence of competing lower montane Pinus. These local factors may help account for the long-term stability of Picea-dominated forests in the area.

Effects of the lake on surface climate of the coastal areas, however, are not well understood. This article utilizes hourly observation data of warm season from 17 automatic weather stations to analyze the diurnal and seasonal variations in air temperature in different coastal zones of the Qinghai Lake. The EOS/MODIS data was also used to analyze the surface temperature differences between the lake and its surrounding areas. The results show a few unique characteristics of the plateau lake: (1) based on the satellite data, lake surface temperature is lower than its surrounding areas (4.925.1 degrees C and 12.235.6 degrees C respectively) in the daytime, while it is obviously higher than that in the surrounding areas (1.910.5 degrees C and - 13.16.3 degrees C respectively) at the nighttime. Daily mean water surface temperature is higher than that in the surrounding areas, which is 7.817.9 degrees C and - 2.617.9 degrees C respectively; (2) based on data of meteorological stations, coastal zones closer to the shoreline have a higher air temperature during the warm season largely due to the much warmer nighttime near the shoreline than those in deep inland zones. For the on-shore, near-shore, and far-shore zones, mean daytime air temperature is 8.79.6 degrees C, 9.511.1 degrees C, and 10.010.7 degrees C, respectively, and the mean nighttime air temperature is 2.94.1 degrees C, 1.312.3 degrees C, and - 0.20.4 degrees C respectively. The hourly mean diurnal temperature range (DTR) increases with distance to the shoreline, which is 8.6 degrees C, 10.9 degrees C, and 12.3 degrees C in the on-shore, near-shore, and far-shore zones respectively; (3) differences between maximum and minimum 5-day mean daily maximum (minimum) air temperature during the warm season are 20.3 degrees C (23.3 degrees C), 21.7 degrees C (25.6 degrees C), and 22.6 degrees C (26.7 degrees C) for the on-shore, near-shore, and far-shore zones, respectively, indicating an asymmetrical effect on daytime and nighttime air temperature in the on-shore zone; (4) daily maximum air temperature of the on-shore zone is lower before early October, but it is slightly higher afterward and occurs later; (5) daily minimum air temperature of the on-shore zone is on average higher than that of the far-shore zone, especially after the mid-September, and it also appears later in autumn than in summer.

A.; Blank, Stephan; Kurmayer, Rainer; Deng, Li			Resilience of planktonic bacterial community structure in response to short-term weather deterioration during the growing season in an alpine lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The disturbing effect of a short-term cooling period during summer on planktonic bacterial community structure of an alpine lake was investigated using 16S rDNA pyrosequencing. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes constituted the most abundant phyla. During the sampling period (from July to August 2010), a sudden cooling period with high precipitation occurred, as indicated by a decrease in conductivity, calcium, and dissolved organic carbon concentration resulting from increased runoff. The relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Cyanobacteria decreased during this short-term cooling period. Instead, a rapid shift from Betaproteobacteria to Gammaproteobacteria occurred, which was mainly caused by an increase of Acinetobacter rhizosphaerae. Soon after the short-term cooling period, warmer weather conditions got re-established and Betaproteobacteria recovered and became again dominant. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling analysis and Venn diagrams revealed a planktonic bacterial community composition with high similarity at the beginning and the end of the growing season. Air temperature and precipitation were significantly correlated with the observed variation in operational taxonomic unit (OTU) relative abundance. It is concluded that, in response to the short-term cooling period, a distinct planktonic bacterial OTU community developed. It rapidly diminished, however, as summer conditions became re-established, implying the recovery of the original bacterial community structure.

Continental Connections: Changing Temperature, Wind and Precipitation Advance the Postbreeding Roosting Phenology of Avian Aerial Insectivores	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim: Migratory birds are under threat by climate change. Successfully conserving them requires knowing which climatic factors drive changes in their migratory behaviour. Weather conditions may directly or indirectly affect the temporally disjointed life history stages of migratory birds, including the breeding, roosting and nonbreeding stages. However, the influences of these broad-scale patterns are often not studied together. Coupling migratory bird movements estimated using weather radar (NEXRAD) with long-term and large-scale environmental data allows us to overcome these spatiotemporal uncertainties. Here, we assess environmental drivers of the phenology of postbreeding roosting of aerial insectivores in the Great Lakes region (USA) by evaluating predictors during the months leading up to roosting across species' ranges. Location: Northern United States and Canada. Time Period: 21-year (2000-2020). Major Taxa Studied: Avian aerial insectivores. Methods: We conducted a spatially explicit time-window analysis to examine the effects of 17 gridded weather and vegetation variables on swallow peak roosting phenology in the Great Lakes, making minimal ecological assumptions. ResultsWe found that peak roosting timing is paced by both local conditions (headwind at 850 hPa) at the Great Lakes and distant conditions (minimum temperature, precipitation rate and specific humidity) at the likely breeding and stopover sites, with warmer temperatures advancing, headwind delaying and high precipitation advancing the phenophases. Time windows selected for the possible breeding and stopover sites are mostly before or around the time of roosting, with one exception during wintertime. Main Conclusions: Although climatic shifts play a significant role in driving variation in phenology, for migratory species, the proximate driver can originate hundreds to thousands of kilometres away, and potentially months prior. Our study illuminates these far-reaching patterns in aerial insectivores, enhancing our grasp of migration ecology and paving the way for a more comprehensive understanding of hemispheric animal movements.					; Haest, Birgen/B-3159-2010; Belotti, Maria/GRE-6731-2022	Deng, Yuting/0000-0001-8110-0414; 													1466-822X	1466-8238				MAY	2025	34	5							e70052	10.1111/geb.70052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.70052													WOS:001496175000010

Data on stomach contents of 194 whitefish taken in 1945 were examined and included in this analysis. Most stomachs contained food, but lesser quantitites of food per stomach and many empty stomachs were found in July and August of each year. Mayfly nymphs occurred in the stomachs most often. Other insects eaten included dipterous larvae, especially Chaoborus and chironomids. Incidental items, constituting a smaller though important part of the fish''s diet, included aquatic coleopterans, hemipterans, trichopteran larvae, cladocerans, Hyalella, hydrachnids, gastropods and, seasonally, aerial insects from the surface of the lake, and small fish. Cyclopid and calanoid copepods were found in about 1% of the stomachs. This apparently low incidence of cyclopids in the diet is considered to be sufficient to establish the relatively high infection levels of Triaenophorus found in Heming Lake fish. Some differences in diet between fish of different sizes and between seasons were shown.																									1963	20	2					279	286		10.1139/f63-025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f63-025													WOS:A1963WV54200004

Aquatic communities are naturally exposed simultaneously to environments containing a mixture of metals and varying DOM levels and compositions. However, the exact effect of DOM on metal bioaccumulation is difficult to predict due to temporal and spatial variations in sources, production, and consumption of DOM, and to interactions between DOM and metals. Ecosystem metabolism describes the process of organic carbon production and consumption and, therefore, the trophic status of ecosystems. However, whether and how ecosystem metabolism determines the seasonality of metal bioaccumulation remains unclear. The present study used in-situ water quality sondes and discrete field samplings to establish the relationship between the seasonality of ecosystem metabolism; related environmental and limnological regulators; the metal speciation and concentration in bulk water and sediments; and their metal bioaccumulation. The target population consisted of atyid shrimp (Neocaridina denticulata) in a brackish constructed wetland in tropical Taiwan was sampled between August 2014 and November 2015. Metal bioaccumulation displayed distinct seasonal patterns that peaked in summer (Cu, Cd, Cr, Zn, Mn, and Se) or winter (Pb and Ni). The in situ production (gross primary production) and heterotrophic consumption (ecosystem respiration) of organic matter significantly decreased with increasing waterborne DOM levels in this heterotrophic wetland. Both dissolved free metals bioavailable for respiratory surfaces (As, Zn, Cu, and Cr) and insoluble metals available for dietary intake (Mn and Ni) decreased with increasing DOM, as well as with decreasing gross primary production and ecosystem respiration. Seasonal variations of metal bioaccumulation also paralleled the transition in wetland trophic status, which reflected the effect of potential qualitative changes in the wetland DOM pool. Bioaccumulation of most metals displayed strong correlations with gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, and wetland trophic status. Our findings demonstrated that ecosystem metabolism can play a key mediating role in the seasonality of metal bioaccumulation in atyid shrimp, as it links the variation and interaction between DOM level/source, the speciation/bioavailability, and the uptake efficiency for metals by aquatic organisms. This study contributes to the temporal-specific risk assessment of aquatic metal exposure in regional environmental settings. It also reveals ecosystem-specific spectra in the context of changes in climate and environment.

Spatially explicit network analysis reveals multi-species annual cycle movement patterns of sea ducks	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Conservation of long-distance migratory species poses unique challenges. Migratory connectivity, that is, the extent to which groupings of individuals at breeding sites are maintained in wintering areas, is frequently used to evaluate population structure and assess use of key habitat areas. However, for species with complex or variable annual cycle movements, this traditional bimodal framework of migratory connectivity may be overly simplistic. Like many other waterfowl, sea ducks often travel to specific pre- and post-breeding sites outside their nesting and wintering areas to prepare for migration by feeding extensively and, in some cases, molting their flight feathers. These additional migrations may play a key role in population structure, but are not included in traditional models of migratory connectivity. Network analysis, which applies graph theory to assess linkages between discrete locations or entities, offers a powerful tool for quantitatively assessing the contributions of different sites used throughout the annual cycle to complex spatial networks. We collected satellite telemetry data on annual cycle movements of 672 individual sea ducks of five species from throughout eastern North America and the Great Lakes. From these data, we constructed a multi-species network model of migratory patterns and site use over the course of breeding, molting, wintering, and migratory staging. Our results highlight inter- and intra-specific differences in the patterns and complexity of annual cycle movement patterns, including the central importance of staging and molting sites in James Bay, the St. Lawrence River, and southern New England to multi-species annual cycle habitat linkages, and highlight the value of Long-tailed Ducks (Calengula haemalis) as an umbrella species to represent the movement patterns of multiple sea duck species. We also discuss potential applications of network migration models to conservation prioritization, identification of population units, and integrating different data streams.

We evaluated the ability of condition indices to predict total body fat and protein for hunter-killed American wigeon (Anas americana) wintering on the Southern High Plains of Texas, USA. Six hundred and forty-two wigeon were collected from 1 October 1988 to 15 March 1989 and processed in the laboratory to determine mean values of carcass components including lipids, ash, and ash-free lean dry mass (protein). In regression equations for various sex and age groups, mass of omental fat deposits was the single best predictor of total body fat (R-2=0.82 to 0.90), although addition of body mass or carcass mass to the equations somewhat improved accuracy of the models (up to R-2=0.93). Protein was not as accurately predicted by measured variables, although equations using the same variables that accurately predicted total body fat (carcass mass or body mass+omental fat mass) provided R-2 values up to 0.53 for protein. Total body fat and, to a lesser extent, protein can be estimated reliably for wintering American wigeons using easily obtained measurements of dead birds.

The fluorescence ratio F-nu:F(m), where F-nu is the difference between DCMU-enhanced fluorescence (F(m)) and normal, dark-adapted fluorescence (F0), was used as a relative measure of photosynthetic performance. A. formosa grown in batch culture displayed a 70-80% decrease in F-nu:F(m) during 1 h of exposure to 1,60-mu-mol quanta m-2 s-1. In addition, sinking rate increased from a mean of 0.23 m d-1 in controls to 0.43 after high irradiance. A. formosa populations were sampled in May, the later stage of the spring abundance maximum in the north basin of Windermere (English Lake District). Diatoms in the upper 1-3 m exhibited low F-nu:F(m) (0.1-0.2) during near-surface stratification (four of five dates) but no depression of F-nu:F(m) on the one occasion of sunny weather and strong surface winds. Near-surface cell abundances were also significantly lower during high-irradiance, stratified conditions. The results suggest that high irradiance lowers production rates and increases sedimentation of diatom populations during the later stages of the spring maximum.

The model simulations for 21, 10, and 0 ka BP were conducted with the GENESIS 2.0 GCM. The 10 ka BP simulation was coupled to the EVE vegetation model. The primary boundary conditions differing from present at 21 ka BP were the northern hemisphere ice sheets and lower CO2, and at 10 ka BP were the orbital insolation and smaller northern hemisphere ice sheets. The purpose of this article is to discuss the hydrological consequences of these simulations. At the Last Glacial Maximum (21 ka BP) the large ice sheets over North America and Eurasia and the lower CO2 levels produced a colder climate than present, with less precipitation throughout the Arctic, except where circulation was altered by the ice sheets. At 10 ka BP greater summer insolation resulted in a warmer and wetter Beringia, but conditions remained cold and dry in the north Atlantic sector, in the vicinity of the remnant ice sheets. Less winter insolation at 10 ka BP resulted in colder and drier conditions throughout the Arctic. Precipitation - evaporation generally correlated with precipitation except where changes in the surface type (ice sheets, vegetation at 10 ka BP, or sea level at 21 ka BP) caused large changes in the evaporation rate. The primary hydrological differences (from present) at 21 and 10 ka BP correlated with the temperature differences, which were a direct result of the large-scale boundary condition changes.

J	Hou, YD; Long, H; Shen, J; Gao, L				Hou, Yandong; Long, Hao; Shen, Ji; Gao, Lei			Holocene lake-level fluctuations of Selin Co on the central Tibetan plateau: Regulated by monsoonal precipitation or meltwater?	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), lakes as paleoenvironmental archives have been the most extensively investigated for their sensitivities to climate change on different timescales. Well-preserved shoreline and terrace remains surrounding these lakes provide critical geomorphological and sedimentary evi-dence that can be used to infer past lake levels over geological timescales. These features can offer an analogue for understanding how future lake-levels respond to global warming. In this study, we investigated a series of water level-related depositional profiles around the Selin Co basin from the central TP, by dating 28 samples using K-feldspar luminescence techniques. Combining the obtained chronological data with sedimentological, stratigraphic evidence and differential GPS survey observa-tions, the Holocene history of lake-level fluctuations in Selin Co was inferred. The results show a stable highstand between 10 ka and 7 ka but a striking subsequent lake-level decline. This pattern appears to follow the solar insolation-forced changes in the intensity of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), particularly during the early Holocene. However, such gradual weakening of ISM intensity after the early Holocene may not interpret the dramatically rapid shrinking of Selin Co, implying other components are largely underrecognized driving factors accounting for the effective moisture of lakes in the early Ho-locene. Here, we argue that the increased meltwater input from glaciers and permafrost, together with increased precipitation, might have resulted in the high lake level at 10e7 ka, as the high summer temperature during the early Holocene induced massive melting water flow into the lake. By 7 ka, the abrupt lake-level drop is likely related to the decreased meltwater owing to decreasing regional tem-peratures documented from glacier landforms, ice cores and lacustrine sediments. Therefore, we high -light that meltwater from glaciers and permafrost poured into lakes on the central TP, particularly during warm periods on the millennial timescales, might also dominate the Holocene high lake levels.

J	Brodersen, KP; Anderson, NJ; Odgaard, BV				Brodersen, KP; Anderson, NJ; Odgaard, BV			Long-term trends in the profundal chronomid-fauna in nitrogen-limited Lake Esrom, Denmark: a combined palaeolimnological/historical approach	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												A 90-cm sediment core from Lake Esrom was analysed for subfossil diatoms and Chironomidae. Quantitative diatom-inferred reconstruction of total phosphorus showed an increase in TP levels from 84 mug P/l around 1600 AD (extrapolated Pb-210 chronology) to 200 mug P/l in 1975, followed by a decrease to 165 mug P/l at the present day. Chironomid-inferred chlorophyll-a concentration ranged from 5-15 mug chl-a/l throughout the core. Analysis of historical oxygen data and long-term zoobenthic population dynamics from the profundal zone of Lake Esrom suggested that the period of oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion increased during the 20(th) century. However, the chironomid record showed only minor variations in the subfossil assemblages over the last similar to 400 years and there was no chironomid indication of significant changes in the hypolimnetic (oxygen) conditions. Because primary production in Lake Esrom is nitrogen limited during the stratification period, the chlorophyll concentration is lower than commonly found for Danish lakes with comparable phosphorus concentrations. However, both the diatom-[TP] and chironomid-[chl-a] inferred values for recent periods agree well with monitored data. The two models work because the diatoms are reflecting the ([TP]) spring situation before nitrogen becomes the limiting factor whereas the chironomid fauna is reflecting the average summer (chlorophyll) situation both before and during the period of nitrogen limitation. This study illustrates the importance of multi-proxy analyses for quantitative palaeolimnological reconstruction of lake trophic state, particularly for lakes that behave differently from the more predictable responses to nutrient enrichment.

J	Cloutier, J; Kyser, K; Olivo, GR; Alexandre, P				Cloutier, Jonathan; Kyser, Kurt; Olivo, Gema R.; Alexandre, Paul			Contrasting Patterns of Alteration at the Wheeler River Area, Athabasca Basin, Saskatchewan, Canada: Insights into the Apparently Uranium-Barren Zone K Alteration System	ECONOMIC GEOLOGY												Previous studies on Athabasca basin unconformity-related uranium deposits have focused on major deposits and have not investigated sites with barren alteration systems that could clarify some of the critical factors controlling mineralization processes. A paragenetic study of the Wheeler River area reveals the presence of minerals that formed during the diagenetic, the main hydrothermal, which is subdivided into early, mid-, and late hydrothermal substages, and the late alteration stages. The diagenetic stage consists of early quartz overgrowths, siderite, rutile, hematite, and abundant dickite in the pore spaces of the Manitou Falls Formation. The early hydrothermal alteration substage is characterized by pervasive 1Mc muscovite alteration and minor goyazite clusters, which formed from oxidizing basinal fluids at temperatures around 240 degrees C prior to 1550 Ma, based on Ar-Ar dates. The mid-hydrothermal alteration substage comprises dravite and sudoite in the basal 200 m of the Manitou Falls Formation, which are interpreted to have formed at temperatures around 175 degrees C from fluids chemically distinct but isotopically similar to the basinal fluids involved during the early hydrothermal alteration substage. The late hydrothermal substage was observed only at zone K of the Wheeler River area and is characterized by the precipitation of clinochlore, copper sulfides, and florencite from reducing basement fluids emerging into the Manitou Falls Formation at temperatures around 230 degrees C, creating a similar to 250-m-high by similar to 250-m-wide reducing halo. Oxidized uranium-bearing basinal fluids interacted with the Manitou Falls Formation during the early hydrothermal substage poor to the arrival of the reducing fluids during the mid- and late hydrothermal substages and this precluded uranium precipitation. The post-hydrothermal alteration stage is characterized by formation of kaolinite after late hydrothermal clinochlore near fractures by meteoric waters. A minimal amount of leachable radiogenic Pb, with a Pb-Pb model age of 1907 Ma that is older age than both the Athabasca basin and the main mineralization event of 1590 Ma, was encountered at zone K, indicating low probability of tins area to host uranium mineralization. However, areas of possible unconformity-related uranium deposits were identified outside zone K wherein significant amounts leachable radiogenic Pb were observed.					; Alexandre, Paul/AAZ-3136-2021	Kyser, Kurt/0000-0001-9667-4103; Cloutier, Jonathan/0000-0002-9432-9880; 													0361-0128	1554-0774				MAR-APR	2010	105	2					303	324		10.2113/gsecongeo.105.2.303	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gsecongeo.105.2.303													WOS:000277407200004

Holocene climate variations retrieved from Gun Nuur lake-sediment core in the northern Mongolian Plateau	HOLOCENE												Our pollen-based climate reconstruction shows that both temperature and moisture were low during the early Holocene from similar to 10,000 to similar to 8000 cal. a BP and gradually climbed from similar to 8000 to similar to 6000 cal. a BP. The last similar to 6000 years have been generally warm and wet with high-amplitude fluctuations. The high-moisture conditions for the past similar to 6000 years are not only corroborated by high arboreal pollen/non-arboreal (AP/NAP; trees and shrubs over herbs) pollen ratio and high pollen concentration but also by high organic matter content and diatom data. We suggest that lower winter insolation and remaining ice covers in the early Holocene might have slowed down temperature rise in the continental interiors and that the resulted low temperature might have suppressed regional evaporation that was a major water vapor source for precipitation. At the same time, icemelt-water injection into the North Atlantic Ocean might have also suppressed water vapor supplies to the downwind areas, including the northern Mongolian Plateau. The increase in winter insolation and the final melting of ice sheets, together with the increased atmospheric CO2 concentration and the associated increase in atmospheric water vapor, could be responsible for the higher temperature during the past similar to 6000 years. The icemelting and the associated rise of sea level during the past similar to 6000 years might be responsible for the weakening of the winter monsoon in the interior of Asian continent, thus alluring farther eastward penetration of the relatively warm and wet Atlantic air masses and consequently bringing more precipitation to the northern Mongolian Plateau.					; Ma, Yuzhen/AAF-6498-2019; Yang, Yingying/GRS-1048-2022	Zhang, Xiaosen/0000-0002-8069-8095; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				DEC	2013	23	12					1721	1730		10.1177/0959683613505337	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683613505337													WOS:000327472500007

Accordingly, this study singled out potential contributing factors to harmful algae blooms with a particular focus on phosphorus (P) release. The potential risks of P release for the drinking water from a lake in Fujian were assessed by investigating the spatial-temporal distribution of P, its exchange capacity, and its discharge capacity in sediment, including the community composition of phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs) and the phosphate's initial migration effects on sediments. Different mixed materials, including soil aggregate distributions, sorbent, fractions, adsorption-desorption of P, and the community composition of PAOs were assessed. Total phosphorus (TP) content was measured at 24.4 +/- 1.2 to 563.9 +/- 38.2 mg/kg, but contents displayed some spatial differences. The dominant Ps found in the sample sediments were organic phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus associated with hydroxide Fe/Al-P, which accounted for 48.6% and 43.6%, respectively, of the TP content in the lake's central waters. The TP concentration in vertical sediment ranged from 436.2 +/- 21.3 to 602.9 +/- 31.4 mg/kg. The TP spatio-temporal distribution inputs varied with rainfall (p < 0.05). P deposition occurred throughout most water bodies (p < 0.05), covering extensive areas and also decreasing at lower depths. Forty-four operational taxonomic unit (OTU) phosphorus-accumulating organism types from 11 phyla were detected in the sediment samples obtained from the Sanshiliujiao Lakes region. Proteobacteria also dominated compared to the organisms with the strongest PAOs. The diversity of PAOs in summer samples was significantly higher than that of the autumn samples. These findings provide a scientific foundation for determining the future discovery of the microbial mechanisms involved in the phosphorus metabolic cycle found in reservoir sediments. Various forms of phosphorus influenced the PAO diversity, especially Fe/Al-P. Thus, the abundance of PAOs in the sediment proved to be an essential component of the P cycle and may even play a key role in regional material circulation and in causing other environmental issues.

To evaluate factors related to low Chl a levels, three Alberta saline lakes (total dissolved solids > 5 g .cntdot. L-1) were studied in 1983 and 1984. Mean summer phytoplankton Chl a ranged from 3 to 10 .mu.g .cntdot. L-1, mean summer periphyton Chl a was less than 70 mg .cntdot. m-1, while mean summer TP and TN ranged from 2 to 13 and from 4 to 11 mg .cntdot. L-1, respectively. Chl a and phytoplankton primary production were extremely low relative to predictions from measured TP and TN levels and empirical models for freshwaters. Bioassays indicated that inorganic phosphorus was not limiting, whereas inorganic nitrogen was limiting algal growth. Bacterial densities and zooplankton dry weight were high (> 107 cells .cntdot. mL-1 and 1.0 mg .cntdot. L-1, respectively) relative to predictions from Chl a and empirical models for freshwaters. Phytoplankton biomass was insufficient to maintain the zooplankton populations; bacteria and detritus were likely a major food source for zooplankton. This study suggests that freshwater models are not applicable to prairie saline lakes.

Vonder			Toward snowfall retrieval over land by combining satellite and in situ measurements	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Although snowfall is an important component of global precipitation in extratropical regions, satellite snowfall estimate is still in an early developmental stage, and existing satellite remote sensing techniques do not yet provide reliable estimates of snowfall over higher latitudes. Toward the goal of developing a global snowfall algorithm, in this study, a Bayesian technique has been tested for snowfall retrieval over land using high-frequency microwave satellite data. In this algorithm, observational data from satellite- and surface-based radars and in situ aircraft measurements are used to build the a priori database consisting of snowfall profiles and corresponding brightness temperatures. The retrieval algorithm is applied to the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B data for snowfall cases that occurred over the Great Lakes region, and the results are compared with the surface radar data and daily snowfall data collected from National Weather Service stations. Although the algorithm is still at an ad hoc stage, the results show that the satellite retrievals compare well with surface measurements in the early winter season, when there is no accumulated snow on ground. However, for the late winter season, when snow constantly covers the ground, the snowfall retrievals become very noisy and show overestimation. Therefore, it is concluded that developing methods to efficiently remove surface snow cover contamination will be the major task in the future to improve the accuracy of satellite snowfall retrieval over land.					vonderhaar, thomas/N-6724-2015; Jones, Andrew/D-3291-2012; Liu, Guosheng/D-3479-2011	Jones, Andrew/0000-0002-0995-4957; NOH, YOO-JEONG/0000-0002-1280-5258													2169-897X					DEC 31	2009	114								D24205	10.1029/2009JD012307	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009JD012307													WOS:000273255900003

Field observations, radiocarbon dating of aragonite (within the gypsum mounds) that yield ancient ages, and the narrow range of 834S and 818O values (d34Sgyp: 14.1-16.9%; d18Ogyp: 14.4-16.5%) indicates that the formation of the gypsum structures is related to the mixing of brines: the Dead Sea brine and ancient (last glacial) Ein Qedem type brine. These are Ca-chloride brines having different salinities and sulfur concentrations that satisfy conditions of an outsalting process whereby supersaturation of gypsum is attained by the mixing of these two brines in the offshore shallow water environment. Thermodynamic calculations (using the PHREEQC software) show that gypsum outsalting occurred when both brines were enriched with sulfate as compared to the present. The Ein-Qedem brine had higher sulfate when subjected to less intensive bacterial sulfate reduction. The Dead Sea was characterized by higher sulfate concentrations during intervals of low lake stands. The conditions of higher sulfate concentrations and enhanced discharge of the saline springs occurred repeatedly in the Dead Sea between -6.6 to 0.6 ka and were intermittent with periods of enhanced supply of sulfate to the lake by freshwaters.

J	Caballero, M; Vázquez, G; Ortega, B; Favila, ME; Lozano-García, S				Caballero, Margarita; Vazquez, Gabriela; Ortega, Beatriz; Favila, Mario E.; Lozano-Garcia, Socorro			Responses to a warming trend and "El Nio" events in a tropical lake in western Mexico	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lakes are sensitive ecosystems to climatic change but in the tropics it is frequently difficult to evaluate as there are few long-term records. In this paper hydrochemistry and phytoplankton data during the 2009-2010 "El Nio" are contrasted with non-"El Nio" conditions (pre- and post- the 2009-2010 event) and with long-term (23 years) meteorological and paleolimnological data from a lake in eastern Mexico. Meteorological data provide evidence of a recent (since year 2000) warming trend, and paleolimnological data show that the diatom assemblage changed at this time to a more diverse association, including low abundances of a small Cyclotella species (C. ocellata) and a small needle shaped species (Fragilaria nanana) to the previously dominant assemblage (Ulnaria delicatissima, Achnanthidium minutissimum). Phytoplankton associations during non-"El Nio" are consistent with the paleolimnological record (U. delicatissima-A. minutissimum, + Staurastrum sp.) but they changed at the onset of "El Nio" (May 2009), when N and P co-limitation favoured a Coelastrum reticulatum-C. ocellata assemblage. During "El Nio" winter (February 2010) colder temperatures led to a longer mixing period and a whole water column deoxygenation event that favoured a particularly low diversity association (Botryococcus sp.-Sphaerocystis sp.). The low diversity C. ocellata-bloom has no precedent for the last 23 years. The previous 1998-1999 "El Nio" had a similar low diversity assemblage but dominated by U. delicatissima. The different response of the phytoplankton to the two "El Nio" events is related with the warmer conditions since the year 2000, that lead to more stable stratification periods and more frequent or intense nutrient limitation, particularly during the warmer than average "El Nio" 2009-2010 summer. Under a global warming scenario, minor changes in ecosystem's base levels determine that even normal climatic variability events can cause unexpected changes in the ecosystem's diversity and species composition.

J	Liao, RW; Liu, G; Chen, JM; Zhang, L				Liao, Rongwei; Liu, Ge; Chen, Junming; Zhang, Lei			Interdecadal Variability of Summer Extreme Rainfall Events over the Huaihe River Basin and Associated Atmospheric Circulation	ATMOSPHERE												The Huaihe River basin (HRB) is an important economically developed and grain production region in China, which is severely affected by rainfall anomalies, especially extreme rainfall events (EREs). It is crucial to the features of interdecadal change in EREs and the contribution of EREs to summer-mean total rainfall amount (TRA) over the HRB. Using the observational 24-h ac-cumulated rainfall and the reanalysis products from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF), as well as the methods of composite analysis and Mann-Kendal and running t tests, we revealed that the EREs experienced a significant interdecadal increase from the period 1990-1999 to the period 2000-2009. The EREs, particularly long persistent extreme rainfall events (LPEREs), occurred more frequently over the HRB during the latter period and dominated the interdecadal increase in the summer mean TRA. An anomalous high-pressure ridge and associated anomalous anticyclone appeared around Lake Baikal during the latter period, which led to anomalous northeasterlies along the eastern flank of the anomalous anticyclone, inducing the southward intrusion of cold air flow from higher latitudes and associated anomalous ascent and more active convection over the HRB. As such, more EREs and LPEREs occurred during the latter period. The higher pseudo-equivalent temperatures also support more active convective ascent and relevant more EREs. The results may shed light on further understanding the effect of large-scale atmospheric circulation on the interdecadal variability of EREs over the HRB, helping mitigate the disastrous impacts of EREs on local ecosystems, agriculture, soil erosion, and societies.																				2073-4433				AUG	2022	13	8							1189	10.3390/atmos13081189	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13081189													WOS:000846333700001

S.; Spaeth, Sybille; Buchleither, Sascha; Mayra, Ulrich			A Review of Sooty Blotch and Flyspeck Disease in German Organic Apple Production	ERWERBS-OBSTBAU												Sooty blotch and flyspeck (SBFS) fungi colonise the surface of a range of fruits, especially apple, without penetrating the cuticle. Economic damage results from the exclusion of severely affected fruit batches from being marketed as table apples. A study of SBFS was conducted in 2007-2012 in the two largest German apple production areas, i.e. the Lake Constance and Lower Elbe regions. The absence of this disease complex from orchards under integrated pest management in both regions in all years was explained by the collateral effects of scab and storage-rot sprays with captan and quinone-outside inhibitors (QoI) such as trifloxystrobin. However, SBFS was economically relevant in organically managed orchards, being generally more severe in Southern Germany than in the North. In both regions, Peltaster cerophilus was the most frequently isolated SBFS fungus and was chiefly responsible for crop losses. Cyphellophora sessilis, Microcyclosporella mali and Schizothyrium pomi also contributed to SBFS in some organic orchards, whereas a diversity of additional species was confined to untreated orchards. Evidence was obtained that P. cerophilus overwinters within orchards, fruit mummies being one of presumably several colonised plant organs. Infections of young apple fruits were initiated at any time following the end of flowering, and P. cerophilus was capable of causing several infection cycles per season by means of conidial inoculum. The colonisation of sheets of waxed paper by P. cerophilus indicated that this species does not require fruit leachates for growth. No further expansion of colonies was observed during cold storage; instead, P. cerophilus was gradually displaced by other fungi. Differences in the susceptibility of apple varieties to P. cerophilus were due to fruit ripening, late-maturing cultivars being most heavily colonised, and to surface properties, varieties with a waxy bloom being conspicuously less strongly colonised than others. This fungus was unable to colonise russeted fruit areas. Repeated spray treatments with lime-sulphur and potassium bicarbonate throughout the season were effective and necessary to control SBFS in organic production. This strategy threatens the fungicide-saving potential offered by scab-resistant apple varieties. Cultural measures against SBFS include summer pruning as well as the manual removal of fruit mummies in winter.																			0014-0309	1439-0302				JUN	2016	58	2					63	79		10.1007/s10341-016-0266-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10341-016-0266-x													WOS:000376925700001

The population varied between 15 and 77, with peaks in Jan. and March before and after maximum ice coverage on the lake. The overall ratio of adults to immatures was 40:60, locally varying with prey availability. Most roosts were in small stands of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) in sheltered drainages within 2 km of the lake. Perch use was highly variable. Eagles fed on the most abundant prey source, but their diet varied as weather and prey availability changed. Big game carrion was the primary food source, followed in order by small mammals, waterfowl and fish.																			0038-4909	1943-6262					1984	29	3					335	341		10.2307/3671364	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3671364													WOS:A1984TH94800010
J	Fiedler, S; Höll, BS; Jungkunst, HF				Fiedler, Sabine; Hoell, Bettina S.; Jungkunst, Hennann F.			Discovering the importance of lateral CO2 transport from a temperate spruce forest	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Our study investigated the concentration of dissolved carbon at the point when water leaves the pedosphere and whether this amount represents a significant proportion of terrestrial carbon cycling. The investigations were carried out in a temperate forest catchment (Black Forest, Germany) over a period of I year. The annual export of dissolved C compounds (14.4 g C m(-2) year I) was dominated by CO2 (9.7 vs. 4.7 g C m(-2) year(-1) DOC). Even though the direct CO2 degassing at the spring was inferior (0.4 kg C year(-1)), considerably lower CO2 concentrations were measured 17 m downstream of the spring. This shows that a large proportion of dissolved CO2 (93%) originating from the pedosphere is not captured anymore within a short distance from the spring. The measured lateral C-transport was in the same order of magnitude as reported for the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) observed for German spruce forests (-4 to -55 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Therefore, the results clearly demonstrated that the lateral transport of dissolved carbon can be a significant part of terrestrial carbon budgets and for this study site CO2 was dominating this 'indirect' pathway. However, for generalisation, it is important to extend this investigation to other landscapes and climatic zones. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

However, the distribution of several taxa were significantly affected by plant species. Hyalella azteca (overall the most abundant species) and Enallagma spp. (the most abundant predator) were consistently most numerous in Ceratophyllum samples and least abundant in Vallisneria samples.

Recent changes in primary production and phytoplankton in the offshore region of southeastern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Phytoplankton abundance, composition, and productivity were monitored on a bi-weekly basis from March/April through November/December at two offshore stations in southeastern Lake Michigan in 1983-1987,1995-1998 and 2007-2008 (exception 1983-1984 which were sampled from May to August). During the spring isothermal mixing period, surface-mixed layer (SML) chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass (carbon) and water column primary productivity decreased substantially in 2007-2008 as compared to 1995-1998 (66%, 87%, and 70% decrease, respectively). Smaller or no decreases were noted between 1983-1987 and 1995-1998 (chlorophyll a 23% decrease, phytoplankton biomass 5% increase, and production 22% decrease). Phytoplankton composition also changed during the spring isothermal mixing period in 2007-2008 as compared to 1983-1987 and 1995-1998: all phytoplankton groups with the exception of cyanobacteria and chlorophytes exhibited dramatic reductions in 2007-2008. The pronounced changes in phytoplankton properties during spring mixing in 2007-2008 were attributed to the filtering activities of the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis). During mid- and late thermal stratification periods, SML phytoplankton chlorophyll a and phytoplankton carbon and water column primary production exhibited only one significant change across all decades (mid-stratification production in 2007-2008 as compared to 1995-1998 and 1983-1987). Phytoplankton compositional changes in the SML also were limited during thermal stratification. The size of the deep chlorophyll layer (DCL) in 2007-2008 was similar to or smaller than those in 1983-1987 and 1995-1998. However, phytoplankton composition in the DCL changed as net diatoms constituted <5% of total phytoplankton in the 2007-2008 DCL but over 50% in 1983-1987 and 1995-1998.

J	Pekkarinen, M; Lotman, K				Pekkarinen, M; Lotman, K			Occurrence and life cycles of Dermocystidium species (Mesomycetozoa) in the perch (Perca fluviatilis) and ruff (Gymnocephalus cernuus) (Pisces: Perciformes) in Finland and Estonia	JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY												In Finland Dermocystidium percae Reichenbach-Klinke was first recorded by Pekkarinen in the fins of a perch in 1988. Because it is a poorly known parasite, its occurrence and life stages are studied here. In occasional sampling during 1995-1998 and 2001, and more systematic sampling during 1999 and 2000 in two different lakes (one oligotrophic, the other slightly eutrophic), it was found to occur almost continuously, although sometimes very sparsely, in both lakes. The life cycle is maintained from year to year by overwintering cysts. Young perch acquire first infections in their first summer of life, and fish over 3 years possibly develop some immunity. In Estonia, in the Kasari River and the Matsalu Bay, the parasite seems to be very rare. Cysts of D. percae , capable of sporogenesis, can occasionally occur in the ruff, too. In perch in Finland, cysts were found differing from the longish and thin-walled cysts typical of D. percae . These roundish to dumbbell-shaped cysts with thicker walls are here suggested to belong to a different Dermocystidium species, called D. sp. Cysts of D. percae occurred in the skin of all fins, but most often in abdominal fins and rarely elsewhere. In ruff, cysts of D. percae were also found in the gills. Of the fins D. sp. favoured the first dorsal fin, but also occurred elsewhere, e.g. in the head region of perch. Cysts of D. percae develop from thin-walled, round plasmodium mother cells, about 10 mum in diameter, by elongating and increasing in size. The nucleus of the plasmodium mother cell degenerates, and a reticular chromatin-containing structure with dense centra spreads out between conspicuous lipid droplets in the plasmodium. Nuclei reappear during fragmentation of the plasmodium. The sporonts thus formed divide to form sporoblasts, which in addition to small lipid droplets acquire a non-lipid 'central' inclusion. The inclusion grows in size to the typical inclusion of the ultimate Dermocystidium spore. Sporogenesis both in D. percae and D. sp. takes place mostly in summer, and at least in D. percae can continue until autumn. In addition, both species can produce numerous zoospores from their spores within 2 days in water at 25degreesC and at slower rates at lower temperatures. The body of the zoospore is about 1.2-2.2 mum in length and the flagellum is about six times the body length. The zoospores may then slightly grow in size and transform into amoebae. Small cysts, which possibly originated from an experimental infection by zoospores of D. sp., developed in 0-group perch kept in an aquarium at 17degreesC. The two Dermocystidium species here discussed can be grouped together with some other species, in which nuclei reappear and the plasmodium divides late in development and in which sporogenesis, unlike that in D. vejdovskyi Jirovec and D. cyprini Cervinka and Lom, does not take place in compartments.																			0022-2933	1464-5262				MAY 20	2003	37	10					1155	1172		10.1080/00222930110120999	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222930110120999													WOS:000182847400001
J	Bird, BW; Abbott, MB; Rodbell, DT; Vuille, M				Bird, Broxton W.; Abbott, Mark B.; Rodbell, Donald T.; Vuille, Mathias			Holocene tropical South American hydroclimate revealed from a decadally resolved lake sediment δ18O record	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Oxygen isotope ratios of authigenic calcite (delta O-18(cal)) measured at annual to decadal resolution from Laguna Pumacocha document Andean precipitation variability during the last 11,200 years. Modern limnological data show that Pumacocha delta O-18(cal) reflects the average annual isotopic composition of the lake's surface waters (delta O-18(lw)), and that delta O-18(lw) tracks the isotopic composition of precipitation (delta O-18(precip)), which is largely controlled by the intensity of the South American summer monsoon (SASM). Based on these relationships we use down-core delta O-18(cal) as a proxy for delta O-18(precip) that varies with the intensity of SASM precipitation. Pumacocha delta O-18(cal) increased rapidly between 11,200 and 10,300 yr B.P. from -14.5 parts per thousand to -10.5 parts per thousand, reaching a maximum of -10.3 parts per thousand. by 9800 yr B.P. After 9800 yr B.P., delta O-18(cal) underwent a long-term decrease that tracked increasing Southern Hemisphere summer insolation, suggesting that enhanced SASM precipitation was linked to precessional forcing. Higher-frequency trends did not follow insolation and therefore represent other variability in the climate system. Millennial-scale trends from Pumacocha strongly resemble those from lower-resolution tropical Andean ice and lake core isotopic records, particularly the Huascaran ice core, and low elevation speleothems. These relationships suggest that tropical Andean isotopic records reflect variations in precipitation intensity related to precessional forcing rather than tropical temperatures. They also demonstrate a coherent pattern of SASM variability, although with differences between low elevation and Andean records during the late Glacial to Holocene transition and the late Holocene. Centennial and decadal SASM precipitation variability is also apparent. Reduced SASM rainfall occurred from 10,000-9200, 7000-5000, 1500-900 yr B.P. and during the last 100 years. Intensifications of the SASM occurred at 5000, 2200-1500, and 550-130 yr B.P. with the amplitude of variability increasing after 2200 yr B.P. These periods may represent SASM responses to ocean-atmosphere variability related to orbital and radiative forcing (e.g., El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the Intertropical Convergence Zone).

Upstream migrants were trapped most frequently from mid-April to mid-May, but mean date of capture varied significantly among years. Mean water temperature at time of capture also varied significantly among years, and several analyses suggested that lampreys were captured earlier in warmer years. Within years, catches of individual silver lampreys were clumped nonrandomly in time. Mean date of capture did not differ between males and females, Females were significantly longer and heavier than males. Preserved silver lampreys shrank significantly in total length and biomass, and mass-length regressions for preserved lampreys had significantly higher intercepts than those for living animals, Parasitic-phase silver lampreys were collected together with wounded yellow perch (Perca flavescens), white suckers (Catostomus commersoni), and burbot (Lota lota) at depths of 6-12 m along the western shore of Green Bay. The parasitic phase is apparently confined largely to Green Bay proper, and available evidence suggests that the Green Bay population is at least somewhat subdivided geographically. Silver lampreys and sea lampreys coexist in Green Bay, where both species achieve relatively large body size. In addition, recent sex ratios in both species are skewed in favor of females, and females reach greater adult size than males. Unlike sea lampreys, which achieve much of their growth during the fall, parasitic-phase silver lampreys grow primarily during the summer.																			0045-8511	1938-5110				MAY 3	1995		2					409	421																WOS:A1995QX93300015

John			Understanding the transfer of contemporary temperature signals into lake sediments via paired oxygen isotope ratios in carbonates and diatom silica: Problems and potential	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Although the oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18) of calcite (delta O-18(calcite)) and, to a lesser extent, diatom silica (delta O-18(diatom)) are widely used tracers of past hydroclimates (especially temperature and surface water hydrology), the degree to which these two hosts simultaneously acquire their isotope signals in modern lacustrine environments, or how these are altered during initial sedimentation, is poorly understood. Here, we present a unique dataset from a natural limnological laboratory to explore these issues. This study compares oxygen and hydrogen isotope data (delta O-18, delta H-2) of contemporary lake water samples at similar to 2-weekly intervals over a 2-year period (2010-12) with matching collections of diatoms (delta O-18(diatom)) and calcite (delta O-18(calcite)) from sediment traps (at 10 m and 25 m) at Rostherne Mere (maximum depth 30 m), a well-monitored, eutrophic, seasonally stratified monomictic lake in the UK. The epilimnion shows a seasonal pattern of rising temperature and summer evaporative enrichment in O-18, and while there is a temperature imprint in both delta O-18(diatom) and delta O-18(calcite), there is significant inter-annual variability in both of these signals. The interpretation of delta O-18(diatom) and delta O-18(calcite) values is complicated due to in-lake processes (e.g. non-equilibrium calcite precipitation, especially in spring, leading to significant O-18(calcite) depletion), and for delta O-18(diatom), by post-mortem, depositional and possibly dissolution or diagenetic effects. For 2010 and 2011 respectively, there is a strong temperature dependence of delta O-18(calcite) and delta O-18(diatom) in fresh trap material, with the fractionation slope for delta O-18(diatom) of ca. -0.2 parts per thousand/degrees C, in agreement with several other studies. The delta 18O(diatom) data indicate the initiation of rapid post-mortem secondary alteration of fresh diatom silica (within similar to 6 months), with some trap material undergoing partial maturation in situ. Diatom delta O-18 of the trap material is also influenced by resuspension of diatom frustules from surface sediments (notably in summer 2011), with the net effect seen as an enrichment of deep-trap O-18(diatom) by about +0.7 parts per thousand relative to shallow-trap values. Contact with anoxic water and anaerobic bacteria are potentially key to initiating this silica maturation process, as deep-trap samples that were removed prior to anoxia developing do not show enrichment. Dissolution (perhaps enhanced by anaerobic bacterial communities) may also be responsible for changes to delta O-18(diatom) that lead to increasing, but potentially predictable, error in inferred temperatures using this proxy. High resolution, multi-year monitoring can shed light on the complex dynamics affecting delta O-18(diatom) and delta O-18(calcite) and supports the careful use of sedimentary delta O-18(diatom) and delta O-18(calcite) as containing valuable hydro climatic signals especially at a multi-annual resolution, although there remain substantial challenges to developing a reliable geothermometer on paired delta O-18(diatom) and delta O-18(calcite). In particular, delta O-18(diatom) needs cautious interpretation where silica post-mortem secondary alteration is incomplete and diatom preservation is not perfect, and we recommend dissolution be routinely assessed on diatom samples used for isotopic analyses.					; Ryves, David/D-6434-2011; Barker, Philip/J-5938-2012; Radbourne, Alan/E-9372-2019	Barker, Philip/0000-0002-5334-9201; Radbourne, Alan/0000-0003-3167-5783													0009-2541	1872-6836				OCT 5	2020	552								119705	10.1016/j.chemgeo.2020.119705	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2020.119705													WOS:000571835700009
J	Estay, FJ; Colihueque, N; Yanez, M				Estay, Francisco Javier; Colihueque, Nelson; Yanez, Miguel			Reproductive performance assessed during three spawning seasons in a naturalized rainbow trout population from southern Chile	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Naturalized rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) populations are an important recreational fishing resource in the Araucanian lakes of southern Chile, but few reproductive studies have been undertaken to assess their sustainability. It is important to address this issue, since this analysis may provide information for improving management activities. In this study we carried out a biometric and reproductive analysis of naturalized rainbow trout breeders to describe their performance and to explore the variables that could determine fecundity, fertilization in addition to egg survival and size. We collected naturalized rainbow trout breeders from six tributaries of Calafque acute accent n Lake, during 2006, 2007 and 2012 to record their biometric and reproductive traits. Spawning and incubation were performed under controlled conditions in a hatchery facility to improve the recording process. In each spawning season, total fecundity (TF, No. of eggs/female), relative fecundity (RF, No. of eggs/kg female), fertilization rate (FR, %), egg diameter (ED, mm) and eyed egg survival (EES, %) were modeled as a function of biometric and reproductive parameters, using general linear mixed models. We used this statistical tool to explore the relationships between these reproductive traits and other breeder traits in order to identify all the potential combinations that could be linked to TF, RF, FR, ED and EES. The spawning period ranged from September to November (i.e., spring spawning season), with a clear spawning peak in October in all reproductive seasons. Mean TF (from 2275.9 to 3438.7) and RF (from 1730.5 to 1909.8) fell within the range of, or were close to, data reported for other Araucanian lakes, respectively. Mean values of FR and EES were relatively high, ranging from 88.8% to 93.3% and between 83.4% and 88.8%, respectively. Models indicated that TF is significantly affected by the interaction between female body weight and egg weight, while RF is affected by the combination of female body length and egg weight. In addition, a positive correlation was observed between female body weight and total fecundity, while an inverse association was recorded between relative fecundity and female body length. This trend is in accordance with the trade-off pattern between egg number and fish size described for naturalized populations of rainbow trout from the Northern Hemisphere. However, regression equations output suggests that the reproductive performance of the Calafque acute accent n Lake population has a more depleted fecundity in comparison either with naturalized populations from the Northern Hemisphere, or with cultured stocks of this species. Models for ED revealed that this variable is affected by egg weight and also by body length or body weight, all with positive correlations. This result concurs with observations reported for other naturalized populations of rainbow trout from North America, further supporting evidence that larger females of this species produce larger eggs than smaller females. Models for EES revealed the significant positive effect of fertilization rate and relative fecundity, being the latter an unexpected result, given that insignificant correlations between these variables have been found in cultured stocks of this species. Overall, the population analyzed exhibited a regular spawning period, and an optimal reproductive performance in terms of egg survival. To promote the sustainability of the naturalized rainbow trout of Calafque acute accent n Lake, we recommend the use of hatchery propagation of wild adults to support the production of fry to be used in subsequent restocking activities. This management effort can benefit because the broodstocks have a short spawning period during their spring run.					; Alvarado, Miguel/AAP-8591-2021; Colihueque, Nelson/H-5549-2013	Estay, Francisco/0000-0001-6228-8466; Colihueque, Nelson/0000-0002-8965-9172													0165-7836	1872-6763				DEC	2021	244								106107	10.1016/j.fishres.2021.106107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2021.106107		AUG 2021											WOS:000703895600005

Tests with partial CCA of three hypotheses revealed that the distributions of chironomid taxa were significantly correlated with summer surface-water temperature and maximum lake depth, but not sediment organic content. In addition, an exploratory CCA revealed possible relationships of chironomid fauna with residual longitude and Fe concentration. A weighted-averaging-regression/calibration model of the chironomid-temperature relationship (derived from a temperature-constrained CCA) allowed the summer surface-water temperature of lakes to be inferred from chironomid remains. Accurate quantitative reconstructions of late glacial and Holocene temperature variations should be possible from fossil Chironomidae.					Birks, H.

The morphology of the species was investigated using both light and scanning electron microscopy. Based on these results, the species could not be identified using the currently available literature and is therefore described as a new species: Pinnularia schoelynckiana sp. nov. The new species is characterized by rhombic-lanceolate valves, radiate, geniculate striae changing into strongly convergent near the apices and an undulating, lateral raphe. A detailed morphological comparison is made with similar Pinnularia species, described from the Antarctic Region and worldwide. Brief notes on the associated diatom flora and its ecology are added.

Spatial variability in dissolved organic matter quantity and composition in Midwest reservoirs, USA	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Reservoirs are globally ubiquitous and critical for inland carbon (C) cycling, but the coupled influence of land use and hydro-climatic fluctuations on reservoir C source and composition is relatively unexplored. In this study, we used chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorbance and fluorescence excitation and emission matrices modeled by parallel factor analysis to characterize the source and composition of reservoir CDOM. Water samples were collected from reservoirs along a land use gradient in Missouri, USA during a wet and dry summer, respectively. Dissolved organic C (DOC) and CDOM quantity assessed by absorbance at 350 nm (a(350)) were significantly (r(2) = 0.5; p < 0.001) correlated, with CDOM quantity per unit DOC increasing with percentage agriculture. Stronger correlations were observed in the wet summer compared to the dry summer. The influence of land use and hydro-climatic variability was further confirmed by redundancy analysis between CDOM compounds, reservoir limnological parameters, watershed characteristics, and precipitation anomaly (Palmer Drought Severity Index). Agricultural reservoirs were shallow and abundant in a(350), aromatic, humic acid- and fulvic acid-like components (C2), chlorophyll-a, and particulate organic matter. These OM signatures in agricultural reservoirs were more pronounced during wet summer conditions, indicating the greater watershed influence. In comparison, CDOM composition in deeper reservoirs was less influenced by watershed influxes. Further, reservoirs with longer residence times experienced internal CDOM processing and an abundance of low-molecular-weight, microbial (C3), and protein-like (C4) CDOM, particularly during drier conditions. Understanding the sensitivity of reservoir CDOM dynamics to watershed land use and variable hydro-climatic conditions will be useful for effective monitoring and resource management.

J	Wiecek, M; Martin, P; Gabka, M				Wiecek, Mariusz; Martin, Peter; Gabka, Maciej			Distribution patterns and environmental correlates of water mites (Hydrachnidia, Acari) in peatland microhabitats	EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY												In Europe peatlands are wetlands of postglacial origin. Because of climatic changes and agricultural activities (i.e. drainage and peat extraction), they are one of the most endangered ecosystems worldwide. Water mites are well known as indicators of changing environments in other ecosystems such as springs and lakes. For our study we selected seven peatlands located in North-Western Poland and focused on water mite distribution and associated habitat and water quality variables. We described water mite fauna in various microhabitats (aquatic and semiaquatic) along the mineral-richness gradient to test whether this gradient is reflected in the composition of water mite assemblages. We selected conductivity, pH and vegetation as variables reflecting the poor-rich gradient. Additionally, we measured water depth, temperature and dissolved oxygen, which are often important parameters for water mites. We also noted presence of prey and host taxa of particular water mite species. Based on physicochemical parameters we identified three types of habitats harbouring three distinctive species groups of water mites. We were able to distinguish species that appear to be typical of spring fens (e.g. Hygrobates norvegicus, Lebertia separata), connected with acidic, nutrient poor pools (e.g. Arrenurus neumani, A. pustulator) and species seemingly typical of temporary habitats dominated by Sphagnum mosses (e.g. Piersigia intermedia, Zschokkea oblonga, A. stecki). The poor-rich gradient is strongly reflected in the composition of water mite assemblages. We also found strong correlations between the water mite fauna and both conductivity and pH gradient. Our results show that water conductivity is the most important of the examined factors, driving mite-species distribution in peatlands.					; Gabka, Maciej/A-1415-2017; Martin, Peter/E-3110-2014; Gąbka, Maciej/A-1415-2017	Wiecek, Mariusz/0000-0003-1360-3540; Gabka, Maciej/0000-0003-0776-5295; Martin, Peter/0000-0003-2230-6484; 													0168-8162	1572-9702				OCT	2013	61	2					147	160		10.1007/s10493-013-9692-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-013-9692-8								23564226					WOS:000323662300001

Flow proxies have been found in tree-ring widths in temperate regions, but have rarely been used in humid subtropical environments because the relationship between tree growth and climate was believed to be weakened by limited seasonality and stress on tree growth from drought conditions. Tree-ring residual chronologies from two forests sampled from northern Florida correlate well with historical annual discharge (r(2) values as high as 0.47) from 3 of 15 river-gauging stations that were used to compare with the tree-ring chronologies. The best correlations occur where streamflow has little contribution from spring discharge or continuous flow from lakes and wetlands. Streams lack correlations with the tree-ring residual chronologies (r(2) values as low as 0.0002) where springs and continuous discharge from lakes mute variations in their flow. Tree-ring chronologies appear to be useful for reconstruction of prehistorical variations of some streamflow in humid subtropical regions, but interpretations of the reconstructions must consider the local hydrologic conditions.

In this study, the instrumental records (from AD 1871) and documentary evidence ( back to the seventeenth century) have been extended for about 10 000 years by reconstructing episodes of palaeofloods as recorded by sedimentological depositional indicators. A record of Holocene flood events has been established based on a lake-fill sedimentary succession in a small basin in the upper Glomma catchment. The flood events as deposited in Lake Butjonna are discrete, sharp-bounded, normal graded units of silt-sized sediments characterized by low organic and water content. The reconstruction of individual palaeofloods is based on loss-on-ignition, dry bulk density, grain-size analyses and several mineral magnetic analyses: initial susceptibility, bulk susceptibility (x), anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) and isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM). Based on 13 C-14 AMS dates, the age-depth model covers the Holocene from c. 9800 cal. yr BP until present. About 115 discrete flood events (ranging from 1 to 620 mm in thickness) have been detected. The recurrence interval is about 90 years with an occurrence probability of about 1%. Important results include: (1) a weak increasing trend of higher river flood activity toward the end of the Holocene; (2) an early-Holocene calm (low or no river flood activity) period with subsequent onset of flood activity around 7600 cal. yr BP; ( 3) a pronounced and well-defined river flood event correlated to the 'Stor-Ofsen' disaster that occurred in July AD 1789; (4) enhanced southerly winds that bring moist air from the Atlantic Ocean apparently lead to periods of higher river flood frequency.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				APR	2006	16	3					445	455		10.1191/0959683606hl940rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683606hl940rp													WOS:000236924000012
J	Neal, RA; Phillips, ID				Neal, Robert A.; Phillips, Ian D.			Winter daily precipitation variability over Cumbria, Northwest England	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Daily precipitation totals at 55 sites were used to investigate geographic variability in winter (DJF) rainfall over Cumbria, NW England, over an 11-year period. Winter is the wettest season (> 800 mm in the mountainous Lake District), with rainfall mechanisms closely linked to North Atlantic forcing. The Lamb weather type catalogue was used to identify rainfall distributions under different wind directions. Precipitation magnitude over Cumbria is much more sensitive to a change in wind direction than the geographic pattern in rainfall, with southwesterly (easterly) winds producing the highest (lowest) spatially averaged daily rainfall totals of 8.2 mm (0.6 mm). S-mode principal components analysis was used to identify the main patterns of precipitation variability. Three principal components (PCs) were retained as being statistically significant (cumulative explained variance for unrotated PCs = 84.3%), with a correlated PC structure (direct oblimin rotation) best describing the spatial variance in rainfall. PC 1 has a very high index of strength (variance measure = 40.9), indicating that there is one dominant rainfall pattern. PC 1 shows a gradient between wetter conditions in southwest Cumbria and over the central Lake District and drier conditions in NE Cumbria, and is usually caused by active zonal west to southwest flows. Almost of equal importance to PC 1 is PC 3 (variance measure = 39.3), which has a more uniform rainfall distribution than PC 1 and is usually caused by fronts stalling over the region. PC 2, which shows an east to west decline in rainfall totals, is much less important than PCs 1 and 3 (variance measure = 18.6). PC 2's rainfall pattern can be caused by easterly flows with high pressure over Scandinavia and low pressure over the Continent, or by strong southwesterly flows, with depressions often centred over Scotland. Finally, cluster analysis was carried out to identify precipitation regions for all days and for each wind direction. Clusters were found to be largely stable to changes in wind direction, with stations in the central Lake District often clustered together, thus highlighting the importance of orographic enhancement of rainfall in this region.					; Neal, Robert/AAU-2045-2021	Neal, Robert/0000-0003-2678-6016; 													0177-798X					NOV	2011	106	1-2					245	262		10.1007/s00704-011-0483-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-011-0483-z													WOS:000296014300018

Timothy			DATING HUMAN OCCUPATION ON DIATOM-PHYTOLITH-RICH SEDIMENT: CASE STUDIES OF MUSTANG SPRING AND LUBBOCK LAKE, TEXAS, USA	RADIOCARBON												The Great Plains of North America have a rich archaeological record that spans the period from Late Glacial to Historic times, a period that also witnessed significant changes in climate and ecology. Chronometric dating of archaeological sites in many areas of the Great Plains, however, is often problematic, largely because charcoal and wood the preferred materials for radiocarbon dating are scarce in this grassland environment with few trees. Two reference archaeological sites are studied here: Mustang Spring. and Lubbock Lake, Texas, USA. We carry out a geochronological approach based on a cross-study of carbon-derived data: combustion yield. delta C-13, C-14 age differences between high temperature and low temperature released carbon, and the C-14 age itself. A study that incorporates multiple approaches is required to solve issues induced by the sedimentological context, which is rich in both freshwater diatoms and phytoliths from quite different origins. Analysis of carbon-derived data allows us to draw a succession model of dry and wet episodes and to associate it with a chronological framework. In this way, we can assert that, for the Mustang Spring site, several human occupations existed from 11 kyr BP to similar to 8.7 kyr BP along the 110-cm-long series with an interruption of similar to 150 yr that is associated with a palustrine environment between the Plainview and Firstview occupations.

However, the subsidies of this carbon source in floodplain ecosystems have not yet well understood. We used a Bayesian mixing model and stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of primary food resources and dominant molluscs species, to estimate the relative importance of allochthonous carbon sources for consumers in a representative sub-lake of Poyang Lake during a prolonged dry season. Our study inferred that terrestrial-derived carbon from Carex spp. could be the primary contributor to snails and mussels in Dahuchi Lake. The mean percentage of allochthonous food resources accounted for 35%-50% of the C incorporated by these consumers. Seston was another important energy sources for benthic consumers. However, during the winter and low water-level period, benthic algae and submerged vegetation contributed less carbon to benthic consumers. Our data highlighted the importance of terrestrial organic carbon to benthic consumers in the wetlands of Poyang Lake during the prolonged dry period. Further, our results provided a perspective that linkages between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems might be facilitated by wintering geese via their droppings.

This approach aims at differentiating "local" from "regional" inputs by comparing distant sedimentary records. Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating methods were validated by historical events recognition [1-2] providing confident age-depth models spanning the last 250 years. In both lakes the sediment is lead-enriched compared to upper continental crust over the whole records. The human impact reached its maximum around 1970 AD, and then presents a rapid decline. Lead concentration and isotopic composition are correlated. When compared to data from a Mont Blanc ice core [3], Lac d'Anterne time-series yields excellent correlation over the last 250 years, confirming the accuracy of both dating process and record of atmospheric lead fall-out. Record from Lac du Bourget presents a similar pattern until 1985 AD when the signal from the high elevation sites ones, both in concentrations and isotopic ratio. Our data confirm the date of 1970 as the maximum of atmospheric lead fall-out over Western Europe.

FISHERIES RESEARCH												In this study the reproductive investment of six populations of Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) in Norwegian waters was contrasted in relation to trade-offs with body growth (relatively slow-relatively fast) and migration distance (stationary-migratory). Down-regulation of fecundity through the process of atresia as well as standardisation of fecundity to the prespawning stage were included as process-oriented reproductive factors, applying both histological and image analysis techniques. The further analysis included historic information on body growth as well as published information on fecundity from several stocks in the North Atlantic. The Norwegian spring-spawning (NSS) herring could be split into three sub-components: migratory (oceanic), likely semi-stationary (coastal) and stationary. The latter one as well as three other populations were sampled in relatively isolated semi-enclosed areas (pond, "lake" or fjord). The study documented clear signs of trade-offs migratory herring had a significantly higher growth rate and lower relative fecundity while stationary populations grew slower and presented higher values of relative fecundity. So these traits appeared highly plastic and for the first time explicitly demonstrated in the three types of NSS herring: stationary NSS herring had high fecundity and body condition while the truly migratory counterpart was low in both while the intermediate version was low in fecundity but high in condition. The literature-based analysis of other Atlantic spring-spawning herring populations seemed to corroborate the finding that slow-growing herring is relatively more fecund than the faster-growing populations.

Overall, ring-billed gulls (L. delawarensis) were the dominant species (59% of gulls counted) followed by herring (L, argentatus, 20%), Bonaparte's (L, philadelphia, 18%) and great black-backed (L, marinus, 0.2%) gulls. Ring-billed gulls displayed the most dramatic population changes over the 45-year period, increasing 23-fold (P <0.05) from 1951-1955 to 1981-1985. The population then declined (P <0.05) by 57% from 1981-1985 to 1991-1995, Population trends for Bonaparte's gulls followed the same general pattern as ring-billed gulls. Herring gulls showed an 11-fold increase (P <0.05) from 1951-1955 to 1971-1975 (10 years before the ring-billed and Bonaparte's peak) followed by a decline. Great black-backed gulls showed slight (P >0.05) increases among 5-year periods from 1951-1990 with a 3.3-fold increase (P <0.05) from 1986-1990 to 1991-1995, Early winter numbers of herring, ring-billed, and Bonaparte's gulls have stabilized or declined from peak numbers recorded. on western Lake Erie in the 1970s and 1980s whereas great black-backed gull population numbers have increased. Continued monitoring of both early winter and nesting populations, combined with studies of feeding habits and migratory patterns, are needed to evaluate long-term trends of Great Lakes gull populations and to provide a foundation for management programs to resolve gull-human conflicts.

J	SMITH, DG				SMITH, DG			A STUDY OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF FRESH-WATER MUSSELS (MOLLUSCA, PELECYPODA, UNIONOIDA) OF THE LAKE CHAMPLAIN DRAINAGE IN NORTHWESTERN NEW-ENGLAND	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Lake Champlain occupies a large shallow basin in northeastern North America and drains to the St. Lawrence River. The freshwater mussel fauna of the lake''s drainage system includes both Northern Atlantic and Interior Basin species. An analysis of the distribution of the mussel species in the eastern and southern drainage streams of Lake Champlain reveals that fall lines have controlled upstream migration at various stages during the lake''s postglacial history. Species composition differs above and below fall lines within drainage streams and varies geographically between drainage streams. Such distribution patterns may be explained by proposed periodic invasions of Lake Champlain by species during specific postglacial lake stages.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1985	114	1					19	29		10.2307/2425236	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2425236													WOS:A1985AQL5800003
J	Novak, PA; Chambers, JM				Novak, Peter A.; Chambers, Jane M.			Investigation of nutrient thresholds to guide restoration and management of two impounded rivers in south-western Australia	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Hysteresis between macrophyte and phytoplankton dominant ecological regimes has been observed in shallow lakes between 50 and 150 mu g/L total phosphorus (TP). This paper explores the capacity of these thresholds, initially proposed for European systems, to guide management and the successful restoration of macrophytes in two eutrophic rivers, the Canning River and the Lower Vasse River in Western Australia. Investigation of long-term nutrient data (1996-2007), revealed alternating macrophyte and phytoplankton dominance in the Canning River at TP concentrations in the spring and summer months of 152 mu g/L (+/- 20 mu g/L SE) prior to remediation. Management interventions, including the application of Phoslock (TM), were successful in reducing TP to approximately 100 mu g/L and resulted in persistent macrophyte dominance. Despite reductions from approximately 400 to 150 mu g/L TP in the Lower Vasse River, phytoplankton blooms persisted. Transplantation of four native, perennial macrophyte species simultaneously in the Canning River and Lower Vasse River resulted in only Vallisneria australis surviving within a nutrient regime of 130-300 mu g/L TP, concurrent with very high epiphyte loads. This research supports guidelines to managers of 150 mu g/L TP (high risk macrophyte loss), 100 mu g/L TP for maintenance of existing macrophyte beds, and less than 100 mu g/L TP for restoration of transplanted species other than V. australis. The efficacy of these thresholds is dependent on P limitation and we suggest optimum molar total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio greater than 20:1 and maximum total nitrogen concentration of 2000 mu g/L for macrophyte dominance.

A., Jr.			Copper transformation, speciation, and detoxification in anoxic and suboxic freshwater sediments	CHEMOSPHERE												The complex chemistry of copper (Cu) in freshwater sediments at low concentrations is not well understood. We evaluated the transformation processes of Cu added to freshwater sediments under suboxic and anoxic conditions. Freshwater sediments from three sources in Michigan with different characteristics (Spring Creek, River Raisin, and Maple Lake) were spiked with 30 or 60 mg kg-1 Cu and incubated under a nitrogen atmosphere. After 28-d, each treatment subset was amended with organic matter (OM) to promote anoxic conditions and evaluate its effects on Cu speciation. OM addition triggered a shift from suboxic to anoxic conditions, and sequential extractions showed that Cu accordingly shifted from acid-soluble to oxidizable fractions. Extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy revealed that Cu sulfides dominated all anoxic samples except for Spring Creek 30 mg kgxfffd; 1, where Cu(I) was predominantly complexed to thiol groups of OM. Covellite and chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) were the predominant Cu species in nearly all anoxic samples, as determined by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Copper reduction also occurred under suboxic conditions: for two of three sediments, around 80% had been reduced to Cu(I), while the remaining 20% persisted as Cu(II) complexed to OM. However, in the third coarsest (i.e., Spring Creek), around 50% of the Cu had been reduced, forming Cu(I)-OM complexes, while the remainder was Cu(II)-OM complexes. Toxicity tests showed that survival of H. azteca and D. magna were significantly lower in suboxic treatments. Anoxic sediments triggered a near-complete transformation of Cu to sulfide minerals, reducing its toxicity.					; Gustafsson, Jon/B-1655-2010; Burton, Glenn/Q-9714-2016; Cervi, Eduardo/G-7314-2019; Baken, Stijn/J-2843-2012	Gustafsson, Jon Petter/0000-0001-8771-7941; Burton, Glenn/0000-0002-8660-6294; Baken, Stijn/0000-0002-2483-3969													0045-6535	1879-1298				NOV	2021	282								131063	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131063	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.131063		JUN 2021						34111636					WOS:000679230700001

Extended studies were conducted to detect and quantify faecal contamination using microbial source tracking (MST) markers targeting bacteria and viruses. The prototypical crAssphage, a presumed Bacteroides-infecting phage discovered in 2014, showed superior specificity to human faeces and high abundance in untreated sewage water. This study evaluated the applicability of crAssphage markers, CPQ_056 and CPQ_064, as MST tools for detecting domestic sewage contamination in surface water in China. Validation tests based on domestic sewage and animal faecal samples demonstrated high sensitivity/specificity of 100%/96.7% for CPQ_056 and 100%/100% for CPQ_064 within the scope of this study, surpassing the performance of traditional Bacteroidales markers such as HF183 (100%/80.4% against sewage). MST markers targeting different hosts and validated in the Taihu watershed (CPQ_056, CPQ_064, BacUni, HF183 TaqMan, Pig-2-Bac, and GFD) were quantified in water samples collected from the inflow rivers of Taihu Lake in summer and winter 2020. The results showed the dominance of sewage/wastewater as the source of contamination in all faecal pollution. Spatial analysis revealed higher contamination levels in northwest rivers, which were those most impacted by human activities. There was also a diluting pattern downstream of some rivers. Correlations with water quality parameters indicated the co-occurrence of nutrient-related pollution and faecal contamination, particularly in areas with industrial, low-density residential, green space, and municipal service land uses. The findings established the efficacy of crAssphage markers in enhancing precision and accuracy in monitoring faecal contamination, offering valuable tools for policymakers and environmental managers.

J	Hudon, C				Hudon, C			Phytoplankton assemblages in the St. Lawrence River, downstream of its confluence with the Ottawa River Quebec, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Consistent differences in physical, chemical, and biological characteristics were observed along a transversal river section located 2 km downstream of the confluence of the Ottawa and the St. Lawrence rivers. Phytoplankton sampled at stations subject to the influence of the St. Lawrence River had a lower biomass, smaller cell volume, lower chlorophyll a, and lower taxa richness than did phytoplankton at stations influenced by the Ottawa River. The stations influenced by St. Lawrence River waters showed regular seasonal changes in phytoplankton biomass and composition, reflecting the major impact of the stratification and mixing cycles observed in the Great Lakes. By comparison, at the stations influenced by Ottawa River waters, monthly variations were found in biomass and composition correlated with temperature and water clarity, suggesting the effects of the watershed's morphology. A discharge reduction of 12% in the St. Lawrence River and 46% in the Ottawa River between summer 1994 and summer 1995 coincided, for stations in both water masses, with lower biomass and greater species richness and an increase in taxa that generate noxious smells and odours. Phytoplankton is recommended for use in monitoring the biological impacts of changes in water characteristics resulting from human activities and climate change in the Great Lakes watershed.

Trends in Lake Erie phytoplankton biomass and community structure during a 20-year period of rapid environmental change	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Since the 1990s, Lake Erie has experienced resurgent eutrophication due in part to climate change-driven increases in precipitation, which have combined with increasingly intensive agricultural practices in the region to produce excessive nutrient runoff into the lake. Harmful blooms of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa ("Microcystis") in Lake Erie's western and central basins (WB and CB, respectively) have been a highly visible consequence of this eutrophication, however few studies have characterized intra-or interannual trends in less abundant, though likely more edible, phytoplankton taxa over the last 25 years. Here, we used the 20-year Lake Erie Plankton Abundance Study (LEPAS) dataset to quantify intra-and interannual trends in the dynamics of six major phytoplankton groups in the WB and CB dur-ing 1995-2015. Cyanobacteria biomass in the WB increased >1000-fold during this period, while biomass of all other major taxa groups increased between 10-and 100-fold. Early summer (June-July) and spring (May) communities saw more modest directional change in the biomass of both edible and less-edible taxa as well as community structure. Around 2008, the CB also began to experience Microcystis blooms concurrent with those in the WB, with similar, though less dramatic consequences for phytoplankton community structure and edible biomass. The biomass of several phytoplankton groups exhibited intra-annual oscillations with a-5-year period. The mechanisms underlying changes in the phytoplank-ton community structure and their consequences for higher trophic levels are not well understood, how-ever increases in edible phytoplankton may be sustaining long-term upward trends in many zooplankton taxa.

The main causes are assumed to be bank erosion, lake eutrophication, mechanical damage to the reeds, and recreational activities. Countermeasures can be grouped into: reed protection against mechanical load (fences), wave dissipative constructions (refilling of substrate, brushwood fascine), nutrient export from the reeds (winter mowing), and supplementary measures (reed plantations, prohibition of access for the public). Favourable issues and undesired results are discussed. It is stated that there is a need for fundamental research and scientific surveillance of the restoration measures to avoid ill effects in the future.																			0925-8574					OCT	1995	5	1					51	75		10.1016/0925-8574(95)00014-A	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0925-8574(95)00014-A													WOS:A1995TB35900006
J	Wei, ZH; Zhou, LZ				Wei, Zhenhua; Zhou, Lizhi			The impact of earlier flood recession on metacommunity diversity of wintering waterbirds at shallow lakes in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain	AVIAN RESEARCH												The hydrological regime in wetlands plays an important role in the process of wintering waterbird meta community assemblage. However, increasing frequency of extreme climate and the intensification of human activities, such as the construction of sluices and dams, have resulted in frequently abnormal hydrological regime in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain. In recent years, earlier flood recession has become one of the main hydrological problems faced in the shallow lakes, having a great impact on wetland biodiversity. It necessary to understand the impact of earlier flood recession on waterbirds, an indicator of wetland biodiversity, and the metacommunity concept is helpful to elucidate the underlying mechanism involved in the processes assemblage by waterbird communities. In this study, we surveyed the wintering waterbirds at three sub-lakes Caizi Lakes during 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 and compared the richness, abundance, alpha and beta diversity waterbirds in and among local metacommunities under earlier flood recession and normal hydrological regime The results showed that the earlier flood recession reduced the species richness in the early stage and abundance in the late stage, it also reduced the Shannon-Wiener index in the early stage and increased the dissimilarity between and within waterbird metacommunities in the late stage. The partition of beta diversity showed that the turnover component played a major role in the process of waterbird metacommunity assemblage. It was found that the earlier flood recession reduced the richness, abundance in different stages of flood recession, which also increased the turnover of waterbirds. Metacommunities with high habitat heterogeneity had better resistance abnormal hydrological regime, which resulted in high dissimilarity between and within metacommunities. The results of this study provide important information for waterbird conservation and water level management shallow lakes in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain.					; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021	zhouZhou, li zhiLizhi/0000-0002-5702-4658; wei, zhen hua/0000-0001-5454-3463; 													2053-7166						2023	14								100102	10.1016/j.avrs.2023.100102	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.avrs.2023.100102													WOS:000994757900001
J	Hansen, AM				Hansen, AM			Response of ciliates and Cryptomonas to the spring cohort of a cyclopoid copepod in a shallow hypereutrophic lake	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The impact of a cyclopoid copepod population on the protozoa community (two ciliate categories and Cryptomonas) was assessed weekly during the spring cohort of Cyclops vicinus (one month duration) in hypereutrophic Lake Sobygard by in situ gradient experiments with manipulation of ambient zooplankton abundance. As C. vicinus always made up >92% of the zooplankton biomass, the response of protozoa is assumed to be a result of predation by the copepod. Significant effects of copepod biomass on protozoa net population growth rates were obtained in the four experiments. Copepod clearance rates were significantly higher on oligotrichs than on prostomatids and Cryptomonas but declined for all three protozoa categories during the first three weeks of the copepod cohort, probably because of the change in developmental instar composition of the copepod population. Grazing impact on protozoa at ambient copepod abundance was considerable (range, 0.05-0.87 day(-1)) and could, together with the estimated reproductive potential of protozoans (range, -0.2-0.87 day(-1)), account for the decline in abundance and biomass of protozoa during the cohort development. Carbon flow from the protozoa to C. vicinus (range, 2.8-23.5 mu g C l(-1) day(-1)) documents the presence of a trophic link between protozoa and the spring cohort of C. vicinus in Lake Sobygard.																			0142-7873					JAN	2000	22	1					185	203		10.1093/plankt/22.1.185	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/22.1.185													WOS:000084903900013

The landscape analysis, developed by municipalities around Lake Siljan, limited expansion of wind power, due to the strong visual impression of wind turbine towers. In order to facilitate the assessment of the visual impact of towers a view, from Tallberg, over the ring of height on the other side of Lake Siljan, has been photographed every ten minutes for a year (34,727 images, about 65% of the possible number during a year). Four towers are possible to see in the photos, three of them have been used in the assessment of visual impression. This contribution presents a method to assess visibility of wind turbine towers from photographs, describing the measuring situation (location and equipment) as well as the analytical method and results of the analysis. The towers are possible to see in about 48% of analyzed images taken during daytime with the used equipment. During the summer (winter) months the towers were apparent in 49% (46%) of the images. At least one red warning light was possible to see on towers in about 66% of the night images. One conclusion of this work is that the method to assess the visibility within digital photographs and translate it into the equivalent of a normal eye can only provide an upper limit for visibility of an object.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-9761-1				2013	8892								88921Y	10.1117/12.2028652	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2028652													WOS:000327342300050

The findings are integrated into the existing knowledge on large Barbus and Labeo spp., which coexist in most river systems in Africa and Asia. Large Barbus spawn on gravel beds within the river channel during floods in spring or summer. In continuously flowing regulated rivers, time of spawning is governed by water temperatures. They have moderate fecundity; large eggs, incubation time of several days and the larvae are initially immobile with large yolk sacs. In the impoundment they spawn in the inflowing regulated river with B. kimberleyensis spawning 4-6 wk later than the more cold-tolerant B. holubi, the dominant large Barbus. Survival is generally good and the juveniles disperse throughout the lake, but unseasonal release of cold water from an upstream impoundment may cause poor reproductive success. Labeo spp. generally spawn on newly flooded ground, usually leaving the main river channel. Spawning may or may not be preceded by a longitudinal migration. Labeos are relatively fecund with small (30% Barbus size) eggs which hatch quickly and the larvae swim in bursts up into the water column before sinking down again. L. capensis does not require a longitudinal spawning migration and breeds throughout the lake, depending on local conditions. Large temporal variation in gondadal development within the population can result in > 1 spawning. Dispersal within the lake is poor. L. umbratus uses larger inflowing tributaries for spawning than L. capensis and its juveniles have a much greater power of dispersal. Early dependence on external feeding and undependable occurrence of conditions for spawning and juvenile feeding makes for variable reproductive success.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1984	112	3					179	195		10.1007/BF00008084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008084													WOS:A1984SX37100003

Influence of regional parameters on the surface mass balance of the Eurasian ice sheet during the peak Saalian (140 kya)	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												Recent geologically-based reconstructions of the Eurasian ice sheet show that during the peak Saalian (approximate to 140 kya) the ice sheet was larger over Eurasia than during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at approximate to 21 kya. To address this problem we use the LMDZ4 atmospheric general circulation model to evaluate the impact on the Saalian ice sheet's surface mass balance (SMB) from proglacial lakes. dust deposition on snow, vegetation and sea surface temperatures (SST) since geological records suggest that these environmental parameters were different during the two glacial periods. Seven model simulations have been carried out. Dust deposition decreases the mean SMB by intensifying surface melt during summer while proglacial lakes cool the summer climate and reduce surface melt on the ice sheet. A simulation including both proglacial lakes and dust shows that the presence of the former parameter reduces the impact of the latter, in particular, during summer. A switch from needle-leaf to tundra vegetation affects the regional climate but not enough to significantly influence the SMB of the nearby ice margin. However, a steady-state vegetation in equilibrium with the climate should be computed to improve the boundary conditions for further evaluations of the vegetation impact on the ice sheet's SMB.

First steps of ecological restoration in Mediterranean lagoons: Shifts in phytoplankton communities	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Along the French Mediterranean coast, a complex of eight lagoons underwent intensive eutrophication over four decades, mainly related to nutrient over-enrichment from continuous sewage discharges. The lagoon complex displayed a wide trophic gradient from mesotrophy to hypertrophy and primary production was dominated by phytoplankton communities. In 2005, the implementation of an 11 km offshore outfall system diverted the treated sewage effluents leading to a drastic reduction of anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus into the lagoons. Time series data have been examined from 2000 to 2013 for physical, chemical and biological (phytoplankton) variables of the water column during the summer period. Since 2006, total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations as well as chlorophyll biomass strongly decreased revealing an improvement in lagoon water quality. In summertime, the decline in phytoplankton biomass was accompanied by shifts in community structure and composition that could be explained by adopting a functional approach by considering the common functional traits of the main algal groups. These phytoplankton communities were dominated by functional groups of small-sized and fast-growing algae (diatoms, cryptophytes and green algae). The trajectories of summer phytoplankton communities displayed a complex response to changing nutrient loads over tithe. While diatoms were the major group in 2006 in all the lagoons, the summer phytoplankton composition in hypertrophic lagoons has shifted towards green algae, which are particularly well adapted to summertime conditions. All lagoons showed increasing proportion and occurrence of peridinin-rich dinophytes over time, probably related to their capacity for mixotrophy. The diversity patterns were marked by a strong variability in eutrophic and hypertrophic lagoons whereas phytoplankton community structure reached the highest diversity and stability in mesotrophic lagoons. We observe that during the re-oligotrophication process in coastal lagoons, phytoplankton shows complex trajectories with similarities with those observed in freshwater lake systems.

J	Sanscrainte, CL; Peterson, DL; McKay, S				Sanscrainte, CL; Peterson, DL; McKay, S			Carbon storage in subalpine tree islands, North Cascade Range, Washington	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Quantifying carbon (C) pools in subalpine systems is an important first step to understanding the effects of climatic variability on terrestrial C dynamics in temperate mountainous regions. We quantified C and other soil characteristics for tree islands and the vegetatively distinct meadows surrounding the tree islands at three subalpine sites (Thornton Lakes, Heather Pass, and Harts Pass) in the North Cascade Range. O-horizon C storage ranged from 0.6 to 2.6 kg m(-2) in meadows and from 3.1 to 5.8 kg m(-2) in tree islands. Gradual vegetative transitions and similar soil depths result in similar quantities of mineral soil C in meadows and tree islands at Thornton Lakes (8.1 vs. 8.3 kg m(-2))and Heather Pass (7.9 vs. 10.3 kg m(-2)). Abrupt vegetative transitions and deeper soils may allow more mineral-soil C to be stored in meadows than tree islands at Harts Pass (14.1 vs. 7.2 kg m(-2)), although these mean values are not significantly different due to high variability in soil profile properties. Mean C concentrations in mineral soil horizons have no consistent relationship with vegetation type (tree island vs. meadow). Total ecosystem C storage is higher in tree islands (range, 35.1 to 98.5 kg m(-2)) than meadows (range, 7.4 to 18.0 kg m(-2)), primarily due to large amounts of C in the aboveground biomass of trees. Consequently, the effects of future climatic variability on C storage in subalpine ecosystems will largely depend on the degree to which conditions that limit tree island expansion (winter snowpack, summer drought) are affected.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				SUM	2003	77	3					255	268																WOS:000185863400008

Climate variation is filtered differently among lakes to influence growth of juvenile sockeye salmon in an Alaskan watershed	OIKOS												The physical landscape filters regional climate variation such that the environmental conditions an organism experiences are unique to the characteristics of local habitat features. While it has become apparent that populations may show watershed-specific responses to changing climate within a geographic region, the population dynamics of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. suggest that within watershed climate filtering is also important. Growth provides an integrated measure of habitat quality capturing the overall response of individuals to climate as filtered by their habitat and their response to the biological interactions in the ecosystem. We used two different long-term datasets, scales from returning adults and juvenile length measurements, to assess the response of sockeye salmon O. nerka growth during their juvenile life phase to single and integrated measures of climate within a watershed between 1950 and 2010. Scale growth showed evidence for differences among stocks rearing in different lake habitats within the same Alaska Peninsula watershed. These lakes have substantially different morphometry and showed opposite responses to changes in spring and fall air temperatures. Juvenile length data were also available for one of these stocks and indicated that density effects were relatively weak in contrast to the effects of temperature. While direct measures of juvenile length and measures derived from adult scales showed some similarity in their trends over time, they indicated opposite effects of air temperature. Throughout the range of Pacific salmon, climate change is altering freshwater ecosystems through changes to temperature, precipitation and associated variables. These data suggest that sockeye salmon populations are experiencing climate filtering at a sub-watershed scale. Maintaining connected, heterogeneous landscapes will therefore likely be important for providing productive habitat for sockeye salmon across a range of climate conditions that they are going to experience under new climate regimes.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				JUN	2014	123	6					687	698		10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00801.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00801.x													WOS:000335721400005

YOY lake trout may use inshore habitat to avoid predation; this habitat may be sub-optimal for growth. To test this, YOY lake trout were penned in nearshore and offshore pelagic areas of two arctic lakes. Toolik Lake had a lake trout population, the other lake, S6, did not. YOY lake trout in Toolik Lake lost weight, but those offshore lost less weight. The YOY lake trout in Lake S6 gained weight and those offshore gained more weight. The primary diet item of the YOY lake trout in both lakes during this experiment was the zooplankter Diaptomis probilofensis; it was also one of the most abundant species. However, its density inshore in Lake S6 was similar to inshore and offshore densities in Toolik Lake. The increased availability of alternative zooplankton prey in Lake S6 may account for the growth differential of YOY lake trout in Lake S6 relative to Toolik Lake. Bioenergetic modeling of YOY lake trout suggests that growth similar to that in the offshore of Lake S6 would be necessary for successful recruitment. If the reduced zooplankton availability in Toolik Lake leads to the reduced growth of YOY in the inshore and offshore pelagic areas, then these fish will be more susceptable to winter predation/starvation. For YOY lake trout to survive in Toolik Lake they most likely shift to feeding on benthic prey before the end of their first summer.																			0018-8158					SEP 21	1992	240	1-3					213	218		10.1007/BF00013462	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00013462													WOS:A1992JQ94000017

LOCAL PERCEPTION OF INDOOR AIR POLLUTION WITH USE OF BIOFUEL IN RURAL COMMUNITIES OF UCHALLI WETLANDS COMPLEX, SALT RANGE PAKISTAN	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES												More than 2.4 billion people around the world in the rural community depend on biomass fuel (wood, charcoal animal dung, and crop residue). Incomplete combustion of this fuel has led to increased amounts of indoor pollution and raise in global warming; this has further led to the increase in the incidence of diseases. Therefore, interventions to reduce biomass fuel related emission by alternative fuels and improved combustion efficiency can improve health, add to socioeconomic development. The area selected for sampling was the Uchalli Wetlands Complex which in the Northwest of Khushab district in Pakistan which houses three saline lakes surrounded by forest and villages. A questionnaire was designed with questions regarding the household fuel use and techniques to improve livelihood and to create awareness and locals from the age of 19-95 were interviewed with a majority of males, houses in the area were mainly of stone blocks and majority males in the area worked in the city. Combined family system was prevalent in the area (80%) with about 42% of the population having no formal education. A wide variety of stoves were observed in the area with wives having a major decision (69%) in fuel choice which mainly depended on the cheapness and availability of the fuel. The cooking being mostly done (79.8%) outside in summers and indoors in winters. Majority of the respondents (94.7%) were aware that liquid petroleum gas and natural gas are better ways of reducing pollution and decreasing the incidence of diseases which included using dry wood, proper ventilation and many others.

J	Roberts, EC; Laybourn-Parry, J				Roberts, EC; Laybourn-Parry, J			Mixotrophic cryptophytes and their predators in the Dry Valley lakes of Antarctica	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The ingestion rates of planktonic, mixotrophic cryptophytes in two perennially ice-covered Antarctic lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, were investigated during the summer of 1997-1998. 2. In Lake Fryxell, which is meromictic, ingestion rates increased with depth in November and were highest in a cryptophyte maximum close to the chemocline. In Lake Hoare, which is unstratified and freshwater, there was no significant difference in ingestion rates with depth. In both lakes, the highest ingestion rates occurred in early summer, decreasing in December and January. Ingestion rates varied between 0.2 bacteria cell(-1) h(-1) and 3.6 bacteria cell(-1) h(-1). 3. During November, mixotrophic cryptophytes removed up to 13% of bacterial biomass day(-1) and had a greater grazing impact than heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN). As summer progressed, the grazing impact of cryptophytes and HNAN became similar. 4. The maximum depth of cryptophytes in Lake Fryxell was predated by a population of the ciliate Plagiocampa. Plagiocampa had an ingestion rate of 0.13-0.19 cryptophytes cell(-1) h(-1). The grazing impact on the cryptophyte community was insignificant. However, the ciliate appeared to be indulging in temporary mixotrophy, sequestering the cryptophytes for a number of weeks before digesting them. 5. It is suggested that mixotrophy is an important survival strategy in the extreme lake ecosystems of the McMurdo Dry Valleys.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	1999	41	4					737	746		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00401.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.00401.x													WOS:000081929600007

Projected changes in rain-on-snow events and their impacts on summer low streamflow in the Great lakes basin	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE												Rain-on-snow (ROS) events accelerate snowmelt, influencing streamflow and ecosystems. While future changes in ROS events have been studied, their impact on streamflow remains unclear. This study uses an enhanced SWAT hydrological model, integrated with the SNOW-17 scheme, to evaluate how future projected changes in ROS may affect summer low stream flows in the Great Lakes Basin (GLB), where ROS significantly contributes to total snowmelt. The SWAT model, calibrated and validated with streamflow and snow (SWE) data, was used to generate ROS projections based on bias-corrected high resolution (similar to 6 km) CMIP6 GCMs. Model results indicate a 75 % increase in ROS frequency in northern GLB subbasins and approximately a 30 % decrease in southern GLB subbasins. ROS intensity is projected to decline in future climates due to reduced snowmelt rates, reducing summer low flows. This work advances the understanding of ROS dynamics, supporting improved water resource management for regions dependent on snowmelt-driven streamflow.

J	Pham, DT; Choi, SH; Kwon, JH				Pham, Dat Thanh; Choi, Sang-Hyun; Kwon, Jung-Hwan			Year-round spatial and temporal distribution of microplastics in water and sediments of an urban freshwater system (Jungnang Stream, Korea)	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Streams and tributaries can play a significant role in the transport of inland microplastics to rivers and oceans; however, research on in these water bodies is limited compared to riverine and marine environments. Analyzing microplastic abundance at higher spatial and temporal resolutions is crucial to comprehend the dynamics of in these water bodies. Therefore, this study investigated year-round spatiotemporal variations of monthly in surface waters and sediments along the Jungnang Stream, one of the main tributaries to the Han River in South Korea. The mean concentration of in the stream was 9.8 +/- 7.9 particles L-1 in water and 3640 +/- 1620 particles kg(-1) in sediment. Microplastic concentrations in surface waters during summer were significantly higher than in other seasons, positively linked to increased precipitation and river discharges. Polymer compositions mainly consisted of polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate, with the majority of detected smaller than 200 mu m. Fragment-shaped were predominant over fibrous ones. The estimated annual input and output of through surface waters were 1.2-207 kg (2.7-150 billion particles) and 11.3-272 kg (17-769 billion particles), with the summer months contributing more than 70% of the total output. The greater output in the Jungnang Stream's waters compared to its receiving waters (Han River) indicates transport from water to other environmental compartments, such as sediments. These findings highlight the importance of investigating microplastic abundances in surface waters and sediments with temporal resolution, at least across different seasons. Such investigations offer valuable insights into the spatiotemporal occurrence and dynamic transport of , providing essential information for water management and the development of policies in freshwater ecosystems.

J	ARVOLA, L				ARVOLA, L			SPRING PHYTOPLANKTON OF 54 SMALL LAKES IN SOUTHERN FINLAND	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The abundance and species composition of phytoplankton communities were studied rapidly following the spring ice-melt in 54 small Finnish lakes that form a unique mosaic of water bodies. Phytoplankton biomass and cell density varied among the study lakes with a factor 100 between the lowest and highest values. Highest biomass and densities of phytoplankton characterized small (< 0.05 km2) lakes with moderate or high water colour (> 80 mg Pt l-1). In contrast, biomass was low in clear-water lakes and lakes where water throughflow was strong. Typically one species dominated most phytoplankton communities, and usually comprised up to about 45% of the total phytoplankton biomass. Two-thirds of the 103 taxa observed were Chrysophyceans and Chlorophyceans. The most common taxa were Chlamydomonas spp. (Chlorophyceae) and Cryptomonas ovata (Cryptophyceae).

J	Wu, DY; Zhao, SY; Li, JY; Wang, WK				Wu, Danyang; Zhao, Shuyun; Li, Jianying; Wang, Wuke			Influences of atmospheric intraseasonal oscillation in mid-high latitudes on winter haze pollution over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												This paper analyses the intraseasonal evolution of the winter haze pollution over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region in China between 1979 and 2013, and the influences of the atmospheric intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) in mid-high latitudes. Two significant ISO signals of 10-20-day and 20-40-day are identified from the winter haze pollution over the BTH region, and their superposition notably contributes to the occurrence of haze pollution. On the 10-20-day timescale, the haze pollution is intimately associated with a mid-high-level southeastward propagating wave train that originates from the North Atlantic. With the wave evolution, an anomalous anticyclone reaches the Korean Peninsula-Japan, leading to strong descents and anomalous southerly winds over the BTH region, favourable for haze pollution. On the 20-40-day timescale, the atmospheric wave train originates from the eastern North America, propagates eastward to the northwestern Lake Baikal, and then turns southward to the northeastern China-Japan. The peak stage of the haze pollution is related to the resultant zonal dipole, with the anomalous cyclone over the northwestern Lake Baikal and the anomalous anticyclone over the northeastern China-Japan. The dominance of the mid-upper tropospheric anticyclone over the BTH region suppresses the development of convection, thus hindering the vertical diffusion and wet deposition of pollutants. Moreover, the anomalous westerly winds between the dipole weaken the incursion of cold mass from higher latitudes, thus further contributing to the peak of haze pollution.					wang, wuke/LOS-7187-2024; Li, jianying/GRE-7304-2022	Wu, Danyang/0000-0002-6270-1094; 													0899-8418	1097-0088				JUN 15	2023	43	7					3173	3188		10.1002/joc.8023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.8023		FEB 2023											WOS:000929552900001

Winter Dynamics in an Epishelf Lake: Quantitative Mixing Estimates and Ice Shelf Basal Channel Considerations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Milne Ice Shelf is located at the mouth of Milne Fiord (82.6 degrees N, 81.0 degrees W), on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut. This floating ice feature is attached to both sides of the fjord. During the melt season, the ice shelf acts as a floating barrier preventing surface runoff in Milne Fiord from flowing freely to the ocean. This results in a permanent layer of freshwater that floats on top of the seawater of the fjord, commonly known as an epishelf lake. Few studies address the physical characteristics of epishelf lakes. Here, winter data from a mooring installed in Milne Fiord epishelf lake during 2011-2019 is analyzed in the framework of a one-dimensional model in order to study mixing in the upper water column and infer the characteristics of a basal channel in the ice shelf. The results show that vertical mixing rates are higher in the epishelf lake than in the seawater below. Estimation of the Richardson number using a geostrophic balance approach reveals that enhanced mixing in the epishelf lake is associated with horizontal temperature gradients. In contrast to most studies on basal channels in Greenland and Antarctica, the results presented here show the basal channel of Milne Ice Shelf is apparently not evolving (melting) rapidly.

Features of Structural Changes in the Plankton Community of an Alpine Lake with Increasing Fish Density in Summer and Autumn	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												It is found that a large species of the order Cladocera, Daphnia (Ctenodaphnia) magna Straus, has disappeared from the zooplankton composition in the alpine Lake Sevan, Armenia, with an increase in the density of whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus L. This led to an increase in the quantitative characteristics of heterotrophic nanoflagellates, resulting in a decrease in the number and biomass of bacterioplankton. At the same time, a number of seasonal features of plankton transformation were observed. In particular, the number and biomass of planktonic invertebrates, including representatives of Cladocera, D. longispina O.F. Muller, and Diaphanosoma lacustris Korinek increased in July. The main reason for this was the change in the distribution of whitefish caused by an increase in their abundance, depletion of food supply due to the disappearance of D. magna, and a high water temperature. This contributed to the formation of the maximum fish density at greater depths than usual, where the trophic and temperature conditions were optimally combined. The reduction of a significant effect of fish on zooplankton can be associated with an increase in the trophic status of the lake under which grazing is compensated by a higher fecundity of invertebrates. An increase in the trophic status of the lake is indicated by an increase in the phytoplankton biomass, which is determined by the increasing amount of phosphorus regenerated by Cladocera against the background of a high water temperature. This not only compensated for grazing of algae and cyanobacteria, but also contributed to an increase in their biomass. In October, the pressure of fish on invertebrates in the water column increased due to an increase in their density and the patterns of their vertical distribution due to oxygen deficiency in the near-bottom layers. Under these conditions, the number of species and the proportion of Rotifera in the total abundance and biomass of zooplankton increased, while the total abundance and biomass of zooplankton decreased due to the filter-feeding crustaceans D. lacustris and D. longispina. However, the decrease in their abundance did not lead to changes in the biomass and structure of phytoplankton, which is associated with the decrease in the input of phosphorus excreted by Cladocera. Thus, the response of invertebrates and the groups of planktonic organisms they control to an increased density of the fish population depends on the vertical distribution of planktophages determined by the water temperature, oxygen concentration, and the quantitative characteristics of food objects.

J	Wu, JY; Cuddington, K				Wu, Jiayi; Cuddington, Kim			Effect of Temperature on Black Carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) Age at Sexual Maturity	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Black Carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) is one of the four invasive Asian Carp species (Bighead Carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis; Grass Carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella; and Silver Carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) in North America. As benthic predators, Black Carp poses ecological risks to unionids within the Great Lakes and could bring other changes to local benthic communities. One means of assessing invasion risk and potential impact is to determine how critical life history characteristics depend on environmental conditions in new regions. Age at sexual maturity is negatively correlated to the maximum per capita population growth rate and thus can be used to estimate potential population growth for invasive species. Previous studies have found a significant negative relationship between age at maturity and temperature for all three other Asian Carp species, but not for Black Carp. With a more comprehensive dataset, we demonstrate that the same relationship exists for Black Carp. Winter duration is the best predictor of Black Carp age at maturity, followed by average winter air temperature. This significant relationship between age at maturity and temperature was not altered in artificial growing environments. Our results suggested that for Black Carp, temperatures in the winter months are more important for its energy accumulation and maturation and may determine invasion risk in northern locations, such as tributaries of the Great Lakes.<br />						Wu, Jiayi/0009-0003-7647-574X													0906-6691	1600-0633				APR	2025	34	2								10.1111/eff.12823	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12823		OCT 2024											WOS:001337906800001

CYBIUM												Study of European eel (Anguilla Anguilla L., 1758) contamination by Anguillicoloides crassus in some Tunisian hydrosystems: its impacts on growth parameters. Information lacks about European eel (Anguilla Anguilla L.) infestation by the nematode Anguillicoloides crassus (Kuwahara, Niimi & Itagaki, 1974) in North African populations, and especially in Tunisia. In order to study the situation of this infestation in Tunisian hydrosystems, we: a) analysed the infestation rate and contamination evolution in the population of Ghar El Melh lagoon and "Ichkeul Lake-oued Tinja" system according to time (month, season, year) and we compared it with the Algerian. Moroccan and European eel populations; b) studied the parasite dynamics and contamination evolution by gender (undifferentiated, male, female) and development stage (elver, yellow, silver); c) and, finally, estimated the impact of this parasite on the vital functions of the eel (growth, condition, GSR, HSR, ISR) during its continental life. For comparison, we used samples of sub-adult eels from Bizerte lagoon and juveniles from Medjerda wadi. Our results showed that the infestation of eel populations in North Africa is relatively recent compared to European populations and that this parasite has evolved considerably since it appeared in Tunisia. However, the values of prevalence, mean intensity and abundance remain low compared to the values found for the eels in Algeria. Morocco and Europe. The infestation is more important in terms of prevalence, mean intensity and abundance in freshwater than in brackish or salt water. The levels of infestation appear to be strongly related to the salinity of the colonized water. We have also seen that the infection affects eels entering freshwater (stage VIA1 and VIA2). The infestation is higher in summer and/or in winter and the most parasitized eels are the undifferentiated and migrant specimens. Finally, we showed that Anguillicoloides crassus had neither influence on length and weight nor on the development of liver, gonads and intestines during continental eel life. The parasite seems to have a direct effect on swim bladder, which will probably affect the migration of eels towards the Sargasso Sea.																			0399-0974					SEP 30	2012	36	3					417	433																WOS:000311712500002

A Homogeneous Record (1896-2006) of Daily Weather and Climate at Mohonk Lake, New York	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Reliable, long-term records of daily weather and climate are relatively rare but are crucial for understanding long-term trends and variability in extreme events and other climate metrics that are not resolvable at the monthly time scale. Here, the distinct features of a continuous, long-term (1896-2006) daily weather record from Mohonk Lake, New York, are highlighted. The site is optimal for daily climate analyses, since it has experienced negligible land-use change, no station moves, and has maintained methodological and instrumental consistency over the entire period of record. Unlike many sites, the site has always used maximum/minimum thermometers rather than shifting to the automated Maximum/Minimum Temperature Sensor. Notable results from the analysis of this record include 1) a warming trend driven largely by trends in maximum temperatures, especially during summer, 2) increasing diurnal temperature range during summer, and 3) a reduction in the number of freeze-days per year with little change in the length of the freeze-free season. These findings deviate from some regional level trends, suggesting there may be value in revisiting selected, consistently monitored, and maintained stations similar to Mohonk for focused analyses of regional climate change.

We drilled 827 samples spaced along 5 km for their detailed directional study. The profiles registered a highresolution (> 10 cm/ka) palaeomagnetic record of the excursion (c. 211 +/- 13 ka) recorded by diatomaceous lacustrine sediments. We conducted palaeomagnetic and rock magnetic studies to investigate the reproducibility of the signal throughout the profiles. We performed low-field susceptibility v. temperature analysis that indicated that the main magnetic carrier is pure magnetite (Curie point 575 degrees C). The magnetic grain size also indicated single domain-multi domain (SD-MD) magnetite. The demagnetization was performed by alternating field experiments and the mean directions were determined by principal component analyses. The detailed behaviour of the palaeosignal is highly consistent since they are rapidly deposited sediments providing a detailed representation of the palaeofield. The dissected virtual geomagnetic pole paths in three different phases are highly internally consistent and are defined by clockwise and anticlockwise loops travelling from high northern latitudes over eastern North America and the North Atlantic to South America and then to high southern latitudes; then they return to high northern latitudes through the Pacific and over to Kamchatka.

Whether wet weather will suppress wildfire or promote them by increasing fuel reserves during the Holocene is not clear. We obtained a record of black carbon from a sediment core spanning the last 14.8 kyr from Gonghai Lake, in North China. There is a close relationship between the timing of wildfire activity and vegetation development driven by the East Asian summer monsoon intensity. On a millennial timescales, wet climatic conditions provide a sufficient biofuels reserve, in the same period wildfire increase; thus, the regional potential biofuels reserve is shown to be an important controlling of regional wildfire activity in the monsoon region of China, under natural conditions. We infer that with the strengthening of Asian summer monsoon caused by global warming, the wildfire carbon emission in Asian monsoon region may increase in the future.

Crassulacean acid metabolism contributes significantly to the in situ carbon budget in a population of the invasive aquatic macrophyte Crassula helmsii	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												The ecophysiological significance of Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) in the invasive aquatic macrophyte Crassula helmsii was studied in an English soft-water lake. The extent and the contribution of CAM to the carbon budget was examined in spring (April) and summer (July) along a depth gradient (0.5-2.2 m), covering the growth range of C. helmsii in the lake. Significant in situ CAM activity (30-80 meq kg(-1) FW) was present in all specimens, although it decreased with depth and hence correlated with the decline in photon irradiance. Potential CAM activity (60-161 meq kg(-1) FW), measured after exposure to low concentrations of CO2 in the day and high concentrations at night, were on average 2.7-times greater than in situ CAM activity. Overall CAM activity increased from April to July, which is consistent with higher potential carbon limitation caused by increased temperature and light availability. CAM activity in C. helmsii appeared to be carbon-limited at night because night-time carbon-fixation increased at raised, compared to ambient, concentrations of CO2. The high in situ CAM activity in C. helmsii was reflected in the contribution of CAM to the total carbon budget which, independent of depth and season, ranged from 18% to 42%. The amount of CO2 taken up in the night via CAM was 0.74 to 2.94 times the amount of CO2 lost in respiration, thus emphasizing the importance of CAM in refixation of potentially lost respiratory CO2. The onset of decarboxylation in the morning appeared to be under circadian control as there was a delay of up to 5.5 h between the start of the light period and a decline in cell acidity level. There was little variation in delta C-13 content (-21.69 to 23.49 parts per thousand) with season or depth suggesting, along with the estimated contribution to the carbon-budget, that CAM is important for the whole population of C. helmsii. CAM may confer a competitive advantage in relation to growth, which may be one of the reasons for the invasiveness of this species.

Additional sampling of 13 big female perch during the same season were carried out from the waters of Nato Biological Station on the Aland Islands in 1997-1998. High summer is the most important season for perch fishing and consumption not only for private families during leisure time but also for professional fishery including trade and export, processing and preparations for restaurants. Fillets of big specimen of perch, s.c. "fillet perch" or "sea perch" from outer coastal waters were chosen for the study to find out the levels of mercury concentration in these desirable fish. The mean concentration of mercury in the dorsal muscle tissue (fillet) of big female "sea perch" from the coastal waters of Tvarminne Zoological Station was calculated to 0.22 (SD 0.08), range 0.08 - 0.43 mg/kg, f wt and for big female perch from the waters of Nato Biological Station to 0.18 (SD 0.07), range 0.07-0.30 mg/kg, f wt respectively. The results show a considerably lower mercury level in big "fillet perch" caught from the outer coastal waters in both Finland (and Estonia) compared with the levels recorded of big "fillet perch" from fresh water lakes and reservoirs. Thus, the common expression "sea perch" may also be used in the form "Baltic sea perch" meaning big healthy perch with low concentrations of mercury and caught from the outer coastal waters in S and SW Finland (and W Estonia) when marketing perch for human consumption.																			0027-769X					APR	2001	45	2					109	113		10.1002/1521-3803(20010401)45:2<109::AID-FOOD109>3.0.CO;2-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1521-3803(20010401)45:2<109::AID-FOOD109>3.0.CO;2-0								11379282					WOS:000168350500009

Here, we used 12 years of weekly or fortnightly monitoring data (518 time points) to determine the occurrence of chytrids, fungal parasites of phytoplankton, to assess their seasonality and long-term (seasonally-detrended) dynamics in the pelagic plankton community of a temperate, eutrophic, and polymictic lake. Chytrid infections were observed in c. 75% of all samples with recurrent infections in multiple host taxa. Infection prevalence was highest in spring, but infections occurred throughout the entire year with an average of 2.3 host taxa infected per time point (ranging from 0 to 10 host taxa) and an average infection prevalence of 2.78% (ranging from 0% to 47.35%). Infected host biomass equalled that of the carnivorous zooplankton and decreased over time, while infection prevalence remained unchanged. Seasonal infection prevalence increased with phytoplankton biomass, but decreased with increasing temperature and phosphorus concentrations, reflecting that peak prevalence occurred in spring when temperature and phosphorus concentrations were relatively low. In contrast, seasonally-detrended prevalence increased with temperature, but decreased with increasing phosphorus concentrations. Chytrids are a common component of the pelagic plankton community with sizeable biomass and removing an-at times-substantial proportion of the primary production, challenging the long-standing underrepresentation of parasites in ecological studies. Chytrids responded differentially to seasonal variation and long-term trends in host density, water temperature and nutrient availability, highlighting the need to disentangle seasonal signals from long-term changes.

J	FAIRCHILD, GW; SHERMAN, JW				FAIRCHILD, GW; SHERMAN, JW			EFFECTS OF LIMING ON NUTRIENT LIMITATION OF EPILITHIC ALGAE IN AN ACID LAKE	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												The processes of lake acidification and lake restoration frequently involve major changes in DIC and DIN, both of which may potentially limit algal growth. We evaluate nutrient limitation of benthic algal biomass and species abundances during summers 1987 and 1989, before and after the liming of Lake Earnest (NE Pennsylvania) in November 1988. Limestrone addition caused immediate increases in pH from 4.7 to 7.2. Alkalinity was -34 .mu.eq L-1 in summer 1987, but rose to 620 .mu.eq L-1 in summer 1989, whereas DIN declined from 10.7 .mu.mol L-1 to 1.1 .mu.mol L-1. The algae were sampled after 45 to 46 d from clay flower pot substrates diffusing combinations of N, P and C. Algal biomass was strongly C-limited in 1987, but NP-limited in 1989. Mougeotia sp., which comprised > 99% of total algal biovolume prior to limiting, declined to < 1% of the community on control substrates, while Oedogonium sp. increased to 43% of total biovolume in 1989. The stimulation of chlorophyll-a accrual with C-enrichment during 1987 was consistent with the later increase in chlorophyll-a on control substrates following liming. Species enhanced by the diffused nutrients, however, generally differed from those which dominated the natural community.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				JUL	1990	52	1-2					133	147																WOS:A1990EH52600009
J	Garuma, GF				Garuma, Gemechu Fanta			Tropical surface urban heat islands in east Africa	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The horn of Africa is susceptible to droughts because of the persistent heat waves and insufficient precipitation. The growth of urban population and built-up urban environments exacerbate the overheating problems due to the urban heat island effects. Understanding the impacts of anthropogenic activities in such dry environments is important to control or mitigate extreme heat leading to droughts. This is required to preserve soil moisture, pothole waters, lakes and rivers that are required for pasture and drinking water. Nonetheless, the intensity and duration of the urban heat island effects have not been investigated in this region resulting in the underestimation of the intensity and severity of the extreme heat events. This study therefore performs the quantitative analyses of the intensity, duration and causality of the tropical surface urban heat islands (TSUHIs) for the first time using earth observation information at a regional to local scale. It also identifies the factors that control TSUHIs, considering background climate, population, vegetation and the impervious urban fractions. Results showed that the TSUHI in the capital cities of tropical east Africa varies from 1 degrees C in Dodoma to 4 degrees C in Kampala and reaches up to 8 degrees C in Khartoum. The mean temperature contribution to regional climate from 2000 to 2020 is 0.64 vC during the day and 0.34 degrees C during the night, a mean total of around 0.5 degrees C, a 0.25 degrees C increase per decade. This is a quarter of the increase in global surface temperature, which is approximate to 1.09 degrees C from 2011 to 2020 compared to the 1850-1900 level. Most of these capital cities in this region exhibited high TSUHIs from late summer to winter and are dependent on mainly population, vegetation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture in different proportions. This urban induced additional temperature has been intensifying droughts in tropical east Africa. Therefore, urban planners are advised to consider the impacts of TSUHIs to reduce the severity of droughts in the tropical east Africa region.

Much research has been done on the transport of human-made fine-grained matter in modern times. It is still unclear, though, what controls the transport process of fine-grained sediment from natural sources on the millennial scale. In this study, we present Holocene basin-wide fine-grained sediment records from the Shiyang River drainage basin system in arid China. Six Holocene sedimentary sequences were collected from various geomorphological units of the drainage system. A total of 1,043 sediment samples were obtained for analysis of fine-grained sediment; fifty-eight radiocarbon dates were acquired for establishing the geochronological frames. In addition, we synthesized the results from transient paleo-climate simulations to understand environmental backgrounds of the Holocene. Our records and simulations indicated that fine-grained sediment 2.5m content was relatively stable and less affected by monsoon intensities and circulations. Millennial-scale fine-grained sediment 10m content varied according to sedimentary facies, and it was negatively correlated with the winter monsoon intensity at eolian sediments. The fine-grained sediment 10m content increases dramatically at lacustrine layers in lake and alluvial sediments from the middle and lower drainage basin, showing its relationship with long-term moisture conditions that are closely related to monsoon precipitation based on climate simulations. This finding contributes to our understanding of the fine-grained matter trends against the backdrop of global warming.

The method is motivated by and applied to varved (annually laminated) sediment data from lake Kassjon in northern Sweden, aiming to infer on past environmental and climate changes. The resulting clusters and their time dynamics show great potential for seasonal climate interpretation, in particular for winter climate changes.

In this study, we used the physiology-based water quality model, the General Ecosystem Module (GEM) in FVCOM, to investigate the potential influence of transferred water on the water quality index (WQI) and comprehensive eutrophication state index (TLI) of the lake. A fuzzy synthetic evaluation algorithm was applied to quantify the value of the WQI objectively. Our results indicate that total nitrogen and total phosphorus (TN and TP) are the most dominant pollutants influencing water quality, accounting for 63.6% of the weighting. In addition, overflow of municipal sewage after rainfall contributed to the decrease of the WQI (class IV in spring and class V in summer). This slow-flow shallow water body was categorised as a light eutrophic lake according to the TLI calculation. As an important factor that influences pollutant retention and water exchange, residence time (tau(e)) was also considered. A multi-objective optimisation method was used as an effective method to guide practical management, considering the hydrodynamic conditions (tau(e)), water quality (WQI) and economic cost (M). First, the WQI, tau(e) and economic cost of different parts of the lake were investigated under different inflow discharge scenarios using our combined approach. Then, the Wolves Colony Search Algorithm was used to minimise the dimensionless objective function, which is comprised of the three factors above. The calculated environmental water demand of Lake Gantang (GTL) and Lake Nanmen (NML) was 0.0456 and 0.0417 million m(3) d(-1), respectively. Under optimal water diversion conditions, this lake changes to a mesotrophic lake of class III with good water body exchange capacity. Overall, our combined model can be a guide for the local government and decision-makers and used to evaluate the optimal amount of transferred water at a minimum cost for inter-basin management.

The monitored lakes (n=171, sampled every autumn since 1990 and in 1987) have a smaller watershed (usually headwater or seepage lakes), a larger, lake/catchment ratio, and lower base cation concentrations, alkalinity and pH than Finnish lakes on average. The monitoring network provides background data for air pollution dose/response studies, critical load calculations and for the modelling of acidification scenarios. The declining sulphate deposition seems to be reflected in small headwater lakes all over southern and central Finland as a lowering of the sulphate concentration in the waters. Nitrate concentrations in these lakes have been typically low in the autumn. The base cation concentration is not generally declining, as it is in deposition in many areas. The sulphate concentration in lakes has declined more than base cations. Hydrologically, the recent years have been quite variable because of varying annual precipitation. The variation in alkalinity and pH in typical Finnish lakes is dependent on the content of humic material derived from catchments. The monitoring period is too short to reveal consistent trends in major ion chemistry. However, signs of improvement in recent years can be seen; in comparing 1993 to 1987, years with similar organic acidity and base cations, it seems that the sulphate decline in lakes monitored is compensated by a significant rise in both alkalinity and pH.																			0049-6979					DEC	1995	85	2					571	576		10.1007/BF00476890	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00476890													WOS:A1995UB05300048

Samples were collected monthly in the surface waters between August 2007 and July 2008. We identified 10 principle functional groups. C-strategists and S/R-strategists with a wide range of tolerance dominated the phytoplankton assemblage. Seasonal variation was related to water column stability because of changes in hydraulic operation in October, January, and May. Functional group C (Asterionella formosa) and P (Aulacoseria granulata) dominated in August and September, whereas group Lo (Peridiniopsis niei) was the most abundant between February and April, forming a dinoflagellate bloom. Group B (Stephanodiscus hantzschii), X2 (Komma acudata), and Y (Cryptomonas erosa) were present throughout most of the year but were most abundant in late spring. A cyanobacterial bloom occurred from June to July, during which group M (Microcystis aeruginosa, M. wesenbergii) and H1 (Anabaena flos-aquae) were dominant. Green algae, characterized by group G (Eudorina sp., Pandorina sp., Pyramidomonas sp.) and J (Pediastrum spp., Coelastrum spp., Scenedesums spp.), were abundant after the bloom degraded. This sequence was corroborated by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The summary sequence of functional groups resulting from CCA was: C/P -> Lo -> H1/M/J/G. The dynamics of the phytoplankton community may be explained by the stability of water column, irradiance, water temperature, and nutrient structure.

Evaluation of passive microwave brightness temperature simulations and snow water equivalent retrievals through a winter season	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Plot-scale brightness temperature (T-B) measurements at 6.9, 19, 37, and 89 GHz were acquired in forest, open, and lake environments near Churchill, Manitoba, Canada with mobile sled-based microwave radiometers during the 2009-2010 winter season. Detailed physical snow measurements within the radiometer footprints were made to relate the microwave signatures to the seasonal evolution of the snowpack, and provide inputs for model simulations with the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model. Large differences in depth, density, and grain size were observed between the three land cover types. Plot-scale simulations with the HUT model showed a wide range in simulation accuracy between sites and frequencies. In general, model performance degraded when the effective grain size exceeded 2 mm and/or there was an ice lens present in the pack. HUT model performance improved when simulations were run regionally at the satellite scale (using three proportional land cover tiles: open, forest, and lake) and compared to Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) measurements. Root mean square error (RMSE) values ranged from approximately 4 to 16 K depending on the frequency, polarization, and land cover composition of the grid cell. Snow water equivalent (SWE) retrievals produced using forward T-B simulations with the HUT model in combination with AMSR-E measurements produced RMSE values below 25 mm for the intensive study area. Retrieval errors exceeded 50 mm when the scheme was applied regionally. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Nishri, A; Stiller, M; Rimmer, A; Geifman, Y; Krom, M				Nishri, A; Stiller, M; Rimmer, A; Geifman, Y; Krom, M			Lake Kinneret (The Sea of Galilee): the effects of diversion of external salinity sources and the probable chemical composition of the internal salinity sources	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												This paper investigates the chemical variations and evolution of Lake Kinneret (LK), the Sea of Galilee after the diversion of onshore saline springs through the Salinity Diversion Channel (SDC) which reduced the salinity of the lake water. The mass-balance approach enables to determine the average chemical composition of the unknown internal lake sources of salinity that in addition to other known sources, contribute salts and control the chemistry of the lake water. This study reveals, for the first time, the average chemical composition of the internal lake salinity sources. Mass balances show that the water discharge of the lake internal sources is 61 x 10(6) m(3) year(-1) and that these sources contribute 72,000 tons of chloride, annually. The SDC operation caused a long term decrease in the concentrations of Cl, Mg, Na, K, Ca, SO4 and Br in lake water. Concomitantly, the ionic ratios of Na/Cl, Mg/Cl. Ca/Cl, K/Cl and SO4/Cl have increased and Br/Cl ratio has decreased. The average chemical composition of the lake internal sources, is characterized by Na/Cl and Mg/Cl ionic ratios which closely resemble those measured in the two well known submerged saline springs, of Fulyia a and Fulyia b, and in water of a deep observation well, located north of the lake (referred to as KIN-8). The decrease in Br/Cl ionic ratio from greater than or equal to 3.58 X 10(-3) prior to the SDC operation, to 3.29(+/-0.11)X 10(-3) in mid 1990s implies that the major internal sources of Cl and Br to the lake are characterized by Br/Cl ratios less than or equal to 3.29 X 10(-3). Br/Cl ionic ratios somewhat lower than 3.29 X 10(-3) were found only in Fulyia a and Fulyia b springs and in KIN-8 water. It is therefore suggested that Fulyia Like water is the internal saline source which supplies most of the Na, Cl and Br to the lake. Sulphate, however, is contributed to the lake mainly (over 80%) through freshwater streams. Calcium and alkalinity originate mainly from freshwater sources, including internal lake flow of groundwater, lower in salinity but saturated with CaCO3. Thus, internal sources of solutes are mostly composed of the saline end member of Fulyia like water and of fresher groundwater. These conclusions have practical implications for lake water management. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

During 2013 and 2014, 5 Columbia-Snake River reservoirs were sampled monthly from May through September, along with 23 additional lakes and reservoirs sampled once each summer. Associations among C. fluminea veligers, other components of the plankton, and environmental variables were analyzed using non-metric multidimenional scaling and canonical correspondence analysis. Corbicula fluminea veligers were found in high abundances in all mainstem Columbia-Snake River reservoirs, with an annual mean abundance of 71.2 individuals per cubic meter (inds./m(3)). Only 3 of 23 lakes and (non-mainstem) reservoirs contained C. flurninea, with abundances considerably lower (maximum = 21.2 inds/m(3)) than in the mainstem reservoirs. A diatom-dominated community preceded the spawning of C. fiuminea in early summer at all sites. Corbicula fluminea veligers characterized the plankton community in late summer and were associated with cyanobacteria and high water temperatures. A third community, characterized by cyanobacteria, was apparent in non-mainstem sites in July and August. Ouranalyses describe the relationship of C. fluminea to the plankton community and environment, which contributes to our understanding of the possible effects of C. fluminea infestations and which waterbodies in the Columbia River Basin are at risk for infestation. Understanding the effects and environmental determinants of invasive mollusks will be increasingly important in the future with the possible arrival of zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) or quagga (D. bugensis) mussels to the region.

Measurement and modelling of evaporation from a coastal wetland in Maputaland, South Africa	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The surface renewal (SR) method was used to determine the long-term (12 months) total evaporation (ET) from the Mfabeni Mire with calibration using eddy covariance during two window periods of approximately one week each. The SR method was found to be inexpensive, reliable and with low power requirements for unattended operation. Despite maximum ET rates of up to 6.0 mm day(-1), the average summer (October to March) ET was lower (3.2 mm day(-1)) due to early morning cloud cover that persisted until nearly midday at times. This reduced the daily available energy, and the ET was lower than expected despite the available water and high average wind speeds. In winter (May to September), there was less cloud cover but the average ET was only 1.8 mm day(-1) due to plant senescence. In general ET was suppressed by the inflow of humid air (low vapour pressure deficit) and the comparatively low leaf area index of the wetland vegetation. The accumulated ET over 12 months was 900 mm. Daily ET estimates were compared to the Priestley-Taylor model results and a calibration alpha = 1.0 (R-2 = 0.96) was obtained for the site. A monthly crop factor (K-c) was determined for the standardised FAO-56 Penman-Monteith. However, K-c was variable in some months and should be used with caution for daily ET modelling. These results represent not only some of the first long-term measurements of ET from a wetland in southern Africa, but also one of the few studies of actual ET in a subtropical peatland in the Southern Hemisphere. The study provides wetland ecologists and hydrologists with guidelines for the use of two internationally applied models for the estimation of wetland ET within a coastal, subtropical environment and shows that wetlands are not necessarily high water users.

Temporal and Spatial Dynamics of Ice-Covered Upper Dumbell Lake (Ellesmere Island, Arctic Canada) during the Summer of 1959	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												We report on a limnological study of ice-covered Upper Dumbell Lake (Ellesmere Island, Canada) conducted during the summer of 1959. The lake was vertically profiled for physical (temperature, light), chemical (alkalinity, pH, oxygen, nutrients), and biological (chlorophyll a, gross and net primary productivity) variables on 21 dates spanning from early July to early September. Zooplankton density and age structure were also determined on four dates. Factors such as temperature, alkalinity, pH, and oxygen varied little with depth or over time, whereas nutrients (nitrate, dissolved silica, soluble reactive phosphorus), light, chlorophyll a, and gross and net photosynthesis varied substantially. Comparing July to August, nitrate and light intensity decreased while dissolved silica, chlorophyll a, and gross and net primary production increased, with two distinct peaks in algal biomass occurring over the month of August. Chlorophyll a in this lake was negatively correlated with nitrate concentrations, suggesting uptake of nitrogen as algal biomass increased. The copepod Limnocalanus macrurus was the dominant zooplankton taxon present; the age structure of the population advanced over the summer. This study reveals the dynamic nature of vertical habitat gradients even under the ice of Arctic lakes and provides important baseline data for conditions in an Arctic lake during the mid-20th century.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				MAY	2014	46	2					293	307		10.1657/1938-4246-46.2.293	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1938-4246-46.2.293													WOS:000336778500001
J	ANGINO, EE; ARMITAGE, KB; TASH, JC				ANGINO, EE; ARMITAGE, KB; TASH, JC			PHYSICOCHEMICAL LIMNOLOGY OF LAKE BONNEY, ANTARCTICA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake Bonney is a permanently ice-covered lake of 3.2 km2 in upper Taylor Valley, Victoria Land, Antarctica. The mean depth, without ice cover, is 18.7 m. The lake probably occupies a glacially overdeepened valley. The lake is meromictic. The maximal temperature of 7C coincides with the chemocline at about 15 m; the temperature decreases to a range of +2 to [long dash]4C in the bottom waters and to less then 1C beneath the ice. Calculations of superficial water inflow and of water loss by sublimation of ice indicate that the lake is slowly shrinking. Old shorelines above the present lake level attest to shrinkage. Part of the difference between water gain and water loss is made up by inflow of warm-spring water at depth. Such springs are probably the major source of heat for the lake. Total solids in the monimolimnion range up to 407.3 g/liter. Sodium and magnesium chloride account for 96% of the dissolved salts. An analysis of ionic ratios suggests that the lake waters may consist of trapped seawater highly modified by subsequent concentration by evaporative processes, by addition of ions from surrounding soils, and by addition of warm-spring water. The ionic concentrations are altered in part by the precipitation of CaSO4, CaCO4, and Na2SO4.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1964	9	2					207	217		10.4319/lo.1964.9.2.0207	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1964.9.2.0207													WOS:A1964WU65900005

However, our understanding of regional vegetation and climate changes influenced by the ISM from the Arabian Sea and the westerlies in the southwestern TP remains limited. Here, we present a pollen record from Lake Mapam Yumco covering the late deglacial to the Holocene. Results show that alpine meadow was sparsely distributed around the lake, with relatively high moisture from 13.5 to 11.7 cal ka BP. The early Holocene (11.7-8.3 cal ka BP) was the most humid period, marked by persistent alpine meadow and expanding steppe. During 8.3-4.2 cal ka BP, the climate became drier, with alpine meadow steppe dominating. After 4.2 cal ka BP, vegetation shifted to sparse dry steppe. Moisture conditions at Lake Mapam Yumco were humid in the late deglacial and early Holocene but drier in the late Holocene compared to the eastern TP, due to the ISM from different pathways and the influence of the southern branch of the westerlies. The stepwise drying trend in the Holocene reflects that the regional climate was mainly controlled by the ISM, which was driven by the summer insolation at 30 degrees N and the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Exotic pollen studies underscore the crucial role of the westerlies and El Nino-Southern Oscillations in atmospheric circulation. Dry events in the Holocene highlight that the North Atlantic region also impacts the climate in the southwestern TP.																			0341-8162	1872-6887				DEC 1	2025	260								109484	10.1016/j.catena.2025.109484	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2025.109484		SEP 2025											WOS:001587637500001

Consequence for the transport and the bioavailability of particulate phosphorus	OCEANIS, VOL 33, NO 1 AND 2	OCEANIS : SERIE DE DOCUMENTS OCEANOGRAPHIQUES				Conference on Mechanism of Transfer of Soil to Water and Management of Phosphorus Throughout the Watershed	FEB 01, 2007	Rennes, FRANCE					In developed countries, policies for controlling P fluxes were initially related to P of point origin (discharges of waste water). They have led to a very extensive reduction in the fluxes of dissolved R On the other hand, P fluxes associated with suspended particulate matter (SPM) remain unchanged; this phase is generally the dominant fraction of the P-total, being mainly of diffuse origin (from runoff and erosion of soils). The impact of these particulate transfers on the eutrophication of aquatic systems (watercourses, lakes, etc.) is a complex phenomenon which depends on the fate of suspensions (fast transfer, sedimentation, resuspension) and certain biogeochemical properties of SPM, in particular its aptitude to release or fix phosphate ions (uptake capacity of sediments), as well as the bioavailability of fixed P (i.e. capacity to supply the phosphorus requirements of phytoplankton and heterotrophic microorganisms). However, these properties of SPM are closed linked to i. the nature and land use of the soils from which it is derived and the resulting P load, ii. the history of SPM transfer according to the hydrological conditions and hence the season. The origin and dynamics of SPM thus prove to be key factors accounting for the behaviour and impact of particulate P in the receiving ecosystems. However, the origin of SPM is often poorly known, particularly in catchments dominated by grassland (erosion features only slightly visible in the landscape). We present some results on the recognition of the origin of SPM in small agricultural catchments (2 to 10 km(2)) dominated by stock breeding, but in different geomorphological contexts (on schists in Normandy, on moraine and molasse in the Alps). The origin of SPM is established by analysing the relations between solid load and flow and/or by identifying the geochemical and spectroscopic signatures of characteristic sources. Our study highlights the prevalence of sources linked to watercourses (bank erosion, resuspension of sediments) in this type of catchment. In particular, we note a very strong production of particles outside the periods of flood, in relation with the degradation of the banks by herds in spring and during the summer. These sediments, which are derived from the banks and stored temporarily in the river, are actually only mobilized and exported during the first high flow event following base flow periods (hydrological recovery). The P associated with these sources appears to have strongly differentiated properties. The particles resulting from erosion of the banks consist of materials with low P content, weak potential boiavailability and very strong fixing capacity. The sediments stored during periods of low stage in rivers become enriched in particulate P by forming a phase from the sorption of dissolved P. The SPM collected during flood episodes associated with hydrological recovery and resulting from the resuspension of these secondary sources exhibit the highest contents of bioavailable P and a very weak fixing capacity.

J	KWAIN, W; KELSO, JRM				KWAIN, W; KELSO, JRM			RISK TO SALMONIDS OF WATER-QUALITY IN THE TURKEY LAKES WATERSHED AS DETERMINED BY BIOASSAY	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Batchawana Lake, the headwater lake in the Turkey Lakes Watershed, was devoid of fish. Although a number of factors could cause this fishless state, we conducted in situ studies to partially address conditions related to lake acidification. The spring pH depression did not induce significant, consistent mortality to rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) or lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) caged in situ. In 1981, however, considerable mortality occurred to fish caged in Batchawana Lake during or immediately following the maximum spring pH depression. In the remaining lakes, mortality occurred later in the exposure period. Whole-body concentrations of Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ in rainbow trout caged (1980) in three lakes of the watershed were similar; however, K+ appeared slightly higher (but not statistically different) in fish held in the headwater lake. Static bioassays indicated that the 96-h pH LC50 for brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) was 3.80-4.09, considerably lower than the lowest pH, 4.66, observed during spring. Brook trout corralled in Batchawana Lake grew slightly faster and accumulated more Pb and Hg than fish held in downstream lake. Although pH and trace metal levels in Batchawana Lake may at times be inhospitable to fish, other factors likely contributed to the fishless condition of this lake.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1988	45			1			127	135																WOS:A1988Q784000016

The lowest lake level, from 18.5 to 15.0 cal ka BP, may reflect both less glacial meltwater and less precipitation entering the lake. Glacial meltwater generally increased from 15.0 to 7.2 cal ka BP and decreased after 7.2 cal ka BP, whereas precipitation generally increased from 15.0 to 10.2 cal ka BP, decreased from 10.2 to 7.2 cal ka BP, then remained stable and moderate to the present. Comparisons of our results with records in adjacent areas and beyond suggest that the glacial meltwater supply during the past 15 cal ka corresponds well with changes in the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM), which are driven by summer insolation at millennial time scales, whereas the precipitation does not match well with ISM changes during the Holocene. Therefore, paleohydrological processes at Lake Pumoyum Co have shown complex responses to climate change. Overall, our results emphasize that reconstruction of paleohydrological processes of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau should be carried out with caution because of glacial meltwater input.					; Peng, Ping'an/KOC-4726-2024; Zhu, Liping/AAC-4284-2022; Wang, Junbo/IVH-8446-2023	Zhu, Liping/0000-0002-4234-8748; 													0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2016	56	2-3					223	238		10.1007/s10933-016-9909-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-016-9909-z													WOS:000383989300009
J	Ceylan, MA				Ceylan, Mehmet Akif			An Important Summer Resort from the Past to the Present: Golcuk Lake and Highland	MARMARA GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW												The paper is a continuation of the previously published study dealing with the physical geography of the Golcuk Lake, as well as its surroundings. The aforementioned study tried to investigate the formation of the lake, morphometry and relief of its depression, geomorphology of its catchment basin, how it is fed, water level changes, physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the lake water in a relatively detailed manner. The Golcuk Lake and Highland is an important summer resort in the Western Anatolia region on account of its many natural and human attractions such as its location, means of transportation, magnificent sceneries of different geographic landscape, climate, water sources, existence of forest lands, transhumance and agricultural activities, etc. Likewise, there are many tourist facilities such as hotels, guesthouses, summer houses and tea gardens on the lakeshore to meet the needs of the visitors coming to the location on a daytrip or longer vacations, and furthermore, the resort is preferred by some sports clubs as a camping site. The paper deals with the recreational features of the Golcuk Lake and Highland, which has maintained its importance in almost any historical period, in a variety of aspects taking into consideration the process of historical development from the Aydinogullari Principality to the present. In this context, interest of the notable administrators of the state particularly during the times of the Aydinogullari Principality, the Ottoman Empire and the first period of the Republic in the resort is covered. Furthermore, some recommendations are made for preserving and putting the existing potentials of the Golcuk Lake and Highland to good use.																			1303-2429	2147-7825				JAN	2016		33					179	214																WOS:000443102100009

Quantitative summer-temperature reconstructions for the last 2000 years based on pollen-stratigraphical data from northern Fennoscandia	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Quantitative reconstructions of mean July temperatures (T (jul)) based on new and previously published pollen-stratigraphical data covering the last 2000 years from 11 lakes in northern Fennoscandia and the Kola Peninsula are presented. T (jul) values are based on a previously published pollen-climate transfer function for the region with a root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.99A degrees C. The most obvious trend in the inferred temperatures from all sites is the general decrease in T (jul) during the last 2000 years. Pollen-inferred T (jul) values on average 0.18 +/- A 0.56A degrees C (n = 91) higher than present (where "present" refers to the last three decades based on pollen-inferred T (jul) in core-top samples) are indicated between 0 and 1100 AD (2000-850 cal year BP), and temperatures -0.2 +/- A 0.47A degrees C (n = 78) below present are inferred between 1100 and 1900 AD (850-50 cal year BP). No consistent temperature peak is observed during the 'Medieval Warm Period', ca. 900-1200 AD (1100-750 cal year BP), but the cooler period between 1100 and 1900 AD (850-50 cal year BP) corresponds in general with the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA). Consistently with independent stable isotopic data, the composite pollen-based record suggests that the coldest periods of the LIA date to 1500-1600 AD (450-350 cal year BP) and 1800-1850 AD (150-100 cal year BP). An abrupt warming occurred at about 1900 AD and the twentieth century is the warmest century since about 1000 AD (950 cal year BP).					Birks, John/C-3103-2008; Birks, H.

In this study we analyzed two well-dated, high-resolution, published paleoclimatic records in order to determine the variability of precipitation in the EAMR during the Holocene. One record is a decadal-resolution pollen record from an annually-laminated Maar lake in Northeast (NE) China, and the other is a UeTh dated, multi-decadal-resolution speleothem record from Central China. Advanced time-series analysis of the two records provides unambiguous evidence for asynchronous summer monsoon rainfall variability on centennial to millennial time scales in the EAMR. The pollen and speleothem records indicate long-term and similar to 500-yr quasi periodic changes in humid/dry climatic shifts against the background of an insolation-forced climatic trend throughout the past 8580 years. Phases of wetter climate (during similar to 7000-5500 cal yr BP) and drier climate (during similar to 1400-300 cal yr BP) in NE China are closely related to different climatic phases in Central China. However, the similar to 500-yr cyclic rainfall changes in Central China lag those in NE China by several decades to almost two centuries. During the similar to 500-yr periodic changes in the monsoon, a climatic pattern encapsulated as "Northern drought, southern flooding" prevailed during an El Nino-like phase, whereas the opposite pattern "Southern drought, northern flooding" occurred during a La Nina-like phase. The asynchronous pattern of similar to 500yr climatic cyclicity between the northern and southern EAMR may have been caused by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, linked to low-latitude oceanic and atmospheric interactions.

In this work, we analyzed seasonal dynamics of silica-scaled chrysophytes in freshwater communicating environments which have considerable differences in water temperature between two ecosystems: the deep and cold oligotrophic Lake Baikal versus the shallower and warmer downstream Irkutsk Reservoir having mesotrophic features. During three seasons of the open water period of 2023, 38 species of silica-scaled chrysophytes were observed at 17 stations using scanning and transmission microscopy. The distribution of silica-scaled chrysophytes was shown to correlate with the water temperature. The greatest species richness was observed in the spring season in a large bay of the Irkutsk Reservoir (23 species), the smallest in the cold spring waters of Southern Baikal (up to 7 species). Widespread species living in Southern Baikal continued to grow in warmer waters of the reservoir. Using the example of silica-scaled chrysophytes, the stability of the high-latitudinal freshwater ecosystems affected by climate change is discussed. Continuous increment of the water temperature can lead to an increased abundance of widespread species and the displacement of psychrophilic species, affecting the overall biodiversity in such ecosystems.

This phenomenon is driven by variations in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the associated latitudinal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). However, the persistence of this phenomenon and the mechanisms involved during the late Holocene, a period characterized by minimal and stable global ice volume, remain unclear. This study presents a new 5.3-year-resolution stalagmite delta 18O record from central China spanning 4.4-3.0 ka BP. Our data reveal a multi-centennial weak Asian summer monsoon (ASM) event spanning 4.4-3.5 ka BP that is inversely correlated with intensified South American summer monsoon (SASM) activity. This antiphase relationship mirrors the pattern observed during the Little Ice Age (LIA), suggesting a consistent seesaw mechanism. Further analysis shows that an AMOC slowdown coupled with a southward shift in the ITCZ created this hemispheric antiphase during both events. El Nino-like conditions further strengthened the ASM-SASM antiphase relationship during both the 4.4-3.5 ka event and the LIA. Unlike the typical AMOC-solar correlation observed during the LIA, the weakened AMOC during the 4.4-3.5 ka event coincided with strong solar activity. Our results emphasize the persistent seesaw pattern during the mid-to-late Holocene transition, which is driven by changes in the AMOC and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) rather than solar activity.

Bacterial diversity and geomicrobiology of Winter Wonderland ice cave, Utah, USA	MICROBIOLOGYOPEN												The Winter Wonderland ice cave, located at an elevation of 3140 m above sea level in the Uinta Mountains of northern Utah, USA, maintains a constant sub-zero temperature. Seasonal snowmelt and rain enter the cave, freeze on the surface of the existing ice, and contribute to a 3-m-thick layered ice mass. This ice mass contains organic matter and cryogenic cave carbonates (CCCs) that date back centuries. In this study, samples of ice, liquid water, and exposed CCCs were collected to examine the bacterial communities within the cave and to determine if these communities vary spatially and between sample types. Flow cytometry showed that cell counts are an order of magnitude higher in liquid water samples than in ice. Epifluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy imaging revealed potential coccoid and bacillus microbial morphologies in water samples and putative cells or calcite spherules in the CCCs. The diversity of bacteria associated with soil, identified through sequence-based analysis, supports the hypothesis that water enters the cave by filtering through soil and bedrock. A differential abundance of bacterial taxa was observed between sample types, with the greatest diversity found in CCCs. This supports a geomicrobiological framework where microbes aggregate in the water, sink into a concentrated layer, and precipitate out of the ice with the CCCs, thereby reducing the cell counts in the ice. These CCCs may provide essential nutrients for the bacteria or could themselves be products of biomineralization. The initial findings on bacterial diversity and geochemical data indicate that microbes enter the Winter Wonderland ice cave from the epikarst, carried by seasonal meltwater. The presence of these microbes in water, cryogenic cave carbonates (CCCs), and ice suggests they originate from the soil and are preserved differently depending on the sample type within the cave system. Notable differences exist between the water and CCCs, as well as observable potential cells or calcite spherules. These findings warrant further investigation into the possibility of biological mineralization in this system. image						Eggleston, Erin/0000-0002-9598-3067													2045-8827					AUG	2024	13	4							e1426	10.1002/mbo3.1426	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mbo3.1426								38995161					WOS:001269506500001

Evaluating diffuse and point source phosphorus inputs to streams in a cold climate region using a load apportionment model	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Variation in the timing and quantity of diffuse versus point-source inputs of phosphorus (P) to streams can be evaluated by examining P concentration-flow relationships. Diffuse load inputs usually increase with stream flow (due to increased delivery caused by precipitation); whereas, point-source concentrations decrease with rising river flow (due to increased dilution). This study tested the suitability of a load apportionment model (LAM), a power-law function of flow, to estimate contributions of diffuse and point inputs to P loads for eight sub-watersheds in the Red River Valley, a cold-climate rural region of Manitoba, Canada. For all but two sub-watersheds, annual and seasonal (snowmelt and summer) models of P concentration versus flow best fit a strictly diffuse source contribution. The models identified significant point-source inputs (in addition to diffuse sources) in two sub-watersheds, during summer in both watersheds (consistent with the fact that wastewater from sewage lagoons is discharged to upstream reaches between June and September) and during snowmelt for one watershed. Application of a LAM proved to be a simple and rapid method for nutrient source apportionment as well as detection of unknown sources for cold-climate, rural sub-watersheds. Such information is critical for developing the most effective mitigation strategies to reduce P concentrations and eutrophication risk.

In this study, multi environmental tracers (hydrochemical parameters, stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and radioactive Rn-222) were employed to investigate the interaction between groundwater and surface water along two rivers (Tiangeli River and Nomhon River) in the Nomhon area, southeast of the arid Qaidam Basin, northwest China. Here we observed that the Rn-222 concentration of waters were distinctly different with a decrease order of groundwater > spring > river in this area. Along the Tiangeli River, the Rn-222 concentrations of groundwater, springs and river water were about 12,120-17,407, 3013-15,819 and 809-8205 Bq/m(3), respectively. This river was characterized by the high Rn-222 concentration of the river water and was investigated to be mainly fed by springs and groundwater discharge. Along the Nomhon river, Rn-222 concentration of groundwater and river water was about 6772-60,369 and 14-519 Bq/m(3), respectively. An average background of the Rn-222 concentration in the upstream of the river was determined to be about 43 Bq/m(3). A high Rn-222 concentration zone along the river appeared in the midstream, with a peak value of 519 Bq/m(3) and a distance about 10 km, indicating that groundwater discharged to the Nomhon River in the alluvial plain. A Rn-222 mass-balance model was constructed to estimate the groundwater discharge into the river, showing a maximum groundwater discharge of 0.37 m(3)/s in the midstream of Nomhon River during the sampling period. The stable isotopic compositions (delta D and delta O-18) and hydrochemical characteristics (hydrochemical type, TDS and EC) showed corresponding changes along these two rivers, which also provided evidences for the groundwater-surface water interactions in the Nomhon area.

Here we present a well-dated, pollen-based, similar to 20-yr-resolution quantitative precipitation reconstruction (derived using a transfer function) from an alpine lake in North China, which provides for the first time a direct record of EASM evolution since 14.7 ka (ka = thousands of years before present, where the "present" is defined as the year AD 1950). Our record reveals a gradually intensifying monsoon from 14.7-7.0 ka, a maximum monsoon (30% higher precipitation than present) from similar to 7.8-5.3 ka, and a rapid decline since similar to 3.3 ka. These insolation-driven EASM trends were punctuated by two millennial-scale weakening events which occurred synchronously to the cold Younger Dryas and at similar to 9.5-8.5 ka, and by two centennial-scale intervals of enhanced (weakened) monsoon during the Medieval Warm Period (Little Ice Age). Our precipitation reconstruction, consistent with temperature changes but quite different from the prevailing view of EASM evolution, points to strong internal feedback processes driving the EASM, and may aid our understanding of future monsoon behaviour under ongoing anthropogenic climate change.

Composition and abundance of the zooplankton community in the Bitter Lakes, Egypt, in relation to environmental factors	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The taxonomic composition of the zooplankton community of the Bitter Lakes, Egypt, was examined in 2003-2004 in relation to the spatial and temporal distribution of environmental factors. Copepoda were dominant, forming 49% of the zooplankton, followed by Protista at 37%. During the autumn, zooplankton in Small Bitter Lake were more abundant and different in composition, when compared with zooplankton populations in Great Bitter Lake. The high abundance of copepods in Small Bitter Lake occurred under conditions of elevated salinity, whereas lower salinity allowed rotifers and other freshwater forms to flourish near the outlet of a canal carrying urban waste. A reduction in zooplankton abundance was observed in an area impacted by heated water from the outlet of an electric power station.

Summer diet of juvenile lake sturgeon reintroduced into the Genesee and St. Regis Rivers, New York USA	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												The restoration of threatened species involves understanding multiple aspects of the life history and ecology of the target species. One important consideration in the restoration of threatened species is feeding ecology. We examined the summer diet of reintroduced juvenile lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) in the Genesee (n = 119, ages 1 and 2) and the St. Regis rivers (n = 40, ages 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7) of New York State, USA, in the summer of 2005. The most common taxa consumed were Diptera (88% of prey biomass) in the Genesee River and Ephemeroptera (35% of prey biomass) and Diptera (29%) in the St. Regis River. Diptera: (Chironomidae) was the major prey taxon in both benthic communities. Selectivity analysis showed a positive selection of Diptera by Genesee River lake sturgeon and an avoidance of Diptera by St. Regis River lake sturgeon. The St. Regis River lake sturgeon showed avoidance of Coleoptera, but positive selection of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, and Oligochaeta. Results indicate that the reintroduced juvenile lake sturgeon are growing and successfully finding prey in these two rivers and appear to actively select specific prey types.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				AUG	2021	37	4					507	513		10.1111/jai.14205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.14205		MAR 2021											WOS:000633515100001

Here we reconstruct high-resolution lake level changes for two closed terminal lake basins in the eastern and western Alxa Plateau (AP) at the fringe of the modern EASM. Nineteen well-preserved paleolake shoreline sequences at these two basins were systematically investigated and trenched. The chronologies for these shorelines were constructed using quartz optically stimulated luminescence dating and K-feldspar pIRIR dating. Our results indicate that: (1) lake high stands occurred in both basins of the AP during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5 and the mid-late Holocene; (2) paleolake level fluctuations on the eastern and western AP are asynchronous within these two periods. Lake levels peaked in the eastern AP during MIS 5e to 5c and the mid-Holocene, while the highest lake levels occurred in the western AP during MIS 5c to 5a and the late Holocene; (3) lake level changes in the eastern AP were contemporaneous with changes in EASM intensities during MIS 5 and the Holocene, while those in the western AP were asynchronous. These differences indicate EASM-precipitation was more intense on the eastern AP during periods of maximum EASM strength. Conversely, relative aridity in the western AP indicates that the EASM did not penetrate that far inland even during phases of strong monsoonal circulation (i.e. early MIS 5 and the mid-Holocene). Instead, precipitation and lake level changes in the western AP and much of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau appears to be related to changing meridional circulation intensity (Westerlies).

Influence of Aquatic Macrophytes on Age-0 Largemouth Bass Growth and Diets	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Macrophyte removal by lakefront property owners occurs on glacial lakes throughout the range of Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides, yet little information exists on how it affects recruitment of these fish populations. We hypothesized that with greater prey availability in macrophytes, age-0 Largemouth Bass consumption and growth would increase. To test this hypothesis, we conducted an in-lake experiment with age-0 Largemouth Bass in twelve 9.29-m(2) littoral mesocosms in glacial Chancellor Lake, Michigan, during summer and fall 2014. We removed macrophytes from mesocosm substrates to produce low-coverage, high-coverage, and vegetation edge treatments and determined treatment effects on consumption and growth at differing age-0 Largemouth Bass stocking densities (0.86-2.15fish/m(2)). When macrophytes were present, age-0 Largemouth Bass stomachs contained fewer zooplankton, contained terrestrial invertebrates more often, and contained aquatic macroinvertebrates less often than when macrophytes were absent. Age-0 Largemouth Bass consumed more fish prey in macrophyte edge and high macrophyte coverage enclosures stocked at moderate densities, resulting in total stomach content biomass increases that increased growth and, potentially, recruitment. Age-0 Largemouth Bass from enclosures with macrophyte edge and high macrophyte coverage grew 9.7 +/- 2.2% (mean +/- SD) and 8.3 +/- 1.9% longer, respectively, than their counterparts in low macrophyte coverage enclosures; fish in macrophyte edge or high macrophyte coverage treatments at moderate stocking density gained 109.3 +/- 45.1% and 110.7 +/- 45.0% more weight, respectively, than those in low-coverage enclosures. These results demonstrate a causal linkage between macrophytes and age-0 Largemouth Bass consumption and growth in lakes. We recommend that fisheries managers seeking to increase consumption and growth rates in age-0 Largemouth Bass consider protecting and restoring macrophytes in littoral habitats up to 60% coverage to potentially decrease mortality and improve recruitment.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	2018	147	4			SI		758	769		10.1002/tafs.10067	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10067													WOS:000439879700016
J	Fleming, SW				Fleming, SW			Comparative analysis of glacial and nival streamflow regimes with implications for lotic habitat quantity and fish species richness	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Growing interest in the differential responses of glacial and nival rivers to climatic forcing, and in ecological distinctions between the two streamflow regimes, suggests the need for a better comparative understanding of how the annual hydrologic cycle differs with presence or absence of catchment glacial cover. In this study, timing and magnitude characteristics of the average annual hydrographs of five glacierized and four nival catchments in the Southwestern Canadian subarctic are empirically identified and compared. Likely effects upon fish habitat are qualitatively assessed, and net fisheries potential is tentatively investigated using taxa richness data. The chief hydrological conclusions at P < 0.05 using Kolmogorov-Smirnov and empirical orthogonal function analyses are: (1) catchment glacial cover results in freshets that are longer, larger, and peak later than those experienced by the nival regime; (2) the winter baseflows of glacial rivers are also much higher on a unit-catchment-area basis; and (3) basin scale and degree of catchment glacial cover are of comparable importance in determining the magnitude of the annual hydrologic cycle. These differences arise from the greater availability, both in volume and over time, Of meltwater in glacial catchments, which in part reflects the consistently negative alpine glacial mass balances observed both in the present study area and globally under historical climatic warming. Such regime distinctions result in increased spawning season and winter aquatic habitat availability, which may in turn offset negative habitat characteristics previously identified for glacial river ecosystems. While previous studies have suggested that glacial influences tend to decrease macroinvertebrate diversity and increase salmon populations, preliminary analysis of available fish species presence/absence data from the current study area tentatively appears to suggest similar or, perhaps, slightly higher fish taxa richness relative to nival streams; in all three cases, however, catchment lake cover may play a key hydroecological modifying role. The results strongly confirm and extend existing understanding of glacial-nival regime differences with respect to both streamflow and fisheries ecology, and raise new questions for future research.

Cooling Effects Revealed by Modeling of Wetlands and Land-Atmosphere Interactions	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Wetlands are important ecosystems-they provide vital hydrological and ecological services such as regulating floods, storing carbon, and providing wildlife habitat. The ability to simulate their spatial extents and hydrological processes is important for valuing wetlands' function. The purpose of this study is to dynamically represent the spatial extents and hydrological processes of wetlands and investigate their feedback to regional climate in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America, where a large number of wetlands exist. In this study, we incorporated a wetland scheme into the Noah-MP land surface model with two major modifications: (a) modifying the subgrid saturation fraction for spatial wetland extent and (b) incorporating a dynamic wetland storage to simulate hydrological processes. This scheme was evaluated at a fen site in central Saskatchewan, Canada and applied regionally in the PPR with 13-year climate forcing produced by a high-resolution convection-permitting model. The differences between wetland and no-wetland simulations are significant, with increasing latent heat and evapotranspiration while suppressing sensible heat and runoff in the wetland scheme. Finally, the dynamic wetland scheme was applied in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The wetlands scheme not only modifies the surface energy balance but also interacts with the lower atmosphere, shallowing the planetary boundary layer height and promoting cloud formation. A cooling effect of 1-3 degrees C in summer temperature is evident where wetlands are abundant. In particular, the wetland simulation shows reduction in the number of hot days for >10 days over the summer of 2006, when a long-lasting heatwave occurred. This research has great implications for land surface/regional climate modeling and wetland conservation, especially in mitigating extreme heatwaves under climate change. Plain Language Summary A large number of wetlands exist in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) across the US and Canada. These wetlands are important to our environment as they can provide flood control and wildlife habitat and may cool the temperature, but they are poorly represented in previous land surface model (LSM) studies. In this study, we updated a dynamic wetland module in the Noah-MP LSM to reasonably estimate wetland extent and seasonal variation in the PPR. This wetland module shows significant impacts to the surface environmental conditions and interactions with regional climate. The results show that wetlands would effectively cool the air temperature 1-3 degrees C in summer, especially for regions with high wetland coverage. The implication of this study is very useful for wetland conservation agencies and climate scientists, as this cooling effect could potentially mitigate heat stress under climate change.

J	BOIKOVA, OS				BOIKOVA, OS			FEEDING OF FISH IN LAKE GLUBOKOE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Glubokoe is inhabited by 13 species of fish. The commonest are roach, bream, perch and ruff. Comparison of seine catches for 1950 and 1984 revealed a considerable decrease in the share of perch (from 31% to 2%) and ruff (from 18.5 to less than 0.1%) in 1984. The richest food resource in the lake is crustacean plankton. In summer, it is mostly consumed by roach. Estimation of the electivity shows that, unlike perch, roach selectively consumes small crustaceans (Bosmina and Polyphemus). Poor growth rate of all common species of fish points to their food limitation. In summer the diets of common species of fish are differentiated to a considerable extent. Of 36 pairs of combinations a high food overlap was found only in 2 cases: 1) O+ perch and Leucaspius delineatus, 2) yearlings and adult roach. Low diet overlap in fish during intensive feeding in summer probably reflects a feedback between the volume and intensity of food competition. The poulations of bream and ruff probably compete for chironomid larvae which inhabit the sublittoral, as perch, roach and Leucaspius delineatus probably do for large littoral insects. However, intraspecific competition appears to be more important than interspecific for the roach and bream populations (the two most numerous species in the lake).																			0018-8158	1573-5117				OCT 20	1986	141	1-2					95	111		10.1007/BF00007483	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007483													WOS:A1986F597000011

The Great Hinggan Mountains are main distribution areas of peatlands in high-latitude region in China and located at East Asian summer monsoonal margin, however, the variation of vegetation and climate in this region is still unclear. Based on the AMS C-14 dating, we analyzed the pollen assemblages to reconstruct vegetation history in Tuqiang (TQ) peatland, and we also used the principal component analysis to reconstruct the temperature and effective moisture and compared with other palaeoclimate records. Pollen assemblage denoted a coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest on the surrounding mountains, and peatland vegetation gradually evolved from herb community (Cyperaceae) to bush community (Ericaceae). The climate of north part in the Great Hinggan Mountains was mainly controlled by the East Asian Summer Monsoon which related to ocean-atmosphere interactions in the tropical Pacific. During the period from 3300 to 1150 cal yr BP, the dominant plant was Cyperaceae, with coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests bordered the peatland, which pointed to a relatively warm and wet climate. Between 1150 and 600 cal yr BP, the expansion of pine forests indicated a cool climate. The interval of 600-300 cal yr BP, the climate became cold and dry which related to the Little Ice Age. Since the 300 cal yr BP, Betula and Ericaceae dominated, the climate became warmer and drier. The obvious increase of secondary birch forests at the expense of pine forests may be the results of human disturbance, anthropogenic activities strengthened gradually and the variation of peatland vegetation was influenced mainly by anthropogenic activities rather than by climate since approximately 600 cal yr BP.

Habitat protection and management strategies will benefit from survival data as well. Thus, we monitored 153 radio-marked female mallards during 3 winters 1986-87 to 1988-89, to examine factors affecting survival in the PLR. Mean survival rate during the 100-day period 21 November to 1 March was 0.777 +/- 0.04 (SE). We did not detect any age or annual differences in survival. Precipitation and habitat availability varied among years. Survival rates (S) were higher (P < 0.10) for individuals in good body condition (s = 0.888 +/- 0.07) than those in poor condition (S = 0.661 +/- 0.09). The hunting season mortality rate was 0.018 +/- 0.05. Natural mortality, which included avian predation, during the 100-day study period was 0.210 (+/- 0.07). Crippling mortality could not be determined because of rapid carcass loss. Early season body condition and extended sub-freezing weather appear to impact mallard survival most in the PLR. Habitat management should encompass the entire PLR to include secondary habitats used by mallards during freezing weather.																			0022-541X					JUL	1993	57	3					570	577		10.2307/3809284	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3809284													WOS:A1993LN19900018

In phase one, dilution and anion substitution by SO4 controls episodic acidification. Phase two is characterized by interaction of snowmelt water with the catchment. A combination of several factors contributes to declines in pH and ANC. In forest and wetland ecosystems, organic acids greatly contribute to the pH depression in the streams. In the coastal tundra and forest-tundra zones, "salt-effect" acidification predominantes. The increase in toxic forms of trace (Ni, Cu) and rare (Fe, Al, Mn) elements during pH depressions may create stress conditions for the fauna of polar fresh waters during a flood period.

The spring influx of alewife into nearshore waters was linked with water temperature and coincided with a decline in the mean length of crustacean zooplankton and the virtual disappearance of zooplankters greater-than-or-equal-to 0.9 mm. Alewife moving inshore to spawn fed heavily on the largest zooplankters, negating the possibility that changes in zooplankton size were wholly a response to seasonal recruitment as waters warm and the composition shifts to Bosmina. Offshore, there was usually no significant (P < 0.05) change in mean lengths of zooplankton in the upper water column between April and May-June, and zooplankters greater-than-or-equal-to 0.9 mm always remained abundant, suggesting that few alewife were there from April through mid-June. We conclude that in large freshwater lakes where a planktivore is abundant, yet spatially concentrated, changes in size of crustacean zooplankton can facilitate understanding of the fish's movement and distribution.																			0706-652X					NOV	1991	48	11					2250	2257		10.1139/f91-264	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-264													WOS:A1991GU71800022

The Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study Winter Field Campaign provided the opportunity to study the effect of boreal forests on snow parameter retrieval in detail. Microwave radiometers (18, 37, and 92 GHz) were flown on board the Canadian National Aeronautical Establishment's Twin Otter. Flight lines covered both the southern study area near Prince Albert and the northern study area near Thompson, Canada. During the 1994 winter campaign, extensive ground-based snow cover information, including depth, density, and grain size, was collected along most of the flight lines, jointly by U.S. and Canadian investigators. Satellite data collected by the special sensor microwave imager are also used for comparison. Preliminary results reconfirmed the relationship between microwave brightness temperature and SWE. However, the effect of forest cover observed by the aircraft sensors is different from that of the satellite observations. This is probably due to the difference in footprint averaging. There were also several flight lines flown over Candle Lake and Waskesiu Lake to assess lake ice signatures. Preliminary results show the thickness of the lake ice may be inferred from the airborne microwave observations. The microwave signature relationship between lake ice and snow matches the results from radiative transfer calculations.

Upon closer inspection, the Backbone can be seen as a microcosm of American conflict. The area was settled only after the indigenous Iroquoian people were violently removed. This ethnic cleansing was followed by the imposition of an orderly grid. The landscape was carved into farmsteads that, following a brief period of prosperity, fell victim to conflict inherent in the capitalist system. Unable to compete with factory farming techniques and the increased commodification of agrarian products, local producers fell into ruin. This paper analyzes how these conflicts can be read in this seemingly pastoral landscape.																			0440-9213						2003	37	3					93	110		10.1007/BF03376614	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03376614													WOS:000185949300009
J	CUCIN, D; REGIER, HA				CUCIN, D; REGIER, HA			DYNAMICS AND EXPLOITATION OF LAKE WHITEFISH IN SOUTHERN GEORGIAN BAY	JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA												Instability of the population of Coregonus clupeaformis (Mitchill) in southern Georgian Bay from 1948 to 1964 was evidently partly due to intensive fishing. The population was discrete at least from 1956 to 1964 as determined by extensive tagging. From 1948 to 1964, estimated effective fishing effort varied 10-fold and annual yields almost 20-fold, with two cycles of abundance and scarcity. Strength of 1951-59 year-classes, defined as population size at age III, varied 40-fold. In spite of the marked instability, the population was in recent years more stable than any other whitefish population in Georgian Bay or Lake Huron. Almost all the commercial catch was made with gill nets of 4 1/2-inch mesh. In 1957, fishing depended largely on age VII-IX fish; by 1964, on those of age V and VI. Apparent growth rate increased during this period: in 1957 age XII fish weighed 3.4 lg; in 1964 age VI weighed 3.7 lb. From 1959 to 1964, reproduction depended largely on males age IV + and older and longer than 17 inches, and on females age V + and older and longer than 18 inches. Natural mortality coefficients (exponential model) averaged 0.41 for fish of the 1948-58 year-classes beyond age III. Gillnetting was largely restricted for 2 months in late spring and two in fall. In each fishing season these gill nets took about 40% of the survivors of a year-class after it became fully vulnerable, at ages V, VI, and VII during the early 1960s. Combining growth and natural mortality rates in biomass curve indicated that individual year-classes would provide highest yields when fished intensively at age IV, or slightly earlier than they were fished in the early 1960s. Yet the only hypothesis that might explain the continued existence of a fishable population was that relatively large parts of the habitat were either legally closed or unsuitable for fishing. Evidently the fishing was intense ind increasing the effort would mean risk of a population collapse.																									1966	23	2					221	+		10.1139/f66-020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f66-020													WOS:A19667317700005
J	LEMMIN, U				LEMMIN, U			DYNAMICS OF HORIZONTAL TURBULENT MIXING IN A NEARSHORE ZONE OF LAKE GENEVA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Time series of currents measured during the fall/winter period in a nearshore zone (near a headland and in an adjacent bay) of Lake Geneva, Switzerland, were used to determine horizontal turbulent mixing coefficients. The data were filtered to obtain components in the time range (0.5-12 h, which are suitable for mixing studies because spectra showed no energy source of system response there. From the filtered data, eddy diffusion coefficients were calculated by the integral time-scale method and eddy viscosity coefficients by the Ertel mixing length method. Viscosity coefficients were systematically higher than diffusion coefficients by a factor of at least two. Long-term horizontal turbulent mixing coefficients calculated over periods of several months were of order 103 cm2 s-1, a factor of 10 lower than coefficients obtained fo costal zones of larger lakes. Short-term (3 d) mixing coefficients varied between 102 cm2 s-1 for quiet background situations and 104 cm2 s-1 for periods of wind-induced, large-scale advection. This variability was traced to the history of wind events, indicating that energy input is not sufficiently homogeneous in time to maintain mixing at a constant level. Sheltering by local topography caused the sensitivity of the mixing coefficients to wind direction. Variability in space, with larger values at the headland and smaller ones inside the bay, underlined the modifying influence of shoreline geometry. Inside the bay, diffusion diagrams show that near the surface mixing is generated by shear, while near the bottom inertial subrange diffusion is found. The importance of shear is also evidenced by a correlation between wind forcing and diffusion coefficients for events of long wind fetch. Near the headland none of these simple concepts hold because local topography influences mixing.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	1989	34	2					420	434		10.4319/lo.1989.34.2.0420	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1989.34.2.0420													WOS:A1989U538800014

Spawning begins in spring 1 day after the daily temperature exceeds 5.degree. C. The peak is on the 3rd day, and half of the egg clumps appear within 5 days. Hatching of the eggs takes 4-17 days (median 14 days). Most egg clumps were isolated from each other in ditches. Hatchability of the eggs was usually over 90%. In 1 spring drought caused fairly high mortality. Great annual variation was observed in the size of a small local population. The females laid 1000 .+-. 290 eggs; no geographical variation was observed in Finland. In Finland spawning takes place in various types of water.

J	Duguay, CR; Lafleur, PM				Duguay, CR; Lafleur, PM			Determining depth and ice thickness of shallow sub-Arctic lakes using space-borne optical and SAR data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												An approach to determine depth and ice thickness of shallow lakes and ponds using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and European Remote Sensing (ERS)-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is presented. A summertime Landsat TM image is used to map lake bathymetry and multi-date ERS-1 images acquired during winter are utilized to determine when and which lakes freeze to the bottom during winter. The two remotely sensed derived products are then combined to estimate ice thickness from lakes and ponds on a monthly basis. The approach has been developed and tested successfully in a sub-Arctic tundra-forest landscape in the Hudson Bay Lowland near Churchill, Manitoba, Canada. Lake depth estimates derived from Landsat TM band 2 generally compared well with measurements obtained in the field, especially in the tundra zone [rms error (RMSE) = 15 cm]. Maximum ice thickness estimates were also within the range of those typically measured during winter in this study area (tundra and forest-tundra zones congruent to 1.6 m; open forest zone congruent to 1.2 m). Results indicate that the approach is particularly well suited for estimating depth and ice thickness of shallow oligotrophic and ultra-oligotrophic lakes that are widespread in many regions above treeline. However, the results also suggest that the Landsat-based approach will require further testing and improvement if one wishes to map bathymetry for shallow lakes in which large nutrient concentrations or amounts of suspended sediments are found.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850; 													0143-1161	1366-5901				FEB 10	2003	24	3					475	489		10.1080/01431160304992	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431160304992													WOS:000180777100004

Size fractionation and optical properties of dissolved organic matter in the continuum soil solution-bog-river and terminal lake of a boreal watershed	ORGANIC GEOCHEMISTRY												The size distribution and speciation of organic matter (OM) in soil solution, bog, stream, and humic and clearwater lake in the north boreal zone (Karelia region, north west Russia) during the summer base-flow period for several years were investigated. The samples were filtered in the field using cascade filtration through progressively decreasing pore size (100, 20, 10, 5, 0.8, 0.4, 0.22, 0.1, 0.046 mu m, 100 kDa, 10 kDa and 1 kDa) followed by dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis, UV-vis and size exclusion chromatography measurements. Surrogate parameters, such as specific UV absorbance (SUVA; absorbance at 254 nm normalized for DOC concentration in l mg (1) m (1)) and the absorbance ratios E-254/E-436, E-280/E-350, E-254/E-365, E-365/E-470 and E-470/E-655 (ratio of spectrophotometric absorbance of the sample at two wavelengths) were applied for the characterization of OM in filtered and ultrafiltered water from soil solution, bog, river and lake. In the < 0.22 mu m filtrates, there was a systematic decrease in DOC concentration, C/N ratio, SUVA (hydrophobicity and aromaticity) and proportion of colloidal (1 kDa-0.22 mu m) OC along the watershed profile from peat bog soil solution, feeding humic lake, to the middle course of the stream towards the terminal oligotrophic lake. Within the filtrates and ultrafiltrates of soil solution and terminal lake, C/N increased from 100 to 140 and from 7 to 25 for 0.22-10 mu m and < 1 kDa fractions, respectively. SUVA, degree of humification, hydrophobicity and aromaticity generally increased from high molecular weight (HMW) to low molecular weight (LMW) fractions, being highest in the < 1 kDa fraction. The results allowed a comprehensive view of DOM transport and transformation among various size fractions within a small boreal watershed that can serve as an analogue of small rivers discharge to the Arctic Ocean. It follows that, during the summer baseflow season, the signature of organic-rich interstitial soil solutions originating in a typical peat bog zone can be completely masked by processes occurring in adjacent bog surface waters feeding lakes, as well as in the stream itself. As such, depending on local landscape, one may expect extremely high variability in both chemical nature and MW of DOM delivered by small coastal watersheds to the Arctic Ocean during the summer baseflow period.

J	Parmenter, AC; Lee, CB; Coniglio, M				Parmenter, AC; Lee, CB; Coniglio, M			"Sudbury Breccia" at Whitefish Falls, Ontario: evidence for an impact origin	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Sudbury breccias are unusual clast-matrix rock bodies formed in abundance around the Sudbury Igneous Complex, the most obvious manifestation of a major impact event at Sudbury. At Whitefish Falls, similar to70 kin southwest of Sudbury, similar breccias consisting of clasts of argillite and amphibolite dyke enclosed in a fine-grained matrix of host rock are developed in metamorphosed argillites of the Huronian Supergroup. Pre-brecciation brittle textures in the host argillite and breccia clasts, such as layer-parallel foliation offset by cataclastic fractures, suggest that the host rock was entirely competent prior to brecciation. One composite penetrative foliation and its associated ductile folding were also formed in the argillite host prior to brecciation. Post-brecciation ductile deformation produced a regionally dominant east-west-trending foliation, and two late-stage folding events, and indicate a syn-Penokean age of brecciation. The breccias at Whitefish Falls are enriched in ferromagnesian minerals compared to adjacent, embayed and partially digested, host rock, Flow-foliated breccia matrices surround a highly rounded clast phase. These features are characteristic of impact-related pseudotachylyte, formed during extreme cataclasis and friction melting of the impacted host rock. We propose that these breccias formed by injection of a high-strain, pseudotachylytic melt, triggered by the Sudbury impact event, and focused along a blind superfault, coincident with a post-Penokean high-strain zone.																			0008-4077					JUN	2002	39	6					971	982		10.1139/E02-006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E02-006													WOS:000177399400007

Here we present a new, ca. 50-thousand year (ka)-long chironomid record from Furamoos, southern Germany, covering the interval from MIS 5a to MIS 3 that we use to examine lake development and then to quantitatively reconstruct mean July air temperatures. Chironomid assemblages with high abundances of taxa such as Polypedilum nubeculosum-type, Microtendipes pedellus-type, Cladopelma lateralis-type and Dicrotendipes nervosus-type imply a shallow-lake setting for the majority of the examined interval, which is corroborated by other aquatic remains such as oribatid mites, Sialidae and Ceratopogonidae. Assemblages from the interval ca. 99 to 80 ka (in the region corresponding to the Brorup Interstadial, Stadial B and early Odderade Interstadial) are dominated by taxa such as Tanytarsus glabrescens-type and Tanytarsus mendax-type and indicate relatively warm temperatures. Assemblages from the interval covering ca. 80 to 54 ka (corresponding to the late Odderade, Stadial C, Durnten Interstadial and Stadial D) are dominated by taxa such as Sergentia coracina-type and Tanytarsus lugens-type and are typical for cooler conditions. Reconstructed July temperatures for the early Wurmian (Brorup to early Odderade; ca. 99-80 ka) are 13-14 degrees C. Values decline to <10 degrees C during the late Odderade and Stadial C (ca. 80-77 ka) around the MIS 5a/4 transition. This decrease is coeval with a pronounced decrease in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. Values stay in the range of 9-11 degrees C during the Durnten and Stadial D (ca. 54-74.5 ka) and increase again to 12.5 degrees C during the Bellamont 1 interstadial (ca. 54-46 ka). Reconstructed July temperatures track changes in arboreal pollen percentages at Furamoos and agree with a summer-temperature decrease during the early to mid-Wurmian as reported by other palaeotemperature records from Europe and the North Atlantic. Our chironomid record from Furamoos provides valuable new insights into Wurmian climate dynamics in Central Europe, and corroborates other temperature reconstructions from the early to mid-Wurmian glacial period.

The Tierra Blanca Joven deposits are products of a complex sequence of pyroclastic flows and falls that occurred during the A.D. 430 eruption of Ilopango Caldera. Very fine, compact white ash-lapilli predominates in both flow and fall units. Laboratory tests carried out on high-quality, undisturbed Tierra Blanca Joven samples show negative pore-water pressures and weak cementation. They also reveal how the strength and compressibility of these sediments can change significantly when the suction and bonding are lost upon soaking or remolding. Thick Tierra Blanca Joven deposits contribute to landslide risk during heavy rainfalls and strong earthquakes in the region.

Food habits of cormorants were studied at three of the reservoirs in 1989. Data were also collected on trout abundance during standardized gill-netting to make comparisons between cormorant numbers and trout abundance. Cormorants were observed at all waters studied except one and were generally most numerous during the spring as they migrated through the area. Estimated cormorant abundance ranged from 0 to 34 bird-days per ha and was highest at the larger, lower-elevation reservoirs. Cormorants were summer residents at several of the larger reservoirs and nested successfully at Piute Reservoir. Trout accounted for 24-81% of the diet of cormorants, with Utah chubs constituting most of the remainder of the diet. Estimates of the annual consumption of fish by cormorants ranged from 0 to 15.8 kg per ha. The index of trout abundance was inversely related to cormorant abundance (P < .01) at the waters studied. Cormorants apparently have increased in numbers and extended their range in southwestern Utah during the past decade. This change may be the result of factors that have led to similar changes throughout North America as well as some factors unique to Utah. Methods to mitigate the impact of predation by piscivorous birds on sportfisheries are discussed. The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources has initiated a new management plan at Minersville Reservoir that incorporates piscivorous birds into sportfish management at that reservoir.																			0017-3614					JUL	1994	54	3					272	286																WOS:A1994PF80000008

Development of a midge-based summer surface water temperature inference model for the great basin of the western united states	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH					Uinta Interdisciplinary Assessment Symposium (UINTAS 2006)	MAY, 2006	Snowbird, UT					Surface sediment recovered from 51 lakes in the Uinta Mountains of northeast Utah was analyzed for subfossil chironomid remains, and incorporated in a midge-based inference model for summer surface water temperature (SSWT). The lakes in the calibration set spanned elevation, depth, and summer surface water temperature ranges of 900 in, 12.7 in, and 11.3 degrees C, respectively. Redundancy analysis (RDA) identified four variables, SSWT, depth, specific conductivity, and Al concentration, that could account for a statistically significant amount of variance in the chironomid distribution, with SSWT accounting for the largest amount of variance. The Uinta Mountain calibration set was merged with a previously developed calibration set from the Sierra Nevada, California, in order to develop a midge-based inference model for SSWT applicable to subfossil chironomid stratigraphies from the Great Basin. A variety of statistical approaches, such as weighted averaging (WA), weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS), and partial least squares (PLS) were used to assess model performance. The best inference model for SSWT, based on a 3-component WA-PLS approach, had robust performance statistics (r(jack)(2) = 0.66, RMSEP = 1.4 degrees C). The newly expanded inference model will enable more accurate estimates of late Pleistocene and Holocene thermal regimes and help address many outstanding questions relating to long-term and recent climate change in this region.

J	De Jong, R; Hammarlund, D; Nesje, A				De Jong, R.; Hammarlund, D.; Nesje, A.			Late Holocene effective precipitation variations in the maritime regions of south-west Scandinavia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												At present, the climate in south-west Scandinavia is predominantly controlled by westerlies carrying moist Atlantic air, which forms a main source of precipitation in all seasons. Past variations in the ratio between precipitation and evaporation (effective precipitation) from terrestrial sites, however, may indicate changes in the degree of maritime influence. Palaeoclimatic archives in this region are thus ideally situated to study past changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. In this study, multi-proxy comparisons of records from three peat bogs and two lakes are used to reconstruct regional-scale variations of effective precipitation in south-west Sweden during the Late Holocene. The total aeolian sediment influx into two peat bogs is used as a proxy for storm activity. The frequency of storm phases increases strongly after ca 2500 cal yrs BP. Dry conditions occur on a regional scale around 4800-4400, 2000-1700, 1300-1000, 700-500 and 300-100 cal yrs BP. In addition, a comparison to winter precipitation reconstructed from four Norwegian glaciers shows similar variations during the past ca 2000 years. This indicates that the climate in both regions was controlled by large-scale atmospheric circulation dynamics of the North Atlantic region. The strong variability of effective precipitation and storm activity after ca 2500 cal yrs BP indicates a highly variable climate. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Holocene environmental change inferred from a high-resolution pollen record, Lake Zhuyeze, arid China	HOLOCENE												A high-resolution pollen record, c. 50 yr/sample, from terminal lake sediments in the Shiyang River drainage basin on the present margin of the summer monsoon was used to reconstruct vegetation and climate history during the Holocene. Forest trees from mountainous areas of the drainage, including Sabina, Picea and Pinus, dominated pollen assemblages in the early Holocene (11.6-7.1 cal. ka). In the mid-Holocene (7.1-3.8 cal. ka) desert and steppe shrubs and herbs around the lake, including Nitraria, Poaceae, Compositae and Artemisia, were dominant. The late Holocene (3.8-0 cal. ka) was again dominated by alternation of Pinus-Sabina tree pollen and desert-steppe pollen. The early Holocene forest expansion in the mountains and subsequent increase in the river transport of tree pollen corresponds with maximum precipitation during the East Asian summer monsoon maximum. The timing of these changes in our record from arid China is different from that of East China, where the Holocene monsoon maximum appeared in the middle Holocene. This difference indicates that the extent and development of summer monsoon circulation in the Holocene was complex. Changes in the pollen record appear to show pervasive and persistent centennial- to millennial-scale oscillations throughout both wet and dry periods of the Holocene. Our results imply the continental interior was sensitive to changing moisture conditions and responsive to Holocene climatic events.

This research mainly focused on monitoring the dissolved trace metal concentrations from water samples in several important drinking water sources including the Huangpu River, Qingcaosha Reservoir and several reservoirs for West Tai Lake from spring to summer in 2013. The changes of trace metal concentrations and removal efficiencies in four typical water treatment plants (WTPs) in China corresponding to these water sources were also investigated. Results indicated that Qingcaosha Reservoir, Hengshan Reservoir and Youche Reservoir were less influenced by anthropogenic activities, therefore the change of dissolved metal concentrations was not significant except for local geochemical elements such as Sr and Ba. The other two water sources that flow through large industrial areas were greatly affected with elevated trace metal concentrations such as Fe, Mn, Zn, Ni, P, which can be attributed to anthropogenic and socio-economic impacts. High Fe and Mn concentrations were observed at low pH while high electric conductivity gained relevance with high geochemical metal concentrations. The occurrence of high dissolved Ni, Cu, Co and Zn was associated with high ammonia concentration and low pH, which might result from the formation of metal ammine complexes. In addition to the raw water information, dissolved metal concentrations after the treatment by individual WTP processes indicated that biological activated carbon and sand filtration achieved significant removal of Mn and Fe, while coagulation/flocculation efficiently reduced the concentrations of As, Pb and Zn. However, oxidation processes might form highly toxic Cr(VI) and increase the dissolved Cr concentrations which posed a potential threat to human safety.

J	Cantonati, M; Lange-Bertalot, H				Cantonati, Marco; Lange-Bertalot, Horst			Diatom monitors of close-to-pristine, very-low alkalinity habitats: three new Eunotia species from springs in Nature Parks of the south-eastern Alps	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												On the basis of LM and SEM observations as well as of environmental claw, three species of the predominantly-acidophilous diatom genus Eunotia (E. cisalpina, E. fallacoides, E. insubrica) are described as new to science, and characterized from the ecological point of view. The three new species were not distinguished from other similar ones in the past hut can be identified at the LM by careful observation of diacritical characters such as valve outline (in particular the shape of the endings). dimensions, and stria density. One of the three new species (E. insubrica) presents a very peculiar ultrastructural feature. i.e. well-developed pseudoseptum-like structures at the apices. The three new species were pointed out by detailed analyses of materials sampled in the south-eastern Alps. It is put forward that diatom investigations adopting high-resolution taxonomy are particularly opportune in habitats such as those colonized by the three new species. The three new species were found to be characteristic of low-alkalinity, naturally slightly-acidic, strictly-oligotrophic, high-mountain springs and lakes. Efficient desiccation-resistance strategies, apparently widespread in the genus Eunotia, might be supposed also far the three new species, that were found to thrive also in low-discharge springs and in the shallow littoral waters of lakes showing seasonal or exploitation-enhanced water-level fluctuations. The diatom assemblages of these aquatic habitats possess a high species richness, and include many rare and Red List species, and are thus of prominent importance for diatom biodiversity, conservation. These relatively-pristine aquatic habitats on siliceous bedrocks are however highly sensitive, and endangered because of diffuse pollution. Climate- and environmental-change driven increased release of organic acids, and contamination by airborne inorganic acids and nutrients are all potential threats to these still high-integrity but fragile systems. The detailed characterization of their diatom assemblages, that are excellent monitors of acid-base and nutrient status is thus of the foremost importance. In particular the distinction between naturally-acidic and acidified systems is a relevant topic that might benefit from detailed knowledge of taxonomy and ecology of both communities and indicative taxa of the diatom assemblages.					; Cantonati, Marco/G-4278-2018	Cantonati, Marco/0000-0003-0179-3842; 													1129-5767	1723-8633					2011	70	2					209	221		10.4081/jlimnol.2011.209	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2011.209													WOS:000294320400006

Lawn Lake, a high montane hunting camp in the Colorado (USA) rocky mountains: Insights into early Holocene Late Paleoindian hunter-gatherer adaptations and paleo-landscapes	NORTH AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGIST												The Lawn Lake site is a stratified hunting camp situated on a glacial lake outlet river terrace in Rocky Mountain National Park's upper subalpine forest zone. Its archaeological assemblage represents 9,000 years of hunter-gatherer use as a summer game and plant processing camp for subalpine forest and nearby alpine tundra resource areas. This article's focus is on the site's earliest camp levels which contain artifacts and AMS radiocarbon dated hearth charcoal between 8,900 and 7,900 cal yr BP, placing them among the region's earliest high montane (3,353 m ASL) Paleoindian hunting camps, once part of a network of such sites designed to support systematic high altitude procurement of summer migratory game animals and plant foods in Southern Rocky Mountain subalpine forest and tundra ecosystems. Lawn Lake paleoclimate and paleoecology studies produced long-term pollen records and climate-proxy sediment data for modeling the site's prehistoric climate and ecology history, useful for interpreting its high-altitude Late Paleoindian hunter-gatherer adaptations.

During summer stratification the hypolimnion was always a sink for chlorophyll, particulate, nitrogen (PN), particulate phosphorous (PP), and dissolved oxygen. The order of decomposition was chlorophyll > PP > PN. The hypolimnion was a source for NH4+ and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), whereas dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) showed no distinct seasonal trends. N2O reached 8,800% of air saturation just before the hypolimnion became anaerobic. At this time, the hyplimnetic N2O pool comprise about 13% of the total dissolved inorganic nitrogen pool. Diffusion of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and DRP from the hypolimnion to the epilimnion could increase mean epilimnetic concentrations during summer stratification by 0.10 mg DRP m-3 d-1 and 0.34 mg DIN m-3 d-1 The ratio of DIN:DRP supplied to the epilimnion was 3.4 (by weight), which would exacerbate DIN deficiency in this lake.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	1986	31	4					812	831		10.4319/lo.1986.31.4.0812	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1986.31.4.0812													WOS:A1986D538600011

Ln's are different from major elements but phosphorus (P) in behavior upon leaching: While leaching of the major elements continued even at the reaction time (t(R)) of 64 h, that of Ln's seemingly finished by t(R) = 2 or 4 h. The behavior of P upon leaching was dissimilar to that of other major elements but rather resembled that of Ln's. This indicates that a part of each Ln may exist as phosphates in rocks. Light Ln's were found to be leached out by acidic waters more easily than heavy Ln's. This could be due to the difference in ionic radii of Ln's and/or be attributed to the difference in resistance to dissolution by acidic waters among various Ln-containing minerals in the rocks used in the present experiments. The results obtained are successfully applied to the elucidation of the Ln patterns of the waters from the Kusatsu-Yubatake hot spring, the Kusatsu spa, Gunma and from the Obuki hot spring, the Tamagawa spa, Akita.																			0016-7002	1880-5973					1995	29	1					67	84		10.2343/geochemj.29.67	http://dx.doi.org/10.2343/geochemj.29.67													WOS:A1995QZ62300004

This comparative study of a saline plateau lake (Lake Daihai) and an eutrophic freshwater lake (Lake Wuliangsuhai) revealed distinct winter microbial patterns, with sediment communities exhibiting 2-3 times higher diversity than ice or water habitats. Fluorescence characterization identified fundamental differences in DOM sources, where saline lake DOM showed mixed terrestrial-autochthonous signatures (fluorescence index: 1.4-1.9), contrasting with the strongly microbial-derived DOM (FI > 1.9) in freshwater systems. Vertical profiling demonstrated progressive humification downward through ice layers, while microbial functional predictions indicated sustained amino acid metabolism despite subzero temperatures. The unique halotolerant community structure of the saline lake contrasted sharply with the psychrophilic Flavobacterium-dominated assemblages in freshwater habitats, reflecting differential adaptation to environmental stressors. Dissolved oxygen and salinity emerged as primary drivers of community composition, while phosphorus availability influenced specific functional groups involved in organic matter processing. These findings highlight the resilience of microbial-mediated carbon cycling under ice cover and provide critical baseline data for predicting ecosystem responses to changing winter conditions in inland waters.

J	Schroeder, F; Peters, L; Traunspurger, W				Schroeder, Fabian; Peters, Lars; Traunspurger, Walter			Temporal variations in epilithic nematode assemblages in lakes of different productivities	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The aim of the present study was to examine: (1) the response of nematodes to temporal changes in the periphyton of stony hard-substrates (epilithon) and (2) the distribution of the nematode species among lakes of different productivities. Accordingly, epilithic nematode assemblages of three Swedish lakes with different trophic states were analyzed over a 2-year period. Depending on habitat size and food availability measured as organic material, algal biomass and inorganic material, nematode populations showed distinct temporal patterns, reaching maximum densities up to 1014 ind. cm(-2) in spring and lowest densities in winter (minimum abundance 27 ind. cm(-2)). A comparison of the analyzed lakes revealed clear differences in nematode species composition. A multivariate statistical analysis showed that the distribution of nematode species along the lakes was significantly linked to the nutrient conditions of the lakes and to the algal biomass in the epilithon. Accordingly, several nematode species could be classified as bioindicators of lake trophic state. Whereas, for example, the two dominant algal-feeding species, Punctodora ratzeburgensis and Chromadorina viridis, were dependent on high nutrient levels, the abundance of species belonging to the genera Rhabdolaimus (R. aquaticus, R. terrestris) and Eumonhystera (E. vulgaris, E. simplex, E. pseudobulbosa) correlated negatively with trophic state. Also linked to increasing nutrient conditions was the change in the composition of the nematode feeding types among the lakes, from one dominated by bacterial feeders to one in which algal feeders predominated. The trophic structure of the assemblage changed in parallel, with a larger proportion of predatory species (chewers) in the eutrophic lake than in the two lakes which were more nutrient poor. For suction feeders, the inverse pattern was observed. Our results underline the importance of the epilithon as the habitat of a highly abundant and diverse nematode fauna that is strongly influenced by the trophic state of its resident lake.

Much remains to be known, however, regarding the complex multi-host disease dynamics of schistosomiasis. Multi-disciplinary disease control programs within China, including mass treatment with praziquantel for over 40 years, have successfully targeted human and bovine definitive hosts, significantly reducing infection prevalence to extremely low levels. However,S.japonicumhas at least 40 species of potential definitive host reservoirs. Most notably, and perhaps most challenging in terms of targeted control, high prevalence ofS.japonicumhas been detected in rodent wildlife within recent years, particularly in hilly and mountainous regions of China. Molecular/phylogenetic studies have revealed matchedS.japonicumgenotypes indicative of shared transmission between rodents and humans. Similarly, mathematical models, incorporating parasitological and molecular data, have indicated that rodents may be sufficient to maintain ongoing transmission of schistosomiasis within some Chinese regions, most notably that of hilly and mountainous habitats. In order to help elucidate further the potential association between prevalence ofS.japonicumin humans with rodent wildlife across China, and to assess whether this balance may be changing following the introduction of mass drug administration with praziquantel to humans (and bovines) in the 1980s, we performed a meta-analyses aimed to estimate the overall prevalence ofS.japonicuminfections in commensal species rodents in China over this period. Published studies onS.japonicuminfections in wild rodents in China since 1980 were searched for across five electronic bibliographic databases, together with lists of cited articles. We identified a total of 37 relevant articles involving 61 studies with eligible data on 8795 rodents. The pooled prevalence level was 3.86% (95% CI: 2.16-5.93%). No significant change in overall pooled prevalence levels within rodents was observed between 1980-2003 and 2004-current, despite the integrated control strategies performed across China within the latter period. However, whilst the prevalence estimates did decrease within marshland and lake regions since 2004, in the hilly and mountainous regions, in contrast, there was a significant increase in the rodent infection prevalence. The estimate increased from the smallest 0.58% in spring to the highest 22.39% in winter. It also increased with the density of rodents. Therefore, we suggest that future systematic monitoring of schistosome infection levels within potential wildlife reservoirs, particularly within hilly and mountainous regions within China and/or areas aiming for verification of interruption of transmission, should be incorporated in order to reliably evaluate impact, risk and ultimately help ensure the sustainability of elimination interventions across, regional, national and international scales. China once suffered greatly from schistosomiasis japonica, a major zoonotic disease. Nearly 70 years of multidisciplinary efforts have achieved great progress in disease control, with infections in both humans and bovines significantly reduced to very low levels. However, reaching for the target of complete interruption of transmission at the country level by 2030 still faces great challenges, with areas of ongoing endemicity and/or re-emergence within previously 'eliminated' regions. The objectives of this study were, by using meta-analytical methods, to estimate the overall prevalence ofSchistosoma japonicuminfections in abundant commensal rodent species in mainland China after the introduction of praziquantel for schistosomiasis treatment in humans and bovines in 1980s. In doing so we thereby aimed to further assess the role of wild rodents as potential reservoirs in ongoing schistosome transmission. Published studies on infection prevalence ofS.japonicumin wild rodents in mainland China since 1980 were searched across five electronic bibliographic databases and lists of article references. Eligible studies were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Risks of within and across study biases, and the variations in prevalence estimates attributable to heterogeneities were assessed. The pooled infection prevalence and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. We identified a total of 37 relevant articles involving 61 field studies which contained eligible data on 8,795 wild rodents across mainland China. The overall pooled infection prevalence was 3.86% (95% CI: 2.16-5.93%). No significant change in the overall pooled prevalence was observed between 1980-2003 (n = 23 studies) and 2004-current (n = 38 studies). However, whilst the estimated prevalence decreased over time in the marshland and lake regions, there was an apparent increase in prevalence within hilly and mountainous regions. Among seven provinces, a significant prevalence reduction was only seen in Jiangsu where most endemic settings are classified as the marshland and lakes. These estimates changed over season, ranging from 0.58% in spring to 22.39% in winter, in association with increases in rodent density. This study systematically analyzedS.japonicuminfections in wild rodents from the published literature over the last forty years after the introduction of praziquantel for schistosomiasis treatment in humans and bovines in 1980s. Although numbers of schistosomiasis cases in humans and bovines have been greatly reduced, no such comparable overall change of infection prevalence in rodents was detected. Furthermore, there appeared to be an increase inS.japonicumprevalence in rodents over time within hilly and mountainous regions. Rodents have been projected to become the dominant wildlife in human-driven environments and the main reservoir of zoonotic diseases in general within tropical zones. Our findings thus suggest that it is now necessary to include monitoring and evaluation of potential schistosome infection within rodents, particularly in hilly and mountainous regions, if we are ever to reach the new 2030 elimination goals and to maximize the impact of future public, and indeed One Health, interventions across, regional, national and international scales.

We used acoustic telemetry to track movements of anadromous brook charr for 1 year in the Laval River, Quebec. Fish entered the marine environment in May and June, inhabited shallow (< 1.7 m), near-shore areas (< 500 m from shore), and rarely ventured beyond the headlands of the bay. They were found where salinities were 1-34 ppt and temperatures 5-18 degrees C. There was a strong tidal periodicity to observed movements with fish running up into bays as they became inundated at high tide and then returning to deep river channels in the bays at low tide. Between late July and early September, the charr returned to freshwater and spawned in the middle and upper sections of the river in October and November. Winter habitats were dispersed over 22 km of the river including two lakes. These detailed observations are an important contribution to our understanding of the evolutionary significance of anadromy in this species. The salinity and temperature co-tolerance provides insights into the species' post-glacial dispersal, present-day distribution, and potential habitat maps for conservation, restoration, and enhancement programmes.

Reproducibility and cause	DENDROCHRONOLOGIA												Tree rings from ring-porous species have often been used as flood proxy. Many ring-porous species produce characteristic flood rings in response to stem submersion during vessel formation. Flood rings have earlywood vessels that are more numerous and/or of smaller cross-sectional area than "normal" rings. This study aimed at determining if diffuse-porous balsam poplar and trembling aspen, like ring-porous black ash, produce anatomically distinct annual tree rings in response to flooding. More specifically, we asked (i) if periodic tangential bands of vessels (hereafter PTBV) could be as easily identified/quantified as flood rings and (ii) if PTBV could be associated with spring flooding. Sampling of black ash, balsam poplar and trembling aspen trees took place along a flood exposure gradient in the floodplain of Lake Duparquet in northwestern Que ' bec. Two observers recorded flood rings and PTBV. Consistency between observers was greatest when identifying flood rings. In both diffuseporous species, PTBV occurred less abundantly than flood rings in black ash. They also occurred less often in balsam poplar than in trembling aspen. Years in which PTBV were initiated early in the growing season were associated with years in which flood rings occurred. Like flood rings, early occurring PTBV were more abundant in springs characterized by high mean river discharge, extensive snow cover, cold temperatures and heavy precipitation. Early-occurring PTBV dominated in flooded sites and late-occurring ones dominated in the control site. However, PTBV of the late-types were also observed in both flood exposures indicating that spring flood may not be the only factor modulating their formation. While flood rings seem to be associated with a change in the transport of growth regulators resulting from stem submergence and excess water, PTBV may be reflective of rhythmic alterations in the transport of growth regulators resulting from either water excess or deficit. Despite promising findings, many questions remain before PTBV in riparian diffuse-porous species can be widely used as a flood proxy. Why do species and individual trees differ in their ability to record them? What is the full range of environmental conditions triggering PTBV's formation especially in unflooded sites and in the late growing season?					; NOLIN, Alexandre/AID-1797-2022	bergeron, yves/0000-0003-3707-3687; NOLIN, Alexandre Florent/0000-0003-1033-9123; 													1125-7865	1612-0051				DEC	2021	70								125889	10.1016/j.dendro.2021.125889	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2021.125889		SEP 2021											WOS:000710180700001
J	Carmignani, JR; Roy, AH				Carmignani, Jason R.; Roy, Allison H.			Annual winter water-level drawdowns influence physical habitat structure and macrophytes in Massachusetts, USA, lakes	ECOSPHERE												Annual wintertime water-level drawdowns are a common management strategy in recreational lakes; however, few studies have estimated their relative impact on lake littoral habitat among a set of typically co-occurring anthropogenic stressors including lakeshore development and herbicide application. Within 21 Massachusetts, USA lakes that represented a drawdown magnitude gradient (0.07-2.26 m), we assessed depth-specific littoral habitat (coarse wood, sediment, macrophytes) at two sites adjacent to forested or developed shorelines. Using generalized linear mixed models, we found coarse wood abundance and branching complexity was not correlated with drawdown magnitude but was primarily explained by the presence of lakeshore development. Drawdown magnitude was negatively correlated with silt cover and positively correlated with coarse substrate cover, with effects further varying by depth (0.5 m vs. 1 m). Macrophyte biomass and biovolume were negatively correlated with drawdown magnitude with effects also varying by depth for biomass. Macrophyte taxa with annual longevity strategies (e.g., Najas flexilis) and amphibious growth forms increased in biomass proportions with drawdown magnitude. Distance-based redundancy analyses suggested macrophyte taxa composition was driven by drawdown magnitude, coarse substrate, alkalinity, water transparency, and herbicide use. These results suggest the importance of water quality and depth on macrophyte assemblage responses to winter drawdowns and the potential to develop drawdown-tolerant macrophyte assemblages. Altogether, understanding the unique impacts of anthropogenic stressors on littoral zone habitat across heterogeneous environmental lake conditions can help minimize impacts to lake ecological integrity while maintaining recreational value.

J	Effler, SW; Peng, F				Effler, Steven W.; Peng, Feng			Light-scattering components and Secchi depth implications in Onondaga Lake, New York, USA	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The dynamics of light scattering attributes of minerogenic particles in the upper waters of an urban lake, Onondaga Lake, NY, U.S.A., are characterized for the spring-summer interval of 2010 with scanning electron microscopy interfaced with automated image and X-ray analyses (SAX). SAX results are used to estimate the minerogenic scattering coefficient (b(m)) through Mie theory calculations. Good optical closure of the summation of bm and organic particle scattering (b(o)), the latter estimated by empirical bio-optical models based on the concentration of chlorophyll-a, with paired bulk measurements of particulate scattering (b(p)) is demonstrated. The average of the ratio of (b(m) + b(o)) to b(p) was 1.07; the average percent difference between this summation and b(p) was 21 %. The contribution of b(m) to b(p) ranged fro m similar to 5 % during a dry weather interval to 70 % following a runoff event; the overall average, for the relatively low runoff study year, was nearly 25 %. Allochthonous clay mineral particles were the dominant minerogenic component, primarily responsible for the observed dynamics in b(m). Calcium carbonate containing particles, with nuclei as clay minerals primarily and organic particles secondarily, were the second most important contributor to b(m). Particles in the size range of 1-10 mu m were responsible for b(m) during low tributary flow intervals, but particles > 10 mu m became important following high runoff events. A strong inverse relationship between Secchi depth and b(p) prevailed, coupling this fundamental metric of water quality to the contributions of the various light scattering constituents. The light scattering and clarity conditions of the lake are considered in the context of prevailing and potential future driving conditions.

J	Urban, NR; Monte, AE				Urban, NR; Monte, AE			Sulfur burial in and loss from the sediments of Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Lake sediments often are regarded as accurate records of changes in climatic conditions, rates of atmospheric deposition of substances to the lake, or other processes occurring within lakes. In this study, the sedimentary record of sulfur was examined in Little Rock Lake, Wisconsin. This lake received experimental sulfate additions from 1985 through 1990, and a mass balance showed that 35% (425 kg) of experimental sulfur additions were buried in the sediments. Sediment cores collected before and after sulfur additions confirmed that burial of 180-360 kg of sulfur occurred during the 6 years of experimental sulfur additions. However, cores collected in 1992 and 1996 contained less sulfur than cores taken in 1990 and suggested that sulfur incorporation in sediments is not permanent. To examine seasonal sulfur loss from sediments, sulfur inventories in the top 4 cm of sediments were measured in multiple cores before and after fall overturn. At water depths greater than 5 m, surface sediments retrieved after fall overturn had significantly less sulfur than did those collected before overturn. The small seasonal release from the sediments (25 kg S in 1996) might be caused by organic matter decomposition or sulfide oxidation.																			0706-652X					JUL	2001	58	7					1347	1355		10.1139/cjfas-58-7-1347	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-58-7-1347													WOS:000169776600008

In the Danube floodplain lake used as a case study, the investigated period from 2003 to 2016 was characterized by the cyclical occurrence of extreme floods (2006 and 2013) and extreme droughts (2003 and 2015). As a result, the lake changed several times from a phytoplankton turbid state to a clear state characterized by a very low phytoplankton biomass. R. raciborskii was abundant in the phytoplankton and bloomed in summer 2003 (June-September) and then in summer 2007 (June-August) and in August 2013. Extreme summer drought triggered the bloom, and water temperature was the most significant environmental variable during the bloom. The observed declining trend in total cyanobacterial biomass, including the less frequent occurrence of the R. raciborskii bloom, can be linked to the ecological disturbances in the stable state of the lake caused by extreme hydrological events. This suggests that the effects of climate change may be less detrimental in preserved natural river-floodplain systems.

THE ETHNOHISTORY OF FRESHWATER USE ON RAPA NUI (EASTER ISLAND, CHILE)	JOURNAL OF THE POLYNESIAN SOCIETY												Sources of drinking water on islands often present critical constraints to human habitation. On Rapa Nui (Easter Island, Chile), there is remarkably little surface fresh water due to the nature of the island's volcanic geology. While several lakes exist in volcanic craters, most rainwater quickly passes into the subsurface and emerges at coastal springs. Nevertheless, the island sustained a relatively large human population for hundreds of years, one that built an impressive array of monumental platforms (ahu) and statues (moai). To understand how Rapanui acquired their scarce fresh water, we review ethnohistoric data from first European arrival (1722) through the mid-twentieth century. Ethnohistoric accounts identify a diversity of freshwater sources and describe various Rapanui freshwater management strategies. Our findings highlight the importance of coastal freshwater seeps and provide much-needed insight into how Rapanui procured this vital and necessary resource.

In the regulated Lake Ontojarvi in spring, the newly hatched vendace larvae did not concentrate in the nearshore areas as they did in the natural Lake Lentua. Distinct differences were found in the composition of zooplankton in the nearshore areas of the lakes and in the composition of food eaten by the larvae. In the regulated lake rotatorians dominated in zooplankton samples and in larval gut contents. In the natural lake the cladocerans (Bosmina sp.) were much more abundant than in the regulated lake. The nearshore nursery areas in the regulated lake with low water lever in spring were considered poor for fish larvae.																			0071-1128		3-510-47047-8				1995	46						465	472																WOS:A1995BH14P00056

However, dynamic studies on habitat distribution under different water regimes are lacking. Here, using data from three successive wintering periods representing three typical water regimes, we modelled and mapped the habitat suitability of three waterbird groups in Dongting Lake, which is the first river-connected lake downstream of the TGP, and a crucial wintering ground for waterbirds along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. The results showed that the spatial pattern of habitat suitability varied among the wintering periods and waterbird groups. The analysis estimated the largest suitable habitat area for the herbivorous/tuber-eating group (HTG) and the insectivorous waterbird group (ING) under a normal water recession pattern, whereas early water recession had a more adverse effect. The suitable habitat area for the piscivorous/omnivorous group (POG) was higher under late water recession than under normal conditions. The ING was the most affected by hydrological changes among the three waterbird groups. Further, we identified the key conservation and potential restoration habitats. The HTG exhibited the largest key con-servation habitat area compared to the other two groups, while the ING showed a potential restoration habitat area larger than its key conservation habitat area, indicating its sensitivity to environmental changes. The optimal inundation durations from September 1 to January 20 for HTG, ING and POG were 52 & PLUSMN; 7 d, 68 & PLUSMN; 18 d, and 132 & PLUSMN; 22 d, respectively. Therefore, the water recession starting in mid-October may be favourable for waterbirds in Dongting Lake. Altogether, our results can be used as guidance for prioritising certain management actions for waterbird conservation. Moreover, our study highlighted the importance of considering habitat spatiotemporal variation in highly dynamic wetlands when implementing management practices.					; Zhang, Siqi/GWZ-5619-2022; LI, feng/HIR-1703-2022	Zhang, Pingyang/0000-0001-9767-0550; 													0301-4797	1095-8630				NOV 1	2023	345								118451	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118451	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118451		JUN 2023						37385199					WOS:001037975600001
J	Shao, J; Wang, J; Lv, SY; Bing, JP				Shao, Jun; Wang, Jun; Lv, Sunyun; Bing, Jianping			Spatial and temporal variability of seasonal precipitation in Poyang Lake basin and possible links with climate indices	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												Based on the precipitation data of 21 meteorological stations in Poyang Lake basin, the temporal and spatial variability of seasonal precipitation was analyzed by wavelet analysis method. This study adopted the cross wavelet transform to analyze the correlation between the seasonal precipitation and climate indices in time and frequency scales, discussed the possible links between its precipitation variations and climate indices, and preliminarily analyzed its mechanism and regular pattern of variation. The results showed that the oscillations in 2-4 years' and 4-8 years' bands were the main variation periods of seasonal precipitation in Poyang Lake basin. In the 2-4 years' band, the years of rainfall peaks appearing in Poyang Lake were basically consistent with the years when El Nino appeared, and the precipitation oscillations in summer appeared more dramatic in space. According to analysis on the cross wavelet power spectra between different seasonal rainfalls and climate indices, certain correlations between climate factors and seasonal precipitation had existed in specific time periods. Large-scale climate oscillations like the El Nino/Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Indian Ocean Dipole, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation caused the variability of large-scale circulations through their respective independent or inter-coupled climate systems, and affected the precipitation distribution in Poyang Lake basin by changing local climate conditions like the East Asian Monsoon.																			0029-1277	2224-7955				DEC	2016	47			1			51	68		10.2166/nh.2016.249	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2016.249													WOS:000391003300005

Ground-penetrating radar for assessing winter roads	GEOPHYSICS												Since its inception, ground penetrating radar (GPR) has been a very effective method for examining ice structure. The vast majority of early GPR use was focused on answering questions related to glaciology and ice sheets. More recently, as more and more activity occurs in arctic areas, managing ice structures for a variety of applications has created new uses for GPR. For the past 30-40 years, GPR use for assessing transportation routes over lakes, rivers, and sea ice has been reported, but, only in the last decade has routine application occurred. We have focused on the application of GPR for winter road safety, explained the operational requirements, discussed the current state of practice, and illustrated modern GPR instrumentation. Based on widespread field observations, we have provided information on the ice-layer thickness variation and the variability on GPR ice bottom reflection. Combining extensive GPR and ice auger data provided insight into the variability of electromagnetic wave velocity in ice. Extensive observations showed that velocity varies with ice thickness, and velocities are often considerably lower than observed in "pure" ice.

J	Cao, ZH; Zhang, DL				Cao, Zuohao; Zhang, Da-Lin			Analysis of Missed Summer Severe Rainfall Forecasts	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												Despite considerable progress in mesoscale numerical weather prediction (NWP), the ability to predict summer severe rainfall (SSR) in terms of amount, location, and timing remains very limited because of its association with convective or mesoscale phenomena. In this study, two representative missed SSR events that occurred in the highly populated Great Lakes regions are analyzed within the context of moisture availability, convective instability, and lifting mechanism in order to help identify the possible causes of these events and improve SSR forecasts/nowcasts. Results reveal the following limitations of the Canadian regional NWP model in predicting SSR events: 1) the model-predicted rainfall is phase shifted to an undesired location that is likely caused by the model initial condition errors, and 2) the model is unable to resolve the echo training process because of the weakness of the parameterized convection and/or coarse resolutions. These limitations are related to the ensuing model-predicted features: 1) vertical motion in the areas of SSR occurrence is unfavorable for triggering parameterized convection and grid-scale condensation; 2) convective available potential energy is lacking for initial model spinup and later for elevating latent heating to higher levels through parameterized convection, giving rise to less precipitation; and 3) the conversion of water vapor into cloud water at the upper and middle levels is underpredicted. Recommendations for future improvements are discussed.					; Zhang, Da-Lin/F-2634-2010	Zhang, Da-Lin/0000-0003-1725-283X; 													0882-8156	1520-0434				APR	2016	31	2					433	450		10.1175/WAF-D-15-0119.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WAF-D-15-0119.1													WOS:000376216300005

The causes of these Heinrich Events remain contested; while initially attributed to internal ice sheet dynamics, there is a growing consensus that favors external climate forcing. But based on the timing and expression of change, it remains unclear whether this trigger was oceanic or atmospheric. We present data from a High Arctic Lake sediment sequence, whose geochronology was previously published, that suggests Heinrich Event 2 was preceded by atmospheric warming. Alkenone-inferred temperatures, geochemical indicators of stratification and provenance, and leaf wax-based information about moisture availability, all indicate summers warmed from 27.5 to 23.5 thousand years before present. This evidence supports the view that Heinrich Stadials were marked by extreme seasonality rather than year-round cold conditions. Our findings also show that a High Arctic Lake ecosystem existed during the Last Glacial Maximum.

Burgas Wetlands, Bulgaria: a Conservation Area of European Priority for Roosting of the Pygmy Cormorant, Microcarbo pygmeus (Pallas, 1773)	ACTA ZOOLOGICA BULGARICA												The pygmy cormorant (Microcarbo pygmeus) has been increasing its population and since the 1980s has extended its wintering range to include the Balkans and Bulgaria. Although the Burgas wetlands on the southern Black Sea coast have been known to be used for wintering by the cormorants, their potential and importance seem to have been underestimated. In the winters of 2011/2012 and 2012/2013, we carried out counts on 15 occasions at two known roosting sites at the Burgas Lake. We recorded two record-high numbers (15,137 in December 2011 and 11,541 in January 2012), combined for the two sites. This represented roughly a quarter of the breeding individuals in Europe. Altogether, we recorded 76,077 observations of roosting birds, with only 11,479 of them at the second location. We counted almost twice the number of birds in 2011/2012, as compared to 2012/2013 (48,367 during eight counts vs 27,710 during seven counts). The birds moved to roost to new locations in 2013/2014. The time of arrival (on a monthly and daily basis) was consistent with previous records. Pygmy cormorants likely forage in the rivers flowing into the Burgas wetlands, suggesting the overall importance of the region beyond the two roosting sites.					; Kornilev, Yurii/N-7035-2013	Kornilev, Yurii/0000-0002-8596-8728; 													0324-0770					SEP	2015	67	3					435	442																WOS:000362242500018

However, the estimation of both biogenic and anthropogenic sources under mixed scenario using n-alkanes and their related proxies still remains an issue. In this study, we investigated spatiotemporal variations of n-alkanes in suspended particulate matter of Lake Chaohu for their source apportionment. Overall, Sigma(29) n-alkanes ranged from 324.1 to 113685 ng.L-1. C17H36 was the most abundant homologue and was followed by C-18, C-27 and C-29 homologues. Carbon preference indexes (CPIs) in most samples (at least 85%) were b<eparated by subtraction to avoid potential bias. Our results showed Sigma biogenic and Sigma anthropogenic n-alkanes ranged from 14.8 to 3531.6 ng.L-1 and 257.6 to 4938.5 ng.L-1, respectively. For biogenic n-alkanes, their carbon-chain distributions posed a preponderant peak at C-17, indicating algae were the main contributors to biogenic n-alkanes in Lake Chaohu. Biogenic average chain length (ACL(bio)) was developed to quantify the contributions of different biogenic sources. We recommended ACL(bio) > 21 for algae dominance and ACL(bio) > 26 for terrestrial plant dominance. For anthropogenic n-alkanes, their carbon-chain distribution presented obviously spatiotemporal variations. The sources of anthropogenic n-alkanes in summer and winter were typical dominances of light petroleum and incomplete fossil fuel burning/heavy oil emission, respectively. New developed proxies, anthropogenic average chain length (ACL(anthro)) and the ratio of unit short- to long-carbon anthropogenic n-alkanes (L/H), are effective for quantifying the relative contributions of different anthropogenic sources. We recommend log(10)L/H > 0.5 and ACL(anthro) < 20.5 for light petroleum input dominance, log(10)L/H < -0.5 and ACL(anthro) > 26.5 for incomplete fossil fuel burning at high temperature/heavy oil emission dominance.

Estimating the potential impact of future climate change on the incidence of fire requires an understanding of the long-term interactions of fire, climate, vegetation, and human activity. Accordingly, we analyzed the black carbon content and the pollen stratigraphy of sediments spanning the past 12.8 ka from Lake Muge Co, an alpine lake in western Sichuan Province, in order to determine the main factors influencing regional fire regimes. The results demonstrate that wildfires occurred frequently and intensively during the late deglaciation and the early Holocene when the regional vegetation was dominated by deciduous forests. Wildfire occurrence decreased significantly during the Holocene climatic optimum between 9.2 and 5.6 cal ka BP. Overall, the wildfire history of western Sichuan Province is similar to that of the Chinese Loess Plateau and of East Asia as a whole, suggesting that regional-scale fires depended mainly on changes in the intensity of the Asian summer monsoon. In addition, the fire regime of western Sichuan Province may have been influenced by the establishment of human settlement and agriculture in western Sichuan Province and the southeastern Tibetan Plateau after about 5.5 cal ka BP, and by an intensification of cereal cultivation coupled with population expansion in southwestern China during the last two millennia.

Lake Caviahue is characterized by its low transparency, CO2, and N concentration; significant P values; a distinctive vertical distribution of phytoplankton biomass with high values along the water column; and sometimes maximum meta-hypolimnion values. Biodiversity is very low as a result of extreme environmental conditions, Chlorophyceae being the prevailing algae group. Two types of bioassays were carried out to assess nitrogen limitation. For the first bioassay, a solution of ammonium-nitrogen chloride and/or wastewater (rich in ammonium and phosphorus) was used, while one of the lake's sediments was the source of nutrients for the second bioassay. Contrary to the case of acidic mining lakes, N-ammonium proved to be a significant supportive capacity limiting factor as to phytoplankton yield. The present paper provides for the first time information on phytoplankton nitrogen limitation in a naturally-acidic lake. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The results indicated that water quality indicated by the trophic state index (TSI) reached a state of mesotrophication to light eutrophication in the Yangtze River, and a state of moderate- to hyper- eutrophication in its tributaries. Based on the biomass of zooplanktons, Asplanchna priodonta was the most common specie in April; Encentrum sp., Filinia cornuta and Epiphanes senta were the most noticeable species in summer; Cyclopoida Copepodid, Sinocalanus dorrii and Philodina erythrophthalma became the dominant species in winter. Generally, rotifers prevailed in April and August, and copepods became the most popular in January. According to canonical correspondence analysis, nitrate, temperature (T), ammonia, water level and permanganate index (CODMn) significantly influenced the community structure of zooplankton (p < 0.05). The dominant species shifts of zooplankton were partly associated with nutrient level (nitrate and ammonia) under periodic water level fluctuations. Rotifers and protozoans were characterized as high T adapted and CODMn-tolerant species comparing with cladocerans and copepods. The ratio of microzooplankton to mesozooplankton (P-micro/meso) has presented a strongly positive relationship with T (p < 0.001), as well as P-micro/meso and CODMn (p < 0.001). It implied that zooplankton tended to miniaturize individual size via species shift under high T and/or CODMn conditions induced by global warming and human activities. The information hints us that climate change and human activities are likely to produce fundamental changes in urban aquatic ecosystem by reorganizing biomass structure of the food web in future.

J	Spencer, DF; Ksander, GG				Spencer, DF; Ksander, GG			Sedimentation disrupts natural regeneration of Zannichellia palustris in Fall River, California	AQUATIC BOTANY												Aquatic plants growing in flowing waters frequently inhabit dynamic substrates, subject to erosion or sediment deposition. Rooted macrophytes have disappeared from the upper portions of Fall River, CA where from 0.6 to 1.2 m of sandy sediments have accumulated. We assessed the abundance of Zannichellia palustris L. seeds in the seed bank, and performed experiments to determine the effect of sediment accumulation on germination and emergence of Z palustris seedlings. In 1996 and 1997, sediment cores were collected from the upper 15 km of Fall River. Cores were placed in a greenhouse and germination monitored for the next 30-40 days. Viable germinating Z palustris seeds were present in 67% of the cores collected in 1996. Z palustris seed density was 1219 seeds m(-2) on average and ranged from 0 to 5920 seeds m-2. Seed abundance did not differ between the upper (<11 cm) and lower portions (>11 cm) of cores collected in 1996 or 1997. We conducted four experiments in which Z palustris seeds and natural sediments containing Z palustris seeds were buried at various depths under sand. Burial by more than 2 cm of sand inhibited germination and emergence. The implication is that significant sediment accumulation may disrupt natural annual regeneration of Z palustris from seeds, although a viable seed bank is maintained for several years.

The laboratory experiments on growth are an attempt to determine whether high summer temperatures or optimum salinity are primarily responsible for the rapid increase in numbers. G. tigrinus was not found in either of 2 adjacent lakes; one nonsaline, the other at a higher salinity. The laboratory experiments on survival are an attempt to determine whether the restricted distribution of G. tigrinus is related to salinity. The implications of the field and laboratory studies are discussed and compared with other data from Europe and North America.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1982	94	3					201	212		10.1007/BF00016400	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016400													WOS:A1982PM78900001
J	Said, TO; El Agroudy, NA				Said, TO; El Agroudy, NA			Assessment of PAHs in water and fish tissues from Great Bitter and El Temsah lakes, Suez Canal, as chemical markers of pollution sources	CHEMISTRY AND ECOLOGY												Sea water and fish tissue samples were collected from nine sampling stations from the Great Bitter and El Temsah lakes in the Suez Canal and analysed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). The compositions of PAH determined in the dissolved fraction of sea water were measured in order to use them as chemical markers for identifying different sources of PAH pollution in this region. PAHs determined in fish tissues were measured for comparison with human health standards as consumption. The total mean PAHs concentrations in the sea water samples ranged from 0.28 to 39.57 mu g l-1 with an overall mean of 10.78 and 12.38 mu g l-1 for El Temsah and Bitter Lakes water, respectively. Total PAHs fractions recorded in muscle tissues of all different Osteicthyes fishes collected from Great Bitter lakes ranged from 5.8 to 218.5 mu g g(-1) with an overall mean of 57.98 mu g g(-1) during all seasons. However, they ranged from 68 to 623 mu g g(-1) with an overall mean of 87.69 mu g g(-1) recorded in El Temsah lake during four seasons (2003-2004). Benzo(a)pyrene was the most dominant PAHs found in the sea water samples from both lakes with an average concentration of 3.8 mu g l(-1). Dibenzo(a,h)anthracene(DBA) was the most dominant PAHs recorded in fish samples. A maximum of 533 mu g g(-1) of DBA was recorded in Dahbana sp. collected from Bitter lakes during January 2004. However, a maximum of 68.7 mu g g(-1) was recorded in Liza carinata species collected from El Temsah lake during July, 2004. The simultaneous occurrence of isomerratios PHE/ANT < 10 for all stations indicated that the major PAH input to water was from combustion of fossil fuel (pyrolytic source). The average ratios were 1.21 and 12.9 during winter (January 2004) and 4.3 and 8.63 during spring (April 2004) for all water samples of Great Bitter lakes and El Temsah lake, respectively. In addition, the present data demonstrate that PAHs from fossil fuel sources (MW < 178) were the least significant source of PAHs in this region.						O.

Last Interglacial (Eemian) hydrographic conditions in the southwestern Baltic Sea based on dinoflagellate cysts from Ristinge Klint, Denmark	GEOLOGICAL MAGAZINE												A dinoflagellate cyst record with strong Mediterranean/Lusitanian affinities is described from marine deposits of Eemian age (Last Interglacial; Late Pleistocene) at Ristinge Klint, Denmark, revealing new information about the hydrographic evolution of the southwestern Baltic Sea. A revised correlation of the pollen record at Ristinge Klint with that of the annually laminated site at Bispingen in northern Germany provides temporal control. Approximately the first quarter of Eemian time is represented. A marine ingression into a lake took place during the Quercus rise, about 300 years into the interglacial, and is marked by low (< c. 3 psu) salinities at the base of the Cyprina Clay that increased progressively. An abrupt and significant rise in the inflow of warm, saline waters from the North Sea occurred at about 750 years into the interglacial (the Corylus rise), and at about 1900 years into the interglacial, strongly stratified waters developed. Higher in the Cyprina Clay and continuing to its top, at nearly 3000 years into the interglacial, more open-marine waters are indicated, although fully marine conditions were not reached. The dinoflagellate record throughout the Cyprina Clay at Ristinge Klint is therefore one of increasing marine influence. Summer sea-surface temperatures approached, and may have exceeded, 26-28 degrees C during early Eemian time, indicating temperatures at least 5 degrees C warmer than at present. These warm conditions persisted to the top of the record at Ristinge Klint. No evidence exists at Ristinge Klint for the influence of Arctic watermasses, and the paucity of cold-water species throughout the section reflects mild winter temperatures in the southwestern Baltic Sea. The new species Spiniferites ristingensis is formally described, and the name Operculodinium centrocarpum var. cezare de Vernal, Goyette & Rodrigues, 1989 is validated.																			0016-7568	1469-5081				NOV	2007	144	6					987	1013		10.1017/S0016756807003780	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0016756807003780													WOS:000251576000007

Proximate Composition and Fatty Acid Differences in Hatchery-Reared and Wild Snake River Sockeye Salmon Overwintering in Nursery Lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												In the artificial propagation program for endangered Snake River sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka, a portion of the F 1 progeny (produced from spawning captive parents) are retained in the hatchery through maturation and spawning; the remaining progeny are reintroduced to nursery lakes in central Idaho at several life history stages (egg, presmolt, and smolt). In this study, the proximate and fatty acid compositions of sockeye salmon from presmolt releases were analyzed both at planting and at out-migration to assess their feeding success after overwintering in nursery lakes relative to that of overwintering wild fish. Hatchery-origin presmolts did not grow significantly over the winter. However, size and length were similar between hatchery-origin fish and wild out-migrants. Average percent whole-body lipid declined significantly in hatchery-origin sockeye salmon overwinter. Hatchery-origin out-migrants also had significantly lower whole-body lipid than wild counterparts migrating from Redfish Lake, Idaho, over the 6 years examined. The lack of growth and significantly lower body fat content of hatchery-origin sockeye salmon suggest that the food resources available to both wild and hatchery-origin presmolts were not utilized equally. There were also significant differences in fatty acid composition between wild and hatchery-origin out-migrants. Wild out-migrants had fatty acid profiles indicative of the zooplankton diet typical of resident sockeye salmon in the lake. In contrast, hatchery-reared juveniles introduced as presmolts in the fall had fatty acid profiles resembling those associated with hatchery diets and showed no evidence of the fatty acids characteristically observed in zooplankton. After overwintering, hatchery-origin out-migrants had fatty acid profiles that were intermediate between those of fish at planting and those of wild fish, reflecting some zooplankton intake during this period. The compromise in lipid quantity and quality for hatchery-produced presmolts may, in part, explain the large observed reductions in smolt-to-adult survival relative to that of naturally produced sockeye salmon.

J	Gardarsson, A; Einarsson, A				Gardarsson, Arnthor; Einarsson, Arni			Relationships among Food, Reproductive Success and Density of Harlequin Ducks on the River Laxa at Myvatn, Iceland (1975-2002)	WATERBIRDS												Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) and aquatic insects have been monitored oil the River Laxa at Myvatn, from 1975 and 1977, respectively, tip to the present. The area holds the densest breeding population of this species in Iceland. The relationship between food abundance, reproductive success and density of breeding Harlequin Ducks were examined oil three sections (outlet, upper and lowland) of the Laxa. Spring density was highest Oil the lake Outlet (2.1 ha(-1)) and much lower oil the upper (0.3 ha(-1)) and lowland (0.4 ha(-1)) sections. Numbers of Harlequin Ducks on the Laxa increased significantly during the study period, 1975-2002. The trend of increasing numbers could be attributed to either a general, as yet unexplained, increase of Harlequin Ducks in northern and northeastern Iceland, or perhaps to the successful eradication of American Mink (Mustela. vison) breeding at the lake outlet (the main production centre of young Harlequin Ducks). Sex ratio in spring was 41% females at the outlet and oil the upper Laxa but 36% on tire lowland part. Yearling males were about 1% of all males oil the upper river but 6-19% on the lowland part. Most young were produced at the outlet, while few females or broods were found further down the liver. The mean total number of young produced annually at the Outlet was 74 +/- 11 (range = 9,235). Young per female present in spring at the Outlet and upper part was 0.49 +/- 0.09, or if only females at the Outlet in spring are considered, 0.82 +/- 0.17. Annual production of young was positively correlated with total yearly black (IN, abundance. We conclude that food limits the production of young in the Harlequin Duck. Changes in the densities of adults Oil the breeding grounds showed density dependence but were not significantly associated with food resources or previous production Of Voting.																			1524-4695						2008	31						84	91																WOS:000263006600013
J	O'Briain, M; Reed, A; MacDonald, SD				O'Briain, M; Reed, A; MacDonald, SD			Breeding, moulting, and site fidelity of brant (Branta bernicla) on Bathurst and Seymour Islands in the Canadian High Arctic	ARCTIC												We studied the breeding and moulting ecology of eastern High Arctic brant Branta bernicla hrota on Bathurst and Seymour Islands in the central Canadian High Arctic from 1968 to 1989. In most years, brant arrived in Polar Bear Pass, Bathurst Island, during the first few days of June (earliest 28 May 1977), where they fed for several days in small flocks before dispersing to nesting areas. First eggs were usually laid on 13 June and the peak of nest initiation occurred about 16 June. The mean clutch size was 4.5 eggs, and the mean incubation period 23 days. Broods were raised along the shorelines of lakes, ponds, estuaries, and rivers. Goslings were capable of flight by 42-43 days. During the 10 years when the studies were most intensive (1974-77 and 1984-89), there were three years in which brant did not attempt to nest (1974, 1986, 1988); they nested in all other years and were known to produce fledged young in at least four of them. Nesting was not attempted when the mean temperature for the period 1-20 June was below -3 degrees C. On Bathurst Island in 1987, arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) preyed heavily on brant eggs, and no young were fledged. Nonbreeding adults assembled in small flocks to moult around nearby inland lakes, in river valleys, and at the mouths of estuaries, and concentrated in the latter in cold summers when inland sites had heavier ice cover. The flightless period began about 6 July and lasted 20-22 days. The recapture or resighting of brant marked on Bathurst Island showed that many adults returned in subsequent years to the same breeding territories, and in nonbreeding years they moulted nearby. A smaller proportion of the brant that had been marked as goslings and yearlings also returned to the island. In comparison with most other stocks of North American brant, those we studied bred at high latitude. That choice of breeding site subjected them to periodic breeding failures caused by cold springs and to a reduced availability of plant biomass, but it offered the advantage of reduced spring snow depth and a full 24 h of daylight for feeding during nesting and brood rearing. By using small wetlands which thaw early in close proximity to nesting sites, these brant were able to initiate egg laying relatively early and produce large clutches in most years. The low availability of plant biomass in the High Arctic probably explained the wide dispersal and low densities of these brant during breeding and moulting.																			0004-0843					DEC	1998	51	4					350	360																WOS:000077972300007
J	Aku, PMK; Tonn, WM				Aku, PMK; Tonn, WM			Changes in population structure, growth, and biomass of cisco (Coregonus artedi) during hypolimnetic oxygenation of a deep, eutrophic lake, Amisk Lake, Alberta	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Although most hypolimnetic oxygenation studies are designed to enhance cold-water fish populations, production-related responses have rarely been evaluated. We examined changes in density, biomass, and growth rate of cisco (Coregonus artedi) in Amisk Lake during 1989-1991, when one of the basins received hypolimnetic oxygenation, and in the nearby, untreated Baptiste Lake during 1990-1991. Variations in monthly density and biomass estimated using hydroacoustics suggested that as summer progressed, cisco in Amisk Lake responded behaviorally to hypolimnetic oxygenation by migrating from the hypoxic reference basin into the treated basin where oxygen concentrations remained high; by summer's end, the treated basin supported a density and biomass of fish that were twice as great as in the reference. Whole-lake fish density increased almost fivefold and biomass tripled in Amisk Lake during treatment, but there were no parallel changes in Baptiste Lake, where the hypolimnion remained anoxic each summer. Growth rate and condition of cisco in Amisk Lake decreased during treatment compared with pretreatment data, suggesting a density-dependent relationship with biomass; no coincident change in growth rate occurred in Baptiste Lake. These results suggest that hypolimnetic oxygenation can be an effective technique to enhance cold-water fish production, especially if combined with other management practices, such as regulated fish exploitation.

J	Zhai, SJ; Yang, LY; Hu, WP				Zhai, Shuijing; Yang, Longyuan; Hu, Weiping			Observations of Atmospheric Nitrogen and Phosphorus Deposition During the Period of Algal Bloom Formation in Northern Lake Taihu, China	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Taihu occurred at the end of April 2007 and had crucial impacts on the livelihood of millions of people living there. Excessive nutrients may promote bloom formation. Atmospheric nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) deposition appears to play an important role in algal bloom formation. Bulk deposition and rain water samples were collected respectively from May 1 to November 30, 2007, the period of optimal algal growth, to measure the bulk atmospheric deposition rate, wet deposition rate, and dry deposition rate for total nitrogen (TN; i.e., all species of nitrogen), and total phosphorus (TP; i.e., all species of phosphorus), in northern Lake Taihu, China. The trends of the bulk atmospheric deposition rate for TN and the wet deposition rate for TN showed double peaks during the observation period and distinct influence with plum rains and typhoons. Meanwhile, monthly bulk atmospheric deposition rates for TP showed little influence of annual precipitation. However, excessive rain may lead to high atmospheric N and P deposition rates. In bulk deposition samples, the average percentage of total dissolved nitrogen accounting for TN was 91.2% and changed little with time. However, the average percentage of total dissolved phosphorus accounting for TP was 65.6% and changed substantially with time. Annual bulk atmospheric deposition rates of TN and TP during 2007 in Lake Taihu were estimated to be 2,976 and 84 kg km(-2) a(-1), respectively. The results showed decreases of 34.4% and 78.7%, respectively, compared to 2002-2003. Annual bulk deposition load of TN for Lake Taihu was estimated at 6,958 t a(-1) in 2007 including 4,642 t a(-1) of wet deposition, lower than the values obtained in 2002-2003. This may be due to measures taken to save energy and emission control regulations in the Yangtze River Delta. Nevertheless, high atmospheric N and P deposition loads helped support cyanobacterial blooms in northern Lake Taihu during summer and autumn, the period of favorable algal growth.					hu, weiping/LIH-2020-2024														0364-152X	1432-1009				SEP	2009	44	3					542	551		10.1007/s00267-009-9334-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-009-9334-4								19597869					WOS:000268901300012

However, the timing, direction, and spatial extent of precipitation changes prior to the instrumental period are still largely unknown, preventing a better understanding of the long-term drivers of the SASM and their effects over the Altiplano. Here we present a detailed pollen reconstruction from a sedimentary sequence covering the period between 4500 and 1000 cal yr BP in Lago Chungara (18 degrees S; 4570 m a.s.l.), a high-elevation lake on the southwestern margin of the Altiplano where precipitation is delivered almost exclusively during the mature phase of the SASM over the austral summer. We distinguish three well-defined centennial-scale anomalies, with dry conditions between 4100-3300 and 1600-1000 cal yr BP and a conspicuous humid interval between 2400 and 1600 cal yr BP, which resulted from the weakening and strengthening of the SASM, respectively. Comparisons with other climate reconstructions from the Altiplano, the Atacama Desert, the tropical Andes, and the southwestern Atlantic coast reveal that - unlike modern climatological controls - past precipitation anomalies at Lago Chungara were largely decoupled from north-south shifts in the ITCZ and ENSO. A regionally coherent pattern of centennial-scale SASM variations and a significant latitudinal gradient in precipitation responses suggest the contribution of an extratropical moisture source for the SASM, with significant effects on precipitation variability in the southern Altiplano.

FEATURES OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN THE PLANKTON COMMUNITY OF AN ALPINE LAKE WITH INCREASING FISH DENSITY IN SUMMER AND AUTUMN	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												Daphnia (Ctenodaphnia) magna Straus, a large species of the order Cladocera, was revealed to have disappeared from the zooplankton composition with an increase in the density of whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus L., in Lake Sevan, Armenia. This caused an increase in the quantitative characteristics of heterotrophic nanoflagellates, as a result of which the abundance and biomass of bacterioplankton decreased. At the same time, several seasonal features of plankton transformation were noted. In particular, the abundance and biomass of planktonic invertebrates, including D. longispina O.F. Muller and Diaphanosoma lacustris Korinek, both representatives of Cladocera, increased in July. The main reason for this were changes in the distribution of whitefish caused by an increase in their abundance, a depletion of food supply due to the disappearance of D. magna, and a high water temperature. This contributed to the formation of the maximum fish density at depths greater than usual, where the trophic and temperature conditions were combined optimally. Leveling a noticeable influence of fish on zooplankton could also be associated with an increase in the trophic status of the lake, when grazing was compensated for by a higher fecundity of invertebrates. An increase in the trophic status of the lake is evidenced by a rising phytoplankton biomass, which is determined by an increased amount of phosphorus regenerated by Cladocera against the background of a high water temperature. This not only compensated for the grazing of algae and cyanobacteria, but also contributed to an increase in their biomass. In October, the pressure of fish on invertebrates rose due to an increase in their density and the peculiarities of their vertical distribution due to oxygen deficiency in the bottom water layers. Under these conditions, the number of species and the share of Rotifera in the total abundance and biomass of zooplankton increased, while the total abundance and biomass of zooplankton decreased due to the filter-feeding crustaceans D. lacustris and D. longispina. However, a decreased abundance of the latter species failed to lead to changes in the biomass and structure of phytoplankton, which was associated with a decrease in the input of phosphorus excreted by Cladocera. Thus, the response of invertebrates and the groups of plankton organisms they control to an increased density of the fish population depends on the vertical distribution of planktophages, this being determined by water temperature, oxygen concentration, and the quantitative characteristics of food objects.

Distribution of Hauled-Out Ladoga Ringed Seals (Pusa hispida ladogensis) in Spring 2012	ARCTIC												The spatial distribution and habitat selection of the Ladoga ringed seal (Pusa hispida ladogensis), an endangered, freshwater seal, are poorly understood, particularly for the ice-covered period. A fixed-wing, strip-transect aerial survey conducted in early April 2012, before the Lake Ladoga breakup, provided data on seal density and distribution throughout the lake in relation to several environmental covariates: depth, distance to shore, recreational ice-fishing activity, and ice type. A predictive model was applied to combinations of covariates to estimate the total number of seals hauled out on ice of Lake Ladoga. The model estimate was 5068 (95% CI: 4026-7086) seals over an area of 16 827 km(2). The mean observed seal density was 0.29 seals/km(2) (SD = 0.351, range from 0 to 8.61), and density was highest (> 1 seal/km(2)) in regions that were relatively shallow (< 50 m). Densities appeared to increase with distance from shore but dropped off again at the longest distances. The average density was lower in fast ice habitats (0.13 seals/km(2)) than in drifting pack ice habitats (0.44 seals/km(2)). Relatively high seal densities observed in "ice edge" zones (0.26 seals/km(2)) could be explained by the ice formation pattern of large" ridged and hummocked areas in the transition zone between shorefast ice and secondary ice. The presence of fishermen had a highly significant negative effect on seal presence (beta = -7.8, p = 0.0014), resulting in a nearly twofold decrease in seal density in shorefast ice habitats (0.09 seals/km(2) in fishing areas and 0.15 seals/km(2) in areas without fishing activity). An extensive winter recreational fishery, in combination with potential negative trends in ice conditions on the lake, might reduce the amount of suitable habitat for the Ladoga ringed seal in the near future.

Climate and permafrost effects on the chemistry and ecosystems of High Arctic Lakes	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Permafrost exerts an important control over hydrological processes in Arctic landscapes and lakes. Recent warming and summer precipitation has the potential to alter water availability and quality in this environment through thermal perturbation of near surface permafrost and increased mobility of previously frozen solutes to Arctic freshwaters. We present a unique thirteen-year record (2003-16) of the physiochemical properties of two High Arctic lakes and show that the concentration of major ions, especially SO42-, has rapidly increased up to 500% since 2008. This hydrochemical change hasoccurred synchronously in both lakes and ionic ratio changes in the lakes indicate that the source for the SO(4)(2-)is compositionally similar to terrestrial sources arising from permafrost thaw. Recordsummer temperatures during this period (2003-16) following over 100 years of warming and summer precipitation in this polar desert environment provide likely mechanisms for this rapid chemical change. An abrupt limnological change is also reflected in the otolith chemistry and improved relative condition of resident Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and increased diatom diversity point to a positive ecosystem response during the same period.					; Muir, Derek/F-6183-2011; Pieńkowski, Anna/AAL-1312-2020; Pienkowski, Anna/J-9339-2013	Normandeau, Alexandre/0000-0001-7900-7763; Muir, Derek/0000-0001-6631-9776; Pienkowski, Anna/0000-0002-3606-7130; Lafreniere, Melissa/0000-0002-9639-6825													2045-2322					OCT 16	2017	7								13292	10.1038/s41598-017-13658-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-13658-9								29038475					WOS:000413048000103

Habitat selection of Marbled Teal and White-headed Duck during the breeding and wintering seasons in south-eastern Spain	BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL												Understanding habitat requirements is vital for developing successful management strategies for threatened species. In this study we analyse the habitat selection of two globally threatened waterbirds (Marbled Teal Marmaronetta angustirostris and White-headed Duck Oxyura leucocephala) coexisting in an internationally important wetland (El Hondo Natural Park, south-eastern Spain) at three spatial scales. We surveyed adults and broods of these species fortnightly during two consecutive years and we related density and presence of birds to several habitat variables. At a pond-selection scale, the density of both species was related to the surface area of the ponds, with Marbled Teal showing avoidance of medium-sized ponds, andWhite-headed Ducks strong selection for the largest ponds. Within ponds, Marbled Teal avoided open waters, and was mainly associated with Phragmites reedbeds, but also selected areas with saltmarsh and Scirpus vegetation, especially for brood-rearing. White-headed Duck made more use of deeper areas with open water, especially in winter, and Phragmites was the only emergent vegetation with which it associated. When breeding success was very high in 2000, strong creching of broods was observed in White-headed Duck, but not in Marbled Teal. In order to provide suitable habitat for both species, there is a need to maintain spatial diversity with a combination of large wetlands suitable for both species and small, vegetated ones suitable for the Marbled Teal.

This is represented only by natural populations of the subgenus Barbus. The systematic, based mainly on the methods of biometrics, is quite different from one author to another. However, two nominal species are usually cited: Barbus callensis (Valenciennes, 1842), which is limited to the region of El Kala (eastern Algeria) and Barbus setivimensis (Valenciennes, 1842) in other parts of the North. During the ecological study of this fauna, many individuals were found infested with the tapeworm Ligula intestinalis (Linne, 1758), which led us to study the effect of this parasite on B. setivimensis using the ecological parasites' index (prevalence, abundance and parasite intensity) and to focus on the impact of the parasite on the growth of fish. Tapeworm L intestinalis presents a wide geographical distribution and a complex lifecycle to multiple hosts: the cycle starts in the body of birds. The life expectancy in the major host is a maximum of 5 days, but in this time, they will lay a multitude of eggs. These eggs are passed into water via the faeces of the bird. Once in the aquatic medium, they hatch and are eaten by a wide range of copepod zooplankton (first intermediate host). The cycle continues when fish (second intermediate host) ingests the copepod. The worm then burrows through the gut wall and continues to develop in the fish's body cavity. The cycle is then complete when the bird (final host) eats the tapeworm-hosting fish. We studied the effects of diet, the hosting period, the habitat on the prevalence, abundance and intensity of the parasitic larvae plerocercoid L intestinalis and the parasiting effect on the Cyprinids fishs of the genus Barbus in the Keddara dam (Boumerdes, Algeria) during one year. Although L. intestinalis was recorded in several host fish, the available data on the parameters of parasitism are limited and no studies are reported on B. setivimensis. In this study, a total of 613 individuals were sampled and checked on the presence of L. intestinalis plerocercoid stages. Only 64 were infested. The value of the prevalence was 10.44% and the average intensity was 1.89 parasites (average two parasites per infested fish). The infection rate is high during the autumn and low during the spring season. The latter corresponds with the breeding period. (C) 2012 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

This could only have been the result of previous sediment resuspension Mechanisms of sedimentation in the studied lake showed that resuspension and resedimentation can change ''the environmental record'' of events even in a lake with laminated sediments. Higher sedimentation of pollen during autumn circulation confirmed that in the sediment layers (varves or laminae) particles from previous seasons also could have been found. In the bay pollen sedimentation was lower and depended on plant flowering, there was no resuspension.																			0049-6979					OCT	1997	99	1-4					587	592		10.1023/A:1018320329646	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1018320329646													WOS:A1997XW68200060

Gates, a Baptist minister and adviser to John D. Rockefeller Sr., read the entire second edition of The Principles and Practice of Medicine by William Osler while on a summer vacation at Lake Liberty, New York. The book reinforced the low opinion Gates had of the efficacy of medicine but convinced him that medical science would be a wise investment for the Rockefeller fortune. The results of this investment included the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, the General Education Board, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the International Health Board. Gates sponsored Rockefeller funding of full-time clinical professorships, an idea that Osler opposed but that eventually became the prevailing model for medical departments at universities in the United States.																			0003-4819	1539-3704				JUL 15	1997	127	2					148	153		10.7326/0003-4819-127-2-199707150-00010	http://dx.doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-127-2-199707150-00010								9230006					WOS:A1997XK15800012
J	MALM, J; JONSSON, L				MALM, J; JONSSON, L			WATER-SURFACE TEMPERATURE CHARACTERISTICS AND THERMAL BAR EVOLUTION DURING SPRING IN LAKE LADOGA	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The present article is a study of the surface temperature distribution and its evolution during spring in Lake Ladoga, using NOAA-AVHRR Channel 4/Channel 5 (CH4/CH5) data, with special focus on a thermohydrodynamic phenomenon, called thermal bar. The split-window technique, where both constant and atmospheric-mass-dependent retrieval coefficients are tested, is used for calculating the atmosphere effects in the temperature derivation. The satellite-derived temperature data are compared with field data from six different years. The results show that on average, the satellite-derived temperatures exceed the in situ data by approximately 0.5-degrees-C. The relative advantages of images from day or night passes for the study of the thermal bar is also discussed. Surface temperature differences in the convectively mixed region (temperatures less than 4-degrees-C) show that day temperatures are on the order of 0.5-degrees-C higher than the night temperatures. However, the surface temperatures from day images seem to be more representative of the bulk temperature in a water column. A comparison of the thermal bar progression in Lake Ladoga during spring 1988 as obtained from satellite images and as predicted by a simple theoretical model shows good agreement. This result and results from an earlier study indicate that the model is a good prediction tool for thermal bar movement in large temperate lakes.

Release of CO2 and CH4 from lakes and drainage ditches in temperate wetlands	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Shallow fresh water bodies in peat areas are important contributors to greenhouse gas fluxes to the atmosphere. In this study we determined the magnitude of CH4 and CO2 fluxes from 12 water bodies in Dutch wetlands during the summer season and studied the factors that might regulate emissions of CH4 and CO2 from these lakes and ditches. The lakes and ditches acted as CO2 and CH4 sources of emissions to the atmosphere; the fluxes from the ditches were significantly larger than the fluxes from the lakes. The mean greenhouse gas flux from ditches and lakes amounted to 129.1 +/- A 8.2 (mean +/- A SE) and 61.5 +/- A 7.1 mg m(-2) h(-1) for CO2 and 33.7 +/- A 9.3 and 3.9 +/- A 1.6 mg m(-2) h(-1) for CH4, respectively. In most water bodies CH4 was the dominant greenhouse gas in terms of warming potential. Trophic status of the water and the sediment was an important factor regulating emissions. By using multiple linear regression 87% of the variation in CH4 could be explained by PO4 (3-) concentration in the sediment and Fe2+ concentration in the water, and 89% of the CO2 flux could be explained by depth, EC and pH of the water. Decreasing the nutrient loads and input of organic substrates to ditches and lakes by for example reducing application of fertilizers and manure within the catchments and decreasing upward seepage of nutrient rich water from the surrounding area will likely reduce summer emissions of CO2 and CH4 from these water bodies.

J	Miller, GH; Wolfe, AP; Briner, JP; Sauer, PE; Nesje, A				Miller, GH; Wolfe, AP; Briner, JP; Sauer, PE; Nesje, A			Holocene glaciation and climate evolution of Baffin Island Arctic Canada	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Lake sediment cores and cosmogenic exposure (CE) dates constrain the pattern of deglaciation and evolution of climate across Baffin Island since the last glacial maximum (LGM). CE dating of erratics demonstrates that the northeastern coastal lowlands became ice-free ca. 14 ka as the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS) receded from its LGM margin on the continental shelf. Coastal lakes in southeastern Baffin Island started to accumulate sediment at this time, whereas initial lacustrine sedimentation was delayed by two millennia in the north. Reduced organic matter in lake sediment deposited during the Younger Dryas chron, and the lack of a glacial readvance at that time suggest cold summers and reduced snowfall. Ice retreated rapidly after I I ka but was interrupted by a widespread readvance of both the LIS and local mountain glaciers similar to 9.6 ka (Cockburn Substage). A second readvance occurred just before 8 ka during a period of unusually cold summers, corresponding to the 8.2 ka cold event in the Greenland Ice Sheet. Most local glaciers were behind their present margins before 7 ka, and in some instances much earlier, although the Foxe Dome of the LIS continued to slowly retract toward the present day Barnes Ice Cap throughout the Holocene. Pollen in lake sediments is rare and dominated by exotic sources prior to 12 ka. Subsequently, grass tundra became established, followed by modern tundra vegetation ca. 8 ka, with subtle changes in pollen assemblages in the late Holocene. Lake primary productivity peaked in the early Holocene, before terrestrial vegetation or marine surface waters reached their apparent thermal maxima. Lacustrine, marine, and glacial proxies all reflect significant late Holocene cooling. The onset of Neoglaciation is well dated in lacustrine records at ca. 6 ka, with intensification after 2.5 ka. The expansion of local glaciers during the Little Ice Age represents the most extensive advance since 7 ka. We suggest that the replacement of Atlantic surface waters by cold, low-salinity Arctic Ocean water, coupled with the steady reduction of summer insolation, resulted in a significant positive sea-ice feedback that produced a larger late Holocene summer temperature depression over the Baffin region than in the Pacific sector of the Arctic.

Pacific Interannual and Multidecadal Variability Recorded in δ18O of South American Summer Monsoon Precipitation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The South American summer monsoon (SASM) generates important hydroclimatic impacts in (sub-)tropical South America and isotopic tracers recorded in paleoclimatic archives allow for assessing its long-term response to Pacific variability prior to modern observations. Stable oxygen isotopes in precipitation integrate hydroclimatic changes during the SASM mature phase from December to February (DJF) in response to the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and El Ni & ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), respectively. Here, results from the isotope-enabled Community Atmosphere Model v.5 are compared with highly resolved and precisely dated isotopic records from speleothems, tree rings, lake and ice cores during the industrial era (1880-2000 CE) and validated against observations from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) network. Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are coupled to the isotopic composition of SASM precipitation through perturbations in the Walker circulation associated with low- (IPO) and high-frequency (ENSO) variability, impacting convective activity over tropical South America and the tropical Atlantic. Changes in convection over this monsoon entrance region ultimately control the downstream oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation recorded in paleoclimate archives. Overall, model results, paleoclimate records and IAEA data agree on the isotopic response to Pacific SST forcing. These results highlight the potential for long isotopic paleoclimate records to reconstruct Pacific climate variability on both high- and low-frequency timescales. Furthermore, the isolation of the IPO signal in a diverse set of isotopic archives invites the reinterpretation of other paleoclimate proxies for identifying this historically overlooked forcing.

Both wetlands were important staging and roosting grounds formigratorywaterfowl for ages. The exposure modelwas used to quantify the risk of exposure tometals through oral ingestion. Exposure doses of Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cr through food plants ingestion and food-associated sediment consumption pathwayswere two potent sources of heavy metal exposure in the waterfowl under study. Exposure through water intake was ignored asmetalswere either of negligible concentrations or below the detection limit inwater samples. Heavy metal concentrations showed significant positive correlations between bottom sediment and plant at both sites. At Purulia Sahebbandh (Site 1), the total exposure dose of all four metals was much higher than their conforming tolerable daily intake (TDI), and thereby, the metals might pose threats to the migratory wintering herbivorous waterfowl populations. However, in Adra Sahebbandh (Site 2), total exposure doses of Pb, Zn and Cuwere much below their corresponding TDI. The Hazard Quotient (HQ) of Cr was highest followed by nonessential toxic Pb and these two elements could be considered as priority pollutants at Site 1. Prioritize threats were decreased in the following sequence: Cr > Pb > Cu > Zn at Site 1 and Cr > Zn > Pb > Cu at Site 2. Hazard Index was found to be >5 at Site 1 and formuch highermetal loads a significant correlation between metal concentrations in plants, bottom sediment and exposure doses were also recorded. Therefore, the peri-urban Purulia Sahebbandh wetland could immediately be considered for risk control and demanded holistic management of important waterfowl habitats.

Field observations and laboratory experiments on growth and lipid content of young-of-the-year perch	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Differences in growth and allocation of energy of young-of-the-year (YOY) perch (Perca fluviatilis) were studied in relation to both quantity and quality of food. Feeding on fish and Mysidacea, the mean size of YOY perch after the first growing season in Lake Pfeiffer was 152 mm. In contrast, YOY perch grew to 107 mm in Lake Speldrop and 83 mm in Lake Reeser Meer while mainly feeding on zooplankton. In correlation with food uptake and growth, the lipid content of YOY perch was significantly highest in Lake Pfeiffer and lowest in Lake Reeser Meer, assuming that YOY perch from Lake Pfeiffer should be able to survive starvation periods during their first winter better then those from Lake Speldrop and Lake Reeser. While feeding on fish, mean highest growth rates were 1.31 mm center dot day(-1) in the laboratory. Growth in weight started when food uptake exceeded 66 J center dot g WW-1 center dot day(-1), while an increase of lipid content required food input of 175 J center dot g WW-1 center dot day(-1). Increased growth potential associated with the availability of energetically profitable food is assumed as an important factor that could have far-reaching consequences for the fish community.

J	MAZUMDER, A; DICKMAN, MD				MAZUMDER, A; DICKMAN, MD			FACTORS AFFECTING THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF PHOTOTROPHIC SULFUR BACTERIA	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Seasonal and vertical distribution of phototrophic sulfur bacteria and their relationships with changes in physico-chemical parameters, abundance of dominant zooplankton species, and in situ grazing by Daphnia, were studied in meromictic Crawford Lake, Ontario [Canada]. Purple and green sulfur bacteria were common, with purple forms being dominating. These bacteria formed a 2 m thick layer whose upper and lower boundaries were set by H2S concentration and light intensity, respectively. The peak concentration on any date was at a depth where light intensity was optimum and H2S concentration was maximum. The position of the bacterial layer shifted up following summer algal blooms and shifted down following oxygen intrusion into the lower mixolimnion and chemocline following overturns. Temporal changes in the concentration of bacteria were related to abundance of Daphnia near the bacterial layer, suggesting that Daphnia grazing may control bacterial biomass. That Daphnia consume phototrophic bacteria was supported by in situ grazing measurements, aggregation of Daphnia immediately above the bacterial layer, higher abundance of pink Daphnia in the deeper water, and spectrophotometric analysis of crushed Daphnia. Daphnia at the bacterial layer consumed over 1.8% .cntdot. h-1 (seasonal average) of the phototrophic bacterial biomass, and substantially more on several occasions in the summer.																			0003-9136					AUG	1989	116	2					209	226																WOS:A1989AM67200006

Physical Controls on the Hydrology of Perennially Ice-Covered Lakes, Taylor Valley, Antarctica (1996-2013)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												The McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, are a polar desert populated with numerous closed-watershed, perennially ice-covered lakes primarily fed by glacial melt. Lake levels have varied by as much as 8 m since 1972 and are currently rising after a decade of decreasing. Precipitation falls as snow, so lake hydrology is dominated by energy available to melt glacier ice and to sublimate lake ice. To understand the energy and hydrologic controls on lake level changes and to explain the variability between neighboring lakes, only a few kilometers apart, we model the hydrology for the three largest lakes in Taylor Valley. We apply a physically based hydrological model that includes a surface energy balance model to estimate glacial melt and lake sublimation to constrain mass fluxes to and from the lakes. Results show that lake levels are very sensitive to small changes in glacier albedo, air temperature, and wind speed. We were able to balance the hydrologic budget in two watersheds using meltwater inflow and sublimation loss from the ice-covered lake alone. A third watershed, closest to the coast, required additional inflow beyond model uncertainties. We hypothesize a shallow groundwater system within the active layer, fed by dispersed snow patches, contributes 23% of the inflow to this watershed. The lakes are out of equilibrium with the current climate. If the climate of our study period (1996-2013) persists into the future, the lakes will reach equilibrium starting in 2300, with levels 2-17 m higher, depending on the lake, relative to the 2020 level. Plain Language Summary The McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) in Antarctica are a polar desert, characterized by a cold and dry climate. A number of permanently ice-covered lakes occupy the MDV. These lake are fed by melt from nearby glaciers, and many lakes occupy watersheds with no outlet. Lake levels have changed dramatically in the past. Precipitation in the MDV falls as snow, contributing very little water directly to the lakes. Lake hydrology is controlled by the energy available to melt glacier ice and to sublimate ice from the frozen lake surface. To understand the energy and water balance controls on lake level changes, we model the hydrology for the three largest lakes in Taylor Valley. We use a numerical model, based on real world hydrological processes, to estimate the water balance of these lakes. The model results show that lake levels are highly responsive to small changes in glacier albedo, summer air temperature, and wind speed. The lakes in Taylor Valley are out of balance with the current climate. If the climate of our study period (1996-2013) continues into the future the lakes will reach levels 2-17 m higher, depending on the lake, relative to the 2020 level.																			2169-9003	2169-9011				DEC	2022	127	12							e2022JF006833	10.1029/2022JF006833	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JF006833													WOS:000924623200001

A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON GENOTOXIC EFFECTS IN OLIGOCHAETA FROM AREAS WITH ELEVATED NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL RADIOACTIVITY	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												A comparative study on genotoxic effects in worm gen. Nais (Oligochaeta) from two selected areas of elevated natural and artificial radioactivity has been carried out. The areas considered were a lake in the Chernobyl NPP area in Ukraine and a spring-created pond in the Ikaria island, in the eastern Aegean sea, Greece. The chromosome aberrations recorded in worm Nais pseudobtusa from the lake in Chernobyl were attributed to beta- and gamma-ionising radiation. Unlike these findings, the chromosome aberrations and the pycnotic nuclei observed in worm Nais communis from the spring-pond in the Ikaria island were probably caused by the combined action of low pH, high water temperature and natural radionuclides as heavy metals or/and micro-aggregated one.

J	Raghul, M; Porchelvan, P				Raghul, Mageswaran; Porchelvan, Ponnusamy			An Approach for Monitoring Chlorophyll-A and Turbidity Levels in Saduperi and Kaveripakkam Lakes Located in and Around Vellore Region, Tamil Nadu, India, Using Spectral Unmixing Technique	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												The paper examines the levels of Chlorophyll-a and turbidity in lake water, which are essential indicators of freshwater ecosystem health. These parameters, indicative of algal presence and suspended matter, respectively, significantly impact aquatic life and human activities. Conventional assessment methods have limitations in coverage, spatial and temporal resolution, and cost, necessitating innovative approaches. This study adopts a comprehensive strategy by merging advanced remote sensing techniques with seasonal monitoring to address a significant gap in understanding Chlorophyll-a and turbidity dynamics in Saduperi and Kaveripakkam Lakes using ESA Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. By leveraging remote sensing technology and advanced algorithms, the research overcomes the shortcomings of traditional monitoring methods. A robust multispectral unmixing model is developed, incorporating carefully chosen endmembers representing Chlorophyll-a and turbidity spectral signatures. Validation with laboratory-derived ground truth data confirms the accuracy and reliability of the unmixing results, achieving high correlation coefficients (R-2 values) and low root mean square error (RMSE) values for all seasons. Specifically, the correlation analysis for chlorophyll-a showed an R-2 value above 0.8 and RMSE values below 0.5, indicating strong linear relationships and high accuracy in the estimation process. For turbidity, R-2 values were above 0.7, with RMSE values less than 0.4 across all seasons. Findings reveal distinct spectral signatures for Chlorophyll-a and turbidity across seasons. During winter, Chlorophyll-a absorption peaks in the red and blue spectral bands (bands 2 and 4), while turbidity variations are noticeable in shorter wavelengths. In summer, Chlorophyll-a levels rise significantly, accompanied by increased turbidity. The monsoon season shows localized responses, with fluctuating Chlorophyll-a and turbidity levels. Linear spectral unmixing effectively estimates Chlorophyll-a and turbidity concentrations, offering insights into water quality dynamics. The study explores the methodology of spectral signature matching, elucidating the spectrum's concentration range. This innovative approach enables accurate estimation, mapping, and temporal analysis of Chlorophyll-a and turbidity in lake water, bridging gaps in remote sensing applications for water quality assessment. Integration with Sentinel-2 imagery enhances understanding of freshwater environments, aiding informed decision-making for sustainable resource management.																			0255-660X	0974-3006				MAR	2025	53	3					711	730		10.1007/s12524-024-02019-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-024-02019-5													WOS:001439311100001

Characterising spatio-temporal variability in seasonal snow cover at a regional scale from MODIS data: the Clutha Catchment, New Zealand	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												A 16-year series of daily snow-covered area (SCA) for 2000-2016 is derived from MODIS imagery to produce a regional-scale snow cover climatology for New Zealand's largest catchment, the Clutha Catchment. Filling a geographic gap in observations of seasonal snow, this record provides a basis for understanding spatio-temporal variability in seasonal snow cover and, combined with climatic data, provides insight into controls on variability. Seasonal snow cover metrics including daily SCA, mean snow cover duration (SCD), annual SCD anomaly and daily snow-line elevation (SLE) were derived and assessed for temporal trends. Modes of spatial variability were characterised, whilst also preserving temporal signals by applying raster principal component analysis (rPCA) to maps of annual SCD anomaly. Sensitivity of SCD to temperature and precipitation variability was assessed in a semi-distributed way for mountain ranges across the catchment. The influence of anomalous winter air flow, as characterised by HYSPLIT back-trajectories, on SCD variability was also assessed. On average, SCA peaks in late June, at around 30 % of the catchment area, with 10 % of the catchment area sustaining snow cover for > 120 d yr(-1). A persistent mid-winter reduction in SCA, prior to a second peak in August, is attributed to the prevalence of winter blocking highs in the New Zealand region. In contrast to other regions globally, no significant decrease in SCD was observed, but substantial spatial and temporal variability was present. rPCA identified six distinct modes of spatial variability, characterising 77 % of the observed variability in SCD. This analysis of SCD anomalies revealed strong spatio-temporal variability beyond that associated with topographic controls, which can result in snow cover conditions being out of phase across the catchment. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the sensitivity of SCD to temperature and precipitation variability varies significantly across the catchment. While two large-scale climate modes, the SOI and SAM, fail to explain observed variability, specific spatial modes of SCD are favoured by anomalous airflow from the NE, E and SE. These findings illustrate the complexity of atmospheric controls on SCD within the catchment and support the need to incorporate atmospheric processes that govern variability of the energy balance, as well as the re-distribution of snow by wind in order to improve the modelling of future changes in seasonal snow.

To this end, we investigated the size and composition of the bud bank of Miscanthus sacchariflorus (Maxim.) Hack. immediately after flooding (November), in winter (January), in spring (March), and before flooding (May) in the wetlands of Dongting Lake. We then examined the sprouting capacity of axillary buds after sediment burial at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 cm. Total bud density of M. sacchariflorus ranged from 2524 buds m(-2) in November to 4293 buds m(-2) in March. Rhizome segments with inactive axillary buds, which represented the majority of the bud population (88.7% in November, 93.3% in May), did not sprout during the 140 days of the experiment (n = 250). The sprouting ratio was the highest for active axillary buds buried at 0 cm (64%) and decreased when buried at 10-20 cm (34%-40%). Due to the large number of active axillary buds in the bud bank (211-277 buds m(-2) from November to the following March), M. sacchariflorus could completely replace its aboveground shoot population, except in May (142 buds m(-2)). Increasing burial depth delayed bud emergence and reduced the growth period of shoots; however, burial depth did not affect the resulting plant height and only reduced the accumulated biomass at 20 cm. Therefore, the belowground bud bank and its strong sprouting capacity are important factors in the maintenance of local populations and colonization of new habitats for M. sacchariflorus after burial disturbances. The present methodology, which combined measurements of bud bank demography and sprouting capacity, may reflect the regeneration potential of clonal plants after burial disturbances.					; LI, feng/HIR-1703-2022	Chen, Xin-sheng/0009-0009-6601-8725; , Xinsheng/0000-0002-3720-247X													1932-6203					MAR 18	2015	10	3							e0120846	10.1371/journal.pone.0120846	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0120846								25785628					WOS:000352138500195
J	COLE, JJ; LIKENS, GE; HOBBIE, JE				COLE, JJ; LIKENS, GE; HOBBIE, JE			DECOMPOSITION OF PLANKTONIC ALGAE IN AN OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE	OIKOS												A new procedure (dip incubation) was used to measure both the dissolution and mineralization (to CO2) of killed, 14C-labeled phytoplankton in an oligotrophic lake. This procedure, based on a series of 24-h incubations in bottles, avoids the problem of extremely long incubations and can be used to measure, independently, the dissolution and mineralization rates of algal detritus of any recent age. In Mirror Lake, New Hampshire [USA] the conversion of particulate C to CO2 occurred only in the presence of living microorganisms and was strongly influenced by the age of the algal detritus and the water temperature. There was a pronounced annual cycle of the conversion of particulates to CO2 with highest rates (average rate for 6 d [days] of 6% d-1) during summer and lowest rates (average rate for 6 d of 0.5% d-1) in winter. In comparison to these average rates, the initial rates of both dissolution and mineralization were higher and much less dependent on temperature. These initial rates, taken alone, would give an erroneously high estimate of the rate of decomposition and underestimate the importance of temperature as a factor controlling decomposition. An annual cycle of these measurements was used in conjunction with models of the age structure of particulate detritus to estimate the metabolism of algal C by planktonic microbes. The estimate (3.6-4.3 .mu.g C l-1 d-1) is comparable to previous measurements of total microbial respiration (of all C-sources) in both amount (3.1 .mu.g C l d-1) and annual pattern. This comparison suggests that algal C is a major C-source for planktonic bacteria in the epilimnion of Mirror Lake.

J	FITZGERALD, SA; GARDNER, WS				FITZGERALD, SA; GARDNER, WS			AN ALGAL CARBON BUDGET FOR PELAGIC-BENTHIC COUPLING IN LAKE-MICHIGAN	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												A budget for algal carbon was constructed to quantify the magnitude and major pathways of pelagic-benthic coupling at a site in southeastern Lake Michigan. The flux of algal C to the benthos and the rate of carbon burial were estimated from sediment traps and dated sediment cores, respectively. Assimilation and respiration rates of Diporeia sp., an abundant benthic amphipod, and of sediment microheterotrophs were measured in a microcosm study with C-14-labeled algae (Melosira italica). Melosira (italica and islandica) accounted for 53% of the algal C flux to the sediments. Radionuclide concentrations indicated no net sediment burial of organic C. Of the total C assimilated by Diporeia, 60% was respired, 35% was incorporated into biomass, and 5% was accounted for as soluble dissolved organic compounds. The areal rate of Diporeia respiration (29 nmol C cm-2 d-1) was 23 times greater than that for sediment bacteria (1.3 nmol C cm-2 d-1). Release of radioisotope in the form of dissolved organic compounds was much lower than that incorporated and respired for both Diporeia and sediment bacteria. Of the 61 mmol C M-2 of algal C estimated to be deposited during the spring bloom, Diporeia assimilation accounted for 61%, significantly more than the 2% observed for microbially mediated algal decomposition. These observations support the hypothesis of a strong pelagic-benthic energy coupling between the spring diatom bloom and Diporeia in Lake Michigan.																			0024-3590					MAY	1993	38	3					547	560		10.4319/lo.1993.38.3.0547	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1993.38.3.0547													WOS:A1993LK31400006

Seasonal Diversity and Morphometric Variations of Rotifers in Relation to Selected Environmental Variables from a Tropical High-Altitude Lake in Mexico	DIVERSITY-BASEL												We studied the species diversity and morphometric variations of rotifers from a high-altitude water body, the Llano reservoir, in central Mexico during September 2021 to August 2022. Samples were collected from four stations in the reservoir every month. During the study period we were able to identify 54 monogonont rotifer species of which Polyarthra vulgaris, Lecane closterocerca, Trichocerca porcellus, Lepadella patella and Keratella cochlearis were numerically the most abundant. Depending on the season, the total rotifer density varied from 250 to 2450 ind L-1. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that the species of Trichocerca similis, Keratella cochlearis, Mytilina ventralis and Scaridium longicaudum were directly related to temperature. Using rotifer species richness and abundance data, we derived the Shannon diversity index, saprobic index and rotifer trophic state index. Data on the geometric morphometrics showed that Keratella cochlearis was found in two of the three climatic periods of the year (dry and winter), while Lecane closterocerca and Trichocerca porcellus occurred during the three climatic seasons (dry, winter and rainy) and formed three distinct clusters in relation to body size.

Core C1 in Lake Chaohu from the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River (MLYR), eastern China, provides an opportunity to investigate vegetation and climate changes, human activities, and East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) evolution since 5100 cal. yr BP. These variables are assessed based on radiocarbon dating, pollen and charcoal records, and magnetic susceptibility (& chi;(lf)), median grain size and TP. Results reveal a hiatus in sedimentation between 2080 and 730 cal. yr BP in the western part of Lake Chaohu, which is common in most lakes in the MLYR. Evergreen and deciduous broadleaved mixed forest retreated gradually after 3650 cal. yr BP, and was replaced by secondary Pinus forest after at least 730 cal. yr BP. Intense agricultural activities and vegetation clearance are first detected at 2520 cal. yr BP. Human settlements expanded from the lake front wetlands (during the period 2520-2080 cal. yr BP) to remote high-altitude areas (2080-100 cal. yr BP), and then returned to the lake front to reclaim the wetlands and lake (after 400 cal. yr BP). A gradual trend of recessional EASM strength from 4300 cal. yr BP and centennial-scale variations of EASM during the period 5100-3650 cal. yr BP are revealed. The reduction of summer insolation, southward shift of the ITCZ, and El Nino Southern Oscillation may control the intensity of EASM and climate on a large regional scale.					; Xiao, Xiayun/G-1396-2012	Hillman, Aubrey/0000-0001-8182-5626; 													1674-7313	1869-1897				JUL	2023	66	7					1450	1467		10.1007/s11430-022-1101-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-022-1101-2		JUN 2023											WOS:001017804100001
J	Callieri, C; Piscia, R				Callieri, C; Piscia, R			Photosynthetic efficiency and seasonality of autotrophic picoplankton in Lago Maggiore after its recovery	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Lago Maggiore is a deep subalpine lake that has regained its previous oligotrophic state during the last decade after going through a process of cultural eutrophication and subsequent restoration. Autotrophic picoplankton (APP) have been studied in Lago Maggiore since 1992, with the primary production of the fraction being measured in 1994 and 1995. In 1998, we began to study the population structure and photosynthetic characteristics of APP after the restoration of the lake. We also compared the seasonal dynamics of APP and nanoplankton biomass and production. In this paper, we show the trend of annual and interannual dynamics of APP from 1993 to 1998. 2. Since 1993 and 1994, APP have almost tripled in numbers (mean values: 1993=44 x 10(3) cell mL(-1) 1998=123 x 10(3) cell mL(-1) ) and in production. On average, APP produced 16 gC m(-2) year(-1) in 1994 and 41.2 gC m(-2) year(-1) in 1998, accounting for 10 and 20%, respectively, of total phototrophic production. 3. Although nanoplankton dominated in terms of biomass and production in the first 6 months of the year, APP were able to compete successfully with them in periods of P limitation. In September 1998, APP carbon fixation actually surpassed that of nanoplankton, reaching 13 mgC m(-3) h(-1) at 3 m. In a comparison of the daily chlorophyll-specific photosynthesis rates of nanoplankton and APP, the latter proved to be more efficient in fixing carbon, particularly in summer and autumn. 4. While the spatial distribution of APP abundance and production followed the isotherms of 18 and 20 degreesC, and was strictly related to water stratification and thermocline appearance, the APP efficiency [mgC (mg chl)(-1) Em(-2) ] had its maximum at the bottom of the euphotic zone, with irradiance in the range 0.5-18 muE m(-2) s(-1) . 5. The existence of a significant regression between APP abundance and carbon fixation (P < 0.001, r (2) =0.92, d.f.=17; APP(prod) =10.6 x 10(3) cell mL(-1) + 15) enabled us to infer APP production from cell numbers, and supports the view that picocyanobacteria production is closely dependent on its standing crop. 6. Lago Maggiore is a good example of how APP in a stabilised oligotrophic system can, under favourable conditions, increase in numbers and effectively exploit the few available resources. We can conclude that the APP population reacts to the reduction in P -levels, but only after several years of stable low nutrient conditions.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2002	47	5					941	956		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00821.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00821.x													WOS:000175251100004

They were subsequently recaptured during spring (white sucker) and fall (lake trout) for the next 5 years. In years 2 and 3 following treatment, fish were spawned to assess reproductive success and survival of their offspring. Survival of adult lake trout and white sucker treated with toxaphene was decreased compared with controls. No changes in growth were evident in either species due to toxaphene treatment. No differences occurred in fertilization rate, total survival, or incidence of deformities in eggs and fry from female lake trout treated with toxaphene. Fertilization rates and survival to swim-up of white sucker eggs and fry from females treated with toxaphene decreased relative to controls in both years. Maternal transfer of toxaphene from female to eggs was observed in both white sucker and lake trout; levels in eggs were much lower than in treated females but were still significantly higher than in controls. Residue analyses showed that depuration of toxaphene was slower than expected, with estimated half-lives of 314 and 793 d in lake trout and white sucker, respectively.					; Muir, Derek/F-6183-2011	Muir, Derek/0000-0001-6631-9776; 													0730-7268	1552-8618				SEP	1999	18	9					1992	2000		10.1002/etc.5620180918	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620180918													WOS:000082201700018

Spatio-temporal patterns of occupation and density by an invasive fish in streams	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Since its introduction to North America in the 1990s, the round goby has spread throughout the Great Lakes and inland movement into small tributaries, a new environment for this species in both its native and invaded ranges, is becoming more prevalent. We assessed spatial and temporal occupation of round gobies in four small streams in two systems in south-central Ontario, Canada to determine which habitat variables are the best predictors of round goby density. Two streams are tributaries of Lake Ontario and two are tributaries of the Otonabee River; all of these streams have barriers preventing upstream migration. Occupation and density patterns differed between the systems. In the Lake Ontario system, density was highest near the longitudinal centre of the stream between the mouth and first barrier, and round goby appeared to occupy these streams mainly from spring to fall. In the Otonabee River system, round goby occupied the streams year-round, and the most important factor determining adult density was distance from a barrier to upstream movement, with density highest next to the barriers. Adult density in Lake Ontario tributaries was highest in sites with a high percentage of cobble/boulder and a low percentage of gravel substrate, while substrate was less important in Otonabee River tributaries. Date was the strongest predictor of juvenile density, with density increasing through the sampling period in both systems. Occupation and density patterns may differ due to contrasting environmental conditions in the source environments and distance to the first barrier preventing upstream movement. This study shows diversity in invasion strategies, and provides insight into the ability of invasive species to change their occupation strategies based on the different environments they encounter.

This occupies the tectonic syncline of Bucegi which is situated between Cheile Tatarului and Cheile Zanoagei, at south, resulted from the background deformations of precadomian crystalline and the deposition blanket being made from the succession of Dogger, Malm and Albian. On the level of the litho-group of Malm-Dogger calcareous stones and Albian grit conglomerates, there is a hydrocarstic system which is drained by the springs line situated at about 1.8 km downstream from the Bolboci barrage, which are known as the "Seven Springs". The systematic observations on the spring flows, are in correlation with the water level of Bolboci lake and the changing biochemical characteristics of the geological environment, in point of: the underground water level, drainage flows, gradients and flows speed, chemistry of the microbiological charge of the underground water. The changes from the geological environment manifested themselves differently in time and can be classified in: short term and long term changes. The short term changes appear at the flows discharge of the underground waters through: the underground water level grows with about 100m downstream of Bolboci barrage; the discharge flows hydrograph is modified in the drainage points; the running speed increase and the time the underground waters need to go through the karst lower; microbiological charges of some springs appears at the drainage frontier. The long term changes appear in: the increased rate of dissolution of the calcareous stones, which determines an amplification of the karst phenomena, with the possibility of development of karst holes. So, it is appreciated that the double time of porosity formation may have been reduced at half compared to the natural conditions.					frinculeasa, madalina/C-2660-2012																				2009							293	300																WOS:000276074500043

Further study into the chemical components composing wintertime PM2.5 and how the composition and level of wintertime PM2.5 are related to meteorological conditions can lead to a better understanding of the causes of high PM2.5 and aid in development and application of emission controls. The results can also aid in short-term air-pollution forecasting and implementation of periodic emission controls such as burning bans. This study examines relationships between PM2.5 concentrations and wintertime atmospheric stability (defined by heat deficit) during snow-covered and snow-free conditions from 2000 to 2013 for five western U.S. urbanizations: Salt Lake City, Utah; Reno, Nevada; Boise, Idaho; Missoula, Montana; and Spokane, Washington. Radiosonde data were used where available to calculate daily heat deficit, which was compared with PM2.5 concentration for days with snow cover and days with no snow cover. Chemically speciated PM2.5 data were compared for snow-cover and snow-free days to see whether the chemical abundances varied by day category. Wintertime PM2.5 levels were highly correlated with heat deficit for all cities except Spokane, where the airport sounding does not represent the urban valley. For a given static stability, snow-cover days experienced higher PM2.5 levels than did snow-free days, mainly because of enhanced ammonium nitrate concentrations. Normalizing average PM2.5 to the heat deficit reduced year-to-year PM2.5 variability, resulting in stronger downward trends, mostly because of reduced carbonaceous aerosol concentrations. The study was limited to western U.S. cities, but similar results are expected for other urban areas in mountainous terrain with cold, snowy winters.

Their microbial communities have crucial roles in food webs and biogeochemical cycling, yet how their communities are assembled along environmental gradients is still understudied. This study aimed to reveal the environmental drivers of diversity (OTU-based richness, evenness, and phylogenetic diversity) and community composition from a network of saline temporary ponds, soda pans, in two consecutive spring seasons characterized by contrasting weather conditions. We used DNA-based molecular methods to investigate microbial community composition. We tested the effect of environmental variables on the diversity of prokaryotic (Bacteria, Cyanobacteria) and microeukaryotic functional groups (ciliates, heterotrophic flagellates and nanoflagellates, fungi, phytoplankton) within and across the years. Conductivity and the concentration of total suspended solids and phosphorus were the most important environmental variables affecting diversity patterns in all functional groups. Environmental conditions were harsher and they also had a stronger impact on community composition in the dry spring. Our results imply that these conditions, which are becoming more frequent with climate change, have a negative effect on microbial diversity in temporary saline ponds. This eventually might translate into community-level shifts across trophic groups with changing local conditions with implications for ecosystem functioning.

The aquatic ecology of these wetlands is partly controlled by the salinity of the wetland pond water, which affects the vegetation and invertebrate communities. The objective of this study was to identify the key geochemical processes affecting water chemistry in prairie wetlands. We used the combined water and solute mass balance approach to quantify the rates of geochemical reactions in a typical prairie recharge wetland in Saskatchewan, Canada. Sulfate reduction, carbonate mineral dissolution, and processes adding carbon dioxide to the pond were identified as the key geochemical reactions. Sulfate reduction removed more sulfate from the pond than infiltration in each of the four years examined. The average rate of sulfate reduction, 0.07 g m(-2) d(-1), was greatest in spring and decreased during the year. Reduced sulfate remains in the sediments but is re-oxidized when the pond dries out and is dissolved into the pond water and sediment pore water when the pond re-floods. X-ray diffraction analyses of wetland soil and mass balance calculations indicate magnesium-calcite is dissolved into the pond water in the spring and precipitates out of solution later in the year, and dissolves into the pond the following year.

Strong altitudinal control on the response of local glaciers to Holocene climate change in southwest Greenland	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Accelerating ice loss during recent years has made the Greenland Ice Sheet one of the largest single contributors to global sea level rise, accounting for 0.5 of the total 3.2 mm yr(-1). This loss is predicted to continue and will most likely increase in the future as a consequence of global warming. However, the sensitivity of glaciers and ice caps (GICs) in Greenland to prolonged warm periods is less well constrained and geological records documenting the long-term glacial history are needed to put recent observations into a broader perspective. Here we report the results from three proglacial lakes where fluctuations in local glaciers located at different altitudes in Kobbefjord, southwest Greenland have been recorded. Our results show that the lakes received meltwater from the initial deglaciation of the area similar to 9.2 cal. ka BP until similar to 8.7-7.9 cal. 1<a BP when the meltwater input ceased as the glaciers most likely disappeared. Regrowth of glaciers began again at similar to 5.5 cal. ka BP at similar to 1370 m a.s.l., similar to 3.6 cal. 1<a at similar to 1170 m a.s.l., and similar to 1.6 cal. ka BP at similar to 1000 m a.s.l., clearly reflecting strong altitudinal control of the GIC response to Neoglacial cooling. Our results highlight that GICs in Kobbefjord, southwest Greenland are primarily influenced by changes in summer air temperatures and winter precipitation and that they are facing a rapid decay that most likely will result in their disappearance within the next centuries as a consequence of global warming. If current 21st Century retreat rates continue, the GICs in the study area will be completely gone in similar to 30-90 years, with the smallest GICs disappearing first. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Sean			Discovery of Important Postbreeding Sites for Barrow's Goldeneye in the Boreal Transition Zone of Alberta	WATERBIRDS												Sites where Barrow's Goldeneye (Bucephala islandica) undergo remigial molt and fall staging are poorly known, with only two major sites documented in Alaska and the Yukon Territory. Satellite telemetry, aerial surveys and ground surveys were used to identify previously unknown molting and fall staging areas in the Boreal Transition Zone (BTZ) of northern Alberta. Of 816 wetlands surveyed between 2004 and 2006 in the BTZ, 40-45% (105-127 lakes annually) had molting goldeneyes. Of these, 1.3-3.3% were used by large aggregations of goldeneyes (>100 birds). Two wetlands, Cardinal and Leddy Lakes, were particularly important, with an estimated 5,000-7,000 Barrow's Goldeneyes, primarily adult males, using these sites during remigial molt and fall staging. Birds used these sites up to five months or over one-third of their annual cycle. Half of adult males marked with satellite transmitters at a breeding area in interior British Columbia used Cardinal Lake for postbreeding activities. Discovery of these sites represents some of the largest concentrations of molting Barrow's Goldeneyes in North America, and the only major molting sites currently known for the intermountain breeding portion of the western population. Protection of Cardinal and Leddy Lakes, and other significant molting and staging sites within the BTZ, should be a priority conservation effort for this species.

An integrative methodological framework for setting environmental criteria: Evaluation of stakeholder perceptions	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												In water quality management, delisting decisions for impaired waterbodies bear resemblance to the statistical null hypothesis testing in which the prevailing conditions in the system at hand are compared against a reference (or non-impaired) state. This binary comparison presupposes the existence of a robust delineation of what constitutes a non-impaired state along with the establishment of threshold values for key environmental variables that act as surrogates for the degree of system impairment. Drawing the dichotomy between impaired and non-impaired conditions can be a challenging exercise, as it can be influenced by different trade-offs between environmental priorities and socioeconomic values. In this study, we present an integrative methodological framework that first uses mathematical modelling to reproduce the fundamental relationships between external stressors and ecosystem response and then statistically links the projected patterns with the likelihood to achieve acceptable water quality conditions. Our case study is the Bay of Quinte, Ontario, Canada; an embayment at the northeastern end of Lake Ontario with a long history of eutrophication. Our survey was conducted during the winter and spring of 2014 and included a total of 51 individuals who were actively involved with the Bay of Quinte Remedial Action Plan. Our analysis found that there is a perceptual difference between public and experts in that the latter group tends to more favorably characterize the present conditions, but is also more conservative about the delisting prospects of the system. Statistical analysis showed an average level of confidence lower than 50% about the delisting likelihood when experts were asked to assess the current water quality criteria. We conclude by arguing that the occurrence frequency of extreme conditions (i.e., exceedance of maximum allowable nutrient levels and/or toxic algal blooms) should be an integral component of the delisting process.

Trophic state modeling for shallow freshwater reservoir: a new approach	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Lakes and reservoirs around the world are facing a substantial water quality degradation problem that poses significant environmental, social, and economic impacts. Reservoir productivity is influenced primarily by the climatic, morphometric, and hydro-edaphic features. High nutrient loadings in the reservoir from agriculture runoff often provide ideal conditions for algal blooms, leading to eutrophication. Reservoir and lake management to prevent or reduce eutrophication, therefore, has become the need of the hour. The traditional approach of trophic state monitoring by rigorous field surveys and eutrophication modeling has been revised in the present study by developing a new trophic state index (TSI)-based model for tropical shallow freshwater reservoirs. The new model has been constructed based on Carlson's Limnology and Oceanography, 22, 361-369, (1977) guidelines by establishing an empirical relationship between trophic parameters including total phosphorus (TP), Secchi disk depth (SDD), and chlorophyll (Chl-a). After comparing the new model with various earlier models for its applicability and validation with actual field conditions, it was found to be most precise over previous TSI models. Temporal and spatial fluctuations in the water quality of the Tiru reservoir were primarily attributed to the changing climatic conditions during the study period. Seasonal monsoon with less frequency, heavy nutrient loading from agriculture runoff, and increased turbidity due to a high level of sediment inflow during monsoon raised the TSI (SDD) values of the Tiru reservoir to place it in the hyper-eutrophic class. Average TSI values during winter for SDD, Chl-a, and TP were indicative of the meso-eutrophic to eutrophic state. Saturation of nutrients due to low water level during summer season caused the poly-eutrophic condition for TSI (SDD)- and TSI (TP)-based estimates and eutrophic condition as per TSI (Chl-a) estimates. However, seasonal deviations of the TSI values based on the relationship between TSI (Chl-a) and TSI (SD) indicated a predominance of smaller particles (non-algal turbidity) during all seasons. Even though TP present in the Tiru reservoir is controlling the algal production, it is also affected by low-light conditions due to non-algal turbidity. The recommendation from this study is that the TSI method for estimating the health of the water bodies is the efficient, cost-effective, and time-saving approach. The model developed during the study would help managers and policy makers to take necessary steps to reduce eutrophication levels in the reservoir and would be helpful for researchers in developing new concepts and protocols, mainly focusing on shallow freshwater reservoirs.					; Markad, Adinath/AAC-6258-2022	, Dr. Adinath T.

J	Villastrigo, A; García-Criado, F				Villastrigo, Adrian; Garcia-Criado, Francisco			Response of a littoral macroinvertebrate assemblage to a persistent hydrological drought in a permanent mountain shallow lake from northwestern Spain	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Current projections predict an intensification of hydrological drought as a consequence of climate change, but we know very little about the potential effects on aquatic communities. La Bana (SW Leon Province, Spain) is a mountain lake suffering from increased water seepage due to geological reasons. This has caused since 2005 a situation of hydrological drought, with pronounced reduction of lake area in late summer. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of this drought on the littoral macroinvertebrate assemblage. Macroinvertebrate samples were collected in 2005 (before the drought events became apparent), 2006 and 2014, as well as in a nearby temporary pond (only in 2014). The most evident change shown by the assemblage at La Bana was a drop in richness values. Rarefaction curves showed that richness in the lake in 2014 was, for an equivalent sampling effort, only slightly higher than that in the temporary pond, and much lower than that in the lake in 2005 or 2006. However, the assemblage composition did not shift toward a fauna typical of temporary waterbodies. The results might indicate that the resistance of the assemblage was high enough to prevent changes in the first moments (differences between 2005 and 2006 were small), but not after nine years of sustained summer drought.

J	Sun, AZ; Feng, ZD				Sun, Aizhi; Feng, Zhaodong			Holocene climatic reconstructions from the fossil pollen record at Qigai Nuur in the southern Mongolian Plateau	HOLOCENE												This study focuses on the reconstructions of vegetation and climate changes during the past similar to 11,000 years on the basis of 222 fossil pollen samples from Qigai Nuur (core QGN-2004) in the southern part of the Mongolian Plateau. Plant Functional Type - Modern Analogue Technique was used for quantitative climatic reconstructions from fossil pollen data. Our results showed that regional vegetation experienced dramatic shifts between steppe forest and dry steppe before 9200 cal. yr BP in the Qigai Nuur region. The reconstructed mean annual temperature and especially mean annual precipitation also showed fluctuations at that time. From similar to 9200 to similar to 2800 cal. yr BP, the vegetation was dominated by steppe forests, and the reconstructed climate was generally warm and wet, but with two cold and dry intervals at similar to 7400 to similar to 6000 cal. yr BP and at similar to 4000 to similar to 2800 cal. yr BP. From similar to 2800 to similar to 850 cal. yr BP, dry steppe vegetation dominated the landscape under slightly cooler and much drier climate conditions. During the past similar to 850 years, the vegetation was characterized by abundant herbs and the climate showed rising temperature and fluctuating precipitation. The comparison of the reconstructed precipitation from the Qigai Nuur core with monsoon-strength records from southern China shows that the first-order variation in the precipitation was most likely controlled by the summer insolation-dictated Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone movements (i.e. N-S shifts). The comparison of the reconstructed precipitation from Qigai Nuur core with surface sea temperature in the Western Tropical Pacific Ocean suggests that the second-order variation in the precipitation was most likely modulated by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation dynamics (i.e. E-W shifts).																			0959-6836	1477-0911				OCT	2013	23	10					1391	1402		10.1177/0959683613489581	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683613489581													WOS:000325710400003
J	Chen, YZ; Zhu, JR				Chen Yizhong; Zhu Jianrong			Reducing eutrophication risk of a reservoir by water replacement: a case study of the Qingcaosha reservoir in the Changjiang Estuary	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												Eutrophication of freshwater systems in cities is a major concern worldwide. Physical, biological and chemical methods have been used in eutrophic lakes and reservoirs to reduce their eutrophic state and algal biomass, but these approaches are not effective without a substantial reduction in nutrients input, which could take decades to achieve in the developing countries. This study aims to assess the risk of eutrophication and algal bloom in a coastal reservoir with high nutrient inputs to confirm the feasibility of inhibiting the reservoir's eutrophic state by hydrodynamic operations. A variety of water quality indexes (e.g., water temperature, secchi depth, dissolved oxygen, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, phytoplankton chlorophyll a) at five observed sites were investigated in the Qingcaosha reservoir, which located in the Changjiang Estuary, during the construction, trial and normal operation periods from 2009 to 2012. No water exchange happened during the construction from April 2009 to October 2010, and the water exchange increased during the trial from October 2010 to January 2011, and during normal operation period from January 2011. The comprehensive nutrition state index (TLI) calculated by several representative water quality indexes was adopted to evaluate the variation of the trophic state in the reservoir. The peak values of TLI reached 51 in the summer of 2009, and 55 in the summer of 2011, higher than the eutrophication threshold value 50. The lowest TLI, about 32, appeared in the summer of 2010. The values of TLI in other observation periods could keep under 50. The results showed that the reservoir could easily deteriorate into the eutrophic state because of excess nutrients and algal blooms in the summer of 2009 and 2011, while the eutrophication and algal blooms could be reduced by the lack of nutrients in 2010 or adequate water replacement in 2012. The temporal and spatial variations of water quality indexes were presented based on observation data and analysis. The adequate water replacement in the reservoir driven by tides was tested to be an efficient and economical method for controlling eutrophication and algae blooms in the water environment with high nutrient inputs.					chen, yizhong/G-2485-2016	chen, yizhong/0000-0002-1552-1162													0253-505X	1869-1099				JUN	2018	37	6					23	29		10.1007/s13131-018-1183-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13131-018-1183-7													WOS:000434813500004

The formation of MgSO4-deficient evaporites in the QSL, whether from the evaporation of river waters with high Na+ and Cl- levels, bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) in brines resulting in SO42- depletion, or the mixing of the river and spring waters, remains controversial. The delta S-34 values of 33 intercrystalline brines and 10 gypsum samples from a sediment core (ISL1A) collected in the QSL were presented in this study. Combining these results with previously reported major ionic concentrations, total dissolved solids (TDS) and delta S-34 values of different waters, and Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of sediments, it was concluded that (1) delta S-34 values of the intercrystalline brines (+ 6.7 parts per thousand to +12.1 parts per thousand) and gypsum (+ 8.1 parts per thousand to +10.1 parts per thousand) suggested that the BSR was insignificant in the QSL. These values were dominated by those of inflowing waters and the evaporation process; (2) river waters with high Na+ and Cl- levels were unable to form MgSO4-deficient evaporites in the QSL. A strong positive correlation of Na and Cl equivalents coupled with high (Na + Cl-)/TDS ratios suggested that the large amount of solutes in Golmud River waters results from the dissolution of halite rather than the chemical weathering of rocks; and (3) the flowing system of the river and spring in the past 50 kyr was similar to the modern supplying system, and mixing of river and spring waters was responsible for the precipitation of evaporites in the QSL.

J	Li, Y; Han, L; Liu, XQ; Song, YG; Wang, YX				Li, Yun; Han, Li; Liu, Xingqi; Song, Yougui; Wang, Yixuan			Correlation and anti-correlation of the Asian summer monsoon and westerlies during the Holocene	GONDWANA RESEARCH												The relationship between the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) and westerlies at different timescales is still under discussion. In this paper, we present Holocene precipitation records derived from loess and lake sediment in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and reconstruct changes in the strength of the ASM during the Holocene. Compared with other Eurasian paleohydroclimatic records, we find that precipitation variations between ASM- and westerlies-dominant regions are positively correlated (anti-correlated) at millennial (sub-orbital) timescales. Based on the analysis of the TraCE-21 results, we suggest that Atlantic meridional overturning circulation may be the primary reason for this in-phase pattern at millennial timescales whereas this anti-phased pattern at sub-orbital timescales is attributed to precessional changes. Due to different response mechanisms, the relationship between the ASM and westerlies may differ significantly at different timescales, which highlights the complex dynamic characteristics of atmospheric systems in the Northern Hemisphere and the challenges for future predictions.

Field measurement campaigns over seawater surface at Kristineberg Marine Research Station (KMRS) and over Hovgardsan River surface at Knobesholm in southwestern Sweden were conducted to measure mercury flux using a dynamic flux chamber technique coupled with automatic mercury vapor-phase analyzers. Both sites show net emissions during summer time. Mercury fluxes measured over both river and seawater surfaces exhibit a consistently diurnal pattern with maximum fluxes during the daytime period and minimum fluxes during the nighttime period. At freshwater site, mercury flux is strongly correlated with the intensity of net solar radiation, and negatively correlated with relative humidity. A typical exponential relationship between mercury flux and water temperature was observed at freshwater measurement site. At seawater site, a strong correlation between mercury flux and intensity of solar radiation was obtained. The driving force of mercury emission from water surface to air is the super-saturation of dissolved gaseous mercury in aqueous phase.

(Verrucomicrobiota)	SYSTEMATIC AND APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												A novel facultatively anaerobic moderately thermophilic bacterium, strain B-154 T, was isolated from a terrestrial hot spring in the Baikal lake region (Russian Federation). Gram-negative, motile, spherical cells were present singly, in pairs, or aggregates, and reproduced by binary fission. The strain grew at 30-57 & DEG;C and within a pH range of 5.1-8.4 with the optimum at 50 & DEG;C and pH 6.8-7.1. Strain B-154 T was a chemoorganoheterotroph, growing on mono-, di- and polysaccharides (xylan, starch, galactan, galactomannan, glucomannan, xyloglucan, pullulan, arabinan, lichenan, beta-glucan, pachyman, locust bean gum, xanthan gum). It did not require sodium chloride or yeast extract for growth. Major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0, iso-C16:0 and iso-C14:0. The respiratory quinone was MK-7. The complete genome of strain B-154 T was 4.73 Mbp in size; its G + C content was 61%. According to the phylogenomic analysis strain B-154 T forms a separate family-level phylogenetic lineage. Moreover, together with Limisphaera ngatamarikiensis and "Pedosphaera parvula" this strain forms a separate order-level phylogenetic lineage within Verrucomicrobiae class. Hence, we propose a novel order, Limisphaerales ord. nov., with two families Limisphaeraceae fam. nov. and Fontisphaeraceae fam. nov., and a novel genus and species Fontisphaera persica gen. nov., sp. nov. with type strain B-154 T. Ecogenomic analysis showed that representatives of the Limisphaerales are widespread in various environments. Although some of them were detected in hot springs the majority of Limisphaerales (54% of the studied metagenomeassembled genomes) were found in marine habitats. This study allowed a better understanding of physiology and ecology of Verrucomicrobiota - a rather understudied bacterial phylum.

Application of the classical IFIM approach (Instream Flow Incremental Methodology) does not usually take into account this dynamic aspect of the habitat. We developed a numerical method to simulate the rate of variation in spawning habitat conditions using two-dimensional hydrodynamic modelling coupled with a fish model based on habitat suitability indices (HSI). The approach assumes that, under natural conditions, fish spawning success is maximized under the most common rates of habitat variation. This method was applied during the feasibility study phase of a Hydro-Quebec hydroelectric project on Ashuapmushuan River (St-Jean Lake region, Quebec, Canada). The aim was to evaluate the environmental impact of different exploitation regimes on the rearing and spawning habitats of the landlocked salmon (Ouananiche) of this river. Only the spawning aspect is addressed here. After the hydrodynamic model was well established on a representative reference reach of the river, two spawning areas were identified within this reach and delimited for computational purposes. The per cent usable areas (PUA) were estimated on these two zones for 36 different flow discharges representing a wide rate of the usual hydrological conditions in summer and autumn. In addition, a time series of daily rate of variation of normalized PUA (dPUA') were obtained from a 35 year habitat time series. Finally, some relevant statistics of dPUA' (mean and exceedance probabilities of 50, 20, 10, 5 and 2%) were obtained for the natural how regime. They were then compared with a hypothetical peak exploitation flow pattern currently in use on a neighbouring river. According to our model, this regime would induce a 10-20-fold increase in the rate of variation compared with the most extreme natural conditions (dPUA exceeded 2% of the time). This regime was considered to obtain a contrasting image of different options that were never seriously envisaged by Hydro-Quebec for this river.																			0886-9375					MAR-JUN	1996	12	2-3					273	285		10.1002/(SICI)1099-1646(199603)12:2/3<273::AID-RRR395>3.0.CO;2-J	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1646(199603)12:2/3<273::AID-RRR395>3.0.CO;2-J													WOS:A1996UM71600013
J	HESSEN, DO				HESSEN, DO			ACIDIFICATION OF THE HUMEX LAKE - EFFECTS ON EPILIMNETIC POOLS AND FLUXES OF CARBON	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												The paper presents data on carbon budgets during the first year of acidification of one half of humic lake Skjervatjern. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), mainly allochthonous humus, ranged from 2 to 12 mg C L-1, with an average of 6 to 7 mg C for both the acidified and the reference basin. The minimum values occurred during winter when ground temperature fell below zero. Average dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was near 500 mug C L-1 in the surface layers, but increased to more than 2 mg close to the bottom. Epilimnetic particulate organic carbon (POC) was also close to 500 mug C L-1, of which more than 3/4 was detritus, while bacteria, phyto-, and macrozooplankton made up approximately 100, 50, and 20-40 mug C L-1, respectively. Major flows were sedimentation, respiration, and discharge. Acidification gave no clearcut effects on the major pools and fluxes of carbon, which were mainly governed by climatic and hydrological events. There were, however, pronounced differences in biotic pools and biologically mediated carbon fluxes, with more unstable conditions in the acidified basin. Primary production and phytoplankton biomass increased in the acidified basin relative to the control. Zooplankton biomass had a strong midsummer peak, followed by a sudden collapse of the dominant species, Holopedium gibberum, in the acidified part. As a consequence, zooplankton community grazing also dropped. Grazing did, however, not exert an efficient control with phytoplankton biomass. Preliminary data indicated decreased respiration and increased sedimentation in the acidified part. A closer follow-up of these processes will be performed during the two upcoming years in order to separate transitional and more permanent changes in carbon metabolism.

The polar regions are an ideal research area to study the impact of global warming because they are less affected by human activities. Seasonal meltwater lakes are a typical landscape in which parts of the soil are covered with water in the summer and exposed to air in the winter. In this study, three types of soils, including BPK (always above water), INT (sometimes above water, sometimes underwater), and SED (always underwater), were selected from the Kitezh Lake area in Antarctica to investigate the relationship between soil geochemical properties and bacterial and archaeal diversity and community structure. The key geochemical factors were found through RDA (CCA), and the network diagrams were drawn by WGCNA to find the hub OTUs. The results showed that pH, phosphate, nitrite, moisture content, ammonium, nitrate, and total carbon content all played important roles in bacterial and archaeal diversity and structure at different sites. This work provides an idea for future microbial diversity analysis, which is finding hub OTUs through WGCNA. Under the aggravation of global warming, this study also makes a contribution to predicting changes in soil microbial communities in lake regions. It is believed that polar regions are influenced by global warming more significantly, and because polar regions are less affected by human activities, they have certain reference values for future predictions. This study aimed to investigate the effects of climate warming on soil microbial communities in lake areas, taking Kitezh Lake, Antarctica as the research area. Below-peak soil, intertidal soil, and sediment were taken at the sampling sites, and we hypothesized that the diversity and composition of the bacterial and archaeal communities were different among the three sampling sites. Through 16S rDNA sequencing and analysis, bacteria and archaea with high abundance were obtained. Based on canonical correspondence analysis and redundancy analysis, pH and phosphate had a great influence on the bacterial community whereas pH and nitrite had a great influence on the archaeal community. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was used to find the hub bacteria and archaea related to geochemical factors. The results showed that in addition to pH, phosphate, and nitrite, moisture content, ammonium, nitrate, and total carbon content also play important roles in microbial diversity and structure at different sites by changing the abundance of some key microbiota.

Arif; Herdianita, Niniek Rina; Juliarka, Bella Restu			Determining recharge area in ULUBELU geothermal field, LAMPUNG, Indonesia using stable isotope data	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The Ulubelu geothermal field is located in Lampung Province, Indonesia, about 125 km west of Bandar Lampung City. This field is utilized as a power plant with an installed capacity of 220 MW operated since 2012. The Ulubelu geothermal system is a high enthalpy water-dominated reservoir and has temperature around 265 & DEG;C. This study aims to determine the elevation of the recharge area in the Ulubelu geothermal system based on the values of & delta;2H and & delta;18O isotopes to support the geothermal use sustainability. Major ions, & delta;2H, & delta;18O, and & delta;13C(DIC) isotopes analysis were carried out on hot springs, lake water, cold springs, and rainwater. The content of the major anions and cations indicates that the hot springs from the Way Panas Group are chloride-type water originating from the reservoir meanwhile the Danau Hijau and Pagar Alam groups are condensates acid-sulphate fluids. Moreover, the calculation using a Na/K and silica geothermometer shows that the reservoir has a tem-perature around 229 & PLUSMN; 4 & DEG;C. Analysis of the & delta;2H and & delta;18O isotopes content informs that the origin meteoric water seeped into the geothermal reservoir was & delta;18O-6.65%o and & delta;2H-39.5%o ranging from 1108 to 1570 masl elevation. Overlaying with the surface terrain map depicts that the recharge area originates from the peak of Mt. Rendingan in the north of Ulubelu and Mt. Sula in the west with 42.9 km2 total area. In conclusion, this study elucidates the recharge area elevation in the Ulubelu geothermal system, offering crucial insights for sustainable geothermal resource management and reservoir origin understanding, thus highlighting its potential for sus-tainable energy production.

One of the first targets was the hydrochemical characterization and classification of springs, along with their grouping on the basis of their affiliation to hydrogeochemical facies and the definition of their hydrogeochemical trends, contributing to assess groundwater circulation model in the involved aquifers. In addition, the study allowed us to evidence, by means of different analytical criteria, two aspects of the hydrogeochemical asset of the territory: (i) a regional variability model, which is explicative of the most examined factors; (ii) a residual number of outlier elements after the results of the principal component analysis, due to local (e.g., geological-structural or anthropogenic) factors. The main obtained results were: (i) all samples may be classified as bicarbonate-calcic waters; (ii) the main outlier values of the chemical parameters of the analyzed waters are probably due to the uplift of deep sulfuric/sulfate waters along local structural-tectonic alignments; (iii) the PCA allowed the distinction of two main ion groups including bicarbonate and Ca, in one hand, and Mg, Na, K, Cl and sulfates, in the other hand; (iv) these two main previous groups of ions resulted to be correlated to lithological typology, explaining about 60% of the variance, and length of the underground paths (16% of variance); (v) it was possible to distinguish two significant bicarbonate-calcic aquifer types, the first one includes all "autochthonous" calcareous and marly formations of the Umbria-Latium-Abruzzi series (excluding the calcareous-dolomitic rocks) and the other one characterized by "allochthonous" arenaceouspelitic flysch deposits; (vi) the peculiar hydrogeochemical characteristics of the water affiliated to flysch deposits, as well as their spatial lithological uniformity, may be related to the occurrence of evaporitic and dolomitic deposits in the terrigenous successions of the North and Central Apennine, where they crop out in. Samples from Antrodoco Sheet area and those from the neighboring areas of Campotosto Lake and Mt. S. Franco show very similar features, according to their affiliation to similar geologic environment facies of the hosting formations, contributing to validate the reconstructed hydrogeological picture of the study area in a regional scenario. In addition, spring waters of the study area also showed similar features respect to other springs of Central Apennines circulating in carbonate geological environment.					; Gaudino, Simona/A-7079-2018	Monti, Gennaro Maria/0000-0003-0136-6904; 													0369-8963					DEC	2012	81	3					269	299		10.2451/2012PM0016	http://dx.doi.org/10.2451/2012PM0016													WOS:000313534500001
J	Shapiro, J				Shapiro, J			The role of carbon dioxide in the initiation and maintenance of blue-green dominance in lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. In 1993 the south basin of Squaw Lake, Wisconsin, U.S.A., was artificially circulated and injected with CO2 in an attempt to eliminate the massive quantities of blue-greens normally present during summer. The unmixed, uninjected north basin was the control. Despite a great difference in CO2 concentration and in pH between the two basins, their blue-green maxima began simultaneously and eventually reached the same size. The predominant algae in both basins were Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Anabaena flos-aquae. 2. From 13 May to 9 September, experiments were done to determine the responses of photosynthesis (oxygen production) of the phytoplankton communities in both basins to changes in pH over the range 7-9. Both the north and south basins underwent two distinct shifts in the slopes of their photosynthetic responses to pH. These shifts paralleled changes in the proportion of blue-greens in their phytoplankton. 3. Experiments with additions of KHCO3 or NaHCO3 showed that the responses to pH were really responses to CO2 concentration. Therefore, the data obtained in the photosynthesis experiments were used to calculate the kinetic parameters K-s* and V-max*. The K-s* values varied in relation to the proportion of blue-greens, with lower values during the period when blue-greens predominated. The V-max* values showed no such systematic changes. 4. CO2 compensation and zero photosynthesis concentrations confirm that when the blue-greens dominated, CO2 was taken up much more efficiently than when the phytoplankton comprised mostly non-blue-greens. No evidence appeared suggesting direct use of bicarbonate even at pH values of 10.0. 5. Experiments with water collected seasonally from four other lakes show that Squaw Lake is not unique. In each case the response slopes (and therefore K,* values) were high during spring when non-blue-greens were dominant, but decreased when the blue-green maximum began. 6. Experiments with individual species of algae confirm that blue-greens generally have better CO2 kinetics than do greens. 7. It is concluded that initiation of the blue-green maximum does not depend upon conditions of low CO2 concentration or high pH. However, once the blue-greens become abundant they ensure their dominance by reducing concentrations of CO2 to levels available only to themselves.																			0046-5070					APR	1997	37	2					307	323		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00164.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00164.x													WOS:A1997WV20000005

It has been reported that macrophytes provide microhabitats for zooplankton (e.g., space and food resources). To date, studies have focused on the overall influence of macrophytes on zooplankton (e.g., positive relationships with zooplankton diversity); however, the morphological characteristics of macrophytes have not been intensively studied. To fill this gap in knowledge, we investigated zooplankton abundance and diversity, macrophyte characteristics (types, dry weight, and species number), and physicochemical parameters (water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, and chlorophyll a) by using the 1 x 1 m quadrat method. We surveyed 164 wetlands in South Korea during spring (May to June), prior to the summer monsoon. Patterning zooplankton distribution was accomplished using a Self-organizing map (SOM). We used 34 input variables (zooplankton genera) to train the model. The distribution of five plant habit parameters (no plant, emergent, free-floating, floating-leaved, and submerged) was investigated with a trained SOM plane, by environment data masking. Based on a U-matrix, three clusters were identified from the model. Zooplankton assemblages were positively related to macrophyte characteristics (i.e., dry weight, species number, and plant type). In particular, free-floating plants supported rotifers, such as Testudinella, and cladocerans, such as Alona, Chydorus, Diaphanosoma, and Ilyocryptus (mostly epiphytic). Submerged plants were associated with planktonic rotifers, such as Filinia, Ploesoma, Synchaeta, cladocerans, such as Daphnia, and copepods, such as Eucyclops and Macrogclops. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the microhabitat structure, created by macrophytes, is an important factor in determining the diversity and abundance of zooplankton communities, because the different species compositions of macrophytes support diverse zooplankton genera in these habitats. The results indicate that macrophytes are the key components of lentic freshwater ecosystem heterogeneity, and the inclusion of diverse plant species in wetland construction or restoration schemes will result in ecologically healthy food webs.

Results indicate that the lake, located in the open pit of the mine, generally contributes less than 30% of water to streams, springs, and groundwater. This contribution is more evident during dry periods, and should be taken into account in the design of remediation plans. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Nutrient and sediment dynamics in a Mediterranean shallow lake in southwest Spain	LIMNETICA												Nutrient and sediment dynamics in a Mediterranean shallow lake in southwest Spain Temporal and spatial variations in the nutrient concentrations of lake water and surface sediments and in settling and resuspension rates were assessed in a Mediterranean shallow lake (Medina Lake, southern Spain) using a combination of short-term and long-time monitoring. Our results confirmed the high temporal (inter- and intra-annual) variability characterising Mediterranean shallow lakes, which is also enhanced by water level fluctuations. The results also underlined the crucial role of phosphorus (P) exchange across the sediment-water interface in controlling P dynamics in lake water. This statement is supported by (i) the existence in the upper 1 cm of the sediment of 18 times the mass of TP of the whole water column and, hence, the high potential impact of P released from the sediment into the overlying column and by (ii) the strong P limitation of planktonic primary production, as reflected by a DIN:TP atomic ratio much higher than 16. Resuspension, co-precipitation with CaCO3 and adsorption onto iron hydroxides (FeOOH) all had major effects on the P exchange across the sediment-water interface. Wind-induced resuspension (31 +/- 13 % of the settled matter) explained the extremely high gross sedimentation rates (40 +/- 11 g m(-2) d(-1)) recorded for a 24 h period. P adsorption onto FeOOH controlled internal P loading during the winter (FeOOH: P-mobile > 15). During the summer, the low availability of FeOOH (Fe:P-mobile < 15) reflected the inability of FeOOH to control P adsorption. The SRP concentrations in lake water were much higher than necessary for CaCO3 and P co-precipitation, explaining the high contribution of P bound to CaCO3 (P-HCl) to the total P in the sediment of the study site and demonstrating the importance of CaCO3 precipitation for removing P from lake water.					; de Vicente, Inmaculada/S-2067-2016; Green, Andy/A-5189-2008	Lopez Luque, Raquel/0000-0002-8735-5415; Green, Andrew John/0000-0002-1268-4951													0213-8409					DEC	2012	31	2					231	249																WOS:000312749700006

Here, we present a detailed record of the development of regional vegetation in the northern margin of Asian summer monsoon during the last deglaciation (16,500-11,000 cal yr BP) based on a radiocarbon-dated high-resolution pollen record from Hulun Lake, northeast China. The results show that the regional vegetation changed from subalpine meadow-desert steppe to mixed coniferous and deciduous forest-typical steppe during the last deglaciation. However, its responses to the Heinrich event 1 (H1) and the Younger Dryas event (YD) were significantly different: during the H1 event, scattered sparse forest was present in the surrounding mountains, while within the lake catchment the vegetation cover was poor and was dominated by desert steppe. In contrast, during the YD event, deciduous forest developed and the proportion of coniferous forest increased in the mountains, the lake catchment was occupied by typical steppe. We suggest that changes in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation and land surface conditions (ice sheets and sea level) caused temperature and monsoonal precipitation variations that contributed to the contrasting vegetation response during the two cold events. We conclude that under future global warming scenarios, extreme climatic events may cause a deterioration of the ecological environment of the Hulun Lake region, resulting in increased coniferous forest and decreased total forest cover in the surrounding mountains, and a reduction in typical steppe in the lake catchment.

In this study, we examined the interplay between the Indian Ocean Summer Monsoon (IOSM) and the Westerlies at lake Nam Co, southern Tibet to understand the climatic effects on the ecosystem. Different organic geochemical proxies (n-alkanes, glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers, delta D, delta(13)Corg, delta N-15) are applied to reconstruct the environmental and hydrological changes on one of the longest available paleorecords at the Tibetan Plateau. Based on our paleohydrological delta D proxies, the aquatic signal lags the terrestrial one due to specific ecological thresholds, which, in addition to climatic changes, can influence aquatic organisms. The aquatic organisms' response strongly depends on temperature and associated lake size, as well as pH and nutrient availability. Because the terrestrial vegetation reacts faster and more sensitively to changes in the monsoonal and climatic system, the delta D of n-C-29 and the reconstructed inflow water signal represent an appropriate IOSM proxy. In general, the interplay of the different air masses seems to be primarily controlled by solar insolation. In the Holocene, the high insolation generates a large land-ocean pressure gradient associated with strong monsoonal winds and the strongest IOSM. In the Last Glacial period, however, the weak insolation promoted the Westerlies, thereby increasing their influence at the Tibetan Plateau. Our results help to elucidate the variable IOSM, and they illustrate a remarkable shift in the lake system regarding pH, delta(13)Corg and delta N-15 from the Last Glacial to the Holocene interglacial period.

We investigate regions of distinct temporal evolution and of largest frequency of occurrence of deep convection (hereinafter referred to as convective activity), and we define and identify the deep convective stage from space observations. The analysis is based on hourly, half-hourly, and quarter-hourly brightness temperature (BT) observations of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on board Meteosat 8. Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches are utilized. In the Eulerian approach, diurnal cycles and spatial distributions of BTs are calculated as averages on a local solar time (LST) and pixel basis. In the Lagrangian approach we use a stand-alone algorithm that tracks deep convective systems. Deep convection is frequently found over mountainous regions and exhibits a distinct diurnal cycle over large lakes. Local maxima of convective activity and origin of tracked systems are observed over the ocean off the west coast of Africa early in the morning. Over land the diurnal cycle of deep convective systems starts with strong rates of BT change in the formative stage, continues with the minimum BT around 1530 LST (start of the mature stage), and reaches the maximum cold cloud cover at 1730 LST (end of mature stage). The maximum number of split events marks the center of the dissipation stage at similar to 1930 LST. A time shift of 1-2 h to earlier times is found in December. The life cycle analysis perfectly complements the diurnal cycle analysis and reveals characteristics of deep convective systems around the time of minimum BT10.8. Extreme rates of BT change and area expansion rates successively increase with decreasing temporal resolution. Thus quarter-hourly measurements are needed to observe the most vigorous updraft and downdraft events.																			2169-897X	2169-8996				MAR 11	2009	114								D05109	10.1029/2008JD010653	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008JD010653													WOS:000264229000001
J	FOOTE, BA				FOOTE, BA			BIOLOGY OF SHORE FLIES	ANNUAL REVIEW OF ENTOMOLOGY												Information is given on the habitat distribution, larval feeding habits, and economic roles of the dipterous family Ephydridae. This family has broad ecological tolerances and is commonly encountered in such physiologically stressful habitats as oil pools, inland alkaline and saline marshes, hot springs, and cold thermal springs, and coastal salt marshes and mangrove swamps. Other ephydrid species occur in freshwater marshes, moist to xeric grasslands, muddy and sandy shores, and rocky substrates along streams and lakes. Larvae display adaptive radiation in their use of particulate food substrates, with different groups of species feeding on Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), algae, detritus, and decomposing carcasses. A few species are predators, whereas others are leaf miners. Economically, certain species are pests in greenhouses and others damage crops such as rice and sugar beets. Other species are being investigated as agents of biological control of aquatic weeds.																			0066-4170	1545-4487					1995	40						417	442																WOS:A1995QB58800018

Ecophysiology of riparian cottonwood and willow before, during, and after two years of soil water removal	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Riparian cottonwood/willow forest assemblages are highly valued in the southwestern United States for their wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and watershed protection. Yet these forests are under considerable threat from climate change impacts on water resources and land-use activities to support human enterprise. Stream diversions, groundwater pumping, and extended drought have resulted in the decline of cottonwood/willow forests along many riparian corridors in the Southwest and, in many cases, the replacement of these forests with less desirable invasive shrubs and trees. Nevertheless, ecophysiological responses of cottonwood and willow, along with associated ecohydrological feedbacks of soil water depletion, arc not well understood. Ecophysiological processes of mature Fremont cottonwood and coyote willow stands were examined over four consecutive growing seasons (2004-2007) near Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. The tree stands occurred near the inlet of a reservoir that was drained in the spring of 2005 and remained empty until mid-summer of 2006, effectively removing the primary water source for most of two growing seasons. Stem sap flux density (J(s)) in cottonwood was highly correlated with volumetric soil moisture (theta) in the upper 60 cm and decreased sevenfold as soil moisture dropped from 12% to 7% after the reservoir was drained. Conversely. J(s) in willow was marginally correlated with theta and decreased by only 25% during the same period. Opposite patterns emerged during the following growing season: willow had a lower whole-plant conductance (k(t)) in June and higher leaf carbon isotope ratios (delta(13)C) than cottonwood in August, whereas k(t) and delta(13)C were otherwise similar between species. Water relations in both species recovered quickly from soil water depletion, with the exception that sapwood area to stem area (A(s):A(st)) was significantly lower in both species after the 2007 growing season compared to 2004. Results suggest that cottonwood has a greater sensitivity to interannual reductions in water availability, while willow is more sensitive to longer periods of soil water depletion. These data shed light on the linkage between soil water deficits and ecophysiological processes of threatened riparian forests given potential land-use and long-term drought impacts on freshwater resources.

Climate-Driven Variations in Nitrogen Retention From a Riverine Submerged Aquatic Vegetation Meadow	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Large rivers can retain a substantial amount of nitrogen (N), particularly in submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) meadows that may act as disproportionate control points for N retention. However, the temporal variation of N retention in large rivers remains unknown since past measurements were snapshots in time. Using high-frequency plants and NO3- measurements over the summers 2012-2017, we investigated how the climate variation influenced N retention in a SAV meadow (similar to 10 km(2)) at the confluence zone of two agricultural tributaries entering the St. Lawrence River. Distinctive combinations of water temperature and level were recorded between years, ranging from extreme hot-low (2012) and cold-high (2017) summers (2 degrees C and 1.4 m interannual range). Using an indicator of SAV biomass, we found that these extreme hot-low and cold-high years had reduced biomass compared to hot summers with intermediate levels. In addition, changes in main stem water levels were asynchronous with the tributary discharges that controlled NO3- inputs at the confluence. We estimated daily N uptake rates from a moored NO(3)(- )sensor and partitioned these into assimilatory and dissimilatory pathways. Measured rates were variable but among the highest reported in rivers (median 576 mg N m(-2) d(-1), range 60-3,893 mg N m(-2) d(-1)) and SAV biomass promoted greater proportional retention and permanent N loss through denitrification. We estimated that the SAV meadow could retain up to 0.8 kt N per year and 87% of N inputs, but this valuable ecosystem service is contingent on how climate variations modulate both N loads and SAV biomass. Plain Language Summary Large rivers remove significant amounts of nitrogen pollution generated by humans in waste waters and from fertilizers applied to agricultural lands. Underwater meadows of aquatic plants remove nitrogen particularly well. To keep the river clean, plants use the nitrogen themselves and promote conditions where bacteria can convert this pollution into a gas typically found in air. Measuring nitrogen removal in rivers is really difficult, and we do not know how climate conditions influence this removal or plant abundance. We successfully measured nitrogen pollution removal from an underwater plant meadow in a large river over six summers. We found that plant abundance and river nitrogen inputs were critical to determine how much pollution was removed, and that these were controlled by climatic conditions. Plant abundance was controlled by both water temperatures and levels. When water was warm and levels were neither too high nor too low, conditions were perfect for lots of plants to grow, which mainly stimulated bacteria that permanently eliminated nitrogen. We showed that the amount of nitrogen pollution removed over the summer by the meadow changes with climatic conditions but in general represents the amount produced by a city of half a million people.

During the premonsoon-onset period, the moisture transport trajectories are clustered into 6 groups, with four ocean-originating paths providing 83.9% and two continent-originating paths (originating over Lake Baikal and the Persian Gulf) contributing the remaining 16.1% of the total moisture. The two Pacific-originating paths, from the western Pacific Ocean and the East China Sea, combined account for about 46%, the SCS-originating path contributes about 24.3%, while the Bay of Bengal-originating path accounts for 13.6% of the total moisture over South China. The trajectories during the postmonsoon-onset period are clustered into 4 groups, with three southwesterly paths (from the Arabian Sea, the central Indian Ocean, and the western Indian Ocean, respectively) accounting for more than 76% and the sole Pacific-originating path accounting for 23.8% of the total moisture. The formation of the moisture transport trajectories is substantially affected by the topography, especially the Tibetan Plateau and the Indian and Indo-China Peninsulas. The SCS region contributes the most moisture during both periods (35.3% and 31.1%). The Pacific Ocean is ranked second during the former period (about 21.0%) but its contribution is reduced to 5.0% during the latter period, while the contribution from the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean combined increases from 17.1% to 43.2%.

Endocrine disruptors in ancient times and Greek mythology: the spring of Salmacis and the curse of Hermaphroditus	HORMONES-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY AND METABOLISM												According to Greek mythology, the spring waters of Salmacis (or Salmakis) feminized the god Hermaphroditus (or Hermaphroditos) and transformed his nature from male to half-male and half-female. The mythical properties of these waters are described in the writings of authors and philosophers of the Hellenistic period. It is evident that the spring of Salmacis and lake actually existed (located in Halicarnassus, today Bodrum, Turkey) and are not the product of poetic imagination. Hence, it could be hypothesized that there were certain natural elements in the waters that had a feminizing effect on the male reproductive axis. We now know, in fact, that naturally occurring environmental agents, also known as endocrine disruptors, can affect the endocrine and reproductive function of both males and females. However, since most endocrine disruptors today are manmade products of the modern industrial lifestyle, the presence and effect of naturally occurring disruptors in times preceding the Industrial Revolution are not widely discussed. It is thus against this background that we seek to formulate a differential diagnosis of male feminization attributable to the effect of natural environmental factors in the form of endocrine disruptors that will have existed in environments round the globe since time immemorial. We conclude that if there had been an accumulation of the mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEA) in the waters of Salmacis, chronic exposure to the lake's water could have resulted in the phenotypic changes described in the Salmacis myth.

J	Rottler, E; Bronstert, A; Bürger, G; Rakovec, O				Rottler, Erwin; Bronstert, Axel; Buerger, Gerd; Rakovec, Oldrich			Projected changes in Rhine River flood seasonality under global warming	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Climatic change alters the frequency and intensity of natural hazards. In order to assess potential future changes in flood seasonality in the Rhine River basin, we analyse changes in streamflow, snowmelt, precipitation and evapotranspiration at 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 degrees C global warming levels. The mesoscale hydrological model (mHM) forced with an ensemble of climate projection scenarios (five general circulation models under three representative concentration pathways) is used to simulate the present and future climate conditions of both pluvial and nival hydrological regimes. Our results indicate that future changes in flood characteristics in the Rhine River basin are controlled by increases in antecedent precipitation and diminishing snowpacks. In the pluvial-type sub-basin of the Moselle River, an increasing flood potential due to increased antecedent precipitation encounters declining snowpacks during winter. The decrease in snowmelt seems to counterbalance increasing precipitation, resulting in only small and transient changes in streamflow maxima. For the Rhine Basin at Basel, rising temperatures cause changes from solid to liquid precipitation, which enhance the overall increase in precipitation sums, particularly in the cold season. At the gauge at Basel, the strongest increases in streamflow maxima show up during winter, when strong increases in liquid precipitation encounter almost unchanged snowmelt-driven runoff. The analysis of snowmelt events for the gauge at Basel suggests that at no point in time during the snowmelt season does a warming climate result in an increase in the risk of snowmelt-driven flooding. Snowpacks are increasingly depleted with the course of the snowmelt season. We do not find indications of a transient merging of pluvial and nival floods due to climate warming. To refine attained results, next steps need to be the representation of glaciers and lakes in the model set-up, the coupling of simulations to a streamflow component model and an independent validation of the snow routine using satellite-based snow cover maps.					; Rakovec, Oldrich/N-5512-2015; Bürger, Gerd/A-9714-2018; Bronstert, Axel/AAA-3314-2022	Rottler, Erwin/0000-0003-3072-2189; Rakovec, Oldrich/0000-0003-2451-3305; Bronstert, Axel/0000-0002-6369-8536													1027-5606	1607-7938				MAY 3	2021	25	5					2353	2371		10.5194/hess-25-2353-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-2353-2021													WOS:000647360600001
J	COLLART, OO				COLLART, OO			REPRODUCTION STRATEGY OF MACROBRACHIUM-AMAZONICUM (DECAPODA, CARIDEA, PALAEMONIDAE) IN CENTRAL AMAZONIA	CRUSTACEANA												The reproduction strategy of the Palaemonid shrimp, Macrobrachium amazonicum, has been studied on Careiro Island in a floodplain lake in Central Amazonia. Ovigerous females have been observed all year round. However, three periods of the hydrological cycle were significantly more favourable to gonad ripening: the middle of the rising and of the falling of the water level, as well as the low level. This suggests the direct effect of two factors: the current velocity and the phytoplankton production. At the population level, the maximum reproduction intensity has been observed during low water, and during rising water. This strategy increases the survival of planctonic larvae during the highest phytoplankton production period, and reduces the intraspecific competition, increasing the larval dispersal in the floodplain. In the lake, the percentage of ovigerous females was always higher regardless of size class of the adult prawns and of season, than in the channels or in the river, suggesting that the lacustrine environment is the more favourable to M. amazonicum reproduction. In eastern Amazonia, M. amazonicum shows a typical reproduction pattern of littoral Palaemonids: mass spawning occurs during the falling water, increasing the larval dispersion towards the estuary. The reproduction flexibility of M. amazonicum explains its success in colonizing a variety of environments in a wide geographical range in South America.																			0011-216X					NOV	1991	61		3				253	270																WOS:A1991GP24500004

The world's largest concentration of tropical glaciers lies in the Cordillera Blanca range of Peru, where glacial runoff is declining and regional stresses are emerging over water resources. Throughout the Cordillera Blanca, groundwater inputs from alpine meadow-talus complexes, locally known as pampas, supply proglacial streams with up to 80% of their flow during the region's dry season. Structural knowledge of the pampa aquifers is needed to estimate their drainable groundwater storage capacity and residence time, to elucidate the role and importance of alpine groundwater storage in the regional water budget of the Cordillera Blanca. To understand the structure of these proglacial aquifers, multiple near-surface geophysical methods were implemented in a proglacial valley near dense networks of spring-fed tributaries. Geophysical results and borehole logs suggest groundwater is stored in a confined aquifer composed of buried talus deposits overlain by lacustrine clay, while deeper portions of the unit, 10-15 m in depth, are relatively clay-free and more hydraulically conductive. Based on these findings and assumptions of aquifer porosity, the pampas of the Callejon de Huaylas may store from 0.006 to 0.02 km(3) of groundwater. Furthermore, these findings suggest that the talus aquifers of the Cordillera Blanca were formed in proglacial lakes, followed by infilling with fine lacustrine sediments that confine lower units and allow for groundwater discharge to springs via macropores and preferential flow.					; Lautz, Laura/J-2274-2014; Mark, Bryan/AAD-1453-2020	Mark, Bryan/0000-0002-4500-7957; Moucha, Robert/0000-0001-8393-4279; Lautz, Laura/0000-0002-5735-1114; 													1431-2174	1435-0157				SEP	2019	27	6					2137	2154		10.1007/s10040-019-01982-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-019-01982-5													WOS:000481884200015
J	Sarre, GA; Platell, ME; Potter, IC				Sarre, GA; Platell, ME; Potter, IC			Do the dietary compositions of Acanthopagrus butcheri in four estuaries and a coastal lake vary with body size and season and within and amongst these water bodies?	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The dietary compositions were determined for Acanthopagrus butcheri in four estuaries and a saline, coastal lake, which vary in the extent, if any, of their connection to the sea and amongst which; in spring and summer, their salinities ranged from 2 to 7 parts per thousand in an intermittently open estuary to >40 parts per thousand in a normally closed estuary. The dietary compositions of A. butcheri in each of the five water bodies were significantly different, which reflected differences in the abundance of different components of the biota in those systems. Biotic differences amongst water bodies thus accounted for the far larger contributions made to the volume of the stomach contents by the macroalgae Cladophora sp. in the Moore River Estuary on the lower west coast of Australia, by amphipods and decapods in the Swan River Estuary 85 km further south and by polychaetes in the landlocked Lake Clifton a further 85 km further south. The diet of A. butcheri in the Nornalup/Walpole Estuary on the south coast of Western Australia contained atypically large volumes of the seagrass Ruppia megacarpa and teleosts, whereas. that in the normally closed Wellstead Estuary, 260 km to the east was characterised by large volumes of the macroalgae Chaetomorpha sp. and a tube-dwelling amphipod, However, then is evidence that A. butcheri selects certain prey, when two or more of the typical prey of A. butcheri are present in the environment, and that it prefers to Feed on or above the substratum, rather than within the substratum. The dietary composition of A. butcheri underwent pronounced ontogenetic changes in each water body, these being progressive in estuaries on the lower west coast and abrupt in those on the south coast. Within the upper Swan Estuary, the dietary composition changed in an upstream direction, reflecting changes in the relative abundance of certain benthic macroinvertebrate pi ey, but did not undergo conspicuous seasonal changes, which is consistent with the lack of any clear cut seasonal changes in the abundance of their major prey.

J	Leino, RL; McCormick, JH				Leino, RL; McCormick, JH			Reproductive characteristics of the ruffe, Gymnocephalus cernuus, in the St Louis River estuary on western Lake Superior: A histological examination of the ovaries over one annual cycle	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The Eurasian ruffe, Gymnocephalus cernuus, is a small percid that has recently been introduced into the Duluth-Superior Harbor at the western end of Lake Superior. Because of its adverse impact on native species, its presence has caused considerable concern in the North American fisheries community. Ruffe have experienced phenomenal reproductive success in their new home and are rapidly extending their range. The reproductive success of this species seems to be partly related to the manner of spawning. We describe the dynamics of oogenesis of different age groups during the 1994 reproductive cycle. Spawning commenced within a week or two of ice-out and extended for approximately 8 weeks. Histological observations revealed that different age groups of ruffe spawned somewhat in succession, with older fish spawning first. As the season progressed, earlier spawners engaged in repeat spawning, probably two or three times before the end of the spawning period. These observations suggest that the unstable spring weather characteristic of this region has a minimal effect on the success of ruffe age groups, in contrast with several native species that spawn only once in the spring and that could suffer losses of age groups during a postspawning cold spell.																			0706-652X					FEB	1997	54	2					256	263		10.1139/cjfas-54-2-256	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-54-2-256													WOS:A1997XB78700003

The northwestern margin of the modern East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) region is particularly sensitive to such climatic changes. In this study, we employed the continuous sedimentary core sequence of Dali Lake, located on the north-western edge of the EASM region. Carbonate clumped isotope (047) thermometry was applied to both fine-grained endogenic carbonates and ostracod (Limnocythere inopinata [Baird]) shells in the lake core sediments to quantita-tively reconstruct lake water temperature and oxygen isotope (818OW [VSMOW]) changes during the period from approximately 15.6-10.5 cal kyr BP (calibrated years before the present; abbreviated to "kyr"). Fine-grained endogenic carbonate 047 temperatures suggest that the lake surface water tem-perature changes may have been mainly controlled by the northern high latitudes, reflected in the corresponding millennial-centennial abrupt climate events (such as a 5-6 degrees C decrease of summer surface water temperature during approximately 12.9-11.8 kyr, indicative of Younger Dryas [YD] cool-ing). Ostracod shell 047 temperatures complement the endogenic carbonates but appear to be affected by changes in calcification season, likely linked to climatic changes. These data suggest a climatic shift at approximately 15.2 kyr, before the onset of the Bolling-Allerod (BA) interstadial, which is interpreted as general warming.818OW from the endogenic carbonates is interpreted as changes in precipitation and conforms well with 18O isotope changes in Greenland ice cores, suggesting that the precipitation changes may have been influenced by the northern high latitudes. Regional rainfall increased during the Heinrich event 1 (H1) and YD stadials, whereas it appears to have decreased in the BA and during the early Holocene (EH). This study indicates that the primary climate pattern at the northwestern boundary of the EASM region during the last deglaciation was characterized by alterations of "cold and wet" and "warm and dry" climate, rather than the more typical "cold and dry" versus "warm and wet" pattern.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhang, MM; Bu, ZJ; Wang, SZ; Jiang, M				Zhang, Mingming; Bu, Zhaojun; Wang, Shengzhong; Jiang, Ming			Moisture changes in Northeast China since the last deglaciation: Spatiotemporal out-of-phase patterns and possible forcing mechanisms	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												There is a strong chance that the 21 st century warming will cause differences in precipitation distribution over the globe. Northeast (NE) China is a unique area whose atmospheric circulation is still a controversial subject and is likely to be strongly impacted by global warming. Thus, a good understanding of the past variations in effective moisture in NE China will be benefit for the prediction of future hydrological changes. In this study, we use basal peat ages and published paleoclimate records to evaluate the spatial and temporal patterns and possible forcing mechanisms for the moisture changes in NE China over the past 16,000 years. Basal peat ages suggest that the moisture conditions in different regions of NE China show as a spatiotemporal out-phase pattern. In addition, the paleoclimate records of 17 sites also indicate that NE China experienced a spatiotemporal outphase pattern of moisture changes along northwest-southeast direction since the last deglaciation. The moisture in southern NE China experienced increasing trend during the period of 16-8 cal ka BP, with the maximum moisture occurring 8-3 cal ka BP and decreasing trend after 3 cal ka BP. The moisture pattern in western NE China is similar to that in southern NE China. It experienced increasing trend during the period of 16.8 cal ka BP, the maximum moisture during the period 8.4 cal ka BP and decreasing trend from 4 cal ka BP to present. The moisture in eastern NE China experienced wet conditions from 16 cal ka BP to 4 cal ka BP, and decreasing trend after 4 cal ka BP. In central NE China, two relatively wet periods occurred during the periods of 13-8 cal ka BP and 6-3 cal ka BP, respectively. In addition, two wet periods occurred during the periods of 14-11 cal ka BP and 7-1 cal ka BP in northern NE China, respectively. The moisture patterns between NE China and other regions of China are also compared in this study. We propose that the possible forcing mechanisms for the moisture changes in NE China were different for each 4000 year interval. During the period of 16.12 cal ka BP, the weak East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and strong Northeast monsoon (NEM) were the major water vapor sources of NE China. During the period of 12.8 cal ka BP, the increasing EASM and strong NEM were still the major water vapor sources of NE China. During the period of 8-4 cal ka BP, the strongest EASM was the major water vapor sources of the whole NE China. Furthermore, the increasing Westerlies slightly penetrated into northern NE China during this period. From 4 cal ka BP to present, the decreasing EASM provided precipitation for the most regions of NE China. The Westerlies reached the maximum and further penetrated into the whole northern NE China during this period.

Life at the top: Lake ecotype influences the foraging pattern, metabolic costs and life history of an apex fish predator	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												We used acoustic telemetry and acceleration sensors to compare population-specific measures of the metabolic costs of an apex fish predator living in four separate lakes. We chose our study species and populations to provide a strong test of recent theoretical predictions that optimal foraging by an apex fish predator in a typical aquatic environment would be consistent with feeding to satiation rather than continuous feeding. We chose four populations where the primary prey type differed along a body size gradient (from small invertebrates to large planktivorous fish) and along a thermal accessibility gradient (from easily accessible cold-water pelagic prey to less accessible warm-water epilimnetic and littoral prey). We expected that these gradients in prey type would evoke distinctly different activity gradients depending on whether predators fed to satiation (e.g., less frequent rest detections where primary prey are smaller/less accessible) or fed continuously (e.g., fixed level of rest detections under all prey conditions). Our study organism was a fall spawning, cold-water visual apex predator (lake trout). Therefore, we focused our study on diel (early night, dawn, day, dusk, late night) changes in metabolic costs associated with summer feeding behaviour. The duration (similar to 20days) and fine temporal scale (similar to 30min) of our behavioural data provided a uniquely detailed picture of intra- and inter-population differences in activity patterns over a critical period in the annual growing season. In all populations, diel shifts in activity were qualitatively consistent with that expected of a visual predator (e.g., resting state detections were most frequent at night). Between-lake differences in daytime thermal experience were qualitatively consistent with between-lake differences in the location of primary prey (e.g., excursions to warm habitats were common in lakes with epilimnetic/littoral fish as primary prey and relatively rare in lakes with pelagic cold-water invertebrates/fish as primary prey). Daytime activity patterns were more consistent with the feeding pattern expected from feeding to satiation rather than continuous feeding: (a) individuals in all four populations exhibited clearly delineated bouts of resting behaviour and active behaviour; (b) the frequency of resting bouts and the resultant overall cost of daily activity were strongly associated with the size and accessibility of preyin lakes with smaller and/or less accessible prey, predators rested less frequently, exhibited marginally higher costs when active and had higher overall daytime activity costs. Within each lake, similar changes in activity occurred concurrently with diel changes in prey accessibility/relative density.					; Shuter, Brian/A-3991-2008; Font, Liset/AAF-2618-2020; Minns, Charles/GYU-2209-2022	Minns, Charles/0000-0003-2249-1624; Cruz Font, Liset/0000-0003-1809-1740; Rennie, Michael/0000-0001-7533-4759; Blanchfield, Paul/0000-0003-0886-5642; Shuter, Brian/0000-0002-3733-6005; 													0021-8790	1365-2656				MAY	2019	88	5					702	716		10.1111/1365-2656.12956	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12956								30712263					WOS:000471342700005
J	Lennon, JT; Smith, VH; Williams, K				Lennon, JT; Smith, VH; Williams, K			Influence of temperature on exotic Daphnia lumholtzi and implications for invasion success	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												We investigated the effects of water temperature on the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi in a eutrophic Kansas reservoir (USA) and under laboratory conditions. Daphnia lumholtzi demonstrated a distinct late summer appearance in the reservoir at temperatures between 26 and 31 degreesC, which corresponded with steep declines in the densities of native Daphnia spp. Laboratory life-table experiments confirmed that D. lumholtzi performs well at elevated water temperatures. The intrinsic rate of increase (r), net reproductive rate (R-4), age at first reproduction, survivorship (l(x)) and molting rated all demonstrate that D. lumholtzi has a high temperature optimum between 20 and 30 degreesC. A comparison of literature-reported r-values indicates that the reproductive rate of D. lumholtzi is comparable with other Daphnia spp. between 20 and 25 degreesC, but also implies that D. lumholtzi may out-perform some Daphnia spp. at temperatures > 25 degreesC. Collectively, these results suggest that D. lumholtzi may be taking advantage of a late summer thermal niche, and that this invader may continue to colonize lakes and reservoirs in the southern US. However, life table data also indicate that D. lumholtzi performs poorly at temperatures < 10<degrees>C, which may inhibit the range expansion of this invader into northern waters.					; Lennon, Jay/ABE-6120-2020	Lennon, Jay T./0000-0003-3126-6111; 													0142-7873	1464-3774				APR	2001	23	4					425	434		10.1093/plankt/23.4.425	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/23.4.425													WOS:000169006800007

Feeding Ecology of Brook Silverside, Golden Shiner, and Subyearling Pumpkinseed in a Lake Ontario Embayment	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Fish feeding ecology has been shown to vary over a 24-h period in terms of the prey consumed and feeding intensity. Consequently, in order to best determine the interspecific feeding associations within a fish community, examination of the diet at multiple times over a 24-h period is often necessary. We examined the diel feeding ecology of three fish species that were numerically dominant in a Lake Ontario embayment during summer. The diet of each of the three species, young-of-year Pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus, Golden Shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas, and Brook Silverside Labidesthes sicculus, was distinct with no significant overlap in diet composition occurring within any of the 4-h time intervals. The diet composition of each species suggested that Brook Silverside were feeding at the surface (terrestrial invertebrates and aquatic surface dwelling hemipterans), whereas young-of-year Pumpkinseed (amphipods) and Golden Shiner (tipulids) were feeding on different benthicprey. Differences in feeding periodicity were most pronounced for young-of-year Pumpkinseed. Our findings provide valuable insights on interspecific feeding associations among these three fish species during summer in a Lake Ontario embayment.

We found that the decrease in size at maturity, as well as diurnal refuge in deep waters, were the adaptive responses (concurrently or alternatively) adopted by large zooplankters to cope with the increasing predation risk throughout the summer. Daphnia galeata initiated a more severe trade-off to cope with high summer predation relative to other cladoceran species. Diaphanosoma brachyurum and Daphnia cucullata seem less susceptible to fish predation as indicated by the low alteration of their size structure and their vertical distribution. The copepod Eudiaptomus gracilis took refuge in deep waters and achieved important modifications of its mature size.																			0018-8158					NOV 15	2005	551						87	98		10.1007/s10750-005-4452-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-4452-3													WOS:000233222500008

In this study, based on the OSL chronology (33 samples) and the stratigraphy of shorelines or lacustrine sequences, we reconstructed the Late Quaternary evolution history of the Zhuyeze palaeolake surrounded by the Tengger Desert at the northern edge of East Asian summer monsoon. The luminescence dating results with geomorphologic analysis indicate that: (1) contrary to previous interpretations on MIS 3 mega-lake derived from C-14 chronology, highstands of ca. 30 m above modem playa are OSL dated to around 90-80 ka (MIS 5a), and no evidence of MIS 3 highstands has been found, which questions the previous climate pattern of 'uniquely warm and wet Late MIS 3' in northwestern China. The high insolation at MIS 5a triggered the strengthened summer monsoon which brought more rainfall to the study area, causing the highstand in Zhuyeze; (2) a substantial lake with a water level of ca. 20 m above the modern playa was present during 8.0-5.0 ka (Mid-Holocene), indicating that the wettest stage of the Holocene occurred in the Mid-Holocene. This reconstructed moisture pattern based on lake levels in East Asian monsoon marginal area is out of phase with that in monsoon core area, and we propose that this is possibly related to low sea level during the Early Holocene leading to the study area out of East Asian monsoon influence; (3) the shrinking process of Zhuyeze lake since 5.0 ka indicate the drying trend during the Late Holocene, responding directly to the changes of the East Asian monsoon triggered by summer insolation at low latitude areas.

Landsat 7 ETM + data for 1999-2002, and ALOS/PRISM and AVNIR data for 2006-2008. The four mountain regions investigated (Pskem, Ili-Kungoy, At-Bashy, and SE-Fergana) cover several distributed glacierized areas in the Tien Shan Mountain system, a region that is affected by highly variable local precipitation regimes. Over the 30 years investigated between similar to 1970 and similar to 2000, glacier area decreased by 19% in the Pskem region, 12% in the Ili-Kungoy region, 12% in the At-Bashy region, and 9% in the SE-Fergana region. In the last 7 years (similar to 2000 to similar to 2007), glacier area shrank by 5% in the Pskem region, 4% in the Ili-Kungoy region, 4% in the At-Bashy region, and 0% in the SE-Fergana region. Glacier behavior has varied markedly in these regions. The most dramatic glacier shrinkage has occurred in the outer ranges of the Tien Shan Mountains. Recent glacier area loss has resulted from rising summer temperatures. Regional differences of glacier-area changes related to local climate conditions, to the altitudinal distribution of glacier areas, and to the relative proportion of glaciers in different size classes. The observed accelerated glacier shrinkage is expected to have two impacts on the more populated outer ranges: 1) water shortages during summer and 2) increased threat from glacier hazards such as glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and ice avalanches.

J	LINLOKKEN, A				LINLOKKEN, A			VERTICAL-DISTRIBUTION OF BROWN TROUT (SALMO-TRUTTA) AND PERCH (PERCA-FLUVIATILIS) IN AN ACIDIFIED LAKE	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Brown trout (Salmo trutta) and perch (Perca fluviatilis) had different vertical distributions throughout the year in the acidified lake Gjerstadvann. During summer, the brown trout lived in the 0 to 16 m depth interval, whereas the perch lived in the 0 to 8 m interval. In Gjerstadvann, the thermocline lies at 8 to 10 m depth. The epilimnion pH was usually > 5.6, and the thermocline pH was about 5.2. Brown trout and perch in Gjerstadvann, thus experienced different chemical environment during summer-stratification. Two rivers, one of them acidified, the other cirum-neutral, were the most important spawning areas for the Gjerstadvann brown trout. Brown trout parr in the acidified river migrated to the lake and matured at younger ages than the brown trout spawning in the non-acidic river. The brown trout stocks were juvenilized because of low survival rate of adult fish (S = 0.15 to 0.19). The short life span was probably due to low pH and elevated Al. The perch in Gjerstadvann showed fluctuating year class strength but the survival rate of adult perch (S = 0.57) did not seem to be affected by acidification during this investigation.

Origin, distribution, and geochemistry of arsenic in the Altiplano-Puna plateau of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peru	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Elevated concentrations of arsenic in water supplies represent a worldwide health concern. In at least 14 countries of South America, high levels have been detected relative to international standards and guidelines. Within these countries, the high plateau referred to as the "Altiplano-Puna", encompassing areas of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Peril, exhibits high arsenic concentrations that could be affecting 3 million inhabitants. The origins of arsenic in the Altiplano-Puna plateau are diverse and are mainly natural in origin. Of the natural sources, the most important correspond to mineral deposits, brines, hot springs, and volcanic rocks, whereas anthropogenic sources are related to mining activities and the release of acid mine drainage (AMD). Arsenic is found in all water types of the Altiplano-Puna plateau over a wide range of concentrations (0.01 mg.L-1 < As in water > 10 mg.L-1) which in decreasing order correspond to: AMD, brines, saline waters, hot springs, rivers affected by AMD, rivers and lakes, and groundwater. Despite the few studies which report As speciation, this metalloid appears mostly in its oxidized form (As[V]) and its mobility is highly susceptible to the influence of dry and wet seasons. Once arsenic is released from its natural sources, it also precipitates in secondary minerals where it is generally stable in the form of saline precipitates and Fe oxides. In relation to human health, arsenic adaptation has been detected in some aboriginal communities of the Puna together with an efficient metabolism of this metalloid. Also, the inefficient methylation of inorganic As in women of the Altiplano might lead to adverse health effects such as cancer. Despite the health risks of living in this arsenic-rich environment with limited water resources, not all of the Altiplano-Puna is properly characterized and there exists a lack of information regarding the basic geochemistry of arsenic in the region.

J	JOHNSTON, CA				JOHNSTON, CA			MATERIAL FLUXES ACROSS WETLAND ECOTONES IN NORTHERN LANDSCAPES	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The spatial and temporal distribution of sediment, nutrients, and cations in a 2-ha wetland near Shawano, Wisconsin (USA) was used to evaluate the effect of wetland ecotones on water- and windborne fluxes at ecosystem and landscape scales. Within the wetland ecosystem the ecotones studied were beach ridges deposited by post-glacial White Clay Lake, and stream levees deposited by a second-order stream flowing through the wetland. Snow, soil, and surface water data collected from a 52-point sampling grid were geostatistically analyzed to derive contour plots of within-wetland concentrations. Windblown snow from the frozen lake surface accumulated in the wetland behind a low beach ridge to a depth of > 65 cm, nearly 7 times the depth at wind-protected areas of the wetland. As a result of this snow accumulation, areas to the lee of the beach ridge annually received 10% more water and 1.5% more inorganic N from direct precipitation than did other areas of the watershed. The use of geostatistical plots to analyze wetland surface waters revealed that: (1) within-wetland spatial variability was high on every sampling date except early snowmelt; (2) on a given sampling date, concentration patterns differed for different elements, sometimes substantially; (3) with the exception of NO3-N, the spatial patterns for a given material changed considerably over time; and (4) many of these spatial patterns were interpretable on the basis of observed water flow patterns and wetland ecology. In general, there was a decrease in the concentrations of inorganic solids and most ions, and an increase in Ca++ and chemical oxygen demand with distance from the stream. Overbank fluxes contributed P to the wetland during spring and fall floods, but diluted ambient P concentrations during snowmelt events. During snow-free periods there was a sharp gradient in NO3-N concentrations from a streamside value of almost-equal-to 5 mg/L to <0.4 mg/L in wetland areas >45 m from the stream. Measurement of the concentration gradient perpendicular to the stream indicated NO3-N disappearance rates of 6.6 g/100 m of distance during the spring flood. Soil concentrations of mineral matter and P were highest in areas of the wetland closest to the stream; soil concentrations of ammonium and nitrate were spatially disaggregated, and related to levee elevation. At the watershed scale the wetland retained and/or denitrified 15.2% of the total solids, 13.7% of the N, and 14.2% of the P fluxes from the watershed, thus benefitting the water quality of White Clay Lake.

Use of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to Identify and Characterize Overwintering Areas of Fish in Ice-Covered Arctic Rivers: A Demonstration with Broad Whitefish and Their Habitats in the Sagavanirktok River, Alaska	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												In northern climates, locating overwintering fish can be very challenging due to thick ice cover. Areas near the coast of the Beaufort Sea provide valuable overwintering habitat for both resident and anadromous fish species; identifying them and understanding their use of overwintering areas is of special interest. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery from two spaceborne satellites was examined as an alternative to radiotelemetry for identifying anadromous fish overwintering. The presence of water and ice were sampled at 162 sites, and fish were sampled at 16 of these sites. From SAR imagery alone, we successfully identified large pools inhabited by overwintering fish in the ice-covered Sagavanirktok River, Alaska. In addition, the imagery was able to identify all of the larger pools (mean minimum length = 138 m, SD = 131, range = 15-470 m) of water located by field sampling. The effectiveness of SAR in identifying these pools varied from 31% to 100%, depending on imagery polarization, the incidence angle range, and the orbit. Horizontal transmit-vertical receive (HV) polarization appeared to be best. The accuracy of SAR was also assessed at a finer pixel-by-pixel scale (30 x 30 m). The best correspondence at this finer scale was obtained with an image having HV polarization. The levels of agreement ranged from 54% to 69%. The presence of broad whitefish Coregonus nasus (the only anadromous species present) was associated with salinity and pool size (estimated with SAR imagery); fish were more likely to be found in larger pools with low salinity. This research illustrates that SAR imaging has great potential for identifying under-ice overwintering areas of riverine fish. These techniques should allow managers to identify critical overwintering areas more easily and at lower cost than traditional techniques permit.

Spatial and temporal variations of past vegetation can be traced by fossil pollen data mapping. In this paper, we synthesized 57 continuous pollen records on the QTP covering the past 15 kyr to depict large-scale vegetation change and its response to climate variations. In order to minimize potential chronological biases, age-depth models were revised using a state-of-the-art and consistent method for all the records. The spatial and temporal variation of major pollen taxa were examined based on interpolated pollen maps at 1000-year intervals. The arboreal pollen (AP, mainly of Pinus, Betula and Abies/Picea) content expressed significant climate signals over a broad spatial and temporal gradient. During the late glacial period, high proportions of AP widely occurred in regions that are presently unforested owing to the sparse local vegetation coverage. For the Holocene period, AP showed relatively high contributions in records from the southeastern margin of the QTP, with a decreasing gradient in abundance towards the northwest. The transportation of AP to unforested regions corresponds closely to the intensity of monsoon wind, which can be used to track the Holocene evolution of the summer monsoon. The dominant shrub and herbaceous taxa (including Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae, Cyperaceae, Poaceae and Ephedra) generally represent developments of local vegetation responding to climate variations. In addition, the persistent increase in Poaceae pollen during the mid to late Holocene correlates possibly to regional human activities. The inferred spatial and temporal patterns of major pollen types on the QTP provide significant knowledge about long-term vegetation change and its potential response to climate variations.					; Zhao, Yan/B-1785-2014; Cao, Xianyong/L-7168-2019; Ni, Jian/I-7067-2012	Herzschuh, Ulrike/0000-0003-0999-1261; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				JUL 1	2021	573								110412	10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110412	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2021.110412		APR 2021											WOS:000656517500002
J	Meunier, A; Jacquet, S				Meunier, Antony; Jacquet, Stephan			Do phages impact microbial dynamics, prokaryotic community structure and nutrient dynamics in Lake Bourget?	BIOLOGY OPEN												Phages are the most abundant and diversified biological entities in aquatic ecosystems. Understanding their functional role requires laboratory experiments on a short time-scale. Using samples of surface waters of Lake Bourget, we studied whether viruses impact (i) the abundance patterns of the bacterial and phytoplankton communities, (ii) a part of the prokaryotic community composition (both for Eubacteria and Archaea), and (iii) the recycling of nutrients and/or organic matter. Three experiments were performed (one each in February, March and April) at the transition between winter and spring in 2013. The experiment reduced or increased the abundance of virus-like particles in samples containing only the picoplanktonic fraction. Viral and cellular abundances, bacterial and archaeal community structures as well as nutrient concentrations were analysed every 24 h for 3 days. Some of the results reveal that increasing the phage abundance increased the diversity of the eubacterial community. Consistent with the 'killing the winner' concept, viruses are thus likely to significantly change the composition of the bacterial community. This suggests a positive association between viral abundance and bacterial diversity. In contrast, the composition of the archaeal community did not seem to be affected by phage abundance, suggesting the absence of viral control on this community or the inability to observe it at this period of year, either based on the time scale of the investigation or because the archaeal virus titre was too low to induce a significant and visible effect. Lastly, we were unable to demonstrate viruses driving the cycling of nutrients or the response of plankton to nutrient concentration changes in a significant way, suggesting that the role of viruses may be subtle or difficult to assess through the use of such experimental procedures.

J	Kong, XZ; Zhan, Q; Boehrer, B; Rinke, K				Kong, Xiangzhen; Zhan, Qing; Boehrer, Bertram; Rinke, Karsten			High frequency data provide new insights into evaluating and modeling nitrogen retention in reservoirs	WATER RESEARCH												Freshwater ecosystems including lakes and reservoirs are hot spots for retention of excess nitrogen (N) from anthropogenic sources, providing valuable ecological services for downstream and coastal ecosystems. Despite previous investigations, current quantitative understanding on the influential factors and underlying mechanisms of N retention in lentic freshwater systems is insufficient due to data paucity and limitation of modeling techniques. Our ability to reliably predict N retention for these systems therefore remains uncertain. Emerging high frequency monitoring techniques and well-developed ecosystem modeling shed light on this issue. In the present study, we explored the retention of NO3-N during a five-year period (2013-2017) in both annual and weekly scales in a highly flushed reservoir in Germany. We found that annual-averaged NO3-N retention efficiency could be up to 17% with an overall retention efficiency of similar to 4% in such a system characterized by a water residence time (WRT) of similar to 4 days. On the weekly scale, the reservoir displayed negative retention in winter (i.e. a source of NO3-N) and high positive retention in summer (i.e. a sink for NO3-N). We further identified the critical role of Chl-a concentration together with the well-recognized effects from WRT in dictating NO3-N retention efficiency, implying the significance of biological processes including phytoplankton dynamics in driving NO3-N retention. Furthermore, our modeling approach showed that an established process-based ecosystem model (PCLake) accounted for 58.0% of the variance in NO3-N retention efficiency, whereas statistical models obtained a lower value (40.5%). This finding exemplified the superior predictive power of process-based models over statistical models whenever ecological processes were at play. Overall, our study highlights the importance of high frequency data in providing new insights into evaluating and modeling N retention in reservoirs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanism triggering the CO2 flux from the lake surface has changed from being dominantly diffusive to mainly advective (bubbling). The Cl concentration was steadily decreasing during the last two decades in the Na-Cl boiling springs feeding the lake. Since 2013, for both lake and SP springs, the Cl concentration has increased up to the 2005 Cl concentration levels. A large degassing spot in the middle of the lake was found in April 2015 with a CO2 flux of more than 10,000gm(-2)d(-1). These observations are the evidence of the onset of a new stage of activity within the volcano-hydrothermal system of El Chichon volcano associated most probably with changes in the magmatic activity at depth.

J	Woodland, RJ; Rodríguez, MA; Magnan, P; Glémet, H; Cabana, G				Woodland, Ryan J.; Rodriguez, Marco A.; Magnan, Pierre; Glemet, Helene; Cabana, Gilbert			Incorporating temporally dynamic baselines in isotopic mixing models	ECOLOGY												Stable isotopes (particularly C and N) are widely used to make inferences regarding food web structure and the phenology of consumer diet shifts, applications that require accurate isotopic characterization of trophic resources to avoid biased inferences of feeding relationships. For example, most isotope mixing models require that endmembers be adequately represented by a single probability distribution; yet, there is mounting evidence that the isotopic composition of aquatic organisms often used as mixing model endmembers can change over periods of weeks to months. A review of the literature indicated that the delta C-13 values of live aquatic primary consumer taxa, commonly used as proxies of carbon production sources (i.e., trophic baselines), express seasonally dynamic cycles characterized by an oscillation between summer maxima and winter minima. Based on these results, we built a dynamic baseline mixing model that allows a growing consumer to track temporal gradients in the isotopic baselines of a food web. Simulations showed that the ability of a consumer to maintain or approach isotopic equilibrium with its diet over a realistic growth season was strongly affected by both the rate of change of the isotopic baseline and equilibration rate of the consumer. In an empirical application, mixing models of varying complexity were used to estimate the relative contribution of benthic vs. pelagic carbon sources to nine species of juvenile fish in a fluvial lake of the St. Lawrence River system (Quebec, Canada). Estimates of p (proportion of carbon derived from benthic sources) derived from a static mixing model indicated broad interspecific variation in trophic niche, ranging from complete benthivory to >95% reliance on pelagic food webs. Output from the more realistic dynamic baseline mixing model increased estimated benthivory by an average of 36% among species. Taken together, our results demonstrate that failing to identify dynamic baselines when present, and (or) matching consumers with baseline taxa that possess substantially different equilibration rates can seriously bias interpretation of stable isotope data. Additionally, by providing a formalized framework that allows both resources and consumers to shift their isotopic value through time, our model demonstrates a feasible approach for incorporating temporally dynamic isotope conditions in trophic studies of higher consumers.					; Magnan, Pierre/U-9342-2019; Rodríguez, Marco/J-6492-2012; Rodriguez, Marco A./J-6492-2012; Woodland, Ryan/D-5344-2017	Glemet, Helene/0000-0001-7549-359X; Magnan, Pierre/0000-0003-3122-7163; Rodriguez, Marco A./0000-0003-0391-9170; 													0012-9658	1939-9170				JAN	2012	93	1					131	144		10.1890/11-0505.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/11-0505.1								22486094					WOS:000301996100016

Stormwater management in nutrient-sensitive watersheds: a case study investigating impervious cover limits and pollutant-load regulations	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The objective of this research project was to compare two stormwater management strategies within a nutrient-sensitive watershed: impervious cover limits versus pollutant-load regulations. A case study was conducted in the nutrient-sensitive Falls Lake watershed in North Carolina, USA, where a commercial fitness complex was constructed in a zone previously restricted to low-density housing. The Falls Lake watershed has a stormwater regulation that limits total nitrogen and total phosphorus export loads to 2.47 kg/ha/yr and 0.37 kg/ha/yr, respectively. Hydrology and water quality were monitored pre- and post-development to quantify changes to stormwater volumes, pollutant concentrations, and annual export loading rates. On-site stormwater control measures (SCMs) reduced nutrient export loading rates below the regulatory standard. However, increased stormwater volumes and nutrient export loading rates were observed from pervious surfaces that were disturbed during construction (total nitrogen increased from 2.06 to 4.24 kg/ha/yr, total phosphorus increased from 0.41 to 0.73 kg/ha/yr). Results from this case study suggest that (1) impervious cover limits do not adequately account for a parcel's nutrient export loads and (2) SCMs that reduce volume and treat pollutants can reduce nutrient export loads below regulatory levels in the Falls Lake watershed.					; Stillwell, Charles/ABB-8500-2021	Stillwell, Charles/0000-0002-4571-4897; 													0273-1223	1996-9732				AUG	2018	78	3					664	675		10.2166/wst.2018.338	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2018.338								30208007					WOS:000445518100020

However, dietary resources under lake ice are both quantitatively and qualitatively limited, and feeding might not be energetically rewarding for most zooplankton species. Many zooplankters are expected to fast throughout the winter, exhausting their previously accumulated fat storage. We hypothesised that only a fraction of the actively overwintering zooplankton contributes to an active food web under lake ice, leading to few trophic linkages within the planktonic community. Zooplankton habitats and feeding were investigated under the ice of Lake Onego. Zooplankton habitats and migrations were studied by coupling zooplankton sampling around the clock to measurements of particle movement using an acoustic Doppler current profiler. Secondly, fatty acid-specific stable isotope compositions were used to determine whether and which zooplankton fatty acids ultimately came from the assimilation of under-ice seston. The algal biomass was low under ice and mostly dominated by large diatoms. Copepods dominated the zooplankton community. Species present as late copepodite and adult instars were confined to the deeper layers, while nauplii occupied the surface layer. Diel vertical migration by Cyclops was the most tangible observation of persistent feeding under the ice. Previously accumulated fat storage represented most of zooplankton fatty acids, with few, yet detectable, fatty acids recently acquired by feeding under the ice. Although some zooplankton taxa maintained feeding activity under the ice of Lake Onego, the food source available beneath the ice was not sufficiently rewarding to leave an isotopic imprint upon the dominant fatty acids of bulk zooplankton. The seston fatty acids that were passed on to zooplankton from feeding under ice were not provided by diatoms, although they made up most of the phytoplankton biovolume. Instead, the zooplankton food web was supported by mixotrophic phytoplankton (i.e. cryptophytes and chrysophytes) that represented <5% of the under-ice biovolume. Consequently, the planktonic food web under the ice of Lake Onego had few trophic linkages, and thereby low connectance. Environmental conditions under the ice of Lake Onego do not depart significantly from those observed in lakes of similar latitudes. Therefore, low connectance food webs could be relatively common under ice for lakes above 60 degrees latitude. Our methodological approach is applicable to other lakes and could thus disclose the variability of under-ice food webs. This would provide a much more complete picture of annual dynamics of food webs in lakes that ice over.					; Nataliia, Kalinkina/U-1473-2017; Kalinkina, Nataliia/U-1473-2017; Lyautey, Emilie/OEM-8549-2025	Frossard, Victor/0000-0003-1338-4739; Lyautey, Emilie/0000-0003-0754-197X; Spangenberg, Jorge E./0000-0001-8636-6414; Perga, Marie-Elodie/0000-0002-9003-0769; Nataliia, Kalinkina/0000-0001-6363-0470; Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAR	2021	66	3					570	581		10.1111/fwb.13661	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13661		DEC 2020											WOS:000599435200001

However, it is unclear whether or not vegetation exhibits a lagged response to climate change during shifts from rapid cooling to rapid warming. The Younger Dryas (YD) cold event, spanning the last glacial/Holocene transition, was a prominent abrupt climatic event. To investigate the vegetation response to climate change during the YD, we compared profiles of independent climatic indicators from the sediments of alpine Lake Gonghai, on the margin of the modern Asian summer monsoon, with a pollen record from the same site. Our aim was to assess the phase lag of vegetation change relative to independent climate proxies that would have responded near instantaneously to climate change. The results show that the vegetation changed synchronously with the climate proxies, and consequently, we conclude that vegetation succession around Lake Gonghai exhibited a nonlagged response to climate change during the YD. This result confirms that a previous pollen-based quantitative regional precipitation record from Lake Gonghai reliably depicts variations in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), especially its decreasing trend during the YD. This conclusion differs from that of related research on the Baxie loess section and Hani peat deposits. Also, we suggest that our findings provide an improved understanding of the likely response of the EASM during cooling intervals and that the YD is a useful analog for studying the response of vegetation to possible abrupt cooling events under future global warming scenarios.					; Liu, jianbao/X-3646-2019; Chen, Shengqian/ABA-5944-2021; Shen, Zhongwei/KDO-9452-2024; Wu, Duo/ACI-5090-2022; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011; Zhang, Zhiping/MVY-0861-2025	Chen, Fahu/0000-0002-8874-1035; Zhang, Zhiping/0000-0001-8388-9631; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				JUL 27	2018	123	14					7065	7075		10.1029/2018JD028752	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JD028752													WOS:000441965400002

Predicting long-term recovery of a strongly acidified stream using MAGIC and climate models (Litavka, Czech Republic)	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Two branches forming the headwaters of a stream in the Czech Republic were studied. Both streams have similar catchment characteristics and historical deposition; however one is rain-fed and strongly affected by acid atmospheric deposition, the other spring-fed and only moderately acidified. The MAGIC model was used to reconstruct past stream water and soil chemistry of the rain-fed branch, and predict future recovery up to 2050 under current proposed emissions levels. A future increase in air temperature calculated by a regional climate model was then used to derive climate-related scenarios to test possible factors affecting chemical recovery up to 2100. Macroinvertebrates were sampled from both branches, and differences in stream chemistry, were reflected in the community structures. According to modelled forecasts, recovery of the rain-fed branch will be gradual and limited, and continued high levels of sulphate release from the soils will continue to dominate stream water chemistry, while scenarios related to a predicted increase in temperature will have little impact. The likelihood of colonization of species from the spring-fed branch was evaluated considering the predicted extent of chemical recovery. The results suggest that the possibility of colonization of species from the spring-fed branch to the rain-fed will be limited to only the acid-tolerant stonefly, caddisfly and dipteran taxa in the modelled period.					; Stuchlik, Evzen/I-1915-2017; Kopacek, Jiri/A-7373-2014	Kopacek, Jiri/0000-0002-4409-4032; Stuchlik, Evzen/0000-0003-0200-5721; 													1027-5606	1607-7938					2008	12	2					479	490		10.5194/hess-12-479-2008	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-12-479-2008													WOS:000256968000014

Holocene climate variability, vegetation dynamics and fire regime in the central Pyrenees: the Basa de la Mora sequence (NE Spain)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												High resolution multiproxy data (pollen, sedimentology, geochemistry, chironomids and charcoal) from the Basa de la Mora (BSM) lake sequence (42 degrees 32' N, 0 degrees 19' E, 1914 m a.s.l.) show marked climate variability in the central southern Pyrenees throughout the Holocene. A robust age model based on 15 AMS radiocarbon dates underpins the first precise reconstruction of rapid climate changes during the Holocene from this area. During the Early Holocene, increased winter snowpack and high snowmelt during summer, as a consequence of high seasonality, led to higher lake levels, a chironomid community dominated by non-lacustrine taxa (Orthocladiinae) related to higher inlet streams, and a forested landscape with intense run-off processes in the watershed. From 9.8 to 8.1 cal ka BP, climate instability is inferred from rapid and intense forest shifts and high fluctuation in surface run-off. Shifts among conifers and mesophytes reveal at least four short-lived dry events at 9.7, 9.3, 8.8 and 8.3 cal ka BP. Between 8.1 and 5.7 cal ka BP a stable climate with higher precipitation favoured highest lake levels and forest expansion, with spread of mesophytes, withdrawal of conifers and intensification of fires, coinciding with the Holocene Climate Optimum. At 5.7 cal ka BP a major change leading to drier conditions contributed to a regional decline in mesophytes, expansion of pines and junipers, and a significant lake level drop. Despite drier conditions, fire activity dropped as consequence of biomass reduction. Two arid intervals occurred between 2.9 and 2.4 cal ka BP and at 1.2-0.7 cal ka BP (800-1300 AD). The latter coincides with the Medieval Climate Anomaly and is one of the most arid phases of the Holocene in BSM sequence. Anthropogenic disturbances were small until 700 AD, when human pressure over landscape intensified, with lea cultivation in the lowlands and significant deforestation in highlands. Colder and unfavourable weather conditions during the second part of the Little Ice Age caused a temporary cease of high-land management. The most intense anthropogenic disturbances occurred during the second half of 19th century. Last decades are characterized by recovery of the vegetation cover as a result of land abandonment, and lowered lake levels, probably due to higher temperatures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	SPENCER, DF; KSANDER, GG				SPENCER, DF; KSANDER, GG			DIFFERENTIAL-EFFECTS OF THE MICROBIAL METABOLITE, ACETIC-ACID, ON SPROUTING OF AQUATIC PLANT PROPAGULES	AQUATIC BOTANY												Subterranean vegetative propagules are important life cycle stages for some species of rooted aquatic plants. Sediments contain numerous compounds resulting from anaerobic degradation of organic matter, including acetic acid. Tubers, turions, and winter buds of Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle, Potamogeton gramineus L., and Potamogeton pectinatus L. were exposed to acetic acid concentrations from 0 to 696 mmol l(-1) for 1-8 days. Hydrilla verticillata propagules were more sensitive to acetic acid exposure than those of either Potamogeton species. Monoecious H. verticillata propagules did not sprout at acetic acid concentrations of 17 mmol l(-1) or over, even at the shortest exposure time. Potamogeton gramineus winter buds and P. pectinatus tubers were less inhibited between 17 and 87 mmol l(-1) if the exposure time was short (2 days or less). Sediment type did not influence the differential response to acetic acid, but the presence of sediments ameliorated the effects of acetic acid somewhat. More than two-thirds of P. pectinatus tubers sprouted after a 24 h exposure to 696 mmol l(-1) at 4 degrees C, at higher temperatures sprouting was greatly reduced. Hydrilla venticillata tubers did not sprout following exposure to 17 mmol l(-1) at any temperature (4, 13, 19, and 25 degrees C) examined.																			0304-3770					SEP	1995	52	1-2					107	119		10.1016/0304-3770(95)00488-L	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(95)00488-L													WOS:A1995TE89200008

However, the patterns of Holocene lake-level variations in the central TP and their relevance to climate change are still unclear, especially for the middle and late Holocene. Located in the central TP, Dagze Co presents a number of distinct palaeoshorelines, thus making it ideal for investigating these patterns. In this study, we first identified these shorelines using remote sensing images, and then dated these shorelines using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. The results showed that high-resolution remote sensing images can successfully identify palaeoshorelines, alluvial fans, and remnant river channels surrounding the lake, which enhances our understanding of regional geomorphic processes. The OSL dating results showed that Dagze Co flowed westward to Cuowa Lake during a lake expansion stage in the early Holocene. The highest palaeoshoreline (40.6 m above the present lake level) formed between 6.1 and 5.5 ka, and the lake area was 2.8 times larger than present. The lake level declined between 5.5 and 3.4 ka in response to the weakened Indian summer monsoon (ISM) with substantially reduced summer rainfall. The lake level rose again and was sustained between 3.4 and 2.2 ka owing to slightly increased rainfall and increased water supply from glacial melt water. The lake level rapidly declined since 2.2 ka in response to decreased ISM rainfall and reduced meltwater supply. The lake level variations of Dagze Co was in a long-term decline pattern since the mid Holocene, similar to several other lakes in the TP influenced by the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM).					yang, hailong/GXH-9625-2022; 徐, 砚田/GQI-0772-2022; wang, yixuan/GXW-2866-2022; Lai, Zhongping/KVB-7935-2024	Liu, Xiang-Jun/0000-0002-8413-2451; Ou, Xianjiao/0000-0003-2776-1099; Xu, Yantian/0000-0002-4530-0686; 													0341-8162	1872-6887				DEC	2022	219								106645	10.1016/j.catena.2022.106645	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2022.106645		SEP 2022											WOS:000864651000004

Lake Qinghai is located on the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and is affected by both Monsoon climate and Westerlies circulation. It is sensitive to the climate drivers of these systems. Its sediments, accumulated over the Cenozoic period, are a rich source of information for climate, tectonics and environmental changes of the period. We present a high-resolution ostracod record from a Lake Qinghai sediment core with a record of the period 5.10-2.60 Ma, thus covering the EPWP. Ostracods appear at 4.63 Ma and are most abundant until 3.58 Ma, while a body of water was present at the core site. This suggests a phase of humid climate and an intensified Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM), which is consistent with a warmer and wetter climate in the early Pliocene. Within this period the ostracod record shows some variabilities in lake level with deeper periods suggesting more intense ASM compared to those with shallower water. The disappearance of ostracods at 3.58 Ma may provide evidence for the uplift of Qinghai Nanshan (south of Qinghai Lake) since this is when the ASM intensified. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Linlokken, AN				Linlokken, Arne N.			Temperature Effects on Recruitment and Individual Growth of Two Antagonistic Fish Species, Perch Perca fluviatilis and Roach Rutilus rutilus, from a Climate Change Perspective	FISHES												Perch (Perca fluviatilis) in four boreal lakes and sympatric roach (Rutilis rutilis) in two of these lakes were studied by means of gill net sampling, and age and growth were analyzed to explore whether summer temperature affects recruitment and individual growth of the two species differently. Water temperature logging in the lakes showed a highly significant correlation with air temperature. Year-class strength of the perch was significantly positively affected by the summer air temperature, whereas the temperature effect was non-significant for the roach. There was a significant negative effect of year-class strength of one-year-old perch on roach year-class strength in one lake. ln one of the allopatric perch populations, the year-class strength correlation with temperature failed after biomass removal, probably because fishing affected the age structure. July-August air temperature had a significantly positive effect on individual growth rates of two- to five-year-old perch, whereas the effect on roach growth was less clear. The inclination of perch to predate its competitor, roach, as well as conspecifics, as well as accelerated individual growth, were shown to occur more frequently in years with abundant 1+ perch, i.e., the summer after the rise of a strong year-class. Climate warming may potentially favor perch recruitment and growth.																				2410-3888				JUN	2023	8	6							295	10.3390/fishes8060295	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fishes8060295													WOS:001017356800001
J	Derksen, C; Walker, A; Goodison, B				Derksen, C; Walker, A; Goodison, B			Evaluation of passive microwave snow water equivalent retrievals across the boreal forest/tundra transition of western Canada	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Composite patterns of monthly averaged (1978-2002) satellite passive microwave derived snow water equivalent (SWE) data produced using the Meteorological Service of Canada land cover sensitive algorithm suite contain an interannually consistent and well-defined zone of high SWE retrievals (> 100 min) across the northern boreal forest of western Canada. Consistently lower SWE retrievals are present across both the comparatively dense boreal forest to the south, and open tundra to the north. Because of the sparse conventional observing network across this region, a dedicated field sampling campaign was conducted during the 2003/2004 winter season to measure snow properties across these landscape zones in northern Manitoba, Canada. Using road and helicopter access, snow cover measurements were made along an approximately 500 km transect between the communities of Thompson (boreal forest), Gillam (sparse northern boreal forest), and Churchill (open tundra) during late November 2003, and early March 2004. The November 2003 snow survey revealed good agreement between Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) derived SWE retrievals and in situ measurements across the gradient of increasing SWE between Thompson and Gillam, and the well defined zone of high SWE values to the north and east of Gillam. Further to the north, SSM/I derived SWE retrievals over the boreal ecotone and open tundra were consistently lower than the in situ measurements. Results of the March survey (at which point mean snow depths had increased from approximately 30-60 cm) showed an increase in absolute SWE differences between the in situ measurements and passive microwave estimates, but relative agreement between the datasets remained strong. The same SWE gradient across the boreal forest was again captured by both datasets, although tundra retrievals remained consistently low. These findings, along with consideration of snowpack stratigraphy, density, and the potential influence of tundra lakes and ponds on microwave emission and scatter, suggest that development of a tundra-specific SWE retrieval algorithm is necessary. From a scaling perspective, a large range of SWE values were measured on the ground within each satellite footprint, but a comparison of frequency histograms showed that a high percentage of satellite retrievals (November: 93%; March: 63%) fell within 20 mm of the median ground measurement.

In the 21-d experiment conducted in October, kokanee (53.9 mm average total length) were placed either in net-pens made of 1.59-mm mesh, allowing drift of ambient zooplankton into the pens, or in pens made of 153-mum mesh containing zooplankton at comparatively high, low, or very low densities relative to that of the ambient zooplankton density pens. Kokanee receiving ambient zooplankton densities grew 0.83%/d, whereas those fed the same diet at high densities grew 1.84%/d, and those fed the low and very low densities grew -0.69% and 0.17%/d, respectively. Final kokanee biomass differed significantly among treatment groups. Large growth differences also existed among treatment groups, but comparisons between the ambient and high treatments or between the ambient and very low treatments were not statistically significant. In samples collected from the lake, the copepods Cyclops bicuspidatus thomasi and Diaptomus ashlandi were the most abundant zooplankters, representing more than 70% of the samples. Kokanee growth in this study was consistent with that in other lakes with limited food resources and showed that growth of wild kokanee would have been greater in October in Lake Pend Oreille had zooplankton been more abundant.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2002	131	6					1061	1069		10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<1061:ANPETE>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<1061:ANPETE>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000180881100005
J	Danylchuk, AJ; Tonn, WM				Danylchuk, AJ; Tonn, WM			Natural disturbances and fish: Local and regional influences on winterkill of fathead minnows in boreal lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We investigated the population dynamics of fathead minnow Pimephales promelas and the environmental factors of four small lakes in the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada, for 5 years to determine the influence of local and regional factors on the development of hypoxia and the occurrence of fish winterkill. Fathead minnow densities varied considerably among lakes and years, with dramatic (47-94%) year-to-year declines occurring when dissolved oxygen levels were extremely low in the intervening winter. Large declines (presumed winterkills) occurred after 25% of the "lake-winters," affecting three of four study lakes and 2 of 5 years. A fifth population in the same region, monitored for 15 years, displayed both a comparable frequency and temporal synchrony of large density decreases, suggesting that winterkill is a pervasive natural disturbance in small lakes of the Boreal Plains. In contrast to patterns displayed by larger fish species, smaller individuals in the fathead minnow populations were more strongly affected than larger individuals. Oxygen levels in a given lake and winter were related to (1) the collective interactions of productivity and depth of the lake, (2) the local and regional hydrogeology, and (3) the current and antecedent climate. As a result, the relative effects of these local and regional factors strongly influence the natural dynamics of fathead minnow populations in these lakes. Given that humans can alter many of the important factors, the natural incidence of winterkill could be augmented if human activities are poorly managed.

Considering the increasing demand for energy wood and timber, this species could be applied in plantation forestry in Latvia; however, knowledge about its growth dynamics in relation to environmental factors is necessary for sustainable management. Annual height increment (HI) was measured for 297 lodgepole pine trees from three provenances (Pink Mountain, Fort Nelson and Summit Lake) and for 135 Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees for the period from 1990 to 2009. Mean HI and diameter between species and provenances was compared by ANOVA. Height-growth-climate relationships were assessed using dendrochronological methods. Chronologies of HI were produced based on cross-dated time-series; the effects of climatic factors on yearly variation of HI were determined by Pearson correlation analysis. There were no significant differences in diameter between species and provenances; however, HI of Summit Lake provenance and Scots pine was the highest. Common signatures in yearly variation of HI were observed in similar to 40 and similar to 60 % of lodgepole pine and Scots pine trees, respectively, suggesting effect of climatic factors. Sets of climatic factors affecting HI differed between species and provenances. Temperature in spring, summer and precipitation in the dormant period showed the strongest effect (positive) on HI of Pink Mountain, Fort Nelson and Summit Lake provenances, respectively. In contrast, HI. of Scots pine was sensitive to climatic factors related to water deficit in May and June of the year preceding growth. Apparently height growth of Scots pine was more affected by conditions in the year preceding growth than in current year, compared with lodgepole pine.

Comparison of soil nutrient fluxes from tree-fall gap zones of an old-growth northern hardwood forest	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												The objective of this study was to assess nutrient losses, via soil solutes, from discrete zones of recent, single-tree gaps in an old-growth, northern hardwood forest. Growing season flux rates of all solutes did not differ between the "undisturbed" zones (areas 5 m away from gap-making trees) and "crownfall" zones (areas associated with fallen tree crowns) of the twelve tree-fallgaps we studied. Under assumptions of partial root gap formation (50% root mortality), total cation and anion fluxes were 2-fold greater, and DON and total N fluxes were 2- to 3-fold greater in the "proximate" zones (areas 0-2 in from stumps of snapped, gap-making trees) compared to the crownfall and undisturbed zones. The "pit" zones (areas of disturbed soil associated with topped-up trees) exhibited 3- to 6-fold greater NH4+, NO3-, and total dissolved N fluxes, and 2-fold greater total cation and anion fluxes than the undisturbed and crownfall zones. We estimated that proximate and pit zones associated with both recent and old tree-fall gaps accounted for 12% and 0.3%, respectively, of the total stand area in this old-growth forest. At the stand level, root throw pits contributed < 1% of the estimated NO3-, total dissolved N, total cations and total anions leaching from the system. Under assumptions of partial root gap formation proximate zones contributed 24-27% of the flux of these solutes. We conclude that the pit zones were inconsequential for nutrient loss and, while proximate zones contributed substantially more to nutrient losses from this system, the majority of nutrients leached from this system (similar to 75%) were leached from undisturbed forest zones. Our results indicate that efforts to account for mechanisms of nutrient loss from old-growth forests must consider variation in leaching rates associated with discrete microenvironments within gaps, and focus greater attention on nutrient retention capacity of the live. intact forest matrix.																			1095-5674	1940-0616				APR-JUN	2007	134	2					269	280		10.3159/1095-5674(2007)134[269:COSNFF]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3159/1095-5674(2007)134[269:COSNFF]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000248354400010
J	EVANS, RM; CASH, KJ				EVANS, RM; CASH, KJ			EARLY SPRING FLIGHTS OF AMERICAN WHITE PELICANS - TIMING AND FUNCTIONAL-ROLE IN ATTRACTING OTHERS TO THE BREEDING COLONY	CONDOR												The aerial activities of the American white pelicans (P. erythrorhynchos) were observed at 3 separate breeding colonies located at East Shoal Lake, Manitoba, Canada, in 1981-1983. The onset of flights over a colony occurred 36 .+-. 2 days before the onset of hatching in the same colony. In each year, flights were concentrated over a single colony on any given day but differed between days. Newly arriving spring migrants were significantly more likely to be attracted to the particular colony over which most of the flights were occurring at the time of their arrival. Conspicuous flights serve to attract other pelicans to a currently active colony site, and may thereby facilitate the formation of highly synchronous breeding aggregations in this species.																				1938-5129					1985	87	2					252	255		10.2307/1366890	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1366890													WOS:A1985AJG7300010

This includes skin and soft tissue infections and wound infections, gastrointestinal infections, and central nervous system infections acquired through recreational exposure or trauma. Case reports of freshwater-associated infections typically focus on waterborne pathogens as the cause of illness; however, patients who experience significant physical trauma during freshwater exposure may also be at increased risk for infection with their own flora if the nature of the injury allows entry of bacteria through a mechanism such as mucosal injury. Here, we present a case of a healthy 18-year-old man who rapidly developed bacteremia with oral flora following several falls submerging his face into lake water while water skiing, as well as acute polymicrobial sinusitis and subsequent pre-septal cellulitis. Shortly after his water skiing falls, the patient developed sinusitis that rapidly progressed to headaches, emesis, and significant periorbital swelling. Blood cultures grew Prevotella salivae, a bacterium naturally found in the oral cavity. Sinus cultures grew Klebsiella aerogenes and Listeria monocytogenes, which may be associated with lake water. The infection improved with antibiotic therapy, and the patient was discharged on a regimen of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Reports of bacteremia with oral flora following freshwater injury are not typically reported, and to our knowledge, this is the first report describing bacteremia with P salivae.

They belong to the group of warm monomictic lakes with surface temperatures in summer of .apprx. 25.degree. C and a homogeneous temperature after winter turnover of 12-16.degree. C. The thermocline lies in about 15 m depth. Two of them are deep (Lake Trichonis, 97 km2, .apprx. 50 m depth and Lake Amvrakia, 14 km2, about 40 m depth). The shallow Lake lyssimachia (maximum depth 6 m, area 13.5 km2), belonging to the drainage area of Lake Trichonis, differs considerably from the deep lakes: because of distinct turbidity light penetration is often highly attenuated. The mud-water exchange probably is rather high, resulting in a much higher nutrient content than in the clear deep lakes. The primary production of this lake is considerable. The deep lakes are oligotrophic, but now being characterized by a nutrient accumulation in the hypolimmion they show rates of daily areal photosynthesis in the range of mesotrophic lakes. Light is not a limiting factor, going down to 20 m depth. From the chemical point of view the lakes form 2 groups: Lakes Trichonis and Lyssimachia belong to lakes of the carbonate type, Lake Amvrakia belongs to the sulfate type, caused apparently by outcrops of gypsum in the karstic environment of this lake. The O2 content is higher with decreasing temperature, as it is typical for oligotrophic lakes. The O2 consumption in the hypolimnion is not complete, at the end of the stratification period some O2 is found just above the sediment. Only in Lake Amvrakia is blue-green algae of some importance. The phytoplankton of the lakes is mostly characterized by Dinophyceae and diatoms.																			0003-9136						1982	95	OCT					365	394																WOS:A1982PV20900026
J	Wright, DT				Wright, DT			The role of sulphate-reducing bacteria and cyanobacteria in dolomite formation in distal ephemeral lakes of the Coorong region, South Australia	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY					Multidiscilinary International Workshop on Microbial Mediation in Carbonate Diagenesis	1997	CHICHILIANNE, FRANCE	Int Assoc Sedimentologists, Assoc Sedimentologistes Francais, IGCP 380 Microbialites, Proc & Prod				The dolomitic distal ephemeral lakes of the Coorong region of South Australia are dynamic systems in which the concentrations of solutes generally increase during late spring and summer when the rate of evaporation greatly exceeds aqueous input. During late evaporation, active bacterial sulphate reduction occurs in uppermost, anoxic lake sediments as rising salinity and then H2S-toxicity kills off the macrobiota. These hypersaline lakewaters are characterised by high pH and elevated concentrations of carbonate and sulphate ions. Magnesium concentrated in cyanobacterial cells and sheaths is released into the strongly-electrolytic, alkaline lake brines from lake-margin stromatolites and mars during desiccation, and may explain the remarkable increase in Mg levels recorded at this time. Continued evaporation of the lakewaters produces a halite crust overlying the dolomite: sulphate-free residual puddles and the absence of gypsum indicates that all sulphate is removed by sulphate-reducing bacteria. Dolomite forms in situ as a primary precipitate from these microbially mediated lake porewaters, and both the morphology and size distribution of dolomite grains is identical to bacterial cells. it is not proven exactly when dolomite precipitation occurs, but the submicron-sized grains and multiple defects in a disordered lattice indicate that precipitation is rapid and follows bacterial removal of sulphate, which is known to inhibit dolomite formation. Bacterial sulphate reduction and cyanobacterial degradation may thus lead to the removal of all kinetic inhibitors to dolomite formation, and provide a mechanism for dolomite precipitation around bacterial cells in shallow subsurface sediments. during the late stages of evaporation. In adjacent non-dolomitic lakes, sulphate is present throughout evaporation, so that other minerals, principally aragonite and hydromagnesite, are precipitated. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Thermal Structure of the Lakes of the North-West of Russia During the Freeze-up Period	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												On the basis of analyzing long-term field data, we investigated the vertical thermal structure of 66 lakes of the North-West of Russia during the freeze-up period. The largest variability in thermal structure is characteristic for low-drainage shallow water bodies. Detailed data were obtained at self-contained buoy stations located in a small Lake Vendyurskoe (southern Karelia) were used to identify water temperature changes at the depths for a winter season as well as making assessments of het flows at the water-bottom and water-ice interfaces. The interannual water temperature variability at the depths reaches 2 degrees C. The main geographical factors influencing the formation of thermal stratifications in the 66 lakes used in the study during the winter period are their mean depth, area, water residence time and geographical latitude. The largest vertical water temperature gradients are characteristic for the group of the smallest and shallow lakes, in the bottom layers of which the water temperature exceeds the temperature of maximum density, whereas in the deep lakes (more than 15 m) the water temperature is below 4 degrees C. The lowest values of water temperature are observed in large lakes. The water temperature in the upper layer (up to 10 m) of drainage water bodies also decreases to 0-1 degrees C as the result of the removal of heat with the river discharge. According to the thermal stratifications, the lakes are categorized as small (shallow, deep and drainage lakes), medium-sized and large shallow and large deep lakes. The suggested regression model permits a typical water temperature to be assessed at standard depths at the end of a winter season for any water body in the study region using available geographical information. The verification of the model is done from independent data for eight lakes of Finland.

We used a taxonomic and a size diversity index as a descriptor of the community structure. We predicted that the size diversity of each trophic level would be mainly related to biotic interactions, such as size-based fish predation (in the case of zooplankton) and food resource availability (in the case of phytoplankton), whereas taxonomic diversity would be more affected by abiotic variables (e.g., conductivity, pond morphology). Our results showed a negative relationship between phytoplankton size diversity and food resource availability leading to low size diversities under food scarcity due to dominance of small species. Conductivity also negatively affected the phytoplankton size diversity, although slightly. Regarding zooplankton size diversity, none of predictors tested seemed to influence this index. Similar fish size diversities among ponds may prevent a significant effect of fish predation on size diversity of zooplankton. As expected, taxonomic diversity of phytoplankton and zooplankton was related to abiotic variables (specifically pond morphometry) rather than biotic interactions, which are usually body size dependent, especially in these species-poor brackish environments.

J	Kocovsky, PM; Carline, RF				Kocovsky, PM; Carline, RF			Influence of extreme temperatures on consumption and condition of walleyes in Pymatuning Sanctuary, Pennsylvania	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Temperature is an important abiotic factor affecting fish population dynamics. An unfavorable thermal regimen can restrict a species' ability to thrive in its environment. We studied the effects of an unfavorable thermal regimen on the feeding, condition, and growth of an unexploited population of walleyes Stizostedion vitreum in Pymatuning Sanctuary, Pennsylvania. We used gastric lavage to sample stomach contents of walleyes captured by electrofishing during bimonthly sampling from May through October, 1997-1998. We sampled available forage by shoreline seining and recorded water temperatures using an electronic temperature monitor. To determine the effects of temperature on walleye feeding, condition, and growth, we examined relationships among water temperature, forage availability, percentage of stomachs containing food, food consumption by number and volume, and relative weight of adults. Average daily temperature and daily minimum temperature were above the thermal optimum (22degreesC) for most of the summer in both years. Adult catch-per-unit-effort, percentage of stomachs containing food, average number of food items, and volume of food consumed were all lowest during summer. Average relative weight of adults was lowest during the warmest periods of summer, and was negatively related to average temperature, as was average volume of food consumed. The thermal regimen in Pymatuning Sanctuary negatively affected adult walleye feeding activity, consumption, and condition, and was thus an important factor in structuring this population.																			0275-5947					FEB	2001	21	1					198	207		10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0198:IOETOC>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021<0198:IOETOC>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000174289000020
J	WU, L; CULVER, DA				WU, L; CULVER, DA			DAPHNIA POPULATION-DYNAMICS IN WESTERN LAKE ERIE - REGULATION BY FOOD LIMITATION AND YELLOW PERCH PREDATION	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Two Daphnia species exhibited similar dynamic patterns in western Lake Erie. Populations peaked in early summer, declined to minimum abundance in mid-July, and then disappeared after August. To determine relative importance of food limitation and young-of-year (YOY) fish predation in regulating Daphnia dynamics, we examined relationships (1) between edible phytoplankton abundances and Daphnia fecundity and birth rates, and (2) between Daphnia biomass consumed by YOY yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and Daphnia death rates. The population peak was created by a burst of parthenogenetic reproduction. Suppression of birth rates (<1 individual d-1) by low edible phytoplankton resources (<4 g.m-3 wet wt) and increased consumption by YOY yellow perch caused a midsummer decline of Daphnia populations. Once the Daphnia populations were reduced, the predation from age-1 and older planktivorous fish in western Lake Erie was likely to keep the populations at low densities in spite of increased food resources in late summer. An increased white perch (Morone americana) population and the invasion of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in western Lake Erie may alter the cycle of Daphnia dynamics, hence influencing yellow perch population in the lake.																			0380-1330						1994	20	3					537	545		10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71170-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(94)71170-9													WOS:A1994PH09200006
J	Kasprzak, PH; Lathrop, RC				Kasprzak, PH; Lathrop, RC			Influence of two Daphnia species on summer phytoplankton assemblages from eutrophic lakes	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												We conducted grazing experiments to test whether larger-bodied Daphnia pulicaria have a different effect from smaller-bodied Daphnia galeata mendotae on the composition of summer algal assemblages in eutrophic lakes. Three separate cubitainer experiments were run for 5 days in a replicated factorial design utilizing two algal community types and the two Daphnia species. Inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen were added to prevent nutrient limitation of the algae. Both edible and inedible size fractions of chlorophyll a increased in cubitainers without Daphnia spp. Grazer addition usually resulted in a reduction in edible chlorophyll; reductions were greater in D.pulicaria cubitainers. Grazing by Daphnia spp. on presumed inedible chlorophyll was variable. Algal size was not always a good predictor of grazeability. The results of this study indicate that D.pulicaria, because of its greater filtration potential and ability to ingest larger particles, provides a stronger control on inedible-sized algae when compared to equal numerical densities of D.g.mendotae. However, Aphanizomenon increased as a response to heavy grazing pressure by D.pulicaria on other algal species. This suggests that biomanipulation efforts that promote large-bodied Daphnia may not produce desirable results if nutrient inputs remain high.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				AUG	1997	19	8					1025	1044		10.1093/plankt/19.8.1025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/19.8.1025													WOS:A1997XT70200006

It was determined that Microcystis abundance increased from 0.16 x 10(4) cell/L to 5.8 x 10(7) cell/L within 17 days from 28 July to 14 August, contributing to 96.84-99.56% of the total phytoplankton abundance. Then, Microcystis gradually disappeared 57 days afterwards. The results showed that the growth of Microcystis, including the stage of recovery, outbreak, subsidence and disappearance, was significantly correlated with water temperature, salinity, soluble reactive phosphorus (PO4-P), dissolved inorganic nutrients (DIN), silicate (SiO4-Si), the ratio of DIN/SiO4-Si and zooplankton abundance, and the key environmental triggers which promoted the outbreak of Microcystis were water temperature, PO4-P concentration and zooplankton abundance in this artificial lagoon.					; he, peimin/ABG-4220-2021; Huo, Yuanzi/R-4840-2017	tang, chun yu/0000-0001-6922-2216; He, Peimin/0000-0003-3704-7905; 													0025-326X	1879-3363				OCT	2018	135						776	782		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.08.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.08.005								30301097					WOS:000448094200084
J	STORMER, FA; BAUER, WA				STORMER, FA; BAUER, WA			SUMMER FORAGE USE BY TAME DEER IN NORTHERN MICHIGAN	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The aspen (Populus tremuloides and P. grandidentata) cover type is one of the most important types for producing white-tailed deer (O. virginianus) in the northern Lake States, and maintaining it is the emphasis of deer habitat management there. The summer food habits, forage preferences and habitat use of tame deer in a mature aspen stand and an adjacent aspen clear-cut were studied. Aspen, beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta), strawberry (Fragaria virginiana), willow (Salix spp.) and choke cherry (Prunus virginiana) leaves and aster (Aster spp.) leaves and flowers averaged 66% of the monthly forage consumption in the mature stand and 80% of that in the clear-cut. Aspen leaves alone averaged nearly a quarter of the intake on both areas. Preferred food included red maple (Acer rubrum), aspen, beaked hazel, choke cherry leaves, the ripe fruit of brambles (Rubus spp.) and aster leaves and flowers. The deer spent equal time foraging in the mature stand and the clear-cut during June; they used the mature stand more during July and Aug. The quantity of food eaten per unit of time was greater in the clear-cut during July and Aug. Clear-cut aspen in small blocks on a 40 yr rotation would provide for an interspersion of age classes that may best meet the overall life requirement of deer on summer range.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1980	44	1					98	106		10.2307/3808355	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3808355													WOS:A1980JD80700011

This rod-shaped bacterium was motile via peritrichous flagella. Isolated strains grew optimally in 5-25 g NaCl l(-1), at pH 9.0-9.5 and at a temperature of 58degreesC and were fermentative and mainly proteolytic, utilizing peptone, Casamino acids and yeast extract. Optimal growth was seen in the presence of elemental sulfur, polysulfide or thiosulfate with concomitant reduction to hydrogen sulfide. Sulfite was also formed in an equal ratio to sulfide during reduction of thiosulfate. The novel isolate could also reduce Fe(III) and Se(IV) in the presence of organic matter.

J	Fritz, SC; Engstrom, DR; Haskell, BJ				Fritz, SC; Engstrom, DR; Haskell, BJ			Nineteenth-century climate in the Devils Lake region as reconstructed from palaeolimnological proxies - Reply	HOLOCENE												Based on historic and anecdotal evidence, Wiche et al. (1996) suggest that the Devils Lake region was cool and wet from AD 1800 until 1870. In contrast, palaeolimnological evidence suggests that the net moisture balance on a decadal to subdecadal scale was negative until about AD 1850. In part, the discrepancies in interpretation may reflect the coarser resolution of the palaeolimnological record in comparison with an annual or subannual historic record, as well as differences in interpretation that arise from comparing pulse events, such as spring floods, with annual catchment water balance, as reflected in lakewater chemistry. However, we question the reliability of several elements of the argument presented by Wiche et al. including early estimates of lake level from tree-ring data, the generalization of limited data on flood frequency to the entire 70-year period, the extrapolation of the temperature-controlled breakup of winter ice on Lake Winnipeg to moisture balance at Devils Lake, and the inference that the lake was fresh from observations in the journals of early explorers of large fish populations. The palaeolimnological interpretations at Devils Lake are consistent with the few other high-resolution palaeoecological reconstructions from the region. Although new palaeolimnological data from the northern Great Plains suggest that the 'Little Ice Age' interval may not have been more arid than the preceding millennium, as we had originally speculated, we have no reason at present to question our interpretation of aridity in the first half of the nineteenth century.

The distributions of DGT-labile Fe and S indicated that microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) and microbial iron reduction (MIR) exhibited an intense competitive relationship and temperature-dependent behavior. Thus, in addition to the expected MSR, MIR is an important or even predominant biogeochemical process for organic matter (OM) mineralization in this Fe-rich mangrove coast. Labile Fe, S, and P distributions and variations demonstrate that Fe redox cycling plays a crucial role in regulating P behavior and P cycling. An additional new finding is that the flux of labile S in the intertidal zone increases during flood tides and decreases during ebb tides, indicating that the formation and reoxidation of sulfide in surface layers are regulated by tide-induced redox changes. The net P flux associated with recirculated seawater was estimated to range from -0.306 +/- 0.001 to 0.343 +/- 0.013 mmol m(-2) d(-1) in the winter survey, suggesting that sediment porewater tends to be a P source in the subtidal zone and a P sink in the intertidal zone for the overlying seawater in winter. The continuous accumulation of labile P in surface sediment could be intensively released into the overlying seawater through prevailing MIR process in the subsequent riverine flood season, which may promote eutrophication of the adjacent Xiamen Bay.

Radiocarbon and thermoluminescence age estimates indicate eolian activity late in the last glacial cycle ca. 20,000-12,000 yr B.P. and subsequent episodes of dune reactivation at ca. 6000, 4500 and 1000 yr B.P. Pollen analysis from aggraded buried soil A horizons show a shift from grasses and shrubs to goosefoot, a disturbance indicator. The association of maximum goosefoot levels with the coarsest part of the buried A horizon immediately prior to burial by eolian sand indicates a substantial reduction in grass and dominance of shrubs with onset of eolian activity. The vegetation change and eolian depositional sequence indicates a reduction in plant coverage with regional drought, possibly augmented by bison grazing and surface heating effects. We infer an increase in summer monsoonal precipitation between 13,000 and 9000 yr B.P. reflecting a heightened land-to-sea temperature gradient associated with rising summer solar-insolation values and a meltwater cooled Gulf of Mexico. Dune reactivation in the middle and late Holocene appears to be independent of summer insolation values, but rather reflects a small (<10 degrees) easterly shift of the Bermuda High and western ridge aloft, difficult parameters to link to a cause and to resolve with climate models.

Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses and behavioural trials were conducted on eleven Hyalella azteca populations and one population of H. montezuma from lakes and springs across northern Arizona, U.S.A. Genetic distances among populations were calculated based on fifty-five RAPD markers. 2. A cluster analysis indicated two genetic lineages among the Hyalella populations. One group consisted of populations inhabiting lakes with submerged vegetation, while a second group consisted of populations that clung to roots of emergent vegetation. Behaviour also diverged between these two groups in laboratory trials: amphipods from the submerged vegetation lineage spent significantly more time swimming than did those from the emergent vegetation lineage. 3. Based on patterns in genetic distance data, it is suggested that a xeric landscape may promote diversity among passively dispersed invertebrates.

The evaporation of the lake waters is likely to be minimal, and thus the isotopic composition of the lake waters recorded by the delta(18)O(diatom) reflects the isotopic composition of summer precipitation. Overall the delta(18)O(diatom) signal seems to record a predominance of the polar Arctic air mass bringing cold summer air temperatures immediately after the last glaciation and again after 4000 years to present time. The Atlantic maritime air mass is likely to have supplied warm summer rainfall especially in the mid Holocene. The pattern is broadly consistent with a quantitative pollen reconstruction from Chuna Lake which suggests higher mean July temperatures from deglaciation to 5500 years BP with a rather steep decline to lower temperatures after 4000 years BP. Our results support the general regional scenario of a mid Holocene warm period deduced from the higher tree line, vegetation changes and glacier fluctuations in Fennoscandia. However, the delta(18)O(diatom) record from the Kola Peninsula Suggests a relatively cold early-Holocene with a gradual shift to warmer conditions to a maximum at around 5000-4000 years BP assuming that the modern delta(precipitation)-temperature relationship has been constant throughout the Holocene.

J	THUNELL, RC				THUNELL, RC			EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN SEA DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM - AN 18,000-YEARS BP RECONSTRUCTION	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												An ecological transfer function based on the distribution of planktonic foraminifera in 66 Mediterranean and 8 North Atlantic surface-sediment samples is used to estimate sea-surface temperatures and salinities for the eastern Mediterranean during the last glacial maximum (18,000 yr B.P.). The present-day distribution of planktonic foraminifera can be explained by 4 faunal assemblages, each of which has diagnostic environmental preferences. Factor 1 is a tropical-subtropical assemblage; factor 2 is a transitional assemblage; factor 3 is a low-salinity assemblage; and factor 4 is a subpolar assemblage. The geographic distribution of these faunal assemblages reflect the variation in overlying hydrographic conditions. The 18,000-yr B.P. samples were selected based on total faunal stratigraphy, O2-isotope stratigraphy, and previously determined radiometric dates for eastern Mediterranean volcanic ash layers. Estimated temperature and salinity patterns show that the greatest change between present-day and 18,000-yr B.P. sea-surface conditions existed in the Aegean Sea and immediately south of Crete. The winter temperature anomaly (18,000 yr B.P. to present) within the Aegean Sea was 6.degree. C cooler than present. In contrast to this, the maximum summer temperature anomaly exists to the south of Crete, where sea-surface temperatures were 4% C cooler than present. Estimated sea-surface salinities also show that the greatest change occurred within the Aegean Sea, being 5.permill. less saline than present. The estimated temperature and salinity patterns seem to reflect changing drainage patterns during glacial times and the diversion of cool, low-salinity water into the Aegean Sea. The source of this glacial runoff may be large freshwater lakes that existed during this time over parts of eastern Europe and western Siberia [USSR].																			0033-5894	1096-0287					1979	11	3					353	372		10.1016/0033-5894(79)90080-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0033-5894(79)90080-2													WOS:A1979GW57500005
J	Fan, Y; Yao, X; Zhou, BT; Li, HX; Liu, M				Fan, Yi; Yao, Xiaona; Zhou, Botao; Li, Huixin; Liu, Mei			Decadal variation of the summer extreme high temperature days in northern Eurasia during 1960-2018	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Unprecedented heat waves have been demonstrated sweeping across much of the Northern Hemisphere in recent summers. However, this study reveals that for northern Eurasia (30 degrees-70 degrees N, 10 degrees-130 degrees E), significant increases in summer extreme high temperature days (EHTDs) have already commenced since the mid-1990s, with the peaks centered on the surrounding areas of the Caspian Sea and Lake Baikal. Results indicate that compared with the period of 1960-1994 (P1), during 1995-2018 (P2) high-pressure and anticyclonic anomalies occupy the areas around the Caspian Sea and Lake Baikal, thus suppressing local cloud cover and precipitation, enhancing the solar radiation and high-temperature anomalies. The anticyclonic anomaly over Lake Baikal shows a close relationship with the increasing trend of global temperature, and the anomalous anticyclone over the Caspian Sea is under the influence of the warm North Atlantic and anomalous upper-troposphere jet stream during P2. The warmer than normal North Atlantic leads to the high-pressure anomaly over the Caspian Sea by modulating the Rossby wave activity. In addition, during P2, the temperatures in the middle North Atlantic and Western Europe show greater increments than those over higher latitudes, and thus the temperature gradient enhances the westerly thermal wind, which therefore leads to an anomalous upper-level jet stream to the North of the Caspian Sea. Under this circumstance, the Caspian Sea is located to the right side of the anomalous jet exit, inducing the suppressed upward motion over there and favoring the occurrence of more EHTDs after the mid-1990s.																				2296-6463				JAN 9	2023	10								1076396	10.3389/feart.2022.1076396	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2022.1076396													WOS:000921293600001
J	Mamun, M; Kim, JY; An, KG				Mamun, Md; Kim, Ji Yoon; An, Kwang-Guk			Trophic Responses of the Asian Reservoir to Long-Term Seasonal and Interannual Dynamic Monsoon	WATER												The main objectives of the study were to determine the trophic response of the temperate reservoir to seasonal and interannual variabilities of monsoon inorganic solids and nutrients along the gradients of the morphologically complex Asian reservoir using long-term datasets between 2000-2018. Nutrient regime (total nitrogen-TN, total phosphorus-TP), total suspended solids (TSS), and chlorophyll-a (CHL-a) were primarily affected by an intensity of summer monsoon and the longitudinal structure of riverine (Rz), transitional (Tz), and lacustrine (Lz) zone. The reservoir is a nitrogen-rich system and the phosphorus content of the water was relatively low, and it had low mean N:P ratios (<40), implying a P-limiting system. The Lz was a highly P-limited zone in comparison to Rz and Tz zone during both drought (2015) and flood year (2011). The TP content was higher in the mainstem (S3) than the embankment (S4 and S6) of the reservoir due to the monsoon river inputs of the nutrients. Nonparametric Mann-Kendall tests indicated that TP decreased over the long-term years in the Rz, while it did not show any trend in Tz, Lz, IT1, and IT2. TN showed an increasing trend in Rz, Tz, Lz, and IT2 except for IT1. The empirical regression model for chlorophyll nutrients showed that CHL-a had a strong positive relationship with TP (R-2= 0.67,p< 0.01) than TN (R-2= 0.06,p< 0.01), supporting the view that algal growth in lentic systems responds to TP enrichment and TP may provide a reliable basis for predicting algal biomass. The seasonality of CHL-a and TP showed a monomodal pattern and indicates that summer TP influences summer algal growth in Tz, Lz, and IT2. The water clarity (SD) of the reservoir was significantly (p< 0.01) influenced by TP (R-2= 0.62), TSS (R-2= 0.67), and CHL-a (R-2= 0.68) rather than TN (R-2= 0.10). The non-algal light attenuation coefficient (K-na) was determined mainly by suspended solids and the monsoon hydrology. The trophic state was much higher when assessments were based on TSI (CHL-a) than on TSI (TP) and TSI (SD). TSI (CHL-a) indicated the eutrophic state of the reservoirs except for the zone of Lz during the premonsoon season. Analysis of trophic state index deviation (TSID) suggested that the blue-green algae dominated the algal community, and the effects of non-algal turbidity and zooplankton grazing were minor in the reservoir.

J	Miller, GS				Miller, GS			Mysis vertical migration in Grand Traverse Bay, Lake Michigan, observed by an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The acoustic return signal from Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) moored in Traverse Bay during a 90-day summer period showed a rapid 5-10 dB increase about 1/2 hour after sunset and a similar decrease 1/2 hour before sunrise. The pattern is characteristic of zooplankton diel vertical migration, most likely Mysis relicta. These are the first reported observations of freshwater invertibrate migrations using ADCP backscatter. A 15-20 m thick sound scattering layer also persisted throughout the summer. This layer, constrained between the 6degreesC and 10degreesC isotherms, generally followed the internal thermocline fluctuations. These backscatter data demonstrate that determining characteristics of diel migration, and monitoring zooplankton temporal and spatial variability are possible using ADCPs.																			0380-1330						2003	29	3					427	435		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70448-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70448-1													WOS:000185781700006

Water samples were collected and the hazard quotient (HQ), hazard index (HI), and water quality index (WQI) were calculated. Total average concentrations of the metals were 135.03, 80.10 and 98.34 A mu g/L in Gandaki, Indrawati and Dudh Koshi rivers, respectively. The results of HQ and HI were less than unity, suggesting a low risk of metals in the region. However, HQ for antimony (Sb) was found to be 4.4 x 10(-1), 2.1 x 10(-1) and 5.4 x 10(-1) in three river basins and HI near unity, suggesting its potential risk. Additionally, HI for Cd in Indrawati was 5.4 x 10(-1) also close to unity, suggesting that Cd could have a potential risk to the local residents and aquatic ecosystems. Further, WQI suggested that the rivers Gandaki and Indrawati fell into the excellent water quality and river Dudh Koshi fell into good water quality.

J	McGechan, MB; Vinten, AJA				McGechan, MB; Vinten, AJA			Simulating transport of E-coli derived from faeces of grazing livestock using the MACRO model	SOIL USE AND MANAGEMENT												Coliforms such as Escherichia coli and E. coli O157 are present in faeces deposited on the ground by grazing livestock, which gives rise to environmental concerns about the consequences of their transport in soil water draining to rivers, lakes, groundwater, water supplies and bathing waters. Following a similar study in relation to slurry spreading (Soil Use and Management 2003; 19, 321-330), a two-stage approach was adopted to using the dual-porosity contaminant transport model MACROto simulate processes by which E. coli microorganisms from grazing livestock (sheep) pass through the soil to receiving waters via field drains. First, model parameter values were selected to reproduce experimental measurements showing rapid flows of the organisms by macropore flow without trapping in smaller pores. However, because of the large number of parameters and likely experimental errors, the set of values chosen, although plausible, is not necessarily unique and so any predictions should be considered provisional pending validation. Second, a series of predictive simulations was carried out to test the influence of soil and weather conditions on losses to field drains during grazing. These showed that E. coli losses were influenced almost entirely by the soil water content at the time of grazing, rising to a high level during grazing in wet conditions, but low or zero under dry conditions. In contrast, rainfall at the time of grazing had almost no consistent effect, other than large losses on the occasional days with over 20 mm of rain. Overall losses for a period of grazing were generally small during summer, but rose to a high level if grazing continued into autumn, due to the increase in soil water content. This demonstrates that there would probably be substantial reductions in the environmental risks of water pollution by E. coli and other faecal microorganisms if continuous grazing were stopped around early September and replaced by grazing on dry days only.																			0266-0032	1475-2743				JUN	2004	20	2					195	202		10.1079/SUM2004254	http://dx.doi.org/10.1079/SUM2004254													WOS:000222912200014

Wolverine density, survival, and population trends in the Canadian boreal forest	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												There is limited information available on wolverine (Gulo gulo) population density and trends in the boreal forest of North America. We estimated wolverine density using spatial capture-recapture methods across 2 boreal forest study areas in Red Lake, Ontario (26,568 km(2)) and Rainbow Lake, Alberta (19,084 km(2)), Canada. We also used radio-telemetry data to estimate annual survival of adult and sub-adult wolverines and evaluated population trends with a stage-based matrix model. We used an array of run poles and live traps to detect wolverines. In Red Lake over 3 winter field seasons (2019-2022), we detected 56 individual wolverines (17 females, 32 males, and 7 unknown sex), and in Rainbow Lake over 2 field seasons (2014-2016), we detected 48 individuals (19 females, 18 males, and 11 of unknown sex). Average densities in Red Lake and Rainbow Lake were 3.64 and 6.74 wolverines/1,000 km(2), respectively. Adults and sub-adults occurred at equal abundance. Spring snow cover, roads, and industrial developments were not associated with spatial patterns of wolverine density. Most deaths occurred near roads; wolverines were killed in fur traps set along roads, by wolves using roads to travel, and by vehicles. The largest source of death was from incidental (n = 6 in Red Lake) or licensed fur trapping (n = 8 in Rainbow Lake) and we report 8 injuries from fur trapping sets. Red Lake survival estimates for adults (0.87) and sub-adults (0.86) contributed to a stable population trend. Rainbow Lake survival estimates for adults (0.66) and sub-adults (0.50) contributed to a declining population trend based on a relatively low sample of radio-days. Red Lake and Rainbow Lake combined survival estimates for adults (0.77) and sub-adults (0.73) also contributed to a declining population trend. Our survival and population modeling suggests that human-caused mortality is a significant risk to these populations. Our results can be applied to wolverine status assessments and used as benchmarks for future monitoring. Wolverine population stability or growth might be achieved by reducing incidental trapping deaths or injury and hindering human access to wolverine habitats through decommissioning or limiting development of industrial roads or other anthropogenic linear features.					; Boyce, Mark/A-2620-2014	Scrafford, Matthew/0000-0001-9971-6495; McCaw, Laura/0000-0002-6961-6693; Boyce, Mark/0000-0001-5811-325X													0022-541X	1937-2817				JUL	2024	88	5								10.1002/jwmg.22587	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.22587		APR 2024											WOS:001207471800001

Patterns in the physiological condition of three species of thrushes during autumn stopover near the south shore of Lake Ontario	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Annual migrations are energetically challenging for migratory passerines and represent a potentially stressful period of the annual cycle, particularly during brief refueling periods at stopover sites. Shoreline habitats near the Great Lakes in eastern North America support many landbird migrants; however, environmental factors-including food availability and unpredictable weather-may impact the health and physiological condition of these birds during refueling periods. The aim of this study at the Braddock Bay Bird Observatory was to use key blood metrics (plasma metabolite profiling and leukocyte counts) to assess annual and within-season variation in nutrient utilization and physiological condition of 3 species of Catharus thrushes with known variation in migration strategy and passage timing. We observed similar plasma triglyceride concentrations across species; however, glucose and uric acid were elevated in a short-distance migrant, the Hermit Thrush (Catharus guttatus). Furthermore, Hermit Thrush showed higher heterophil/lymphocyte ratios than Gray-cheeked Thrush (C. minimus) or Swainson's Thrush (C. ustulatus). Year was an important factor in all analyses exploring variables that may influence nutrient utilization or chronic stress. Our results suggest that thrushes with diverse migration strategies do not significantly differ in fat deposition patterns at the site, but end-of-season migrants may consume different resources and display increased chronic stress levels as they experience reduced food availability with the progression of autumn migration. We additionally propose that annual variation detected in this multi-year study underscores the importance of physiological condition metrics as tools for assessing yearly patterns in refueling performance at stopover sites, which is especially relevant in light of the continuing pressures of invasive species and environmental change.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				JUN	2023	135	2					210	223		10.1676/22-00088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/22-00088													WOS:001079381800009

The seasonal development of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), bacteria, rotiferans and crustacean zooplankton was studied in the epilimnion of Lake Pavin, an oligomesotrophic lake in the Massif Central of France. 2. HNF abundance varied from 0.1 to 2.5 x 10(3) mL(-1). Free-living HNF reached their highest density in spring when the copepod Acanthodiaptomus denticornis dominated the metazooplankton. They were present in low numbers when rotifers and cladocerans were numerous. 3. Attached HNF, consisting of bicoecids and choanoflagellates, were fixed to large diatoms and to the colonial cyanobacterium Anabaena flos-aquae. The abundance of attached HNF was significantly correlated to bacterial abundance, which fluctuated between 1.1 and 2.7 x 10(6) mL(-1). Highest abundance of these epiphytic protists was recorded when free-living heterotrophic nanoflagellates declined. 4. The comparison of the dynamics of heterotrophic nanoflagellates, bacteria, and the impact of zooplankton grazing suggested that prey abundance, the presence of suitable attachment sites and limited competition from the free-living forms were the main factors controlling the development of the epiphytic flagellate protists. In contrast, the low abundance of free-living forms during the period of rotiferan and cladoceran development suggests the prevalence of a top-down control by predation of the metazoopankton.					; Carrias, Jean-François/AAT-2738-2021	Carrias, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-6201-1544; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	1998	39	1					91	101		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00263.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.00263.x													WOS:000072105100008
J	Weyhenmeyer, GA				Weyhenmeyer, Gesa A.			Rates of change in physical and chemical lake variables - are they comparable between large and small lakes?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Changes over time in 16 physical and chemical variables were analysed and compared between Sweden's largest lakes, Vattern and Vanern, and 48 smaller Swedish reference lakes during spring over the period 1984-2003. The rates of changes varied substantially among lakes and among variables, and they were clearly influenced by changes in both climate and atmospheric deposition. Rates of change of variables associated with atmospheric deposition such as sulphate concentrations were dependent on lake morphometry. This also applied to the rates of change of variables associated with climate change effects in the catchment such as calcium and magnesium concentrations. However, climate change effects could also be comparable between large and small lakes. Rates of change in physical and chemical variables directly influenced by the climate via the lake water surface, e.g., surface water temperature, and variables associated with the spring phytoplankton development such as phosphate-phosphorus and nitrate-nitrogen concentrations, were similar and therefore independent of lake morphometry. This study shows that climate change effects that act via the lake surface can be of the same order of magnitude among large and small lakes, but climate change effects that act via the catchment differ substantially in large lakes.

J	Arends, D; Tedford, EW; Olsthoorn, J				Arends, Dana; Tedford, Edmund W.; Olsthoorn, Jason			Modelling the Bathymetric Influence on Ice Melt for an Idealized Ice-Covered Lake	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												Despite the high abundance of lakes that experience ice cover at some point in their seasonal cycle and the important role frozen lakes play for many communities, winter limnology remains underdiscussed compared to its summer counterpart. This paper examines the effect of bathymetry on the late-winter basin-scale circulation and the associated melt rates, which remains a knowledge gap in the literature. The modelling setup considered a symmetrical truncated cone lake shape, covered uniformly by 35 cm of ice, and idealized atmospheric warming input to simulate convection-driven mixing under ice. In the absence of Coriolis forces, the simulations indicated that bathymetry does influence under-ice flow features and, under these modelled conditions, produces a signal in the ice melting pattern. As the strength of the rotational forces increased (increasing Coriolis frequency), an anticyclonic (clockwise) gyre formed and grew, resulting in a suppression of lateral heat transport from the density currents. A transition in circulation regime occurs for Rosby number approximate to 0.15, where the ice melt pattern reversed, revealing greater melting at the lake sides due to the heat becoming trapped there. The trend of these effects was reinforced with real bathymetry data from Base Mine Lake, a pit lake located in northeast Alberta. Despite the many differences between the idealized setup and the real lake conditions, the real ice melt compared well with the simulation without Coriolis.

Slowing the Spread of Grapevine Leafroll-Associated Viruses in Commercial Vineyards With Insecticide Control of the Vector, Pseudococcus maritimus (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae)	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE												Vineyards were surveyed for grapevine leafroll-associated viruses and their insect vectors in New York State's Finger Lakes region in 2006-2008. Grape mealybug, Pseudococcus maritimus (Erhorn) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae), European Fruit Lecanium, Parthenolecanium corni (Bouche), and Cottony Maple Scale, Pulvinaria acericola (Walsh and Riley) (Hemiptera: Coccidae) were identified as vector species in this region. An increase in the incidence of Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 1 (GLRaV-1) and GLRaV-3 was observed in 8 of the 20 vineyards surveyed, which implies transmission by these insect vectors. Two of the vineyards for which a temporal increase in disease incidence was documented were then used to evaluate the efficacy of foliar applications of horticultural oil and two classes of insecticides for control of P. maritimus and for slowing virus spread over 2 years of vine protection. Delayed dormant applications of horticultural oil contributed to control of early season crawlers; however, this was not the case for control of summer populations. Applications of acetamiprid and spirotetramat achieved control in summer populations; however, spirotetramat outperformed acetamiprid in percent reduction of treated compared with control vines and in a side-by-side trial. Vines treated with spirotetramat had a lower percentage of new vines testing positive for GLRaV-1 than control vines after 2 years, while no other spray program altered the increase in incidence of GLRaV-1 or -3.

J	RODRIGUEZ, MA; MAGNAN, P				RODRIGUEZ, MA; MAGNAN, P			COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF LACUSTRINE MACROBENTHOS - DO TAXON-BASED AND SIZE-BASED APPROACHES YIELD SIMILAR INSIGHTS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We sampled the macrobenthos of three Laurentian Shield lakes to evaluate how the taxonomic structure and the size distribution (biomass spectra) of littoral communities varied (1) seasonally over the summer, (2) among lakes, and (3) in relation to substratum. Seasonal variation was limited: although total numbers differed significantly among months, the taxonomic structure (biomass) and the biomass size spectrum for each lake-year combination were relatively constant during the summer. Taxonomic structure differed significantly among lake-year combinations; substratum variables explained 55% of this variation. Biomass spectra were conspicuously bimodal for all lake-date combinations, with a main peak at 6.4-102.4 mg dry mass and a lesser peak at 0.1-0.4 mg dry mass. These spectra differ considerably from those reported previously for marine and lacustrine macrobenthos. The shape of the biomass spectrum was relatively invariant across months and lakes, which is remarkable in view of the differences in taxonomic structure, substratum, and fish species composition among lakes. This conservative pattern provides indirect evidence for structuring of littoral macrobenthic communities by size-dependent processes. The results illustrate that taxon-based and size-based approaches can emphasize strikingly different aspects of community structure.

How waterbird communities respond to seasonal and environmental factors in rice fields adjacent to a Ramsar wetland	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Natural wetlands have been lost or degraded worldwide, negatively impacting waterbird populations. However, many species have capitalised on the creation of complementary habitats such as rice fields, a common and widespread type of artificial wetland. Despite the significance of rice fields as supplementary habitats for waterbirds, few studies have explored how waterbirds use these wetlands across seasons and how they respond to different local environmental factors. We surveyed waterbird communities in rice fields near Anhui Shengjin Lake National Nature Reserve, a Ramsar site, during the rice growing periods and the post-harvest periods from 2023 to 2024, to analyse the impact of environmental factors on the metrics of community diversity. We observed 15,085 waterbirds of 33 species in the rice fields, with diversity indices that were generally higher in rice fields inside the reserve than those outside the reserve in most periods. Waterbird densities peaked during the seedling and pre-wintering periods. Species richness, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, and the densities of ducks and shorebirds were highest during the seedling period, while gull densities peaked in the flowering period. In contrast, goose densities were highest during the pre-wintering period. Rice fields with larger areas, irregular shapes, deeper water, higher drain density, and closer proximity to larger adjacent rice fields and Shengjin Lake supported higher waterbird densities and species richness. Human disturbances from main roads and settlements negatively affected waterbirds. However, during certain periods, waterbirds were attracted by human activities that may expose food resources in rice fields. These findings provide important implications for waterbird conservation in these artificial wetlands, which are of global significance given their important role in the context of worldwide wetland loss and degradations.																			0167-8809	1873-2305				NOV 1	2025	393								109778	10.1016/j.agee.2025.109778	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2025.109778													WOS:001503659500001

Through numerically solving the one order differential equations picturing the block (or fault segment) motion, the parameter charactering the fault segment motion is achieved. Finally, we find the recurrence period of strong earthquake is shorter in fast sliding velocity than that in slow one. The 0.1 mm changing of fault segment sliding velocity per year will make the several hundreds years of variation in strong earthquake recurrence period.					; Bai, Yuzhu/NOF-1942-2025; Xu, Xiwei/AAD-6098-2020	XU, Xiwei/0000-0002-8301-7347; 													1660-9336		978-3-03785-185-2				2011	66-68						37	41		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.66-68.37	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.66-68.37													WOS:000309941600008

Modern vegetation distribution and lake surface pollen assemblages suggested that the fossil pollen mainly came from local and surrounding vegetation in Gonghai Lake, which reflected the elevational changes of plant communities in study area. From 14,700 to 11,100cal. yr BP, open forests and mountain meadows dominated by shrubs and herbaceous species in surrounding area, suggesting a weak EASM with less precipitation. In the period between 11,100 and 7300cal. yr BP, bushwoods and grasses were gradually replaced by mixed broadleaf-conifer forest, first developed by pioneer species of Betula and Populus and then replaced by Picea, Pinus, and Quercus, implying an enhanced EASM and increased temperature and precipitation. During the period of 7300-5000cal. yr BP, warm-fitted trees became expanded and widespread, indicating a climax community of mixed broadleaf-conifer forest and warm and humid climate with higher temperature and sufficient precipitation and the strongest period of EASM. From 5000 to 1600cal. yr BP, Pinus pollen increased, but Quercus pollen decreased, showing the breakup of the climax community and the recession of the EASM. Since 1600cal. yr BP, under the threats of land reclamation and deforestation, forest cover sharply decreased, and mountain grass lands were developed. The EASM changes inferred from pollen record of Gonghai Lake were asynchronous to the oxygen isotope records of stalagmites from southern China. We suggest that the existence of remnant Northern Hemisphere ice sheets and relative low sea levels might hampered the northward penetration of the EASM in early Holocene, which caused the maximum monsoon precipitation to reach northern China until mid-Holocene.

The annual retention of total phosphorus of the shallow Misere predam amounted to about 60%, whereas the deeper Bavigne predam retained about 82%: for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) the annual retention rates were 4 and 54%, respectively. The different behaviour of the predams is probably due to their different flow regimes and morphology. The highest retention rates were observed during summer, when up to 90% of SRP could be retained in the Bavigne predam. The comparison of the measured removal rates of SRP with those calculated on the basis of the model proposed by Benndorf & Putz (Wat. Res. 1987 21: 829-838) shows a rather good agreement for the thermally stratified Bavigne predam, For the shallow Misere predam, the model adequately predicts the annual trends of SRP removal, but a great discrepancy is observed for the absolute values. This is probably due to the phytoplankton composition and to the release of phosphorus from the sediments in the summer period.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 1	2001	459						61	71		10.1023/A:1012548006413	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1012548006413													WOS:000173248900008

Here, we present a well-dated high-resolution pollen analysis from a 4.82-m long sediment core taken from Basomtso, in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), which depicts the regional climate changes of the past millennium. Our results show that subalpine coniferous forest was dominant around Basomtso from ca. 867 to ca. 750 cal. yr BP, indicating a warm and semi-humid climate. The timberline in the study area significantly decreased from ca. 750 to ca.100 cal. yr BP, and a cold climate, corresponding to the Little Ice Age (LIA) prevailed. Since ca. 100 cal. yr BP, the vegetation type changed to forest-meadow with rising temperatures and moisture. Ordination analysis reveals that the migration of vegetation was dominated by regional temperatures and then by moisture. Further comparisons between the Basomtso pollen record and the regional temperature reconstructions underscore the relevance of the Basomtso record from the southeastern TP for regional and global climatologies. Our pollen based moisture reconstruction demonstrates the strong multicentennial-scale link to ISM variability, providing solid evidence for the increase of monsoonal strengths over the past four centuries. Spectral analysis indicates the potential influence of solar forcing. However, a closer relationship has been observed between multicentennial ISM variations and Indian Ocean sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTs), suggesting that the variations in monsoonal precipitation over the southeastern TP are probably driven by the Indian Ocean Dipole on the multicentennial scale.

Simulations of climate effects on water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and ice and snow covers in lakes of the contiguous United States under past and future climate scenarios	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Daily water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles, and ice and snow covers (where applicable) were simulated for 27 types of small lakes (up to 10 km(2) surface area) at 209 locations in the contiguous United States under past climate (observed from 1961 to 1979) and for projected doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide (2xCO(2)) climate conditions. A verified, process-oriented, dynamic, and one-dimensional year-round lake water quality model (MINLAKE96) was applied to simulate water temperature and DO profiles continuously in daily time steps over a 19-yr simulation period. This regional lake model has no geographic constraints on the model's physical and chemical processes, but the climate forcing is a function of geographic location. Model calibration parameters and initial conditions are correlated to lake geometry, trophic state, and location. The 2xCO(2) climate scenario is projected to increase lake surface temperatures by up to 5.2 degrees C when the climate scenario projects an increase of mean annual air temperature up to 6.7 degrees C. The 2xCO(2) climate scenario is projected to increase the duration of seasonal summer stratification by up to 67 d, to shorten ice cover by up to 90 d, and to reduce the maximum ice thickness by up to 0.44 m. Under a 2xCO(2) climate scenario, lake anoxia during the period of ice cover is projected to shorten so that fish winterkill can be avoided, but the periods of hypolimnetic summer anoxia are projected to lengthen. These projected changes will have many significant effects on ecological conditions and aquatic habitats in lakes in the contiguous United States.

River networks can provide a perfect opportunity for exploring the occurrence and enrichment of ARGs and antibiotics in freshwater environments. On this basis, the abundances of four types of antibiotics (sulfonamides, quinolones, tetracyclines, and macrolides) and 13 ARGs (sul., sul.., tetA, tetB, tetO, tetW, qnrA, qnrS, qnrD, ermB, ermF, ermC, and ereA) were measured in the river networks of the west bank of the Wangyu River in China. The spatial distribution and temporal variation of these antibiotics and ARGs were characterized, and their controlling factors were analyzed. All four types of antibiotics were detected with high frequencies between 41% and 100%. Quinolone antibiotics exhibited the highest average concentration (286.53 ng/L). The concentrations of quinolones, tetracyclines, and macrolides were significantly higher in the winter than in the summer, whereas the concentration of sulfonamides was higher in wet periods than in dry periods. Of the 13 ARGs, sulI was the most abundant (1.28 x 10(5) copies per milliliter), followed by sulII and tetO (5.41 x 10(4) and 4.45 x 10(4) copies per milliliter, respectively). The canonical correspondence analysis showed that environmental factors, including dissolved oxygen, water temperature, total nitrogen, pH, and total phosphorus, had significant effects on the abundance of ARGs. sul., sul.., tetA, and tetB were significantly correlated with 16S ribosomal RNA sequences, indicating that the bacterioplankton community might affect the distribution of ARGs. The correlation heat map analysis showed that the spread of ARGs was influenced by specific bacterial groups, such as Acidobacteria and Cyanobacteria, indicating that these bacterioplankton may be the hosts of environmental ARGs.					wang, pei/MTG-1182-2025														1674-2370	2405-8106				DEC	2022	15	4					318	327		10.1016/j.wse.2022.08.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wse.2022.08.001		OCT 2022											WOS:000926095000005

The concentrations of dimethylarsenic acid [DMAA(V)] became comparable with those of inorganic forms during a stratification period. DMAA(V) increased not only in the photic zone but also in the hypolimnion, In the photic zone, an increase in DMAA(V) was observed with the yearly maximum of water temperature, In the hypolimnion, the seasonal changes in methylarsenicals differed from those in surface waters, DMAA(V) maxima appeared seasonally under sub-anoxic conditions and developed regionally at the redox boundary and above the sediment surface, The DMAA(V) concentrations increased in the initial period of oxygen depletion and just after the disappearance of anoxia, while they diminished in the anoxic hypolimnion by midsummer, The seasonal behavior of trivalent methylarsenicals, which are readily oxidized in oxic environments, was similar to that of DMAA(V). The total arsenic concentration in the surface layer rose to a maximum in late summer, Methylarsenicals did not increase in such a way that the total arsenic concentration increased during summer.

Dynamic Modelling of the Impact of Climate Change and Power Flow Management Options using STELLA: Application to the Steephill Falls Reservoir, Ontario, Canada	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												This paper presents a dynamic modelling framework for evaluating the impact of climate change and flow management options on a hydroelectric power reservoir. The model couples the HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning) rainfall-runoff model to a generic reservoir routing model. The efficacy of the model was tested on the Steephill Falls hydropower facility located in the Magpie River watershed in Northern Ontario. Both the impact of climate change and future energy demands were evaluated. Using a statistical downscaling approach, future climate under Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A1B and A2 emission scenarios was projected from the Canadian Global Circulation Model 3 (CGCM3). Both scenarios suggest a significantly increasing trend in air temperature (p < 0.001) corresponding to a 1.7 degrees C increase by the middle of the century and a 2.9 degrees C to 3.7 degrees C increase by the end of the century relative to the baseline period (1970-2000). The model performed well in simulating the inter-annual seasonal dynamics of the reservoir. Plausible climate-induced increase in runoff input into the reservoir might be counterbalanced by increased drawdown caused by increasing energy demands and water users, resulting in increased pressure to adjust lower reservoir rule curves, in-stream flow requirements downstream, or a combination of both.

Population densities for M. domesticus reached 13.4 mice ha(-1) in November 1995, and were always twice those of L. lakedownensis. M. domesticus bred throughout the year. In contrast, the breeding season for L. lakedownensis was strictly seasonal, and was restricted to the mid-year months. Numbers of M. domesticus were correlated with rainfall that fell 3-6 months previously. Similarly, numbers of L. lakedownensis were correlated with rain that fell 3 months previously. Although no significant relationship was detected between total invertebrate and mouse abundance, numbers of M. domesticus were correlated with those of lepidopteran larvae collected in pitfall traps. These data suggest that species coexistence on the island may be mediated by extreme rainfall events, and a lack of competition during low population densities.

The experimental buckets each contained 4,832.80 g of dry sediment (depth: 10 cm) and 100 L water. The phosphorus (P) fractions in the water and sediment were investigated along with the environmental factors, including pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and redox potential (ORP). The concentrations of the different forms of P in the water and sediment were lower in the submerged macrophyte groups. Submerged macrophyte uptake was the primary reason for the decrease in P in the water and sediment. At the end of the experiment, the total amounts of phosphorus accumulated by H. verticillata, V. natans, and P. crispus were 156.05 g, 282.24 g, and 115.84 g, respectively, and the three submerged macrophytes enriched P by 4.18%, 7.56%, and 3.10%. The levels of the environmental factors pH, DO, and ORP were higher in the submerged macrophyte groups than the control groups. The environmental factors had different effects on the different forms of P during growth of the submerged macrophytes. H. verticillata primarily acted on the soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) through environmental factors, while P. crispus acted on the dissolved total phosphorous, SRP, dissolved organic phosphorus, and particulate phosphorous through these factors. V. natans had a weak impact on P content in the water through the environmental factors. Hence, the transformation of P between the sediment and water was affected by environmental factors. Overall, the results of this study reveal the effects of environmental factors under submerged macrophyte growth on water purification as well as the migration and transformation of P in the sediment and on the surface and provide a theoretical basis for the ecological restoration of eutrophicated shallow lakes.																			2523-3963	2523-3971				APR	2023	5	4							111	10.1007/s42452-023-05334-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42452-023-05334-7													WOS:000951348500004
J	Liu, Z; Zhang, M; Li, Q; You, S				Liu, Z; Zhang, M; Li, Q; You, S			Hydrochemical and isotope characteristics of spring water and travertine in the Baishuitai area (SW China) and their meaning for paleoenvironmental reconstruction	ENVIRONMENTAL GEOLOGY												A method of combining hydrochemical data logging and in situ titrating with measurement of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes was used to reveal the hydrochemical and isotopic characteristics in the Baishuitai travertine scenic area of SW China. It was found that the travertine-forming springs have a very high concentration of calcium and bicarbonate, and accordingly very high CO2 partial pressures, which are not likely to be produced by biological activity in soil alone. Further analysis of the stable carbon isotopes of the springs shows that the high pressure of CO2 is mainly related to an endogenic CO2 source. That means the Baishuitai travertine is endogenic in origin. This is contrast to the commonly accepted saying that the travertine deposition in this study simply is a product of warm and humid conditions in a karst ecological environment. Rapid CO2 degassing from the water is triggered by the much higher partial pressures in water than that of the surrounding air. Consequently, as the waters flow downstream of the spring the pH increases, the waters become supersaturated with respect to calcite, and travertine is deposited. The preferential release of (CO2)-C-12 to the atmosphere results in a progressive increase of travertine delta(13)C downstream. This is concluded with a preliminary discussion of variation in travertine-forming water temperatures, according to differences in stable oxygen isotopic compositions of the travertine formed in different epochs at Baishuitai. It was found that the change in water temperature is as high as 13 degreesC, i.e., from 23 degreesC at about 2500 years B.P., to 10 degreesC at present. This may mainly reflect that the effect of geothermal source on water temperature is decreasing. The problems involved in paleoenvironmental reconstruction with endogene travertine are also discussed. They are the impacts of 'dead carbon' in radiocarbon dating and the enrichment in C-13 of travertine by endogenic CO2 and degassing of CO2 from water, which has to be considered in paleovegetation reconstruction when using delta(13)C data of the endogene carbonate deposits.

J	Dinerman, E; Dubowski, Y; Friedler, E				Dinerman, Efrat; Dubowski, Yael; Friedler, Eran			Fuel derived pollutants and boating activity patterns in the sea of galilee	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												MTBE (Methyl tert-Butyl Ether) is a fuel additive that replaced lead as an antiknock compound in internal combustion motors. Few years after its introduction, detectable levels of MTBE were found in various water bodies. MTBE has a very low taste and odor threshold and is a potential carcinogen. Another group of fuel derived toxic compounds that has been detected in water bodies is BTEX (Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene and Xylene). Boating activity and allochthonous contributions from watersheds are the major sources of fuel derived pollutants in lakes. Their concentrations in lakes thus vary as a function of boating activity intensity, lake surface area and depth, weather and wind regime, land-use in the watershed, etc. The Sea of Galilee (Lake Kinneret) is the only recreational lake in Israel and an important freshwater source. In the current study, a sampling campaign was conducted in order to quantify MTBE and BTEX concentrations in Lake Kinneret, its marinas and its main contributing streams. In addition, a boating-use survey was performed in order to estimate MTBE and BTEX contribution of recreational boating. The sampling campaign revealed that, as expected, MTBE concentrations were higher than BTEX, and that near shore (i.e., marina) concentrations were higher than in-lake concentrations. Despite the clear contribution from boating, high MTBE concentrations were found following a major inflow event in winter, indicating the importance of the allochthonous contribution. The contribution from boating during summer, as measured indirectly by in-lake concentrations, is likely underestimated due to enhanced MTBE volatilization due to strong winds and high temperatures. May September was found to be the main recreational boating season, with continued boating year round. On average, a single boat is active 23 d/y, with 84% of the watercrafts being active only during weekends and holidays. The survey further indicated that boats stay in the lake for 4.5 h on average, which conforms to the unique winds regime that limits afternoon activity due to high winds, and have an average fuel consumption of 14 L/h. The annual load of MTBE and BTEX from recreational boating in Lake Kinneret was estimated at 4430 and 6220 kg/y respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Groundwater in the Shallow Aquifer of the Jericho Area, Jordan Valley - Noble Gas Evidence for Different Sources of Salinization	CLIMATIC CHANGES AND WATER RESOURCES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA	Environmental Science and Engineering	Environmental Engineering			4th Environmental Symposium of German-Arab Scientific Forum for Environmental Studies on Climatic Changes and Water Resources in the Middle East and North Africa	OCT 07-08, 2008	Fez, MOROCCO					Arid to semi-arid conditions that generally promote water scarcity are common in many regions in the Near East. Moreover, various places in that geographic domain are affected by groundwater salinization. This challenge is also shared by the Jericho area, located on the western side of the lower Jordan Valley, about ten kilometres NW of the Dead Sea. Due to a unique hydrogeological situation in this area, the discrimination of the hydrochemical signatures of the possible sources of salinization are fuzzy. Part of the potentially salt bearing aquifer material was deposited by the high saline Pleistocene precursor of the Dead Sea, the Lake Lisan, and thus resembles the signature of known residual brines of the former lake. Brine occurrences at other locations in the area usually are connected to the western boundary fault, which is a structural element of the Dead Sea Transform system. From the study of the helium and neon noble gas isotope composition of samples from saline wells and springs at the northwestern Dead Sea shore as well as from six Jericho agricultural wells there is evidence that admixing brines are supposedly not the only source of salinization in the study area. Indeed it is shown that the highest helium excess concentrations are related to the vicinity of the border fault, where moderate salinities are already present. Wells not too far in the E of the study area but in close vicinity to Wadi Qilt produce groundwater with a noble gas composition typical for air-equilibrated surface water. This reflects significant volumes of infiltration in the rainy season due to the mountain discharge, that is mainly derived from springs in the upstream area of Wadi Qilt as well as run off. An intermediate position between the first two groups is demonstrated by the most saline groundwaters, which are found remote from the border fault in the E of the study area. This is interpreted as evidence for additional non-brine salinization input probably from the surrounding sediments of the Lisan Formation.

Novel archaea and bacteria dominate stable microbial communities in North America's largest hot spring	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Boiling Springs Lake is an similar to 12,000 m(2)p, 55 degrees C, pH 2 thermal feature located in Lassen Volcanic National Park in northern California, USA. We assessed the microbial diversity in the lake by analyzing similar to 500 sequences from clone libraries constructed using three different primer sets targeted at 16S rRNA genes and one targeted at 18S rRNA genes. We assessed the stability of the microbial community by constructing terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles using DNA extracts collected in four separate years over a 7-year period. The four most prevalent phylotypes in the clone libraries shared an average similar to 85% sequence identity with their closest cultured relatives, and three fourths of the prokaryotic sequences shared less than 91% identity. Phylogenetic analyses revealed novel lineages devoid of cultivated representatives in the Bacterial and Archaeal domains. Many detected phylotypes were related to taxonomically diverse genera previously associated with high-temperature environments, while others were related to diverse Proteobacteria and Firmicutes that would not be expected to grow within BSL conditions. All of the 18S rRNA sequences most closely matched fungi in the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota (91-99% identity). T-RFLP detected fragments corresponding to the most prevalent phylotypes detected in 16S rRNA gene libraries. The T-RFLPs from separate years were similar, and the water-derived T-RFLPs were similar to the sediment-derived (average pairwise Sorenson's similarity index of 0.74, and 0.78, respectively). Collectively, these results indicate that a stable community of diverse novel microorganisms exists in Boiling Springs Lake.

Reconstructing the precipitation seasonality during the deglaciation and Holocene, can improve our understanding of how and why precipitation seasonality changes under different climate scenarios. Here we develop an indicator of seasonal precipitation weight (growing season precipitation to annual precipitation) based on a modern pollen dataset for the central and western Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is further applied to a fossil pollen record spanning the last deglaciation and Holocene from the central TP to reconstruct long-term variations in seasonal precipitation weight. Our reconstruction result, combined with modelled data from a transient simulation, shows that changes in the precipitation seasonality associated with shifts in the atmospheric circulation systems are distinct from those in annual precipitation amount. Our results suggest that changes in the westerlies driven by the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) dominate the precipitation seasonality during the last deglaciation and the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) dominates mainly in the Holocene, and confirm the important moisture contributions of the westerlies to the early Holocene humid conditions.

J	Nowak, GM; Tabor, RA; Warner, EJ; Fresh, KL; Quinn, TP				Nowak, GM; Tabor, RA; Warner, EJ; Fresh, KL; Quinn, TP			Ontogenetic shifts in habitat and diet of cutthroat trout in Lake Washington, Washington	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Salmonids often display a series of ontogenetic shifts in habitat, and these may also be associated with changes in diet. For example, adfluvial populations rear in streams for several years and then migrate to lakes. The patterns of habitat use, trophic ecology, and movements of such populations are commonly studied during the riverine stages. The lacustrine period is typically less well known, but salmonids may play an important ecological role as lake piscivores. In Lake Washington, Seattle, Washington, cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarki are a top native piscivore and may affect the dynamics of the fish and zooplankton upon which they prey. Our objective was to study the growth, diet, and size distribution of cutthroat trout in littoral and limnetic habitats of Lake Washington, with emphasis on consumption of two of the lake's dominant pelagic planktivores: juvenile sockeye salmon O. nerka and longfin smelt Spirinchus thaleichthys. Cutthroat trout entered the lake at approximately age 2. As they grew larger, the cutthroat trout became increasingly piscivorous and tended to occupy the limnetic zone after they reached about 250 mm fork length (FL). Specifically, percentages (by wet weight) of fish in the diet of cutthroat trout increased from 22.5% for cutthroat trout smaller than 200 mm FL to over 95% for cutthroat trout larger than 400 mm FL. Fish made up a higher percentage of cutthroat trout diets in fall and winter in both the limnetic and littoral zones, and a greater proportion of fish was consumed in the limnetic zone than in the littoral zone. Variation in diet was observed among years (1995-2000), apparently reflecting the relative abundance of longfin smelt. The role of cutthroat trout both as the object of recreational fisheries and as a predator on sockeye salmon (valued in commercial and recreational fisheries) complicates management of this large, urban lake.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				MAY	2004	24	2					624	635		10.1577/M03-033.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M03-033.1													WOS:000222067500026

Here, we show a high-resolution record of grain size and pollen data from a lacustrine sediment core of Dajiuhu Lake in Shennongjia, Hubei Province, China, in order to reconstruct the paleovegetation and paleoeclimate evolution of the Dajiuhu Basin since the late Middle Pleistocene (similar to 237.9 ka to the present). The results show that grain size and pollen record of the core DJH-2 are consistent with the delta O-18 record of stalagmites from Sanbao Cave in the same area, which is closely related to the changes of insolation at the precessional (similar to 20-kyr) scale in the Northern Hemisphere. This is different from the records of the Asian summer monsoon recorded in the Loess Plateau of North China, which exhibited dominant 100-kyr change cyclicities. We suggest that the difference between paleoclimatic records from North and South China is closely related to the east-west-oriented mountain ranges of the Qinling Mountains in central China that blocked weakened East Asia summer monsoons across the mountains during glacial periods.

This is often used to assess the functional roles of wetland in biodiversity conservation. Shifting habitat and diet may be one of the survival strategies during extremely adverse conditions. Therefore, sudden changes in habitat selection may indicate the deterioration of the habitat quality, and management interventions are necessary. Siberian crane (Grus leucogeranus) became critically endangered due to loss of habitat, and is currently a global conservation focus. Every winter, more than 95% of the species' global population congregates at Poyang Lake, and feeds on tubers of Vallisneria spiralis in shallow water and mudflat habitat. In this study, we reported the first sighting of large numbers of Siberian cranes foraging at wet meadows, where they fed on a different plant, Potentilla limprichtii due to extreme scarcity of their preferred tuber. To understand how well the cranes adapted to such unusual habitat, field surveys to assess the distribution of cranes across different habitats, and food availability in each habitat were carried out in the winter of 2011. Field observations on crane behaviors at different habitats were also conducted. Results show that cranes displayed significantly different behavior patterns when using the wet meadow, compared to the crane's optimal habitat - shallow water and mudflat. Both juveniles and adults spent significantly less time foraging, and more time alerting in meadows than in shallow waters and mudflats. These results indicated that the meadow might be a suboptimal wintering ground for Siberian crane, which helped the cranes survive from extreme unfavorable conditions. To some degree, this finding alleviates the general concern over the fluctuating of its food resources which was caused by hydrological disturbances. However, more studies are needed to assess the consequences of such diet and habitat shift for crane survival.

The goal was to determine whether these characteristics differed between lakes occupied and not occupied by loons, and whether these characteristics could be used to predict the occurrence of loons on lakes. The results indicate that, in contrast to non-occupied lakes, loons frequented lakes that had significantly larger surface areas and sampling site depths. Also, these lakes were clearer, warmer and less productive. The individual best predictors of loon use of a lake, in decreasing order of importance, were lake area, iron, surface temperature and sampling-site depth.

Details of these techniques have been presented before (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2001, 35,1303-1311). Both the TN and DF methods revealed that the majority of OC pesticides declined over the 5 years of study, except endosulfan I and several of the pesticide metabolites, including dieldrin and p,p'-DDE. In comparison to studies conducted in the Great Lakes, atmospheric levels in the Arctic were less dependent on temperature, although seasonal variations were apparent. Generally, levels in the winter were lower than during the rest of the year. A notable exception was p,p'-DDE. Many compounds also showed a second minimum in concentrations during June/July and possible explanations are presented to account for this. The estimated first order half-lives for the decline in OC concentrations were generally found to be comparable or slightly longer than those obtained at temperate locations, with the exception of alpha-HCH, which displayed a much longer half-life in the Arctic (similar to17 yrs). Sporadic increases in heptachlor as well as increases in the ratio of trans- to cis-chlordane suggest episodic input of chlordanes between 1995 and 1997, especially during the winter.

J	FINLAYSON, BJ; ASHUCKIAN, SH				FINLAYSON, BJ; ASHUCKIAN, SH			SAFE ZINC AND COPPER LEVELS FROM THE SPRING CREEK DRAINAGE FOR STEELHEAD TROUT IN THE UPPER SACRAMENTO RIVER, CALIFORNIA	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												Acid mine discharges in the Spring Creek drainage, collecting behind the Spring Creek Diversion Dam, contribute large quantities of toxic Zn and Cu to the upper Sacramento River, California, USA. Ratios of Cu:Zn for the Spring Creek Diversion Dam discharge into the Sacramento River fluctuate between 1:2 during storm periods and 1:8 during dry periods. Source control and treatment of the waste for Cu removal must result in Cu:Zn ratios of 1:12 or less. Since the flows into the river of the waste and the dilution water from Shasta Lake can be controlled, dilution factors which provide for the complete protection of salmonids in the Sacramento River need to be determined and implemented. To determine these factors, long-term (60 day) and short-term (96 h) bioassays with the waste were conducted on steelhead trout (Salmo gairdneri) eggs, alevins and swim-up fry. Eggs were more resistant than alevins and fry to solutions containing Zn and Cu while solutions containing only Zn affected all stages equally. At the lower Cu:Zn waste ratio of 1:12, Cu was absent in solution at partially toxic levels and toxicity was attributable to Zn alone, while at the higher waste ratio of 1:4, Cu was present in sufficient quantities to increase the toxicity of the waste. The incipient lethal levels (10% mortality) for the period from eggs-to-fry were .12 mg/l Zn at the lower waste ratio, and .10 mg/l Zn and .011 mg/l Cu at the higher waste ratio. The incipient lethal level of control fry, those which were not previously exposed to the waste, was .03 mg/l Zn. The presence of Al and Fe in the waste apparently did not affect the toxicity of either Zn or Cu. Safe levels of Zn and Cu for steelhead trout are below .03 mg/l and .01 mg/l, respectively.																			0008-1078	2331-0405					1979	65	2					80	99																WOS:A1979HB66500002

However, these glaciers are retreating rapidly under the influence of global warming. Many studies have attempted to explain the spatial heterogeneity of glacier retreat in the TP and its impacts on local lakes, but few studies have focused on the feedback of lakes on glaciers, especially in summer with intense lake effects and glacier ablation. Using an air-lake coupled model, the potential summer climatic impacts of the lake clusters on glacier behavior over TP are investigated based on two experiments with and without the lakes. Away from the lake-rich area of Inner TP, glaciers along the Himalayas are retreating rapidly with climate warming. The most pronounced glacier ablation occurs in southeastern TP, where TP lakes reduce snowfall. However, in the Inner TP, the influence of climate warming on glaciers is partially offset by the lakes through different lake-related mechanisms. The glaciers on the Western Nyainqentanglha Range are preserved mainly by the local cooling and snowfall-increase caused by nearby Nam Co. In turn, the numerous small lakes in the Eastern Inner TP exert a cumulative effect on preserving the glaciers through cooling and moistening the atmospheric boundary layer and thus increasing snowfall. The glaciers in the western Kunlun Mountains benefit from the large-scale impacts of the TP lakes, which intensified westerlies and lead to regional temperature decrease and snowfall increase.					; Wu, Yang/HNI-3599-2023; Gao, Xiaoqing/AAE-5934-2019; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010; Wang, Mengxiao/ABD-2144-2020; Su, Dongsheng/AAI-1211-2019; 黄, 安宁/K-7473-2019	Wu, Yang/0000-0002-3477-7171; Kirillin, Georgiy/0000-0001-7337-3586; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				JUN	2023	60	11-12					3435	3454		10.1007/s00382-022-06517-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-022-06517-5		OCT 2022											WOS:000864542500002
J	Palmer, C; Brady, E				Palmer, Clare; Brady, Emily			Landscape and value in the work of Alfred Wainwright (1907-1991)	LANDSCAPE RESEARCH												Alfred Wainwright was arguably the best known British guidebook writer of the 20th century, and his work has been highly influential in promoting and directing fell-walking in northern Britain, in particular in the English Lake District. His work has, however, received little critical attention. This paper represents an initial attempt to undertake such a study. We examine Wainwright's work through the lens of the landscape values and aesthetics that, we suggest, underpins it, and by an exploration of what might be called Wainwright's 'environmental identity'. We argue that Wainwright manifests a strikingly contemporary embodied landscape aesthetic and a strongly place-attached environmental identity. We consider some possible implications of this landscape aesthetic and place attached identity, including their relation to broader environmental commitments and the possibility that the endorsement of such values may have exclusionary consequences for members of 'outsider' groups.					; Palmer, Clare/Q-9281-2019	Palmer, Clare/0000-0001-9098-5330; 													0142-6397	1469-9710				AUG	2007	32	4					397	421		10.1080/01426390701449778	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01426390701449778													WOS:000249764000001

As a lake-depocenter since the Pleistocene and surrounded by Gobi and yardang fields, it might have deposited abundant aeolian materials. Distinguishing its aeolian signature from lacustrine sediments is important for understanding the landform processes and environmental changes, which is the focus of the current study. Based on major-elements analysis, microtextures of quartz grains, and features of grain-size frequency curves and other grain-size parameters, we demonstrate the existence of aeolian component in the lacustrine sequences of a 102 m core (ISL1A). Grain-size distribution curve statistics on 60 samples from two extreme palaeoclimate environments (hyperarid and humid), as well as multi-proxies records comparison, indicate that the mode at about 40 pm represents the aeolian component and the 10-70 pm fraction of grain-size is a valid proxy of East Asian winter monsoon, and that the 70-650 pm fraction represents the intensity of dust storms. The erosive lacustrine sediments in the western Qaidam Basin and the alluvial/fluvial fans in nearby piedmont are probably important sources for these aeolian materials. The similarities of major-element data for samples from the Qaidam Basin (both lacustrine and loess), Qinghai Lake (loess), and the Chinese Loess Plateau (loess) indicate that the Qaidam Basin is a dust source for the loess in Qinghai Lake and the Chinese Loess Plateau.

Many iteroparous fishes, like lake sturgeon, may transition between spawning and non-spawning states among years in response to recent spawning history, sex, and environmental variation leading to variation in interannual spawning intervals, with strong implications for conservation and management. We combined three capture-mark-recapture datasets to jointly estimate interannual spawning state transitions in lake sturgeon of the lower Niagara River between 2011 and 2020, where temperature drives strong interannual environmental variation. Our Bayesian multi-state capture-mark-recapture model suggested interannual spawning state transitions were best explained by sex-specific responses to water temperatures during the previous spring. With higher spring temperatures, males were less likely to delay spawning, while females were more likely to re-engage in spawning after delaying. Our model thus suggests that both sexes shorten intervals between spawning years in response to warming. Conservation and management of lake sturgeon in the lower Niagara River should account for the link between spawning behavior and environmental temperature, underscoring the need to address similar questions in other long-lived imperiled taxa.					; Webb, Molly/KRR-0296-2024; Wenger, Seth/G-6594-2011; Gorsky, Dimitry/AGI-7846-2022; Osenberg, Craig/M-9904-2013	Gorsky, Dimitry/0000-0003-1708-539X; Wenger, Seth/0000-0001-7858-960X; 													0706-652X	1205-7533					2025	82								46	10.1139/cjfas-2025-0046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2025-0046													WOS:001532102600001

Principal fractions in most samples were (in order of decreasing concentration) P associated with CaCO3, residual organic P, associated with Fe and Al hydrous oxides, and P in the fulvic acid fraction. Concentrations of P in each fraction were followed at 3-wk intervals from May to October and on some additional dates at two or more sites. There were only two systematic changes in concentration over this time. The amount of P incorporated in the sedimentary biomass increased during the summer, probably at a time of high microbiological activity; this was followed by a sharp decrease and another slower increase in late summer. Available P steadily increased during the growing season, but returned to near the previous year's value 12 mo later. Dissolved P in water adjacent to the sediments showed a peak in concentration corresponding to the decrease in biomass P in midsummer. The results are consistent with a picture of P cycling in which forms of the element are first incorporated in the biomass, but are later released to the water column or to available sites on the sediment upon decomposition of the biomass.

J	KONKLE, BR; SPRULES, WG				KONKLE, BR; SPRULES, WG			PLANKTIVORY BY STUNTED LAKE TROUT IN AN ONTARIO LAKE	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The feeding habits of a population of stunted lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in Lake Louisa, Algonquin Park, Ontario, suggest that these fish are facultative planktivores in summer. Although other prey such as cyprinids and mayfly larvae were eaten, these fish fed mainly on zooplankton. They selected large cladocerans (99% of zooplankters eaten were Daphnia sp. longer than 0.9 mm), even though similar-sized copepods sometimes were more abundant in the lake. Electivities were similar for each depth stratum examined. We suggest the lake trout used all parts of the water column while foraging, and were not restricted to deep water as previously believed. However, periodic foraging excursions into the warmer summer epilimnion, low abundance of large prey, and gastric inefficiency may all contribute to the stunting of lake trout in this lake.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	1986	115	4					515	521		10.1577/1548-8659(1986)115<515:PBSLTI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1986)115<515:PBSLTI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1986E416700002

A low-frequency summer temperature reconstruction for the United States Southwest, 3000 BC-AD 2000	HOLOCENE												Temperature variability likely played an important role in determining the spread and productive potential of North America's key prehispanic agricultural staple, maize. The United States Southwest (SWUS) also served as the gateway for maize to reach portions of North America to the north and east. Existing temperature reconstructions for the SWUS are typically low in spatial or temporal resolution, shallow in time depth, or subject to unknown degrees of insensitivity to low-frequency variability, hindering accurate determination of temperature's role in agricultural productivity and variability in distribution and success of prehispanic farmers. Here, we develop a model-based modern analog technique (MAT) approach applied to 29 SWUS fossil pollen sites to reconstruct July temperatures from 3000 BC to AD 2000. Temperatures were generally warmer than or similar to those of the modern (1961-1990) period until the first century AD. Our reconstruction also notes rapid warming beginning in the AD 1800s; modern conditions are unprecedented in at least the last five millennia in the SWUS. Temperature minima were reached around 1800 BC, 1000 BC, AD 400 (the global minimum in this series), the mid-to-late AD 900s, and the AD 1500s. Summer temperatures were generally depressed relative to northern hemisphere norms by a dominance of El Nino-like conditions during much of the second millenium BC and the first millenium AD, but somewhat elevated relative to those same norms in other periods, including from about AD 1300 to the present, due to the dominance of La Nina-like conditions.					; Kohler, Tim/GSN-2779-2022	Gillreath-Brown, Andrew/0000-0002-2272-5542; Bocinsky, R.

A theory for the lateral falling mechanism of plunging was developed for inflows when the initial densimetric Froude number (Fr-0) is slightly larger than unity. The ratio of the river width to the offshore extent of the plunge region was equal to Fr-0. The mixing ratio in the plunge region was 0.06. Theoretical results were quantitatively consistent with the length scale and mixing ratio of the observed plunge region. The progression of the inflow was interpreted as: initially a laterally falling plunge region with little mixing; followed by a steep underflow region with substantial mixing; and finally an intrusion. The intrusion was at first controlled dynamically by an inertia-buoyancy force balance. Further from the liftoff point, turbulent mixing effects dominated over those due to inertia. Ultimately, the intrusion diffused into the adjacent layers in such a way that the interflow fluid was effectively indistinguishable from the lake water.					; Marti, Clelia/H-5371-2014	Hogg, Charlie/0000-0002-1974-6705; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2013	58	2					579	592		10.4319/lo.2013.58.2.0579	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2013.58.2.0579													WOS:000317954300013

Somatic energy content (kJ . g(-1) wet wt) of fasting captives declined at a rate of 23 J . g(-1) wet wt per day from 1 December 1995 to 25 January 1996 (56 days) at a mean temperature of 6.6 degrees C. In another observation, fish captured on 1 December 1995 and held without feeding until 1 April 1996 (122 days) had an average WBEC that changed from 5.2 to 3.2 kJ . g(-1) wet wt during captivity at about 5.2 degrees C. Fish that died during fasts had WBEC values ranging from 2.8 to 3.6 kJ . g(-1) wet wt. During March 1996 the WBEC of field collected age-0 herring averaged 3.8 kJ . g(-1), with approximate to 40% having WBEC less than or equal to 3.6 kJ . g(-1) wet wt. Thus, by March the average recruit had used most of its stored energy. These observations confirm that in the northern Gulf of Alaska region age-0 herring rely heavily on stored energy to survive their first winter.

J	Dominiak, BC; McLeod, LJ; Landon, R				Dominiak, BC; McLeod, LJ; Landon, R			Further development of a low-cost release method for sterile Queensland fruit fly Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) in rural New South Wales	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE												Sterile Queensland fruit fly (QFF) Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) were released using a pupal-release technique in part of Wagga Wagga. Between August 1997 and May 1998, sterile flies were released using initially sand and later vermiculite mediums in the bed technique. A total of 234.16 million pupae were delivered, with an overall emergence rate of 41.4% and male recapture rate of 0.0365% based on emerged flies. A male recapture rate of 0.0141% was calculated from the male pupae deployed, not corrected for emergence. Released sterile flies were recaptured up to 74 days after release. Of the 16563 males recaptured, 99.3% of sterile flies were trapped within 1 km of release sites. The CLIMEX model was used to rank the climate at Wagga Wagga to better understand emergence and recapture rates during this and earlier programs. CLIMEX indicated that the 1997-98 year was hotter and drier than both the 2 previous years and the long-term average. The Meats daily survival rate decrement formula was also used to compare quality of sterile flies. Results from previous suppression programs were compared using these parameters. In winter 1998 at Junee, pupae were deployed in foam eskies where emergence varied from 0 to 29%, with CLIMEX Cold Stress at an average of 481. Emergence occurred over a 4-week period. In the 1998-99 summer at Lake Cargelligo, sterile flies were deployed using the pupal-release technique. Foam containers replaced the metal trays from the previous season to afford better insulation from the heat. The average emergence rate was 64% for the program. A male recapture rate of 0.071% was calculated from the 9.12 million pupae deployed or 0.11% from the estimated emerged males. An overflooding ratio of 3.2 was achieved for the season, with some apparent suppression of wild fly populations. The last recaptured sterile fly was trapped 77 days after the final release. CLIMEX, with and without irrigation, was used to assess the suitability of Lake Cargelligo and surrounding rural areas for QFF survival.

Investigation of the Long-Term Trends in the Streamflow Due to Climate Change and Urbanization for a Great Lakes Watershed	ATMOSPHERE												Climate change and rapid urbanization could possibly increase the vulnerability of the Great Lakes Basin, Canada, which is the largest surface freshwater system in the world. This study explores the joint impact of climate change and land-use changes on the hydrology of a rapidly urbanizing Credit River watershed which lets out into Lake Ontario 25 km southwest of downtown Toronto, Ontario (ON), Canada; we began by classifying the watershed into urban and rural sections. A non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and the Sen slope estimator served to detect and describe the annual-, seasonal-, and monthly-scale trends in the climate variables (temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration), as well as the streamflow characteristics (median annual streamflow, baseflow, Runoff Coefficients (RC), Flow Duration Curve (FDC), Center of Volume (COV), and Peak Over Threshold (POT)) since 1916 for four rural and urban sub-watersheds. The temperature, precipitation and evapotranspiration (1950-2019) showed significant increasing trends for different months and seasons. Furthermore, the results indicated that the median annual streamflow, 7-day annual minimum flow, and days above normal are increasing; meanwhile, the annual maximum streamflow is decreasing. A total of 230 datasets were tested for their trends; of these, 80% and 20% increasing and decreasing trends were obtained, respectively. Of the total, significant trends (<0.05%) of 32% and 2% increasing and decreasing, respectively, were observed. The results of the FDC analysis indicated a decline in the annual and winter 10:90 exceedance ratio over the years for the rural and urban sub-watershed gauges. The BFI results show that the BFI of the rural areas was, on average, 18% higher than that of the urban areas. In addition, the RC also showed the influence of land-use and population changes on the watershed hydrology, as the RC for the urban gauge area was 19.3% higher than that for the rural area gauge. However, the difference in the RC was the lowest (5.8%) in the summer. Overall, the findings from this study highlight the annual, seasonal, and monthly changes in the temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and streamflow in the watershed under study. Based on the available monitored data, it was difficult to quantify the changes in the streamflow over the decade which were attributable to population growth and land-cover use and management changes due to municipal official planning in the watershed.					; Rudra, Ramesh/AAA-7267-2022; Ahmed, Syed Imran/IAQ-3608-2023	Goel, Pradeep/0000-0002-0695-5321; 														2073-4433				FEB	2022	13	2							225	10.3390/atmos13020225	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos13020225													WOS:000763797500001

Zooplankton in the Murray estuary and Coorong during flow and no-flow periods	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA												From 2001 to 2010, River Murray flows were extremely low because of drought and over allocation. Barrage releases to the Murray Mouth were small and intermittent, with an extended period of closure and no flow from December 2001 to September 2003 and from February 2006 to November 2010. We studied the zooplankton communities in the Murray estuary and Coorong North Lagoon from 2003 to 2008 to identify the distribution and abundance of zooplankters in flow and no-flow periods, to compare zooplankton communities to those in other Australian estuaries and to consider the role of zooplankton in trophodynamics. Most of our samples were taken with a 59 mu m net. In September/October, 2003 a barrage release brought freshwater zooplankters into the Murray estuary. By November and December, salinities had risen and only estuarine and hypermarine species were collected. In the spring/summer of 2004/05, salinities ranged from 16 to 88 parts per thousand (ppt) and a limited estuarine/hypermarine community was present. By 2007/08, salinities had risen to be 35-130 ppt and the distribution of the estuarine/hypermarine community was restricted and the Australian brine shrimp Parartemia zeitziana was collected. Overall, the zooplankton community was of low diversity compared to other estuaries in south-east Australia and lacked several of the common copepods. Rotifers, especially Synchaeta spp., were well represented especially in the hypermarine regions. The diversity and abundance of zooplankters was the highest during the period of River Murray outflow. The low abundance of adult calanoid copepods during the no-flow period might suggest that large bodied individuals were removed by high fish predation. The abundance of copepodites and nauplii shows that small mesh nets are required to see the complete zooplankton community and also that copepodites and nauplii can be surprisingly abundant when adults are rare.																			0372-1426	2204-0293				MAY	2016	140	1					74	89		10.1080/03721426.2016.1151497	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03721426.2016.1151497													WOS:000372891500007

This paper explores whether the sedimentary diatom record from Sanjiaolongwan Maar Lake (SJML), northeastern China, reveals variations in seasonal pattern over the past 1000 years. The observed succession in diatom assemblages reveals that between 980 and 1310 CE the small-celled planktonic diatom Discostella pseudostelligera was abundant. Its relative abundance peaked during 1020-1060 CE, indicating that the duration of summer conditions over this interval was the longest within the last millennium. By contrast, the interval between 1470 and 1850 CE was marked by an increase in benthic diatoms pointing to a shortened duration of the ice-free season, and generally cold conditions. During the twentieth century warm period, the succession of eutrophic diatoms and changes in diatom cell size also reveal temperature-controlled seasonal variations in limnological conditions. The differences observed between the diatoms assemblages associated with the two warm periods indicate that the summers of the warmest part of the Medieval Climate Anomaly were longer than that of the current warm period. This result is supported by the diatom record from Erlongwan, another maar lake in the region that differs from SJML by its topographic features and in the level of human impact on its catchment.					; Wang, Luo/A-1430-2009; Zhang, Wenxu/K-1823-2017; Rioual, Patrick/H-5140-2018	Zou, Yafei/0000-0002-7605-4115; Rioual, Patrick/0000-0001-9491-9197; LI, JIE/0009-0001-1924-0210													0921-2728	1573-0417				JUN	2022	68	1			SI		133	154		10.1007/s10933-021-00228-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-021-00228-3		FEB 2022											WOS:000753917800001

Characterization of Bacteria Isolated from Landlocked Fall Chinook Salmon Eggs from Lake Oahe, South Dakota	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												Bacteria were isolated from the eggs of landlocked fall Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha prior to initial placement in vertical-flow incubations trays 4h after spawning and also 27 d later at the early eyed egg stage of development. Bacterial densities on the eggs after iodophor disinfection and just before being placed in trays were very low, and most isolates were gram-positive, nonfermenting cocci. In contrast, bacterial densities on eggs at incubation day 27 exceeded 1 x 107 CFU/egg and were dominated by slow-growing, gram-negative coccobacilli. Pseudomonas spp., as well as Flavobacterium (closely related to F. johnsoniae) were also present. Most Pseudomonas and Flavobacterium isolates produced extracellular proteases, making them candidates for further investigation into their possible contribution to egg mortality.

Up to 47% of the P. gelidicola population ingested fluorescently labeled prey (FLP). Ingestion rates varied with depth. In January 1997 and November 1999, maximum P. gelidicola ingestion rates of 6.95 and 0.79 FLP.cell(-1) .h(-1) , respectively, were measured at the chemocline (6-8 m) where a deep chl maximum composed of phototrophic nanoflagellates (PNAN DCM), predominantly P. gelidicola , persisted all year. During the summers of 1997 and 1999, the grazing P. gelidicola community removed between 0.4% and approximately 16% of in situ bacterial biomass, equivalent to between 4% and>100% of in situ bacterial production. Because of their higher abundance, the community clearance rates of HNAN in Ace Lake generally exceeded those of P. gelidicola , but HNAN removed approximately only 3%-4% of bacterial biomass, equivalent to between 28% and 32% of bacterial production. Pyramimonas gelidicola growth rates were highest at the PNAN DCM concomitant with the highest ingestion rates. It is estimated that during the summer P. gelidicola can derive up to 30% of their daily carbon requirements from bacterivory at the PNAN DCM. This study confirms mixotrophy as an important strategy by which planktonic organisms can survive in extreme, polar, lacustrine ecosystems.																			0022-3646					AUG	2003	39	4					644	649		10.1046/j.1529-8817.2003.02152.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1529-8817.2003.02152.x													WOS:000184451100003

These processes can be amplified by the effect of climate warming on thermal stratification in lakes. This study aimed to assess how metabolic disruptions affect carbon sources and pathways in lake pelagic food webs, focusing on methanogenic carbon. The studied lakes showed strong seasonal variations of carbon source availability and transfers to pelagic food webs, characterized by increased methanogenic carbon transfers to Daphnia populations in winter. The magnitude of these winter transfers seems to largely depend on the amount of methane stored in the hypolimnion during the stratification period, and thus on the amount of methane released with autumnal turnover. Methane production, storage and transfer mechanisms partly depend on thermal stratification intensity, but also on external factors such as land use. This study provides new insights into the impacts of global changes on the sources and pathways of carbon in pelagic food webs through their influence on lake metabolism and thermal regimes. These functional changes may lead to greater production and release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.					; Millet, Laurent/F-8730-2014; Masclaux, Helene/S-1265-2017	Essert, Valentin/0000-0002-3197-7397; Masclaux, Helene/0000-0002-5869-8419; Millet, Laurent/0000-0003-2050-206X													1195-6860	2376-7626				OCT 2	2022	29	4					293	310		10.1080/11956860.2022.2094630	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2022.2094630		JUL 2022											WOS:000821747400001

Correlation analysis indicates that the tree-ring width reflects growing-season moisture variability. Our chronology reveals three distinct periods based on the prevailing moisture anomalies: A.D. 775-1101 (wetness persistence), 1101-1831 (dryness persistence) and 1831-2006 (wetness persistence). A 31-year running mean through the tree-ring index series clearly shows seven obvious dry spells and eight wet spells. Compared with the proxies associated with the East Asian monsoon and the westerlies in the past millennium, our moisture-sensitive tree-ring chronology revealed that the East Asian summer monsoon had a strong influence on tree growth before A.D. 1300. From about A.D. 1450-1750, the westerlies strongly affected the Qilian Mountains. After A.D. 1750, a combined influence of both East Asian monsoon and westerlies was apparent. In the past century, the effect of westerlies has become stronger. Our results suggest that tree rings can preserve the information on the advance and retreats of the westerlies and the East Asian summer monsoon. Additionally, this research is helpful for understanding the driving mechanism of the Asian monsoon and the westerlies in northwestern China over the past thousand years.					peng, jianfeng/HRD-0096-2023; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011	Yang, Mei-Lin/0000-0001-8102-2161; Chen, Fahu/0000-0002-8874-1035; 													0928-1541	2294-1932					2009	30	4					407	420		10.1163/22941932-90000228	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/22941932-90000228													WOS:000272529300006

Water quality and restoration in a coastal subdivision stormwater pond	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Stormwater ponds are commonly used in residential and commercial areas to control flooding. The accumulation of urban contaminants in stormwater ponds can lead to a number of water quality problems including high nutrient, chemical contaminant, and bacterial levels. This study examined the interaction between land use and coastal pond water quality in a South Carolina residential subdivision pond. Eutrophic levels of chlorophyll and phosphorus were present in all seasons. Harmful cyanobacterial blooms were prevalent during the summer months. Microcystin toxin and fecal coliform bacteria levels were measured that exceeded health and safety standards. Low concentrations of herbicides (atrazine and 2,4-D) were also detected during summer months. Drainage from the stormwater pond may transport contaminants into the adjacent tidal creek and estuary. A survey of residents within the pond's watershed indicated poor pet waste management and frequent use of fertilizers and pesticides as possible contamination sources. Educational and outreach activities were provided to community members to create an awareness of the water quality conditions in the pond. Pond management strategies were then recommended, and selected mitigation actions were implemented. Water quality problems identified in this study have been observed in other coastal stormwater ponds of varying size and salinity, leading this project to serve as a potential model for coastal stormwater pond management.

J	McDaniel, M; Zielinska, B				McDaniel, Mark; Zielinska, Barbara			Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the Snowpack and Surface Water in Blackwood Canyon, Lake Tahoe, CA, as Related to Snowmobile Activity	POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC COMPOUNDS												Snowpack in alpine environments may contain appreciable levels of regional pollution acquired through natural processes of wet and dry deposition, as well as from immediate sources such as snowmobile engine exhaust. Understanding the fate and transport of pollutants in alpine environments is a crucial step towards managing emission sources in alpine terrain to mitigate their impacts on natural resources. This study presents detailed chemical analysis for 94 species of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in 55 samples of snow and surface water collected in Blackwood Canyon, a tributary to the west shore of Lake Tahoe that is a popular winter recreation area for snowmobile riders. Analyses included toxic and persistent PAH, emitted as products of incomplete combustion and useful for identifying fossil fuel combustion emissions in the environment. Average background snow PAH concentrations were used to estimate background PAH surface loading (mu g.m(-2)). Loadings in excess of the estimated background are mapped and compared with observations of snowmobile activity to determine effects of snowmobile emissions on snow water quality. Loading of heavy PAH, those having three or more aromatic rings, in snow was found to be significantly greater than background loading (alpha = 5%) where snowmobile tracks cover more than 50% of the snow surface. Loadings were 8-20times greater than background levels where snowmobile traffic was most concentrated over snow covered roads. PAH were also measured in snow melt and surface water samples in Blackwood Canyon for comparison with snow samples. Flux of PAH (g.day(-1)) from Blackwood Creek into Lake Tahoe was calculated and compared to estimates of background flux, increasing from 74g.day(-1) to 480g.day(-1) over an 8-day period during spring run-off.																			1040-6638	1563-5333				JAN 1	2015	35	1			SI		102	119		10.1080/10406638.2014.935449	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10406638.2014.935449													WOS:000344866600009

The .delta.34S values for S isotopes range from around +4.permill. in the fresh water to +19 to +23.permill. in the saline springs. The regular increase in 34S/32S with salinity is explained by a mixing model between rainwater-derived groundwater (.delta.34S = 4-9.permill.) and slightly evaporated seawater (.delta.34S around +21.permill.). The isotopic evidene argues against derivation of sulfate from oxidation of igneous or sedimentary sulfide, and the sulfide that occurs in the saline springs may originate from bacteriogenic reduction of marine-derived sulfate at depth.																			0013-936X	1520-5851					1978	12	8					962	965		10.1021/es60144a004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es60144a004													WOS:A1978FJ40000022

Spatial Overlap, Proximity, and Habitat use of Individual Wolves Within the Same Packs	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Packs are the basic social and breeding groups of wolf (Canis spp.) populations and are often the sampling unit for wolf research. Researchers commonly assume, either explicitly or implicitly, that telemetry data from >= 1 individual wolf can be used to represent the space use, distribution, presence, and resource selection of the pack. We tested these critical assumptions using Global Positioning System telemetry by directly comparing home range size, probability of spatial overlap, seasonal proximity, and habitat use of individuals within wolf packs in central and northern Ontario, Canada, 2006-2010. Space use was similar and probability of overlap was high for wolves within packs for individual 95% home-range contours. Variation was greater for 50% contours, indicating that individual wolves may use space differently within territories. Wolves within packs spent more time <100m and <1 km from each other during winter ((x) over bar = 66 and 75%, respectively) than during other seasons ((x) over bar = 33 and 40%, respectively) supporting earlier findings that pack cohesion was highest during winter. Individuals within all packs exhibited differences in the use of specific resource variables when separated by >100 m. Use of habitat variables was more similar when we compared resource selection of individuals within packs using all locations (regardless of proximity), although we still detected differences within most packs. Our results suggest that telemetry data from individual wolves can be used to reliably estimate territories for packs, but that researchers should be cautious when making pack-level inferences regarding finer scale space and habitat use within home ranges based on data from individual animals.

We present a dual ensemble workflow coupling climate models with lake models. We used a large set of simulations across multiple domains, multi-scenario, and multi GCM- RCM combinations from CORDEX data. We forced a set of multiple hydrodynamic lake models by these multiple climate simulations to explore climate change impacts on lakes. We also quantified the contributions from the different models to the overall uncertainty. We employed this workflow to investigate the effects of climate change on Lake Sevan (Armenia). We predicted for the end of the 21st century, under RCP 8.5, a sharp increase in surface temperature (4.3 +/- 0.7K) $(4.3\pm 0.7\,\mathrm{K})$ and substantial bottom warming (1.7 +/- 0.7K) $(1.7\pm 0.7\,\mathrm{K})$, longer stratification periods (+55 days) and disappearance of ice cover leading to a shift in mixing regime. Increased insufficient cooling during warmer winters points to the vulnerability of Lake Sevan to climate change. Our workflow leverages the strengths of multiple models at several levels of the model chain to provide a more robust projection and at the same time a better uncertainty estimate that accounts for the contributions of the different model levels to overall uncertainty. Although for specific variables, for example, summer bottom temperature, single lake models may perform better, the full ensemble provides a robust estimate of thermal dynamics that has a high transferability so that our workflow can be a blueprint for climate impact studies in other systems.					; Mi, Chenxi/S-1612-2018; Feldbauer, Johannes/NHP-9703-2025; Schultze, Martin/D-4985-2015; Shatwell, Tom/ABF-1308-2020; Rinke, Karsten/E-6163-2016; Mercado-Bettin, DANIEL/HPF-6131-2023; Gevorgyan, Artur/HSI-1776-2023	Feldbauer, Johannes/0000-0002-8238-5375; Mi, Chenxi/0000-0003-2323-1832; Shikhani, Muhammed/0000-0003-3558-4328; Schultze, Martin/0000-0003-3526-2919; Boehrer, Bertram/0000-0001-6253-6634; Ladwig, Robert/0000-0001-8443-1999; Mercado-Bettin, Daniel/0000-0003-4572-3029; Gevorgyan, Artur/0000-0003-1220-3617; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				NOV	2024	60	11							e2023WR036511	10.1029/2023WR036511	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023WR036511								39582854					WOS:001370328800001

Daphnia lumholtzi was an important prey item for silversides during summer when large native zooplankton was scarce.

The predicted slope of the TP-Chl relationship (Chl:TP) ranged between 0.22 at TP = 50 mg . m(-3) and 0.08 at TP = 1030 mg . m(-3), the highest value of TP in our data set. A bivariate model indicated that stream catchment area had a significant effect on Chi at all levels of TP and predicted a 2.3-fold increase in Chl:TP as the stream catchment area increased from 100 to 100 000 km(2). We suggest that TP may provide a reliable basis for predicting Chi in small and large temperate streams worldwide.																			0706-652X					JAN	1996	53	1					99	105		10.1139/f95-166	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-166													WOS:A1996UB97900010

When such a mesoscale event propagates a distance large enough that the viewing angle from a single-Doppler radar changes by about 30 degrees and the circulation is sufficiently steady during this time period, then the SDD method can reveal reliable details about the circulation. One such detail of the observed vortex was a pattern of convergence and divergence associated with radial bands, where heavier snowfall was located. Another was the steadiness and vertical coherence of the derived vorticity and convergence patterns within the cyclonic circulation On 5 December 1997. the observed reflectivity field remained remarkably steady for nearly 2.5 h as the vortex moved southeastward allowing for the application of the SDD technique. The reflectivity field exhibited a pronounced asymmetric convective structure with at least three well-defined, inward-spiraling radial snowbands, and a distinct weak-reflectivity region or "eye" near the center of cyclonic circulation. The SDD results showed the vortex circulation was composed of a combination of rotation on the meso-beta scale and convergence on the meso-gamma scale associated with the embedded radial snowbands. Vertical profiles of derived meso-beta -scale. area-mean convergence and vorticity suggest that this winter vortex was likely a warm-core system, similar to both tropical cyclones and polar lows.

Uranium and arsenic contamination in the former Mondego Sul uranium mine area, Central Portugal	JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION												The abandoned Mondego Sul uranium mine exploited quartz veins containing sulfides, torbernite, metauranocircite, saleeite, meta-saleeite and Fe-oxides and hydroxides and intersected the schist-greywacke complex. The exploitation was carried out in five open pits and produced 74,968 kg U3O8 from 1987 to 1991. From July 2008 until now we observed that a lake had formed in one left open pit. Three dumps slightly covered by vegetation were located in steep slopes and streams and drainage water ran to a dam reservoir. Water, stream sediments and soils were contaminated in U and As. Uranium sulfate minerals were the most important contaminants of water, because U was positively correlated with SO42- in water. However, Fe-oxyhydroxides were the main retention minerals in soils, as U was positively correlated with Fe in soils. The Fe-Mn hydr(oxides) precipitate in streambeds retained a higher U concentration and a lower As concentration than stream sediments. Uranium and As were mainly retained in montmorillonite of stream sediments. Uranium concentration was up to 181 mu g/L in water, 266 mg/kg in stream sediments and 377 mg/kg in soils. The highest U concentration in water was reached at the beginning of spring, because the highest flow caused leaching of mineralized quartz veins, tailings and dumps and U from secondary minerals was released into water. The pH of water from the open pit was acidic and UO22+ was up to 50%, but drainage water from the largest dump was acidic to alkaline and had up to 88% UO2CO3.

J	Hart, RC				Hart, RC			Two calanoids, two lakes, and a decade or two. An updated record and evaluation of occurrence and periodicity of Tropodiaptomus spectabilis and Metadiaptomus meridianus (Copepoda: Calanoida), and alternative stable states in two cascading impoundments	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Episodic switching between Tropodiaptomus spectabilis and Metadiaptomus meridianus in L. Midmar (29 degrees 30' S, 30 degrees 12' E), and transitory seasonal alternation of these taxa in L. Albert Falls (29 degrees 26' S, 30 degrees 26' E) recorded in comparative studies of these inter-leading reservoirs between 1989 and 1999, along with historical records for Midmar extending back to 1978, are updated and re-evaluated in light of subsequent and additional findings. In the longer term, an `exclusive' occupancy by one or another species has been maintained in these and other inter-leading impoundments on the quasi-subtropical Mgeni River. Sympatry was invariably transitional. It lasted several months in the upper Midmar system, and where protracted over several years as in the downstream Albert Falls system, was effectively negated by seasonal separation of the taxa. Possible influences of parasitism, changes in water turbidity or pH, dependent or independent of inter-basin water transfers, and such water transfers themselves, are explored and rejected as proximate causes of species replacement. Because evidence for the existence of resting eggs was contradictory (respectively present and absent in preserved and live samples), emergence from diapause is considered an unlikely source of re-colonisation. The guild complement of invertebrate planktivores is comparable in both lakes, seemingly removing predation as a determinant factor. The comparability of food thresholds for various measures of demographic performance suggests remarkable similarity in the competitive potential of these species, which additionally show considerable niche overlap in terms of adult diet, and comparable vulnerability to ellobiopsid parasitism. Ecological separation is thus limited to differentiation of thermal optima, functional feeding biology of juvenile stages - especially nauplii, and sediment tolerance. Evidence now available supports previous arguments that species separations remain attributable largely to marginal species differences in thermal optima, mirrored in the pattern of seasonal separation during an episode of sympatry (1990 to early 1994) in the down-stream Albert Falls system. While no causal explanation can be substantiated from evidence gleaned during this decade of study, the species replacements observed in Midmar appear to reflect alternative stable states, induced by presently unknown factor(s), plausibly temperature, or improbably, human translocation. By contrast, alternative stable states are not manifest in Albert Falls, wherein the longer term, T. spectabilis seemingly represents the only stable state, a feature apparently shared by other warmer reservoirs down the Mgeni cascade. The unpredictability of chaotic dynamics precludes its analysis in this situation, while conversely, the system provides a unique model for meta-population analysis, related to uni-directionality of natural dispersal. However, the cost-effectiveness of continued monitoring for unforeseeable events poses a serious practical dilemma.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					2001	453	1-3					269	283		10.1023/A:1013157109927	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013157109927													WOS:000172600200022

Dietary plasticity in a nutrient-rich system does not influence brown bear (Ursus arctos) body condition or denning	POLAR BIOLOGY												Behavioral differences within a population can allow use of a greater range of resources among individuals. The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a generalist omnivore that occupies diverse habitats and displays considerable plasticity in food use. We evaluated whether brown bear foraging that resulted in deviations from a proposed optimal diet influenced body condition and, in turn, denning duration in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska. To assess assimilated diet, we used sectioned guard hair samples (n = 23) collected in autumn to determine stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. To index proportional contributions of meat and vegetation to assimilated diets, we compared the carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) values of hair samples with the values identified for major food categories. We then compared percentage body fat and body mass in relation to the proportion of assimilated meat in the diet using linear models. We also examined the influence of autumn percentage body fat and mass on denning duration. Percentage body fat was not influenced by the proportion of assimilated meat in the diet. Additionally, percentage body fat and body mass did not influence denning duration. However, body mass of bears assimilating proportionately more meat was greater than bears assimilating less meat. Our results provide support for previous findings that larger bears consume higher amounts of protein to maintain their body size and therefore forage further from the proposed optimal diet. Additionally, our results demonstrate that individuals can achieve similar biological outcomes (e.g., percentage body fat) despite variable foraging strategies, suggesting that individuals within generalist populations may confer an adaptive advantage through behavioral plasticity.					; Belant, Jerrold/HDM-7749-2022	Gustine, Dave/0000-0003-1087-1937; Colvin, Michael/0000-0002-6581-4764													0722-4060	1432-2056				APR	2018	41	4					763	772		10.1007/s00300-017-2237-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-017-2237-6													WOS:000428603800015

The former grows in early summer, whereas the latter grows in late summer. Levels of MIB were determined for water samples collected from Lake Biwa and the lower sampling site of Murano Water Treatment Plant's intake on Yodo River. MIB concentrations detected at the lower site differed between the two odor seasons. In the first episode due to growth of Phormidium, MIB level at the lower site was almost the same as that in the lake, whereas it was clearly lower than that of the lake in the second episode caused by Oscillatoria. No differences in flow ratio of the lake effluent to that of Yodo River were detected between the two odor seasons. Thus, the difference in MIB concentration between the lake and the lower site in the second episode may be caused by a decrease in cell-associated MIB due to the high sinking rate of Oscillatoria. The sinking rate of Oscillatoria trichome was twenty times higher than that of Phormidium.																			0273-1223						1995	31	11					139	144		10.1016/0273-1223(95)00468-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0273-1223(95)00468-3													WOS:A1995RW01400022

Measurement of their velocity can provide important information for the study of glacier mass balance and glacier involved hazards. This paper applies seven ALOS/PALSAR images and the offset-tracking method to derive the displacement field of the largest mountain glacier in Asia, i. e., the South Inylchek Glacier. The temporal continuity of SAR images and the debris coverage of South Inylchek Glacier make the offset-tracking method successfully acquire continuous surface displacements. Several natural events such as snowfall in the firn basins, ablation of superimposed ice and development of crevasses in steep sections still have some influence on the results. However, the derived surface displacement maps of different periods are highly consistent with each other. The detail analysis reveals the following rules of the South Inylchek Glacier's motion: the velocity reduces from glacier axis to both sides, and increases from its origin to snowline and then reduces towards the end; the velocity is positively and nonlinearly correlated with the slope, especially when the slope increases sharply from 1 degrees to 16 degrees, the surge velocity will give rise to crevasses on the glacier; under the influence of glacial lake level changes, the velocity of tributary at the tail can surge to 96 cm/d; the summer velocity is 5 similar to 10 cm/d higher than winter one. Seen from all results, the normal velocity of the glacier trunk is between 20 and 50 cm/d, but can reach 65 cm/d in special place. The statistics of sampling points in the tongue indicates that mean velocity of different periods lies between 27.9 and 33.3 cm/d. Compared to the record in 2004, velocity derived in this research reduces about 5 cm/d.

Case study: A tropical montane catchment	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Hydrogeochemical based mixing models have been successfully used to investigate the composition and source identification of streamflow. The applicability of these models is limited due to the high costs associated with data collection and the hydrogeochemical analysis of water samples. Fortunately, a variety of mixing models exist, requiting different amount of data as input, and in data scarce regions it is likely that preference will be given to models with the lowest requirement of input data. An unanswered question is if models with high or low input requirement are equally accurate. To this end, the performance of two mixing models with different input requirement, the mixing model analysis (MMA) and the end-member mixing analysis (EMMA), were verified on a tropical montane headwater catchment (21.7 km(2)) in the Ecuadorian Andes. Nineteen hydrogeochemical tracers were measured on water samples collected weekly during 3 years in streamflow and eight potential water sources or end-members (precipitation, lake water, soil water from different horizons and springs). Results based on 6 conservative tracers, revealed that EMMA (using all tracers) and MMA (using pair-combinations out of the 6 conservative ones), identified the same end-members: rainfall, soil water and spring water., as well as, similar contribution fractions to streamflow from rainfall 21.9% and 21.4%, soil water 52.7% and 52.3%, and spring water 26.1% and 28.7%, respectively. Our findings show that a hydrogeochemical mixing model requiring a few tracers can provide similar outcomes than models demanding more tracers as input data. This underlines the value of a preliminary detailed hydrogeochemical characterization as basis to derive the most cost-efficient monitoring strategy.					; Timbe, Edison/J-7594-2019; Correa, Alicia/ABE-5696-2020; Mosquera, Giovanny/G-9319-2017	Timbe, Edison/0000-0001-9944-9075; Crespo, Patricio/0000-0001-5126-0687; Mora-Abril, Enmita/0000-0002-1823-867X; Correa, Alicia/0000-0001-6127-2948; Mosquera, Giovanny/0000-0002-4764-4685													0885-6087	1099-1085				JUN	2021	35	6							e14209	10.1002/hyp.14209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14209													WOS:000667549500015

The goal of this paper is then to study the changes of coastal waters quality as a result of intense rainfall events during the bathing season through the use of remote sensing data. These analyses are performed at the outlets of small watersheds which are not usually affected by high sediment transport as in the case of large basins which are persistently affected by intense solid transport which does not allow retrieving a reliable correlation between rainfall events and water quality parameters. Four small watersheds in different Italian regions on the Mediterranean Sea are selected for this study. The remotely sensed parameters of turbidity, total suspend solids and secchi disk depth, are retrieved from MODIS data. Secchi disk depths are also compared to available ground data during the summer seasons between 2003 and 2006 showing good correlations. Then the spatial and temporal changes of these parameters are analyzed after intense short storm events. Increases of turbidity and total suspend solids are found to be around 35 NTU and 20 mg L-1 respectively depending on the intensity of the rainfall event and on the distance from the shoreline. Moreover the recovery of water quality after the rain event is reached after two or three days. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Dombrovsky, LA				Dombrovsky, Leonid A.			MODELING HEAT TRANSFER DURING SOLAR-INDUCED MELTING OF LAKE AND SEA ICE	COMPUTATIONAL THERMAL SCIENCES												Solar heating and ice melting on the water surface is an important geophysical problem that has attracted the attention of researchers for many years. It is essential in connection with global climate change on our planet. A simple and sufficiently accurate physical model of the process is proposed, combining analytical solutions for the solar radiation transfer in light-scattering snow cover and an ice layer with numerical calculations of transient heat transfer in a multilayer system. The boundary conditions for the heat transfer problem consider convective heat losses to the cold air and radiative cooling of the open surface in the mid-infrared window of transparency of the cloudless atmosphere. Much attention is paid to modeling the anomalous spring melting of ice covering the large high-mountain lakes of Tibet, the Earth's third pole. It was found that a thick ice layer not covered with snow starts to melt at the ice-water interface due to the volumetric solar heating of ice. The results of the calculations are in good agreement with the field observations. The computational analysis shows a dramatic change in the process when the ice surface is covered with snow. A qualitative change in the physical picture of the process occurs when the snow cover thickness increases to 20-30 cm. In this case, the snow melting precedes ice melting and water ponds are formed on the ice's surface. This is a typical situation for the Arctic Sea ice cover during the polar summer. Known experimental data are used to estimate the melting of sea ice under the melt pond. Positive or negative feedback related to the specific optical and thermal properties of snow, ice, and water are discussed.

J	Armagan, B; Gok, N; Ucar, D				Armagan, Bulent; Gok, Nuray; Ucar, Deniz			Assessment of seasonal variations in surface water quality of the Balikligol Lakes, Sanliurfa, Turkey	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												The Balikligol freshwater lakes (Lake Ayn-i Zeliha and Lake Halil-ur Rahman) in Sanliurfa are located in the Southeastern Anatolian region, Turkey. They have not only environmental value, but are also of touristic value due to their historical and sacred status in the past and present, as well as their natural aquarium look. From time to time, fish deaths have been observed, possibly by deteriorating water quality. Therefore, water samples collected from 7 different points in the Balikligol lakes during a one-year period were analyzed monthly for 11 physico-chemical water quality parameters (temperature, pH, conductivity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), Fe, Na, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb). In general, the measured parameters comply surprisingly well with the standard values. DO values are within the range given in International and Turkish standards. As far as COD values are concerned, they met the standard, except for the summer period. To meet with standard COD values, aeration must be done during the summer period, and the feeding of fishes should be kept under control. The average pH values were between 7-7.7. The analyses also showed that Cu, Ni and Ph were not present, and Fe, Cr and Na levels complied with the standards.

L-Lake was constructed in 1984-1985 and filled in late 1985. Approximately 25% of the shoreline of L-Lake was planted with lacustrine vegetation in early 1987 in an attempt to speed the establishment of a self-sustaining balanced biological community (BBC) at the reservoir. Even so, during the course of our studies, L-Lake had considerably less wetland vegetation, especially floating-leaved species such as yellow nelumbo (Nelumbo lutea), than did either of the two older reservoirs. Sixty-three surveys of the avian communities using the three reservoirs were conducted between fall of 1987 and summer of 1989. These surveys indicated that (1) at least seven species of wading birds (order: Ciconiiformes) used L-Lake, (2) wading bird density was higher at L-Lake than at the other two reservoirs, (3) wading birds represented a higher proportion of the total avian community at L-Lake than at the other two, older reservoirs, and (4) wading birds at L-Lake used planted portions of the shore-line more than unplanted portions. We suggest that the inter-reservoir differences we observed represent a 'trophic upsurge' (sensu O'Brien, 1990) resulting from the increased availability of fishes at L-Lake compared with the two older reservoirs.

J	Kvisvik, BC; Paasche, O; Dahl, SO				Kvisvik, Bjorn Christian; Paasche, Oyvind; Dahl, Svein Olaf			Holocene cirque glacier activity in Rondane, southern Norway	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Skriufonnen is a small cirque glacier (0.03 km(2)) in the continental mountains of Rondane in southern Norway. At present, it is the only glacier in Rondane, and very little is known about Holocene glacier fluctuations in this region. Direct observations of the glacier began in 2002, since which time Skriufonnen has been in a state of strong decline. In order to provide a temporal context, past glacier fluctuations were reconstructed based on a series of short HTH gravity cores (n = 8) and long piston cores (n = 6) retrieved from three downstream lakes of Skriufonnen. The cores were analysed for selected magnetic properties (chi bulk, ARM, SIRM, 77K/293 K), organic content (LOI), and geochemical trace elements. Soil catchment samples (n = 6) were collected along a transect running from the three lakes up to the present glacier terminus. Bulk susceptibility (chi bulk) measurements show that the finest fractions systematically return the highest values and that ferromagnetic minerals are depleted with distance to the glacier front. This means that periods dominated by paramagnetic minerals indicate very little or no glacier activity, whereas intervals with more ferromagnetic minerals suggest increased glacier activity. The quantitative core analyses indicate that Skriufonnen existed prior to 10,200 b2k (years before A.D. 2000) and disappeared similar to 10,000 b2k. No glacier activity is recorded from c. 10,000 b2k until the glacier reoccurred at the onset of the local Neoglacial period, c. 4000 b2k. The glacier attained its maximum extent between 3200 and 2400 b2k and during the end of the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA) c. A.D. 1800. Neoglacial fluctuations of Skriufonnen are in line with shifts in local summer temperatures and show a delayed Neoglacial inception compared to western Norway. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The complementary role of lentic and lotic habitats for Arctic grayling in a complex stream-lake network in Arctic Alaska	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Lakes can be important to stream dwelling fishes, yet how individuals exploit habitat heterogeneity across complex stream-lake networks is poorly understood. Furthermore, despite growing awareness that intermittent streams are widely used by fish, studies documenting the use of seasonally accessible lakes remain scarce. We studied Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) in a small seasonally flowing (June-October) stream-lake network in Alaska using PIT telemetry. Overall, 70% of fish visited two lakes, 8% used a single lake, and 22% used only stream reaches. We identified five distinct behavioural patterns that differed in dominant macrohabitat used (deep lake, shallow lake or stream reaches), entry day into the network and mobility. Some juvenile fish spent the entire summer in a shallow seasonally frozen lake (average 71 days), whereas others demonstrated prospecting behaviour and only entered the stream channel briefly in September. Another group included adult and juvenile fish that were highly mobile, moving up to 27 km while in the 3-km stream-lake network, and used stream reaches extensively (average 59 days). Lentic and lotic habitats served differing roles for individuals, some fish occupied stream reaches as summer foraging habitat, and other individuals used them as migration corridors to access lakes. Our study emphasises the importance of considering stream-lake connectivity in stream fish assessments, even to shallow seasonally frozen habitats not widely recognised as important. Furthermore, we demonstrate that individuals may use temporary aquatic habitats in complex and changing ways across ontogeny that are not captured by typical classifications of fish movement behaviour.

We have developed a new multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method for LSM and applied it to the Izeh River basin in south-western Iran. Our method is based on fuzzy membership functions (FMFs) derived from GIS analysis. It makes use of nine causal landslide factors identified by local landslide experts. Fuzzy set theory was first integrated with an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in order to use pairwise comparisons to compare LSM criteria for ranking purposes. FMFs were then applied in order to determine the criteria weights to be used in the development of a landslide susceptibility map. Finally, a landslide inventory database was used to validate the LSM map by comparing it with known landslides within the study area. Results indicated that the integration of fuzzy set theory with AHP produced significantly improved accuracies and a high level of reliability in the resulting landslide susceptibility map. Approximately 53% of known landslides within our study area fell within zones classified as having "very high susceptibility", with the further 31% falling into zones classified as having "high susceptibility".

J	Whitlock, C; Shafer, SL; Marlon, J				Whitlock, C; Shafer, SL; Marlon, J			The role of climate and vegetation change in shaping past and future fire regimes in the northwestern US and the implications for ecosystem management	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT					International Symposium on Effects of Wildland Fire on Aquatic Ecosystems in the Western USA	APR 22-24, 2002	BOISE, ID					Fire is an important part of the disturbance regimes of northwestern US forests and its role in maintaining and altering forest vegetation is evident in the paleoecological record of the region. Long-tenri reconstructions of Holocene fire regimes, provided by the analysis of charcoal, pollen, and other fire proxies in a network of lake records, indicate that the Pacific Northwest and summer-dry regions of the northern Rocky Mountains experienced their highest fire activity in the early Holocene (11,000-7000 years ago) and during the Medieval Warm Period (ca. 1000 years ago) when drought conditions were more severe than today. In contrast, in summer-wet areas of the northern Rocky Mountains, the period of highest fire activity was registered in the last 7000 years when dry woodland vegetation developed. When synthesized across the entire northwestern US, the paleoecological record reveals that past and present fire regimes are strongly controlled by climate changes occurring on multiple time scales. The scarcity of fires in the 20th century in some northwestern US ecosystems may be the result of successful fire suppression policies, but in wetter forests this absence is consistent with long-term fire regime patterns. In addition, simulations of potential future climate and vegetation indicate that future fire conditions in some parts of the northwestern US could be more severe than they are today.

Severe cyanobacterial blooms in an Australian lake; causes and factors controlling succession patterns	HARMFUL ALGAE												Cyanobacterial blooms have major impacts on the ecological integrity and anthropogenic value of freshwater systems. Chrysosporum ovalisporum, a potentially toxic cyanobacteria has been rare in Australian waters until recently when is has bloomed in a number of lake and river systems. The aim of this study was to determine drivers of its growth and growing dominance. We performed regular monitoring of Mannus Lake, a small freshwater reservoir in South-Eastern Australia that has recently undergone extremely dense bloom events. Blooms of the diazotrophic Chrysosporum ovalisporum occurred in both summers of the 19 month study during periods of persistent thermal stratification. Following the C. ovalisporum blooms, non-diazotrophic taxa (Micro-cystis aeruginosa and Woronichinia sp.) dominated the phytoplankton community under less stratified conditions. Thermal stratification and nitrogen availability appeared to be the primary drivers of changes in cyanobacterial community structure. We propose that the observed transition from C. ovalisporum to M. aeruginosa and/or Woronichinia sp. may be a result of nitrogen limitation in early summer, which combined with persistent thermal stratification led to an ecological advantage for the nitrogen-fixing C. ovalisporum. Mixing events caused the senescence of the C. ovalisporum bloom, likely supplementing the nutrient budget of the lake with atmospheri-cally derived N and alleviating N limitation to non-diazotrophic taxa. Non-diazotrophic cyanobacterial growth then increased, albeit at much lower biovolumes compared to the initial bloom. Overall, the results demonstrate the role of thermal stratification and nutrient cycling in structuring the cyanobacterial community and provide insights into the environmental factors driving the proliferation of the relatively new, potentially toxic cyano-bacterium C. ovalisporum in Australian waters.

Here, based on the modern relationship between permafrost and vegetation (represented by pollen assemblages), we trained a Random Forest model using pollen and permafrost data and verified its reliability to reconstruct the history of permafrost in northern Asia during the Holocene. An early Holocene (12-8 cal ka BP) strong thawing trend, a middle-to-late Holocene (8-2 cal ka BP) relatively slow thawing trend, and a late Holocene freezing trend of permafrost in northern Asia are consistent with climatic proxies such as summer solar radiation and Northern Hemisphere temperature. The extensive distribution of permafrost in northern Asia inhibited the spread of evergreen coniferous trees during the early Holocene warming and might have decelerated the enhancement of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) by altering hydrological processes and albedo. Based on these findings, we suggest that studies of the EASM should consider more the state of permafrost and vegetation in northern Asia, which are often overlooked and may have a profound impact on climate change in this region.					; Cao, Xianyong/L-7168-2019; Rudaya, Natalia/B-1622-2012	Herzschuh, Ulrike/0000-0003-0999-1261; Rudaya, Natalia/0000-0003-1536-6470													2296-701X					JUN 6	2022	10								894471	10.3389/fevo.2022.894471	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2022.894471													WOS:000813185700001

Detailed temperature mapping-Warming characterizes archipelago zones	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Rapidly warming shallow archipelago areas have the best energetic options for high ecological production. We analyzed and visualized the spring and summer temperature development in the Finnish coastal areas of the Northern Baltic Sea. Typical for the Baltic is a high annual periodicity and variability in water temperatures. The maximum difference between a single day average temperatures across the study area was 283 degrees C. During wintertime the littoral water temperature can decrease below zero in outer archipelago or open water areas when the protective ice cover is not present and the lowest observed value was 0.5 degrees C. The depth and exposition are the most important variables explaining the coastal temperature gradients from the innermost to the outermost areas in springtime when water is heated by increasing solar radiation. Temperature differs more within coastal area than between the basins. Water temperature sum was highest in innermost areas, lowest in open water areas and the variation in daily averages was highest in the middle region. At the end of the warming period, the difference in surface water temperatures between the innermost and outermost areas had diminished at the time when the cooling began in August September. These clear temperature gradients enabled us use the cumulative water temperature to classify the coastal zones in a biologically sensible manner into five regions. Our study shows a novel approach to study detailed spatial variations in water temperatures. The results can further be used, for example, to model and predict the spatial distribution of aquatic biota and to determine appropriate spatio-temporal designs for aquatic biota surveys. The new spatial knowledge of temperature regions will also help the evaluation of possible causes of larger scale climatological changes in a biological context including productivity.

J	Edmundson, JA; Mazumder, A				Edmundson, JA; Mazumder, A			Regional and hierarchical perspectives of thermal regimes in subarctic, Alaskan lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We examined 60 clear, stained and glacial lakes in Alaska to quantify the relative importance of climate setting, morphometry, transparency, and lake typology influences on various thermal characteristics including duration of growing season, water temperature, mixing depth (MD) and heat content. We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test for differences in thermal characteristics in association with lake type and employed simple and multiple regression techniques to determine functional relationships between variables. 2. Latitude accounted for 60% of the total variance in length of growing season. Although the date of maximum heat content was consistent among lake types, stained lakes had longer growing seasons compared with clear and glacially turbid lakes. 3. Maximum water temperatures were approximately 3 degreesC higher in stained lakes and 3 degreesC lower in glacial lakes compared with clear lakes. Mean water column temperature was significantly lower in glacial lakes (5.9 degreesC) compared with clear lakes (7.4 degreesC), but there eras no statistical difference between clear and stained lakes (7.2 degreesC) or between stained and glacial lakes. Maximum surface temperatures were positively related (r(2) = 0.51) to colour (humic stain), but negatively related (r(2) = 0.40) to inorganic turbidity (glacial silt). 4. Only about half of the lakes in our data set underwent summer stratification. None of the glacial lakes developed a distinct thermocline, but stained lakes had shallower MDs (mean 8 m) than clear lakes (mean 12 m). Thus, the MD to total depth ratio for glacial lakes was unity compared with mean values of 0.66 for clear lakes and 0.34 for stained lakes. Fetch explained a significant fraction (51%) of the total variance in MD. Considering all lakes, MD was inversely related to transparency (Secchi depth). In contrast, considering only stratified clear and stained lakes, MD was positively related to Secchi depth (SD), the fraction of the total variance explained was 23%. The sign of the slope was dependent on the mixture of lake types. 5. Despite significant (ANOVA) differences in water temperatures, growing season, and MDs among the three lake types, there were no statistical differences in the summer heat budget associated with lake type. In addition, heat budgets were poorly correlated with lake area, depth and volume. In contrast, mean water column temperature was strongly and inversely related (r(2) = 0.77) to mean depth. 6. Potential explanations for the similarity in summer heat budget among lake types and weak correlation with morphometry were attributed to different patterns in vertical heat distribution associated with lake typology (colour and turbidity) differences. 7. Multiple linear regression including climatic (latitude and altitude), morphometric, and lake typology (colour and turbidity) factors demonstrated a hierarchical (climate-morphometry-typology) regulation of growing season characteristics, water temperatures, stratification and heat retention. A regional and hierarchical framework for lake thermal characteristics adds to our understanding of potential responses to climatic change and may be important for regional management objectives for fisheries.																			0046-5070					JAN	2002	47	1					1	17		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00775.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00775.x													WOS:000173397900001

Mammals dominated in the diet (61.8% of occurrence). Among them, Arvicola terrestris and Microtus sp. (mainly M. oeconomus) were most numerous. No beaver kit remains were recorded. Birds, amphibians, fish and crayfish were also important components of the mink diet. Each of these groups were found in about 25% of scats. The mink was found to be a typical generalistic predator. The diversity of the mink diet, most probably, was made possible by the abundant and diverse food resources in late spring.																			0001-7051	2190-3743					1992	37	1-2					193	198		10.4098/AT.arch.92-19	http://dx.doi.org/10.4098/AT.arch.92-19													WOS:A1992JK21100015

The Bush administration's leadership in advocating for biosurveillance systems capable of monitoring for bioterrorism attacks suggests that we should move quickly to establish a nationwide early warning biosurveillance system as a defense against this threat. The spirit of collaboration and unity inspired by the events of 9-11 and the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City provided the opportunity to demonstrate how a prototypic biosurveillance system could be rapidly deployed. In seven weeks we were able to implement an automated, real-time disease outbreak detection system in the State of Utah and monitored 80,684 acute care visits occurring during a 28-day period spanning the Olympics.

A multidisciplinary study performed on a transect of sediment cores was used to reconstruct the depositional evolution of the high-elevation Laguna del Maule (LdM) (36 degrees S, 2180 m a.s.l., Chilean Andes). The recovered 5 m composite sediment sequence includes two thick turbidite units (LT1 and LT2) and numerous tephra layers (23 ash and 6 lapilli). We produced an age model based on nine new C-14 AMS dates, existing Pb-210 and Cs-137 data, and the Quizapti ash horizon (1932 CE). According to this age model, the relatively drier Early Holocene was followed by a phase of increased productivity during the mid-Holocene and higher lake levels after 4.0 ka cal BR Major hydroclimate transitions occurred at ca. 11, 8.0, 4.0 and 0.5 ka cal BP. Decreased summer insolation and winter precipitation due to a southward shift in the southern westerly winds and a strengthened Pacific Subtropical High could explain Early Holocene lower lake levels. Increased biological productivity during the mid-Holocene (similar to 8.0 to 6.0 ka cal BP) is coeval with a warm-dry phase described for much of southern South America. Periods of higher lake productivity are synchronous to a higher frequency of volcanic events. During the Late Holocene, the tephra layers show compositional changes suggesting a transition from silica-rich to silica-poor magmas at around 4.0 ka cal BR. This transition was synchronous with increased variability of sedimentary facies and geochemical proxies, indicating higher lake levels and increased moisture at LdM after 4.0 ka cal BP, most likely caused by the inception of current El Niflo-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (ENSO-PDO) dynamics in central Chile.

Climate in continental interior Asia during the longest interglacial of the past 500 000 years: the new MIS 11 records from Lake Baikal, SE Siberia	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												A synthesis of paleoclimate responses from Lake Baikal during the MIS 11 interglacial is presented based on proxy records from two drill sites 245 km apart. BDP-99 is located in vicinity of the delta of the major Baikal tributary, whereas the BDP-96 site represents hemipelagic setting distant from riverine influence. The comparison of thicknesses of interglacial intervals in these contrasting depositional settings confirms the extended ca. 33-kyr duration of the MIS 11 interglacial. The new BDP-99 diatom biostratigraphic record matches that of the BDP-96-2 holostratotype and thus allows establishing establishes robust correlation between the records on the same orbitally-tuned timescale. The first detailed MIS 11 palynological record from the BDP-99 drill core indicates the dominance of boreal conifer (taiga) forest vegetation in the Baikal region throughout the MIS 11 interglacial, since at least 424 ka till ca. 396 ka. The interval ca. 420-405 ka stands out as a 'conifer optimum' with abundant Abies sibirica, indicative of climate significantly warmer and less continental than today. The closest Baikal analog to this type of vegetation in the history of the current Holocene interglacial is at ca. 9-7 ka. The warm conifer phase lasted for ca. 15 kyr during MIS 11 interrupted by two millennial-scale cooling episodes at ca. 411-410 and 405-404 ka. Reconstructed annual precipitation of 450-550 mm/yr during the MIS 11 interglacial is by ca. 100 mm higher than during the Holocene; regional climate was less continental with warmer mean temperatures both in summer and in winter. At both drill sites, the two-peak structure of the MIS 11 diatom abundance profiles reflects the orbital signature of precession in the interglacial paleoclimate record of continental Eurasia. MIS 11 interglacial was characterized by the sustained high level of primary production and accumulation of autochthonous organic matter at both study sites. The responses of paleoclimate-sensitive indices in the mineralogy of the MIS 11 sediments in BDP-96-2 are consistent with those during the Holocene. Illitization of secondary clay minerals in the Baikal watershed was an important process, but it appears to have been subdued during the first half of the MIS 11, apparently due to elevated humidity and muted seasonality of regional climate.

The terrigenous record exhibits a well-defined period of low influx between 14.8 and 5.5 cal. ka BP associated with the African Humid Period, when the Sahara was nearly completely vegetated and supported numerous perennial lakes; an arid interval corresponding to the Younger Dryas Chronozone punctuates this humid period. The African Humid Period has been attributed to a strengthening of the African monsoon due to gradual orbital increases in summer season insolation. However, the onset and termination of this humid period were very abrupt, occurring within decades to centuries. Both transitions occurred when summer season insolation crossed a nearly identical threshold value, which was 4.2% greater than present. These abrupt climate responses to gradual insolation forcing require strongly non-linear feedback processes, and current coupled climate model studies invoke vegetation and ocean temperature feedbacks as candidate mechanisms for the non-linear climate sensitivity. The African monsoon climate system is thus a low-latitude corollary to the bi-stable behavior of high-latitude deep ocean thermohaline circulation, which is similarly capable of rapid and large-amplitude climate transitions.

Palaeohydrological evolution and implications for palaeoclimate since the Late Glacial at Laguna de Fuente de Piedra, southern Spain	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Here, we present a terrestrial multi-proxy record of Late Quaternary environmental changes in the southern Iberian Peninsula covering approximately 30 ka. This sedimentary record originates from a saline playa lake (Laguna de Fuente de Piedra) hosted within a complex geological setting dominated by Triassic claystones and evaporites, Jurassic carbonates and Miocene deposits leading to a complex hydrogeological setting. Dissolution of evaporites in the catchment and intense evaporation are responsible for saline waters fluctuating in the basin. Thus, salinity as palaeohydrological proxy, requires a decoupling of internal and external hydrogeochemical processes. The greatest accumulation of evaporites in the LFP late Pleistocene-Holocene record coincides with a more humid or, at least, less evaporative, period. Based on multi-proxy data we describe five lacustrine lithofacies (2-5), and fluvial deposits (1) from sediment cores. The proposed conceptual lake margin model contains three main lake water stages repeated within the sedimentary succession and building up the characteristic lithofacies. Lake water stages refer to a flooding stage (influx > outflux), high water stage (influx = outflux), and low water stage (influx < outflux). The lithostratigraphy reveals a palaeohydrological record suggesting climate changes and associated lake level fluctuations. Lake level oscillations of different amplitudes have been identified. Low amplitude changes have been revealed for the periods from 28 ka cal BP to 17.5 ka cal BP and from 8.2 ka cal BP to present, whereas in between (17.5 ka cal BP to 8.2 ka cal BP) the Late Pleistocene/Holocene transition shows high amplitude lake level changes. The latter coincides with an increased influence of saline subsurface waters, due to groundwater level rising (sulfate signature). In contrast, the Holocene, records the low amplitude oscillations and a drop of the groundwater levels, which creates a less saline or fresher footprint in the sediments (carbonate signature). Thus, the periods of low amplitude lake level oscillations, low inputs of clastics and low groundwater levels (drier) coincide with periods of minimal seasonal insolation difference. In contrast, the period of higher amplitude lake level oscillations, higher input of clastics and higher groundwater table (wetter) is correlative to periods of maximum difference between summer and winter insolation.

J	HAMMER, UT				HAMMER, UT			LIFE AND TIMES OF 5 SASKATCHEWAN SALINE MEROMICTIC LAKES	INTERNATIONALE REVUE DER GESAMTEN HYDROBIOLOGIE												Five closed saline lakes near Humboldt, Saskatchewan, were found to be meromictic. Two of these lakes (Waldsea, Deadmoose) were first discovered to be meromictic in the early 1970s and three (Arthur, Marie, Sayer) in 1985. The origin of their meromixis is ectogenic. One of the lakes, Waldsea, had surface salinities far higher in 1960-1961 than those of 1970 or later and as high as that of the monimolimnion occasionally was from 1970 to the present. During the late 1960s to 1980 the lake level of Waldsea rose four metres as a result of higher than normal snowpacks and subsequent high snowmelt runoff. Endogenic processes of freezing out of salts from the upper metre during ice formation and precipitation of sodium sulphate during autumn cooling also promote meromixis. The lakes which are located in depressions in a relatively flat topography are very exposed to periodic high velocity westerly winds. Although Deadmoose and Waldsea lakes are relatively deep, Arthur, Marie and Sayer lakes have maximum depths of only three to five metres. Meromixis has persisted until the present in three lakes but Marie and Arthur lakes became holomictic during the autumn of 1988, a severe drought year. Bacterial plates were prominent in Waldsea, Deadmoose and Sayer lakes. BChl-a and BChl-d were present in 1988 with maxima of 2652 mg.m-3 BChl-a and 4290 mg.m-3 BChl-d in Sayer Lake. BChl-a virtually disappeared in subsequent years.																			0020-9309						1994	79	2					235	248		10.1002/iroh.19940790209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19940790209													WOS:A1994NW40300006
J	Jargal, N; An, KG				Jargal, Namsrai; An, Kwang-Guk			Seasonal and interannual responses of blue-green algal taxa and chlorophyll to a monsoon climate, flow regimes, and N:P ratios in a temperate drinking-water reservoir	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Blooms of blue-green algae (BGA) threaten drinking water safety and ecosystems worldwide. Understanding mechanisms and driving factors that promote BGA proliferation is crucial for effective freshwater management. This study tested the response of BGA growth to environmental variations driven by nutrients (N and P), N:P ratios, and flow regime depending on the influence of the Asian monsoon intensity and identified the critical regulatory factors in a temperate drinking-water reservoir, using weekly interval samplings collected during 2017-2022. The hydrodynamic and underwater light conditions experienced significant changes in summers due to high inflows and outflows associated with intense rainfalls, and these conditions strongly influenced the proliferation of BGA and total phytoplankton biomass (as estimated by chlorophyll-a [CHL-a]) during summer monsoons. However, the intense monsoon resulted in the post-monsoon blooms of BGA. The monsoon-induced phosphorus enrichment, facilitated through soil washing and runoff, was crucial in promoting phytoplankton blooms in early post-monsoon (September). Thus, the monomodal phytoplankton peak was evident in the system, compared to the bimodal peaks in North American and European lakes. Strong water column stability in the weak monsoon years depressed phytoplankton growth and BGA, suggesting the importance of the intensity of monsoon. The low N:P ratios and longer water residence time increased BGA abundance. The predictive model of BGA abundance accounted for the variations largely (Mallows' Cp = 0.39, adjusted R2 = 0.55, p < 0.001) by dissolved phosphorus, N:P ratios, CHL-a, and inflow volume. Overall, this study suggests that monsoon intensity was the key triggering factor regulating the interannual BGA variations and facilitated the post-monsoon blooms through increased nutrient availability.

We selected the largest artificial lake in southeastern china, Changshou Lake (CSL), which has high background levels of Hg, for our investigation of Hg transformation microorganisms. Five different sections of the water column of CSL were sampled during four seasons. The water samples were subjected to analysis of geochemical parameters, various Hg species and microbiome information. High concentrations of total mercury (THg) were detected in CSL in comparison with those found in natural lakes. Significant differences in microbial community structure and Hg species abundance existed among seasons. High dissolved methyl mercury (DMeHg) formation and high bacterial richness and diversity occurred in the fall. The microbiome was dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Deinococcus-Thermus and many unclassified bacteria. Significant correlations were found between seasonal bacterial communities and Hg levels. Hg methylation was strongly linked to the abundance of Cyanobacteria. Methylators, including Syntrophus, Desulfovibrio and Desulfomonile species, were detected only in samples collected in the fall. The results of enzyme functional analyses revealed that many unknown types of bacteria could also be responsible for Hg transformation. This study was the first to investigate the impact of various Hg species on the microbiome of artificial lake water. The findings of this study illuminate the role of seasonal bacteria in Hg transformation.

J	KELLER, T				KELLER, T			FOOD OF CORMORANTS PHALACROCORAX-CARBO-SINENSIS WINTERING IN BAVARIA, SOUTHERN GERMANY	ARDEA												Following the spectacular population increase in continental Cormorants, numbers of wintering birds on lakes and rivers in Bavaria, southern Germany, have risen sharply. Because of a,growing concern among commercial fishermen and anglers, a diet study has been carried out at two major roosts: one at a lake (lake Chiemsee) and one at a dammed river (lower Inn river). Main prey species were cyprinids (Rudd, Roach, Chub and Bream), but at lake Chiemsee the commercially most important Whitefish also appeared in the diet during spawning in December/January. Mean daily intake per bird increased in the course of winter, because of larger specimens taken. Possible causes and effects of this phenomenon are discussed. Assuming an average daily uptake of 400 g fresh mass, it was estimated that at lake Chiemsee 3.3% of the total annual fish production was taken by Cormorants (vs. 28% by commercial fishermen). The total catch of Whitefish by Cormorants amounted to a mere 3.2% of the total commercial catch of this species. Larger proportions were scored for Eel (22.3%) and Pike (6.2%). At the lower Inn river it was estimated that Cormorants took 21% of the total annual fish production. Both in view of species composition in the Cormorants' diet and of the consumption estimates specified above, it is considered unlikely that the birds impose a serious threat to commercial fisheries. Interference with recreational angling (e.g. for Grayling) may, however, occur.																			0373-2266						1995	83	1					185	192																WOS:A1995RM43100020

Sakari			A comparison of plant macrofossil-based quantitative climate reconstruction methods: A case study of the lateglacial Baltic States	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The recent advancements of new quantitative tools compatible with plant macrofossil proxy data have revived its potential for paleoclimate research. Plant macrofossils are commonly used in so-called indicator-species approaches, using methodologies that are typically built on known observations linking modern plant distributions with climate. This allows complementary paleoclimate reconstructions using an approach that is not limited by the spatial availability of calibration samples obtained from surface sediments (e.g., pollen or chironomids). We aim to evaluate the impact that various methodological choices have on the plant-macrofossil based reconstructions of January and July temperature patterns for the Lateglacial (14-11 ka BP) period. We use a variety of classic and novel quantitative climate reconstruction algorithms with plant macrofossil assemblages from 13 sites of the Baltic States. We use unfiltered plant data to evaluate the ability of each method to also handle the presence of plants that might have a weak sensitivity to temperature. Additionally, we test the influence of another methodological choice - the choice of modern calibration region - on the reconstructed climate. Our findings indicate that, with no prior filtering of summer and winter-sensitive plants, temporal temperature variations can be reconstructed with methods that implement probability density functions. Although some disparities in reconstructions are seen between the tested algorithms, we note that the choice of calibration region bears a greater influence on the results. A calibration region that best represents the past environment should be chosen rather than one representing the same spatial extent as the fossil site(s). Moreover, for longterm reconstructions, a "dynamic calibration set" approach should be considered in future studies by using a range of calibration regions and mirroring the continuously changing broadscale environmental regime of the past.					; Stivrins, Normunds/H-5661-2019; Schenk, Frederik/AAI-7824-2020	Stivrins, Normunds/0000-0002-1136-0146; Trasune, Liva/0000-0001-7843-1378; Schenk, Frederik/0000-0002-4768-9832; Salonen, Sakari/0000-0002-8847-9081													0277-3791	1873-457X				AUG 15	2024	338								108811	10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108811	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108811		JUL 2024											WOS:001278481400001
J	Ridgway, MS				Ridgway, Mark S.			Seasonal and annual patterns in density of double-crested cormorants in two coastal regions of Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Aerial line transect distance sampling surveys of coastal areas in the North Channel and Georgian Bay, Lake Huron, were conducted to estimate density of double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus). Surveys were approximately every two weeks through summer from 2000 to 2005. In each year, density of cormorants declined towards late summer indicating a large scale outward migration of cormorants from Lake Huron. The seasonal pattern of decline differed between the two regions based on a mixed model analysis. Seasonal patterns in apparent fledging patterns may reflect differences between the North Channel and Georgian Bay in nesting phenology, nesting synchrony or some combination of these factors. Density was generally higher in the North Channel relative to Georgian Bay seasonally and during the period 20002002 likely reflecting higher per unit area productivity in the North Channel. In the years 2003-2005, density was lower in both regions and similar compared to earlier years of the survey likely reflecting a regime shift that occurred in Lake Huron at that time. The effect of this change was greater in the North Channel than in Georgian Bay as indicated by a greater decline in cormorant density in the North Channel after 2002. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Under-ice convection dynamics in a boreal lake	INLAND WATERS												We investigated radiatively driven under-ice convection in Lake Onego (Russia) during 3 consecutive late winters. In ice-covered lakes, where the temperature of water is below the temperature of maximum density, radiatively driven heating in the upper water column induces unstable density distributions leading to gravitational convection. In this work, we quantified the key parameters to characterise the radiatively driven under-ice convection: (1) the effective buoyancy flux, B* (driver), and its vertical distribution; (2) the convective mixed-layer thickness, (depth scale); and (3) the convective velocity, w*(kinematic scale). We compared analytical scaling estimates to in situ observations from high-resolution acoustic Doppler current profilers. The results show a robust correlation between w* and the direct observations, except during the onset and decay of the solar radiation. Our results highlight the importance of accurately defining the upper limit of h(CML) in highly turbid water and the need for spectrally resolving solar radiation measurements and their attenuation for accurate B* estimates. Uncertainties in the different parameters were also investigated. We finally examined the implications of under-ice convection for the growth rate of nonmotile phytoplankton and provide a simple heuristic model as a function of easily measurable parameters.					; Bogdanov, Sergey/Y-5047-2019; Zdorovennova, Galina/L-8214-2013; Ulloa, Hugo N./HOA-7472-2023; Volkov, Sergey/V-5050-2018; Palshin, Nikolay/L-8634-2013; Efremova, Tatiana/M-1943-2013; Terzhevik, Arkady/L-7911-2013; Zdorovennov, Roman/L-8294-2013	Ulloa, Hugo N./0000-0002-1995-6630; Zdorovennova, Galina/0000-0003-2726-0104; Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718; Efremova, Tatiana/0000-0003-0313-6731; Terzhevik, Arkady/0000-0002-0837-9065; Lavanchy, Sebastien/0000-0002-7417-8587; Palshin, Nikolay/0000-0003-1540-3788; Volkov, Sergei/0000-0002-5385-1541; Zdorovennov, Roman/0000-0003-1695-4872; Bogdanov, Sergey/0000-0003-4150-2712													2044-2041	2044-205X					2019	9	2			SI		142	161		10.1080/20442041.2018.1533356	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2018.1533356													WOS:000482317700003
J	Camberlin, P				Camberlin, P			Rainfall anomalies in the source region of the Nile and their connection with the Indian summer monsoon	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												In light of the droughts and subsequent food crises that have plagued the Ethiopia-Sudan region in the course of its history, and especially during the last 3 decades, the author examines both the interannual and intraseasonal variabilities of the July-September rains and compares them to the Indian summer monsoon. Regional rainfall indexes for the region stretching from Eritrea to Lake Victoria are computed using seasonal totals for the period 1901-88. Daily data for 1982-88 are also considered. Though all these regions are only partly affected by the Indian monsoon cross-equatorial flow and although they are separated from India by an extensive dry belt (Red Sea, Somalia, west Arabian Sea), there exists a close association between summer rainfall variations in India and in the western parts of East Africa. An even stronger relationship is revealed between these latter regions and Bombay surface pressure, with as much as 79% of the variance in common during 1953-88. This relationship has been virtually stable throughout the twentieth century. Although there also exists a statistical connection between East African rainfall and the Southern Oscillation index (SOI), partial correlation coefficients show that the India-East Africa teleconnection is to a large extent independent of SOI. At intraseasonal timescales, this connection with India still holds, although less consistently. Abnormally low pressure along the western coast of India is associated with above normal daily rainfall and westerly wind anomalies over western Kenya. The most significant relationship is found with a lag of 2-6 days after the occurrence of a low pressure anomaly in Bombay. It is suggested that monsoon activity over India is a major trigger for July-September rainfall variability in the East African highlands. Active/strong monsoon conditions correspond to an enhanced west-east pressure gradient near the equator and, therefore, to abnormally strong westerly winds, advecting moisture from the Congo Basin to Ethiopia, Uganda, and western Kenya. This advection is reduced for weak/break monsoon conditions in India. This teleconnection bears some potential for the improvement of intraseasonal and seasonal rainfall forecasting in the Ethiopia/western Kenya area.

This study describes spatial and temporal variation of surf-zone drownings on the Great Lakes between 2010 and 2017 with respect to the demographics of the drowning victims, proximity to population centers, and interannual variations in the regional climate. A total of 391 drownings were reported on the Great Lakes during this period, but there is considerable variability in the number of drownings among the lakes and from year to year. The largest number of drownings occurred on Lake Michigan (n = 207; 53%), with most drownings concentrated along the southern end of the lake, near large population centers. The number of drownings in the other lakes ranged from 67 in Lake Erie (17%) to 27 (7%) in Lake Superior. Most drownings during this period occurred in the summer months of June, July, and August, with a disproportionate number occurring on a Sunday (n = 102; 26%). Most drownings involved males between 10 and 30 years old (n = 167; 43%), with males between 15 and 20 years old accounting for the largest proportion of drownings (n = 69; 18%). Most drownings occurred during periods when wind speeds (a proxy for wave height) were relatively weak (2-5 ms(-1)), although there were many drownings when winds ranged from 5 to 10 ms(-1).The number of drownings in each year was found to be dependent on air and water temperature, annual precipitation, and the concentration of ice in the previous winter. The identified relationships suggest that the number of drownings is expected to increase in the future with a warming climate, which, in turn, suggests a need for increased education and lifesaving programs in the region.																			0749-0208	1551-5036				JUL	2019	35	4					794	804		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-18-00027.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-18-00027.1													WOS:000473810600007

We also set up a numerical model to resolve hydrodynamics and fate of water quality variables in the system. Results show that most of nutrients loading are trapped in the lake and higher concentrations of nutrients and organic matters (OM) are present only inside of the artificial sea dike. There exist episodial discharges at the dam, which coincide mostly with rainfall events during summer monsoon periods. During this discharge event, lower salinity and higher suspended solids, nutrients, and OM are observed in surface layer of the estuarine section. Hydrodynamic model results show that circulation in the estuarine section is governed by freshwater discharge from the lake, resulting in an enhanced two-layer estuarine circulation being dominated, during and after the freshwater is discharged. Such two-layer estuarine circulation combined with higher concentration of nutrients in the surface layer results in that outfluxes of nutrients in the surface layer dominate over the influxes in the bottom layer during summer high precipitation periods. Meanwhile, numerical dye experiment results show that the discharged water with elevated nutrients levels have a short residence time (similar to 5-10 days) in the estuarine section. Due to this fast flushing rate, excessive nutrient loadings are not used to produce biological matters in the estuarine section. This limited biological productivity, characterized by seaward side of the artificial sea dike, makes Yeongsan estuarine system excluded from acting as an active carbon sink. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

B., MacPherson, M. and McKenzie, D. B. 2003. Corn heat unit variability and potential of corn (Zea mays L.) production in a cool climate ecosystem. Can. I Plant Sci. 83: 689-698. Recent interest in corn (Zea mays L.) production among forage producers in Newfoundland, Canada, raises questions of risk, scale and impact of seasonal heat accumulation for attaining maturity. The objectives of this paper were to present the results of corn performance in a short-term trial at three selected sites (St. John's, Deer Lake and Stephenville), calculate corn heat unit (CHU) probability levels of these sites to assess the long-term risks, and determine CHU values of locations across Newfoundland to describe their suitability for corn production. Daily values of CHU were accumulated from the conversion of daily maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min) air temperature for each location using the last day of 3 consecutive days in the spring with mean daily air temperatures (T-mean greater than or equal to 12.8degreesC as the starting date and the first date of a killing frost in the autumn (T-min less than or equal to-2C) or 30 September, whichever was earlier, as the ending date. Corn gown for silage at the three selected sites was within the desired level of 250-350 g kg(-1) DM at 50% kernel milk fine (R5.5) stage. Corn reached harvesting stage (R5.5) before the occurrence of a killing frost at Deer Lake and Stephenville. To protect seedlings against killing frost, mulching with transparent polyethylene film is recommended at St. John's. There was considerable year-to-year variability in CHU at each of the three sites. Differences in seasonal CHU for St. John's were identified over two periods: from 1945-1989 and 1990-2001. The most recent period (1990-2001) has generally been warmer than the earlier period. A warming trend, as indicated by the CHU trends at the three sites, holds the prospect of some significant longer-term benefits for Newfoundland agriculture. Across Newfoundland, average (1956-1990) seasonal CHU accumulations (CHUave) based on START(ave) and ENDend) ranged from 1686 at St. Lawrence to 2695 at Gander. Using the 80% probability (START(80%) and END80%) dates, the CHU80% ranged from 1486 at Port aux Basques to 2382 at Gander. The CHU values would help producers select what corn hybrid(s) to grow in their area. Overall, these analyses underline the potential for successful corn production in Newfoundland.																			0008-4220					OCT	2003	83	4					689	698		10.4141/P02-127	http://dx.doi.org/10.4141/P02-127													WOS:000188252400005
J	Ager, TA				Ager, TA			Late Quaternary vegetation and climate history of the central Bering land bridge from St. Michael Island, western Alaska	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												Pollen analysis of a sediment core from Zagoskin Lake on St. Michael Island, northeast Bering Sea, provides a history of vegetation and climate for the central Bering land bridge and adjacent western Alaska for the past greater than or equal to30,000 C-14 yr B.P. During the late middle Wisconsin interstadial (greater than or equal to30,000-26,000 C-14 yr B.P.) vegetation was dominated by graminoid-herb tundra with willows (Salix) and minor dwarf birch (Betula nana) and Ericales. During the late Wisconsin glacial interval (26,000-15,000 C-14 yr B.P.) vegetation was graminoid-herb tundra with willows. but with fewer dwarf birch and Ericales, and more herb types associated with dry habitats and disturbed soils. Grasses (Poaceae) dominated during the peak of this glacial interval. Graminoid-herb tundra suggests that central Beringia had a cold, and climate from greater than or equal to30,000 to 15,000 C-14 yr B.P. Between 15,000 and 13,000 14C yr B.P., birch shrub-Ericales-sedge-moss tundra began to spread rapidly across the land bridge and Alaska. This major vegetation change suggests moister, warmer summer climates and deeper winter snows. A brief invasion of Populus (poplar, aspen) occurred ca. 11,000-9500 C-14 yr B.P., overlapping with the Younger Dryas interval of dry, cooler(?) climate. During the latest Wisconsin to middle Holocene the Bering land bridge was flooded by rising seas. Alder shrubs (Alnus crispa) colonized the St. Michael Island area ca. 8000 C-14 yr B.P. Boreal forests dominated by spruce (Picea) spread from interior Alaska into the eastern Norton Sound area in middle Holocene time, but have not spread as far west as St. Michael Island.

Advancing estuarine ecological forecasts: seasonal hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Ecological forecasts are quantitative tools that can guide ecosystem management. The coemergence of extensive environmental monitoring and quantitative frameworks allows for widespread development and continued improvement of ecological forecasting systems. We use a relatively simple estuarine hypoxia model to demonstrate advances in addressing some of the most critical challenges and opportunities of contemporary ecological forecasting, including predictive accuracy, uncertainty characterization, and management relevance. We explore the impacts of different combinations of forecast metrics, drivers, and driver time windows on predictive performance. We also incorporate multiple sets of state-variable observations from different sources and separately quantify model prediction error and measurement uncertainty through a flexible Bayesian hierarchical framework. Results illustrate the benefits of (1) adopting forecast metrics and drivers that strike an optimal balance between predictability and relevance to management, (2) incorporating multiple data sources in the calibration data set to separate and propagate different sources of uncertainty, and (3) using the model in scenario mode to probabilistically evaluate the effects of alternative management decisions on future ecosystem state. In the Chesapeake Bay, the subject of this case study, we find that average summer or total annual hypoxia metrics are more predictable than monthly metrics and that measurement error represents an important source of uncertainty. Application of the model in scenario mode suggests that absent watershed management actions over the past decades, long-term average hypoxia would have increased by 7% compared to 1985. Conversely, the model projects that if management goals currently in place to restore the Bay are met, long-term average hypoxia would eventually decrease by 32% with respect to the mid-1980s.					; Scavia, Donald/P-5917-2018; Testa, Jeremy/C-7189-2013; Michael, Benedict/LQK-3906-2024	Michael, Benedict/0000-0002-8693-8926; Bever, Aaron/0000-0002-2196-0831; Testa, Jeremy/0000-0003-0027-9761; Friedrichs, Marjorie/0000-0003-2828-7595; 													1051-0761	1939-5582				SEP	2021	31	6							e02384	10.1002/eap.2384	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eap.2384		JUL 2021						34128283					WOS:000675256200001

Mean levels of Cd, Cr, Zn, Pb, and Cu in fish muscle, except Mn and Ni, were below the benchmarks for safe limits as recommended by various authorities worldwide. In general, the metals' concentrations found during winter were comparatively higher than those of the other seasons. Correlation study exhibited diverse relationships among the metals in different seasons, and a few significant relationships were found between metal level and fish size. Potential noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks related to the metals in C. auratus were assessed using cancer risk-assessment guidelines approved by the US Environmental protection Agency. Although Mn and Ni concentrations exceeded the limits in some ponds, the calculated daily and weekly intakes of Cd, Cr, Zn, Pb, Cu, Mn, and Ni through fish consumption were significantly lower than the permissible limits. In relation to the noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks to human, health risks posed by metals in winter were much higher, and all the risks posed by heavy metals alone and in combination were lower than the safe limits. Consequently, consumption of C. auratus from the subsidence ponds on regular basis was considered safe.					; Liu, Guijian/M-9597-2014; Liu, XuKe/JAN-5517-2023; Li, Hui/AFQ-7299-2022	Li, Hui/0000-0003-0142-7500; Liu, Xuke/0000-0003-0197-4707; Liu, Guijian/0000-0002-3360-9424; 													2451-9766	2451-9685				MAR	2016	8	1					79	91		10.1007/s12403-015-0184-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12403-015-0184-4													WOS:000372551700008
J	An, YJ; Kampbell, DH; Breidenbach, GP				An, YJ; Kampbell, DH; Breidenbach, GP			Escherichia coli and total coliforms in water and sediments at lake marinas	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Escherichia coli, a fecal coliform, and total coliforms were monitored between September 1999 and October 2001 in five marinas at Lake Texoma, located on the Oklahoma and Texas border. The general trend was that densities of E. coli were lower in the summer season due to the lower loading of fecal material into Lake Texoma and the ecological conditions of the lake, such as more vigorous grazing by protozoa and less viability of E. coli at an elevated temperature. The densities of total coliforms greatly increased in the summer. E. coli levels increased with depth, and the bottom water samples had higher densities of E. coli mainly due to their association with particles. There was a direct relationship between amount of gasoline sold, which was related to recreational boating activity, and the resuspension of E. coli. This indicated that recreational boating activity in lake marinas may have resuspended bottom sediments with bound E. coli, and the presence of E. coli in marinas was not an indication of recent fecal contamination. E. coli were detected in the largest densities at the boat dock points, followed by the gasoline filling station, and marina entrance. In addition, enumeration of bacteria in bottom sediment showed that the densities of E. coli and total coliforms in sediment were much higher compared to those in lake water.

The abundances of five dominant rotifer species and their birth and death rates were analysed, together with changes in chl-a concentration, HNF, bacteria biomass and the abundances of predator and competitor species, from high frequency sampling. Development of loricated species (Keratella cochlearis, K. quadrata and Kellicottia longispina) was driven predominantly by food availability. The dominant soft-bodied species Polyarthra spp. and Synchaeta lakowitziana were affected predominantly through C. vicinus predation. The role of mechanical interference from D. galeata, although may be important in a limited periods was overclouded by predation and exploitative competition in general.

Depth integrated productivity (0-5 gC/m2 per day) increased with station depth, which together with visibility measurements indicated that light did not limit deep station productivity (C1 and C2). Macrophytes at station C5 (shallow) reduced the euphotic zone to Zero in June. On a unit depth basis, C5 was the most productive station. Apparently changes in macrophyte growth, regulated by light and temperature, controlled phytoplankton production. At C1, productivity was related to levels of different nutrients at different depths, the thermocline influencing nutrient availability at mid-depth. At S2, NH3-N controlled mid-depth productivity. Surface and mid-depth productivity appeared influenced by factors not measured in this study.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1980	70	1-2					95	101		10.1007/BF00015495	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00015495													WOS:A1980JT81700013

Lake Soyang is a deep warm monomictic reservoir with a dendritic shape, located in the Asian summer monsoon region, South Korea. During summer, the lake is stratified and receives a large nutrient input via storm runoff, which forms a turbid intermediate layer with high concentrations of suspended particles. The lake water, the main inflowing stream (the Soyang River), bottom sediment, and porewater of the lake sediments were studied over a 2-year period (2012-2013). After intensive monsoon rain events, particulate organic carbon (POC), total phosphorus (TP), and turbidity were high in the inflowing water (C: 1.21 mg L-1 in June 2013) and in the metalimnion (2.8 mg L-1, 17.6 mu g L-1, and 58.5 NTU, respectively in July 2013). Higher concentrations of iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) were also associated with the turbid intermediate layer (37 and 8 mu g L-1, respectively, in July 2013). During the summer stratification period, oxygen started to deplete in the hypoliminion (down to 0.5 mg L-1 in September 2013), and sediment became anoxic, showing negative oxidation redox potential (ORP) in core samples. Diffusion of dissolved inorganic P and ammonia from sediment to the water column can be substantial, considering the concentration difference between the porewater and hypolimnetic water. Fe and Mn were abundant in the sediment porewater at the dam site, implying inorganic nutrients and minerals are well transported along the 60 km long lake axis by the density current of storm runoff. Sulfate and reduced sulfur were larger in the porewater of the top sediment than in the lower layer of the sediment core (below 10 cm). The results show that substantial amounts of inorganic nutrients and minerals are supplied to the lake by storm runoffs during monsoon and distributed through the lake by a density current, controlling the material cycle and flux at the sediment surface.

These particles consisted largely of terrestrial insects, insect parts, and plant fragments of various sizes. This atmospheric fallout of P was greatest near the shoreline and decreased exponentially with increasing distance from shore. Integrated for the entire 15-ha lake, it represented an input of approximately 11-13-mu-mol P m-2 d-1 of lake surface in midsummer. The input of P from atmospheric fallout was highly significant to the summer P economy of the lake and was 50-fold to 70-fold greater than the input of P in either streamflow or rainfall in the same period.

Divergent outcomes following multi-year Phragmites australis management	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionLimited funds and compressed timelines frequently translate into a reliance on seed banks for native plant recovery following invasive plant management. This approach assumes: (a) baseline seed bank communities are sufficient for native plant recovery regardless of site environmental conditions; (b) different management actions variably impact native and invader seed banks; (c) management actions reduce invader seed banks; while (d) native seed banks do not decline following management; and (e) returning above-ground vegetation reflects the seed bank. Do these assumptions hold true in the context of invasive Phragmites australis management? LocationGreat Salt Lake wetlands, Utah, USA. MethodsAcross six sites, we applied six Phragmites management treatments (solarization, or glyphosate or imazapyr herbicide in the summer or fall with mowing) for three years, and monitored two more. Each year, we assessed the above-ground vegetation and seed bank using the seedling emergence method. ResultsSite environmental conditions drove baseline seed bank communities: seed banks differed substantially across sites with varying anthropogenic degradation as less disturbed sites had greater seed bank richness. Different management actions had similar impacts on native and invader seed banks. Phragmites seed density was reduced after herbicide treatments while native seed bank communities were unaffected. Above-ground vegetation generally reflected seed bank communities. However, native graminoids were present in seed banks but surprisingly rare above-ground. ConclusionCommonly held assumptions about invasive plant management and native recovery from the seed bank did not all hold true. Native seed banks were particularly insufficient for recovery at sites with greater degradation, suggesting managers should prioritize management at less degraded sites or consider revegetation in highly degraded sites. Despite reductions in Phragmites seed bank density, Phragmites propagule pressure remained high, requiring a long-term management commitment. Often seed banks are insufficient and revegetation of desired above-ground species is necessary to meet restoration goals.					; Hazelton, Eric/D-6599-2014; Kettenring, Karin/A-5829-2011	Kettenring, Karin/0000-0001-7080-0407; Reynolds, Laura K/0000-0002-4498-4641; Adams, Carrie/0000-0001-7707-7506; Hazelton, Eric/0000-0002-1205-8096; Rohal, Christine/0000-0003-2385-3121													1402-2001	1654-109X				OCT-DEC	2021	24	4							e12626	10.1111/avsc.12626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avsc.12626													WOS:000764249800015

It could be assumed that the intricate interconnections in hypersaline water ecosystems are easier to understand than in other aquatic ecosystems. Interannual differences vs small-scale spatiotemporal variabilities were studied in the spring zooplankton of hypersaline Lake Moynaki from 2019 to 2023. Salinity, water temperature, wind speed and direction were measured along with zooplankton sampling. The average spring wind speed and water temperature varied significantly from year to year, seemingly with a certain cyclicity. In total, 17 species were noted in zooplankton. The copepods Acanthocyclops vernalis and Arctodiaptomus salinus were not previously recorded in the lake. Bottom species were found in the plankton, among which the oligochaete Nais pseudobtusa, , the gastropod Bittium reticulatum, , and dragonfly larvae Gomphus sp. had not previously been found in the lake. Only four species, Gammarus aequicauda, , Eucypris mareotica, , Moina salina, , and Cletocamptus retrogressus were regularly observed en masse. On average, the total zooplankton abundance near the windward shore was 2 times higher than that near the leeward shore and the abundance of individual species was from 2 to 5 times higher. If the values near only one coast were used, then the range of interannual differences would be underestimated or overestimated by approximately 2-4 times. Based on the zooplankton similarity in different years, all years except 2019, are grouped into a single cluster. Various changes are occurring in the lake, which are difficult to present as a complete picture of the cause-and-effect relationships that determine them.

These pristine high latitude lacustrine systems serve as a natural laboratory to understand the interaction between hydrosphere, lithosphere and atmosphere thus providing valuable insights on the functioning of major biogeochemical cycles. A total of 14 fresh water lakes were identified and the water samples were analysed for its physico-chemical characteristics. The abundance of anions and cations in the lake water samples were in the following order of Cl- > HC3-) > SO42- // > NO3- and Na+/ > Mg+ > Ca2+/ > IC respectively. Moreover, the lakes exhibit slightly alkaline condition clue to dissolution of alkaline earth metals and atmospheric fallout. Na+ - Cl--HCO3- and Na+-Cl- are the commonly noticed water type in the study area and higher concentration of Na+ - Cl- were due to the effect of sea spray through marine aerosols. Reverse ion exchange is noticed in most of the lakes clue to saline influence. Three major mechanisms such as rock dominance, precipitation/snow and evaporation/sea spray controls the lake water geochemistry in the study area. Silicate weathering and evaporite dissolution also contribute ionic load to the lake water. Significant positive correlations (p > .01) among major ions reveal sources from bedrock weathering along with marine aerosols. Trace element chemistry shows that rock-water interaction is the primary source for dissolved metals in the lake water followed by long range atmospheric transport in the form of aeolian dust. Mineral groups such as evaporites, sulphates, carbonates, metal oxides and hydroxides are responsible for the dissolution of metal complexes in the lake water. Furthermore, lakes falling within a micro basin have shown higher Na+-Cl- content which is due to the catchment effect where snow enriched with sea spray melts during the austral summer feeding these lakes.

B.			Increased exposure of plankton to arsenic in contaminated weakly-stratified lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Arsenic, a priority Superfund contaminant and carcinogen, is a legacy pollutant impacting aquatic ecosystems in urban lakes downwind of the former ASARCO copper smelter in Ruston, WA, now a Superfund site. We examined the mobility of arsenic from contaminated sediments and arsenic bioaccumulation in phytoplankton and zoo plankton in lakes with varying mixing regimes. In lakes with strong seasonal thermal stratification, high aqueous arsenic concentrations were limited to anoxic bottom waters that formed during summer stratification, and arsenic concentrations were low in oxic surface waters. However, in weakly -stratified lakes, the entire water column, including the fully oxic surface waters, had elevated concentrations of arsenic (up to 30 ig L-1) during the summer. We found enhanced trophic transfer of arsenic through the base of the aquatic food web in weakly -stratified lakes; plankton in these lakes accumulated up to an order of magnitude more arsenic on multiple sampling days than plankton in stratified lakes with similar levels of contamination. We posit that greater bioaccumulation in weakly -stratified lakes was due to elevated arsenic in oxic waters. Aquatic life primarily inhabits oxic waters and in the oxic water column of weakly -stratified lakes arsenic was speciatecl as arsenate, which is readily taken up by phytoplanklon because of its structural similarities to phosphate.

Classification of hydrological regimes of northern floodplain basins (Peace -Athabasca Delta, Canada) from analysis of stable isotopes (δ18O, δ2H) and water chemistry	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												We used stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2) and water chemistry to characterize the water balance and hydrolimnological relationships of 57 shallow aquatic basins in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), northern Alberta, Canada, based on sampling at the end of the 2000 thaw season. Evaporation-to-inflow ratios (Ell) were estimated using an isotope mass-balance model tailored to accommodate basin-specific input water compositions, which provided an effective, first-order. quantitative framework for identifying water balances and associated limnological characteristics spanning three main, previously identified drainage types. Open-drainage basins (E/I < 0.4 n = 5). characterized by low alkalinity, low concentrations of nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ions, and high minerogenic turbidity, include large, shallow basins that dominate the interior of the PAD and experience frequent or Continuous river channel connection. Closed-drainage basins (E/I >= 1.0 n = 16), in contrast, possess high alkalinity and high concentrations of nitrogen, DOC. and ions, and low minerogenic turbidity, and are located primarily in the relict and infrequently flooded landscape of the northern Peace sector of the delta. Several basins fall into the restricted-drainage category (0.4 # E/I < 1.0; n = 26) with intermediate water chemistries and are predominant in the southern Athabasca sector, which is subject to active fluviodeltaic processes, including intermittent flooding front riverbank overflow. Integration of isotopic and limniological data also revealed evidence for a new fourth drainage type, mainly located near the large open-drainage takes that Occupy the central portion of the delta but within the Athabasca sector (n = 10). These basins were very shallow (< 50 cm deep) at the time of sampling and isotopically depleted, corresponding to Ell characteristic of restricted and open-drainage conditions. However, they are limnologically similar to closed-drainage basins except for hi,,her conductivity and higher concentrations of Ca2+ and Na+. and lower concentrations of SiO2 and chlorophyll c. These distinct features are due to the overriding influence of recent summer rainfall on the basin water balance and chemistry. The close relationships evident between water balances and limnological conditions suggest that past and future changes in hydrology are likely to be coupled with marked alterations in water chemistry and, hence, the ecology of aquatic environments in the PAD.

High-resolution pollen and conifer stoma data are presented from a sediment core (Tiancai Lake), located just below treeline in the Hengduan Mountains, northwestern Yunnan Province of China. These data record changes in vegetation and climate for the latest Pleistocene and Holocene (c. the last 12,230 cal. yr BP), and by comparing these results with the pollen records from the nearby Erhai Lake and Lugu Lake, a regional climate history in Yunnan Province can be inferred. During the period of 12,230-11,510 cal. yr BP, open alpine meadow around Tiancai Lake indicates a relatively cold and dry climate, corresponding to the Younger Dryas cold event (YD). Between 11,510 and 10,000 cal. yr BP, the vegetation types around Tiancai Lake changed into Picea and Abies forest and alpine Rhododendron shrubland, reflecting increases in the temperature and humidity. From similar to 10,000 to 6100 cal. yr BP, Tsuga forest expanded persistently toward Tiancai Lake, indicating further climate changed towards warmer and wetter conditions. Between 6100 and 3410 cal. yr BP, Tsuga forest was the dominant vegetation type nearest to Tiancai Lake, denoting warm and humid climatic conditions, corresponding to the Holocene climatic optimum in the northwestern Yunnan Province. Tsuga forest in mountains around Lugu Lake shrank quickly at 3410 cal. yr BP, reflecting significant decline of humidity. Since 2930 cal. yr BP, Tsuga forest around Tiancai Lake shrank gradually, indicating a fluctuating decrease of temperature. These climatic changes reflect changes of the southwest monsoon, namely, warm and humid climate indicating strong southwest monsoon, cold and dry climate denoting weak southwest monsoon.

Predicting Wave-Induced Sediment Resuspension at the Perimeter of Lakes Using a Steady-State Spectral Wave Model	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A steady-state spectral wave model, STWAVE, is evaluated as a tool for predicting wave-induced sediment resuspension in lake littoral zones. Steady-state wave height and bed-shear stress estimates are tested against 2years of high-frequency wave height and turbidity data from six littoral measurement stations in Lake Tahoe. Average wave and sediment resuspension response to a broad range of wind conditions are well captured by the model. Despite steady-state assumptions, the model reproduces patterns in wave height and sediment resuspension under time-varying wind conditions at sites with different wave exposure. Model results are insensitive to the measurement location of wind data input among six offshore meteorological buoys. Uniform and variable wind field assumptions yield similar resuspension predictions. Results representing the steady-state response to spatially uniform wind speed-direction combinations enable output from a single set of model runs to serve as a reasonable static reference for hindcasting and predicting wave resuspension patterns. This obviates the need for repeated model runs, making STWAVE output an efficient tool for exploring long-term spatio-temporal patterns in nearshore wave forcing. Application of this tool is limited by wave height overprediction for short fetches and presumably by the validity of uniform wind field assumptions over very long fetches. Applied successfully at Lake Tahoe, we find that the north and east shores, exposed to the prevailing southwesterly winds, see resuspension conditions upward of 3,000hr/year, while the south and west shores typically see less than 500. Location-specific resuspension hours can vary by upward of 200hr/year due to shifting interannual wind patterns. Plain Language Summary A tool that describes lake-wide wave conditions as a function of combinations of wind speeds and directions is tested using 2years of wave height and water clarity data from six nearshore locations at Lake Tahoe. The data confirm the modeling tool's ability to predict wave-driven resuspension of lake bed sediments. An example application details seasonal and interannual variability in wind wave influence at the perimeter of Lake Tahoe. Due to the prevailing southwesterly winds, exposed sections of the north and east shores of the lake can see in excess of 3,000hr of sediment resuspension-inducing wave conditions per year, while the south and west shores are comparatively calm. In representative year 2016, wave forcing was more prevalent in the fall and winter seasons.

In this study, based on Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating of surface sediments and AMS C-14 dating of terrestrial plant residues, we establish a robust age model that covers the last similar to 1500 years (AD 439-2012) at Lake Yihai in southwest China. We use analyses of multiple geochemical proxy indices, including loss on ignition at 550 degrees C, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratios, and stable carbon isotopes of organic matter to reconstruct changes in summer monsoon precipitation at Lake Yihai during the last similar to 1500 years. The results show that, over southwest China, warm and dry climate conditions prevailed during the MWP (AD 1000-1400) and the past 200 years, whereas conditions during the LIA (AD 1400-1800) were cold and wet. This is consistent with evidence from other geological records over southwest China, such as stalagmite and lake sediment data. Similar hydroclimatic patterns have occurred over the last 1500 years in adjacent tropical/subtropical monsoon regions where the climate is similarly dominated by the Indian summer monsoon (e.g., South China, the South China Sea, Southeast Asia, Northeast India). We suggest that the meridional migration of the mean position of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone, and El Nino/Southern Oscillation conditions which are linked to tropical Pacific sea surface temperature, are responsible for centennial-scale hydroclimatic patterns over southwest China and adjacent areas during the last 1500 years.

Effects of single and multiple applications of mosquito insecticides on nontarget arthropods	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION												Mosquito management plans have been implemented in the United States and globally to manage mosquito vectors of West Nile virus and many other diseases. However, there is public concern about ecological risks from using insecticides to manage mosquitoes. Two studies were conducted during the late summers of 2004 through 2006 at Benton Lake National Wildlife Refuge near Great Falls, MT. The first experiment was conducted in 2004 and 2005 to assess acute impacts of mosquito adulticides (permethrin and d-phenothrin) and larvicides (Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis and methoprene) on nontarget aquatic and terrestrial arthropods after a single application. The second experiment was conducted in 2005 and 2006 to assess longer-term impacts of permethrin on nontarget terrestrial arthropods after multiple repeated applications. For aquatic samples, in the first study, no overall treatment effects were observed despite a potentially deleterious effect on amphipods on sample date 1 in 2004. During the same study, 1 of 54 responses had a significant overall treatment effect for sticky-card samples. Many of the responses for sticky-card samples suggested significant time effects and time X treatment effects. Three response variables were associated with fewer individuals present in the insecticide-treated plots in a multivariate analysis. For the multiple-spray study conducted in 2005 and 2006, 6 of the response variables collected via sticky cards exhibited significant overall treatment effects, but none was associated with fewer individuals in the insecticide-treated plots. None of the responses collected using sweep-net sampling suggested overall treatment effects. Time and time X treatment effects were prevalent in 2005, but no discernable pattern was evident. In general, nearly all of the responses evaluated for either study indicated few, if any, deleterious effects from insecticide application.																			8756-971X	1943-6270				JUN	2008	24	2					270	280		10.2987/5654.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2987/5654.1								18666536					WOS:000256943600013
J	Kiro, Y; Goldstein, SL; Lazar, B; Stein, M				Kiro, Yael; Goldstein, Steven L.; Lazar, Boaz; Stein, Mordechai			Environmental implications of salt facies in the Dead Sea	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Thick sequences of salt (halite) have been recovered in a 456-m-long core drilled at the deepest floor of the Dead Sea by the Dead Sea Deep Drilling Project and extending similar to 200 k.y. back in time. The salt sequences were precipitated in the ancient lake that occupied the Dead Sea Basin during the last three interglacials during intervals of extreme aridity in the lake's watershed. The salt layers alternate with "mud" layers that indicate wetter periods in the watershed, when floods transported fine detritus matter to the lake. The salt sources include brine discharge and freshwater runoff that dissolved halite units. Dissolved salts accumulated in the lake during glacials and relatively wet periods when the lake expanded, and precipitated during interglacials when the lake levels dropped. This study establishes for the first time the evaporite facies and sedimentological features of the deep Dead Sea brine during interglacial periods, by using the modern precipitation of halite in the Dead Sea as an analogue for past halite depositional periods as recorded in the drill core. The halite intervals provide a record of facies characterizing a deep-water evaporitic environment. The halite layers consist mainly of two types of crystals: small cumulate crystals containing halite rafts, which indicate precipitation from the surface brine of the lake (epilimnion), and bottom-growth (usually large) halite crystals that precipitated on the lake floor (hypolimnion). The layers of small halite crystals formed during drier periods as compared to the bottom-growth crystals. The bottom-growth halite crystals contain variable quantities of detritus and show mild dissolution structures at the contact between the mud and the halite crystals. These two main types of halite, in combination with "muds" and gypsum, comprise seven categories of salt facies that reflect the hydrological conditions (dry-to-wet), and that display a cyclic (decadal to millennial) pattern along the sampled core intervals. Frequent alternation of these two salt crystal types suggests seasonal changes, whereby the small cumulate crystals were formed during the summer, and the bottom-growth crystals were formed during the winter, when the surface temperatures of the lake were low, and the surface water was less saline and less likely to be saturated with respect to halite. Comparison of the last interglacial halite with the modern halite facies, together with the absence of significant dissolution features within the halite and the cyclic nature of the facies, indicates that the lake was continuously deep (>100 m) during the last 200 k.y.					; Stein, Mordechai/AAJ-3200-2020	Kiro, Yael/0000-0002-4646-9221; Goldstein, Steven L/0000-0001-7252-8064; 													0016-7606	1943-2674				MAY	2016	128	5-6					824	841		10.1130/B31357.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B31357.1													WOS:000375212200009

Forecasting the combined effects of anticipated climate change and agricultural conservation practices on fish recruitment dynamics in Lake Erie	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Many aquatic ecosystems are experiencing multiple anthropogenic stressors that threaten their ability to support ecologically and economically important fish species. Two of the most ubiquitous stressors are climate change and non-point source nutrient pollution. Agricultural conservation practices (ACPs, i.e. farming practices that reduce runoff, prevent erosion, and curb excessive nutrient loading) offer a potential means to mitigate the negative effects of non-point source pollution on fish populations. However, our understanding of how ACP implementation amidst a changing climate will affect fish production in large ecosystems that receive substantial upstream sediment and nutrient inputs remains incomplete. Towards this end, we explored how anticipated climate change and the implementation of realistic ACPs might alter the recruitment dynamics of three fish populations (native walleye Sander vitreus and yellow perch Perca flavescens and invasive white perch Morone americana) in the highly productive, dynamic west basin of Lake Erie. We projected future (2020-2065) recruitment under different combinations of anticipated climate change (n = 2 levels) and ACP implementation (n = 4 levels) in the western Lake Erie catchment using predictive biological models driven by forecasted winter severity, spring warming rate, and Maumee River total phosphorus loads that were generated from linked climate, catchment-hydrology, and agricultural-practice-simulation models. In general, our models projected reduced walleye and yellow perch recruitment whereas invasive white perch recruitment was projected to remain stable or increase relative to the recent past. Our modelling also suggests the potential for trade-offs, as ACP implementation was projected to reduce yellow perch recruitment with anticipated climate change. Overall, our study presents a useful modelling framework to forecast fish recruitment in Lake Erie and elsewhere, as well as offering projections and new avenues of research that could help resource management agencies and policy-makers develop adaptive and resilient management strategies in the face of anticipated climate and land-management change.					; Robertson, Dale/O-1913-2018; Aloysius, Noel/HPG-9859-2023; Daggupati, Prasad/D-8886-2017; Yen, Haw/K-6809-2014; Ludsin, Stuart/F-2925-2010	Sowa, Scott/0000-0002-5425-2591; Yen, Haw/0000-0002-5509-8792; Robertson, Dale/0000-0001-6799-0596; Fraker, Michael/0000-0002-1813-706X; Dippold, David/0000-0002-4240-8704; Aloysius, Noel/0000-0002-9094-427X; Daggupati, Prasad/0000-0002-7044-3435; Martin, Jay/0000-0002-1599-5931; Keitzer, Steven/0000-0002-8164-4099													0046-5070	1365-2427				SEP	2020	65	9					1487	1508		10.1111/fwb.13515	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.13515		MAY 2020											WOS:000531852000001

Conservation implications of long-distance migration routes: Regional metapopulation structure, asymmetrical dispersal, and population declines	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Understanding and conserving metapopulations of long-distance migrants is challenging since breeding population structure may not be delimited simply by geography, but also by migration or wintering distributions. We present the first study of the relative importance of breeding, migration and wintering distributions for regional metapopulation processes in breeding areas. Using a species for which life-history and demography are extensively studied (common terns Sterna hirundo), we explored population genetics across eastern North America to distinguish between these potential drivers of metapopulation structure, understand recent population declines in inland areas, and direct appropriate conservation efforts. We analyzed nuclear and mitochondrial DNA to determine changes in population structure and dispersal over prehistoric, historical and contemporary time at regional, sub-regional and local spatial scales. We found evidence for conservation-relevant, hierarchical metapopulation structure within breeding areas: at (i) local and sub-regional scales resulting from restricted dispersal distances, and (ii) between inland and coastal regions as a result of non-breeding distributions. Crucially, at regional scales (ii), asymmetrical dispersal rates from inland to coastal colonies have increased ten-fold since the 1960s, contributing to recent, largely-enigmatic inland population declines. Migrating inland common terns pass over coastal colonies but the reverse is not true. Thus, asymmetrical dispersal from inland to coastal areas provides the first demonstration that migration routes, not wintering distributions, are drivers of breeding population structure in the absence of physical barriers. Our results illustrate the conservation importance of this determination for long-distance migrants: definitive evidence connecting metapopulation demographics to regional population declines for common terns, previously only speculated at despite >100 years of banding effort.

A survey of microtopography within and around a remnant fragment of lakeshore vegetation revealed that, over a large range, the habitat is frequently inundated in spring under the current water regime, although it was rarely inundated under past water regimes. Analysis of the patterns of seedling emergence and establishment at microsites at various elevations revealed a significant negative correlation between number of inundation days and abundance or species-richness of seedlings that emerged in the spring. Most seedling deaths occurred when the study site was inundated. We suggest that regeneration failure caused by the artificial raising of the lake's water level is one of the principal mechanisms of the recent vegetational decline in the lake.

Charophytic algae use bicarbonate in photosynthesis, and direct variable proportions to assimilate organic carbon and to precipitate calcium carbonate on their surfaces. To evaluate pools of organic carbon (C-org), carbonate carbon (C-carbonate), and phosphorus (P) in dense charophyte vegetation, we studied apical and basal tissue and carbonate surface precipitates, as well as underlying sediments in ten calcareous ponds. We also quantified the release of calcium, bicarbonate and phosphate from charophyte shoots in dark experiments. We found that the C-org:C-carbonate quotient in charophyte stands averaged 1.19 during spring and summer. The C-org:C-carbonate quotient in the sediments formed by dead charophytes averaged 0.97 in accordance with some respiratory CO2 release without carbonate dissolution to bicarbonate. The molar quotient of carbon to calcium was close to 2.0 in sediment and pond water. In dark incubations, shoots subjected to calcium carbonate dissolution released bicarbonate and calcium with a molar quotient of 2:1; lowered pH (7.0-8.0) increased the release. Thus, the carbonate surface crust on living charophytes was not inert, as hitherto anticipated. Phosphate dark release occurred from basal shoots only, was unrelated to pH, and may have derived from organic decomposition, rather than from carbonate dissolution. Extensive phosphorus pools were associated with the charophyte stands (200-600 mg m(-2)) and had about 2/3 incorporated in alga tissue and 1/3 in carbonate crust. Overall, the biogeochemistry of carbon, calcium and phosphorus are closely linked in calcareous charophyte ponds. Carbonate dissolution from charophyte crusts at night and continuously from sediment might balance extensive carbonate precipitation during daytime photosynthesis. The substantial P-pool in charophyte stands may not derive from P-deprived water, but from P-rich sediment. Charophyte photosynthesis may still contribute to nutrient-poor conditions by forming carbonate-rich sediment of high P-binding capacity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Documentation of the presence of Gmelinoides fasciatus (Stebbing, 1899) and the native benthic fauna in the Volga River at Tver (Tver Region, Russia)	AQUATIC INSECTS					Aquatic Insects Symposium/9th European Congress of Entomology	AUG 22-27, 2010	Budapest, HUNGARY	Hungarian Entomol Soc, Hungarian Nat Hist Museum (HNHM), Hungarian Acad Sci (HAS), Plant Protect Inst, Univ Pecs, Dept Ecol & Hydrobiol, Univ Pecs, Rector, Hungarian Acad Sci (HAS), Balaton Limnol Res Inst, Univ Debrecen, Dept Hydrobiol				In the Volga Basin, the small Baikalian amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus was introduced in 1965 into the Gorky reservoir in order to enhance fish production; it appeared in 1986 in the Rybinsk reservoir and we recorded it during monitoring activities in 2006 at Tver. In total, at the monitoring site Tver/Migalovo 69 benthic invertebrate taxa were identified. We compared data from three summer seasons. During summer low flow period Gmelinoides fasciatus did not exceed a share of 12.6% considering individual (ind) densities (mean abundance 165 +/- 104 ind m(-2)) and 14.2% considering biomass (mean biomass 0.39 +/- 0.44 g m(-2)). Abundances and biomass of G. fasciatus were shown to be stable over three years and no increase was observed. The monthly dataset (March-November 2008) revealed dynamics in relation to the native benthic communities and it was shown that the maximal densities of Gmelinoides did not exceed 587 ind m(-2). Understanding the effects on benthic communities caused by the invasive amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus is crucial in order to predict further developments in European inland waters and to establish management strategies.

J	Son, S; Wang, MH				Son, Seunghyun; Wang, Menghua			Ice Detection for Satellite Ocean Color Data Processing in the Great Lakes	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Satellite remote-sensing data are essential for monitoring and quantifying water properties in the Great Lakes, providing useful monitoring and management tools for understanding water optical, biological, and ecological processes and phenomena. However, during the winter season, large parts of the Great Lakes are often covered by ice, which can cause significant uncertainties in satellite-measured water quality products. Although some developed radiance-based ice-detection algorithms for satellite ocean color data processing can eliminate most of the ice pixels in a region, there are still some significant errors due to misidentification of ice-contaminated pixels, particularly for the thin ice-covered regions. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the ice-detection methods for satellite ocean color data processing in the Great Lakes. In this paper, impacts of ice contamination on satellite-derived ocean color products in the Great Lakes are investigated, and a refined regional ice-detection algorithm which is based on the radiance spectra and normalized water-leaving radiance at the wavelength of 551 nm, nLw(551), is developed and assessed for satellite ocean color data processing in the Great Lakes. Results show that this proposed ice-detection method can reasonably identify ice-contaminated pixels, including those in very thin ice-covered regions, and provide accurate satellite ocean color products for the winter season in the Great Lakes.					; Wang, Menghua/F-5631-2010	, unhson/0009-0007-3335-7566; Wang, Menghua/0000-0001-7019-3125													0196-2892	1558-0644				DEC	2017	55	12					6793	6804		10.1109/TGRS.2017.2734079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2734079													WOS:000417363100011

We used respondent driven sampling (RDS) to sample this hard-to reach population for the first Biomonitoring of Great Lakes Populations program. In the current study, we examined the interview data and assessed the effectiveness of RDS to sample the unique population. Methods: In 2013, we used RDS to sample 205 Burmese refugees and immigrants residing in Buffalo, New York who consumed fish caught from Great Lakes waters. RDS-adjusted population estimates of sociodemographic characteristics, residential history, fish consumption related behaviors, and awareness of fish advisories were obtained. We also examined sample homophily and equilibrium to assess how well the RDS assumptions were met in the study. Results: Our sample was diverse with respect to sex, age, years residing in Buffalo, years lived in a refugee camp, education, employment, and fish consumption behaviors, and each of these variables reached equilibrium by the end of recruitment. Burmese refugees in Buffalo consumed Great Lakes fish throughout the year; a majority of them consumed the fish more than two times per week during summer, and about one third ate local fish more than once per week in winter. An estimated 60% of Burmese refugees in Buffalo had heard about local fish advisories. Conclusions: RDS has the potential to be an effective methodology for sampling refugees and immigrants in conducting biomonitoring and environmental exposure assessment. Due to high fish consumption and limited awareness and knowledge of fish advisories, some refugee and immigrant populations are more susceptible to environmental contaminants. Increased awareness on local fish advisories is needed among these populations.																			1438-4639	1618-131X				JUN	2018	221	5					792	799		10.1016/j.ijheh.2018.04.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2018.04.014								29789260					WOS:000440394100005

Changes in Salt Composition of Soils under Irrigation with Brackish Water in the Steppe Crimea	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												influence of brackish artesian waters used for drip irrigation of gardens in the Sivash area of Crimea on the composition of salts and exchangeable cations of two soils located at different distances from Lake Sivash has been studied. Observations of the dynamics of mineralization and salt composition of irrigation water during three years (2019-2021) indicate that this water is neutral (pH 6.88-7.43) and slightly to moderately saline (1.5-3.4 g/L) with variable chemical composition of soluble salts: calcium chloride & mdash; sodium sulfate-chloride & mdash;calcium sulfate. Water salinity increases with time and towards Lake Sivash. The high contents of chlorides (15-25 meq/L), sulfates (6-31 meq/L), and Ca2+ (14-26 meq/L) and a stable and relatively low concentration of HCO3-(3 meq/L) are characteristic of the irrigation water. Local moistening of soils during drip irrigation has favored local slight sulfate-chloride and chloride magnesium-sodium salinization in a layer of 0-60 cm, which is toxic for fruit crops. The total salt content in the soil has a pulsating regime: it increases in the fall after the irrigation season and decreases in the spring due to salt leaching by atmospheric precipitation deep into the profile and to the sides from tree rows. Slightly brackish water of this salt composition with a salinity of 1.5-2.7 g/L and SAR 2-4 has led to solonetzization of Haplic Kastanozem with an increase in the content of exchangeable Na+ up to 6-8% of the sum of exchangeable cations. Irrigation water with salinity above 3 g/L and SAR 3-7 increases the content of exchangeable Na+ up to 9-10% of the sum of exchangeable cations in a slightly solonetzic Luvic Kastanozem. Under conditions of progressive salinization of irrigation water and soils, it is necessary to continue monitoring of the salt composition and ion exchange processes in irrigated soils.

J	SLY, PG				SLY, PG			EXPERIMENTAL USE OF DIALYSIS CHAMBER ARRAYS TO STUDY P-FLUXES IN THE BAY OF QUINTE, 1987	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												To study the internal phosphorus load in the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario, dialysis chambers were set in an array mounted on a platform at the sediment/water interface. Two sets of arrays were used, one set was sampled weekly and the other bi-weekly. Chamber samples were analysed for total phosphorus and dissolved oxygen, and temperature and pH were measured. Upfacing array tubes also acted as settling traps and, from these, quantities of trapped material and contents of organic carbon and organic nitrogen were measured. Sediment samples were recovered at the array sites, and temperature, pH, Eh, color, and near surface layer structures were recorded. The arrays were used to estimate proportions of the internal phosphorus load derived from degradation of fresh particulates, at or near the base of the water column, and partly aged bed material. Phosphorus released from partly aged lake bed sediment provided about 20 percent of the internal load at Hay Bay, but the bed acted as a sink for much of the time at Picton. At Hay Bay, sediment oxygen consumption rates were high, averaging more than 0.6 g O2 m-2 d-1. Higher oxygen consumption rates characterized Picton sediments during the late summer and early fall, and these were accompanied by a slight increase in the rate of phosphorus release. Combined mean P-reflux values derived from these experiments were higher than expected from model predictions based on past Bay of Quinte studies. The higher values may be caused by very rapid degradation to trapped material in the up-facing array tubes due to the presence of excessive numbers of benthic invertebrates.																			0380-1330						1990	16	2					258	270		10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71419-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(90)71419-0													WOS:A1990DL43700007
J	Leng, MJ; Metcalfe, SE; Davies, SJ				Leng, MJ; Metcalfe, SE; Davies, SJ			Investigating late holocene climate variability in central mexico using carbon isotope ratios in organic materials and oxygen isotope ratios from diatom silica within lacustrine sediments	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Previous studies have shown that moisture availability in the central highlands of Mexico during the last 3000 years has been highly variable, but evidence remains ambiguous since the climatic signal is partially masked by that of human activity. Here we use two isotope systems to provide evidence for environmental change in Laguna Zacapu, Michoacan covering this time period. Carbon isotope ratios of organic material suggest that there have been fluctuations in the carbon pool related to plant productivity, possibly as a result of changes in the abundance of aquatic plants around the lake margins. The drainage basin and lake have been managed intensively during the 20th century. Lake level apparently fell during the early part of the century, but has been artificially controlled since the 1950s. The oxygen isotope ratios from diatom silica should provide the more unambiguous climate signal, although we show that the interpretation of the diatom oxygen isotope record is far from straight forward. Zacapu is a spring-fed, non-evaporating system and changes in delta O-18(diatom) are likely to be a function of changes in delta O-18 of precipitation, due to either temperature and salinity variation in the Gulf of Mexico (associated with changes in the Bond cycles from the North Atlantic or the Loop current from the Carribean) and/or changing moisture contributions from different air masses (Gulf of Mexico vs. Pacific). Changes in the Gulf of Mexico are possibly at a resolution comparable to the periodicity we see in the delta O-18(diatom) record, although without better dating the comparison is speculative.

During a period of high adult walleye abundance and declining phosphorus loading (1976-1982); we observed a decline in the abundance of later hatching forage fish species (e.g., July) and those species that did not shift their diets from zooplankton to benthos during the summer of their life. During years of high young-of-the-year (YOY) white perch abundance (1983-1990), forage fishes whose hatching dates and (or) diet overlapped with YOY white perch declined in abundance. When the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) became abundant (1991-1995), most forage fishes showed no change in abundances. Given a YOY's ability to switch to benthos during summer, the date on which this occurred was determined by a combination of zooplankton abundance and fish size. Hence, the dates individual taxa of fish hatch relative to seasonal cycles of zooplankton abundance and the size at which they can undergo an ontogenetic diet shift to benthos and (or) fish could be influencing fish growth and recruitment and need to be incorporated into YOY recruitment models.																			0706-652X					DEC	1998	55	12					2572	2579		10.1139/cjfas-55-12-2572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-55-12-2572													WOS:000078455500005

We surveyed the fish fauna of a spring pond in Hopong in 2016, 2019 and 2020 and identified 25 species. Of these, seven, including Inlecypris auropurpureus and Sawbwa resplendens, had been considered endemic to Inle Lake and at least three species were genetically unique. Eight were suspected or definite introduced species, including Oreochromis niloticus and Gambusia affinis. We were unable to identify a nemacheilid species of the genus Petruichthys, which would need a taxonomic examination. The Hopong area is being developed rapidly and, hence, it is crucial to conserve its native fish species and the freshwater ecosystems.					; Fuke, Yusuke/JOK-0200-2023	Kano, Yuichi/0000-0001-7158-753X; Fuke, Yusuke/0000-0001-6404-6241; 													1314-2836	1314-2828				APR 5	2022	10								e80101	10.3897/BDJ.10.e80101	http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.10.e80101								35437404					WOS:000783784500002

Accelerator mass spectrometry(14)C data were determined to set an age-depth model after removing about 1920 years of the carbon reservoir effect. Based on the multi-proxies grain size, carbonate-content, total organic carbon-content, ratio of C/N, ratios of Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca, and carbonate carbon and oxygen isotopes, paleoenvironmental changes since the last deglaciation were reconstructed. Tengger Nuur was very shallow during the last deglaciation under a cool and wet climate, especially during the interval of the cold Younger Dryas event. Although, temperature and humidity increased from the early Holocene (similar to 10,450-8750 cal a BP), low lake levels indicated that the summer monsoon was not sufficiently strong to reach the modern monsoon boundary in Inner Mongolia. High monsoon precipitation caused lake expansion during 8750-5000 cal a BP, but the lake level oscillated in a shallow state under high evaporation. A low lake-level event occurred with the interval of a cold-wet climate during 5450-5100 cal a BP. The summer monsoon receded gradually to maintain a deep lake under high effective humidity during 5000-2000 cal a BP, punctuated by low lake-level events at intervals of 4300-3980 cal a BP and 3700-2750 cal a BP. With the arrival of the cold and dry westerly after 2000 cal a BP, lakes shrank gradually to become salinized or completely desiccated, but their levels oscillated at shallow depths during the four periods of 1900-1800 cal a BP, 1500-1050 cal a BP, 550-400 cal a BP (Little Ice Age), and 100 cal a BP-AD 1985. Therefore, the eastern summer monsoon was weak in the early Holocene, and lake-level oscillation was controlled by effective humidity in arid and semi-arid areas.					zhang, chengjun/HHC-4054-2022															2296-6463				AUG 7	2020	8								314	10.3389/feart.2020.00314	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2020.00314													WOS:000563330400001

Intensive fish and shrimp farming, being defined as throughput-based systems, have a continuous or pulse release of nutrients that adds to coastal eutrophication. As an alternative treatment solution, seaweeds can be used to clean the dissolved part of this effluent. Two examples of successfully using seaweeds as biofilters in intensive mariculture systems are discussed in this paper. The first example shows that Gracilaria co-cultivated with salmon in a tank system reached production rates as high as 48.9 kg m(-2) a(-1), and could remove 50% of the dissolved ammonium released by the fish in winter, increasing to 90-95% in spring. In the second example, Gracilaria cultivated on ropes near a 22-t fish cage farm, had up to 40% higher growth rate (specific growth rate of 7% d(-1)) compared to controls. Extrapolation of the results showed that a 1 ha Gracilaria culture gave an annual harvest of 34 t (d. wt), and assimilated 6.5% of the released dissolved nitrogen. This production and assimilation was more than twice that of a Gracilaria monoculture. By integrating seaweeds with fish farming the nutrient assimilating capacity of an area increases. With increased carrying capacity it will be possible to increase salmon cage densities before risking negative environmental effects like eutrophication and toxic algal blooms sometimes associated with the release of dissolved nutrients. The potential for using mangroves and/or seaweeds as filters for wastes from intensive shrimp pond farming is also discussed. It is concluded that such techniques, based on ecological engineering, seems promising for mitigating environmental impacts from intensive mariculture; however, continued research on this type of solution is required.

The cooling effect of the meltwater drainage suppressed summer warming of the surface lake waters, reduced the growing season and thus altered the vegetation composition in the surrounding land areas. The vegetation responded in different ways as evidenced by five variants from the normal Pollen succession.The pollen anomalies are most pronounced where the effect of increased meltwater discharge had a strong influence, such as within or along the margins of Lake Agassiz, Mattawa phase lakes, and the Goldthwait Sea, or in their lee areas, especially where these water bodies intersected ecotonal boundaries. Climatic effects were minimal or non-existent where the water surface areas were restricted such as the channelized drainage routes of the Ottawa and St. Lawrence rivers.

Fruits, among them plums, were originally grown in the gardens of monasteries established in Scandinavia in the period from 1100-1500. Plums became an important fruit in many districts from late in the XVIIIth century, and reached more than one million trees around World War II. Hardanger is the main fruit growing district of Norway. The growers run small family operated farms of 2-5 hectares where most of the labour is carried out by the family members. They grow the four fruit species sweet cherries, plums, pears and apples to employ workers during a long harvesting season. The Norwegian plum production totals 1000 tons, some more in a good cropping year, of which all is sold for fresh consumption. It has had a small increase over the last years and is now the second in size of the Norwegian fruit crops in regard of tons. The main plum growing areas along the west coast of Norway benefits strongly from the mild Gulf stream in the Atlantic Ocean; without it, fruit growing would not be possible at latitudes 58 62 degrees N. It protects from winter frosts, and a late flowering period makes blossom frost very rare. Shortage of water in early summer occurs, but is compensated for with irrigation; snow and lakes in the mountains provide abundance of water in most districts. Fruit orchards are established mainly on landslip soils and moraines which are warm with good drainage. The two main plum cultivars grown over the last decades are 'Opal' and 'Victoria', and St. Julien A is the predominating rootstock in use to plums. The traditional plum tree grown in Norway is a spindle shaped tree, spaced 2 x 4.5 m or 1.75 x 4 m depending on the cultivar. The fruit districts of western Norway are important tourist destinations, and the tourist industry has a turnover counting many times that of fruit production. The fruit growing is an important part of the total marketing of this region as a tourist destination. In this respect, fruit production in Norway is important beyond the value of the crop itself.																			0567-7572	2406-6168	978-90-6605-107-2				2007		734					23	28		10.17660/ActaHortic.2007.734.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2007.734.1													WOS:000246177100001

Threat of glacial lake outburst flood to Tehsil Gupis from Khukush Lake, District Ghizer, Gilgit Baltistan, Pakistan	NATURAL HAZARDS												Glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) is a powerful natural phenomenon that is very active in the Karakoram and Himalayas. This paper presents a case study from Gupis Tehsil in northern areas of Pakistan that is exposed to GLOFs from nine different glacial lakes in its upper catchment areas. Khukush Lake being the largest of all the glacial lakes has been studied and a flood attenuation model has been created for the whole Gupis Tehsil. This lake covers almost 2.2 km(2) of surface area, and its calculated volume is 2.6 x 10(4) m(3). In case of its outburst, the peak flow discharge is calculated to be 7,642 m(3)/s. The catchment area which contributes water and debris to the lake is 170 km(2). This lake is dammed by a glacial moraine, which is not strong enough to sustain the pressure for a longer period of time. Other factors that are reducing the reliability of the dam are the secondary hazards which are in direct contact with the lake, and in case of their reactivation, they can put severe impacts on the dam. There are eight potential sites of the snow avalanche activity where debris along with snow may fall directly into the lake producing a strong wave. This strong wave of water will increase the pressure on the dam and ultimately will increase the probability for its outburst. The presense of water springs towards the downstream side of the natural dam also indicate the presence of hidden channels passing through the dam which may weaken the shear strength of the dam. Almost 24 villages settled along either sides of the Gupis River are critically studied for the expected flood from Khukush Lake. With few exceptions, almost 20-25 % area of all the villages will be affected from this flood.

The Nordic climate and the deeply nature-concerned culture within which he lived are factors that derived a conscious design method characterised by the exploration of environmental concepts. The contextual approach was developed since his early career and reached a peak in his own summer house erected in Finland in the year 1953. As Aalto himself comments, this building had the advantage of being the 'experimental game' of the architect, where he could freely work without worrying about the constraints of usual project requirements.(2) The biography of Aalto shows that he used to help his father, who was a surveyor, by drawing plans from the Finnish territory.(3) Aalto himself grew up in Jyvaskyla, a town located on the same lake studied here, and worked there in the first years of his professional career. He was familiar with the landscape and knew well in advance the general features of the house's surroundings. The Summer House is a well-known building that has drawn attention in the academic context. Aalto published a seminal, brief text when the construction of the main block was finished, where experiments concerning topographical adaptation, material durability, and solar heating passive systems are mentioned.(4) After appearing in the complete work of the architect,(5) the Summer House was briefly mentioned in critical literature,(6) and in recent years has been the subject of numerous studies.(7) This panorama has contributed important information about the site and the house, which were, nevertheless, considered mainly by aesthetical and typological means. The bioclimatic themes seem to have not been systematically explored yet. The present essay seeks to identify and explain some design strategies that can illustrate the bioclimatic structure of the building.(8) The textual argumentation is supported by photographs, diagrams, and a physical model. An introduction to the house is given by describing its geographical and programmatic situation. The study is then developed through the following topics: site and program; placement; spatial organization; and exterior-interior relations. As a conclusion, the house is evaluated as a precedent of an environmentally-concerned architecture.																			1552-6100						2012	7	2					64	73		10.3992/jgb.7.2.64	http://dx.doi.org/10.3992/jgb.7.2.64													WOS:000310913000005

Sampling was conducted at two sampling sites: in the main lake (Site 1: Lake) and in an adjacent man-made water ski lake with karstic springs (Site 2: Springs). Samples were fractionated into three size classes: 0.2-2 mu m (pico), 2-20 mu m (nano) and 20-180 mu m (micro). According to chlorophyll a values, eutrophic to hypereutrophic conditions prevail at Site 1 and oligotrophic to mesotrophic conditions - at Site 2. Similarly, Site 1 was distinguished by higher concentration of phycocyanin compared to Site 2. Fractionated chlorophyll a showed monthly variations at Site 1 with alternations in the dominance between the two larger fractions. The maximum of the 0.2-2 mu m fraction was observed in October but it contributed less to the total chlorophyll a content than nano- or microphytoplankton. Its contribution was higher at Site 2, reaching occasionally similar to 40% of the bulk chlorophyll a. However, nanophytoplankton was the fraction found to respond faster when disturbances occurred. At Site 1, phycocyanin correlated well with total chlorophyll a as well as with the micro- and nanophytoplankton fractions, indicating that cyanobacteria represent art important component of the large-sized phytoplankton in Lake Pamvotis.

The source of the assimilable organic carbon (AOC) needed for this growth is not known. Evidence is provided that AOC is generated by ozone treatment of cyanobacteria present in the raw water which are disrupted during ozonation. Firstly, bacterial growth correlates with the presence of cyanobacteria at the intake during the winter months and secondly, the quantification of specific phytoplankton pigments, as a parameter for intact biomass, suggests that cells of cyanobacteria are readily disrupted by ozone treatment whereas other phytoplankton cells, such as diatoms, are more resistant to ozone. it is proposed that the released cellular content of phytoplankton provides the AOC source for bacterial growth.																			0003-7214					AUG	2003	52	5					333	340		10.2166/aqua.2003.0031	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/aqua.2003.0031													WOS:000185181900002

Studies on the high-resolution profile variations and release mechanisms of P at the sediment-water interface (SWI) are rare in these reservoirs until now. In this study, monthly monitoring (Nov 2017 to Oct 2018) using a composite diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT) technique was taken to determine the temporal and vertical profile variations of the DGT-labile P (Fe) at the SWI in Hongfeng Reservoir. The results showed that the average concentrations of the DGT-labile P (Fe) in surface sediments were 0.63 +/- 024 mg.L-1 and 4.61 +/- 1.12 mg.L-1, respectively, with significantly higher concentrations during the summer anoxic period than that during the winter aerobic period. The DGT-labile P (Fe) concentrations in sediments presented a significant positive correlation (r(2) > 0.70, p < 0.001), supporting the simultaneous release of reactive P and reactive Fe from the sediments and indicating that the reductive dissolution of ironbound P dominates the P release from sediments. The release rates of P ranged from 0.01 mg.m(-2)d(-1) to 0.83 mg.m(-2)d(-1) (mean: 0.22 mg.m(-2)d(-1)) in Hongfeng Reservoir, which are higher than that in heavily eutrophic shallow lakes in eastern China, such as Lake Taihu. There is a higher P loading, stronger P reactivity, faster P release rates, and higher pollution potential in deep reservoirs of southwestern China than that in natural shallow lakes of eastern China, highlighting the importance and urgency of treating internal P pollution in deep reservoirs. Further studies on the mechanisms and controlling factors of the coupled Fe-P-S cycle in deep reservoirs are desirable in the future, so as to provide a scientific foundation for exploring effective internal P treatment techniques adaptive to deep reservoirs in southwestern China.

Occupancy and Abundance of Wintering Birds in a Dynamic Agricultural Landscape	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Assessing wildlife management action requires monitoring populations, and abundance often is the parameter monitored. Recent methodological advances have enabled estimation of mean abundance within a habitat using presence-absence or count data obtained via repeated visits to a sample of sites. These methods assume populations are closed and intuitively assume habitats within sites change little during a field season. However, many habitats are highly variable over short periods. We developed a variation of existing occupancy and abundance models that allows for extreme spatio-temporal differences in habitat, and resulting changes in wildlife abundance, among sites and among visits to a site within a field season. We conducted our study in sugarcane habitat within the Everglades Agricultural Area southeast of Lake Okeechobee in south Florida. We counted wintering birds, primarily passerines, within 245 sites usually 5 times at each site during December 2006-March 2007. We estimated occupancy and mean abundance of birds in 6 vegetation states during the sugarcane harvest and allowed these parameters to vary temporally or spatially within a vegetation state. Occupancy and mean abundance of the common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) was affected by structure of sugarcane and uncultivated edge vegetation (occupancy = 1.00 [95% CI = 0.96-1.00] and mean abundance = 7.9 [95% CI = 3.2-19.5] in tall sugarcane with tall edge vegetation versus 0.20 [95% CI = 0.04-0.71] and 0.22 [95% CI = 0.04-1.2], respectively, in short sugarcane with short edge vegetation in one half of the study area). Occupancy and mean abundance of palm warblers (Dendroica palmarum) were constant (occupancy = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.69-1.00; mean abundance = 18, 95% CI = 1-270). Our model may enable wildlife managers to assess rigorously effects of future edge habitat management on avian distribution and abundance within agricultural landscapes during winter or the breeding season. The model may also help wildlife managers make similar management decisions involving other dynamic habitats such as wetlands, prairies, and even forested areas if forest management or fires occur during the field season.

This motivated the organisation of NOPEX (Northern hemisphere climate-Processes land-surface Experiment) in the southern part of the European boreal zone. This paper summarises results from NOPEX in its first phase, dealing with spring- and summertime conditions. Two concentrated field efforts (CFE1 on 27 May-23 June 1994, CFE2 on 18 April-14 July 1995) were carried out with coordinated measurements of energy, water, and CO2 budgets at 13 ground-based sites and at various airborne platforms. Flux aggregation was a central issue in the heterogeneous, patchy NOPEX landscape. It is shown that simple land-use-weighted averaging of fluxes from fields/forests/lakes agree well with regional fluxes. Momentum fluxes can be parameterised over the whole area with a roughness length of approximately 1.5 m, whereas fluxes of sensible heat and other scalars depend on the averaging scale, Local measurements of soil moisture can be classified and meaningful averages can be deduced with a 1 km resolution. Lakes play an important role and differs in both diurnal and annual cycles compared to the forests and fields. Multiannual data from an agricultural and a forest site has allowed quantification and modelling of seldom occuring phenomena. One unexpected result was that the Norunda Common forest acted as a source and not a sink of CO2. The successful completion of CFE1-2 and a pilot winter campaign (CFE3) will lead NOPEX into its final phase, devoted to wintertime processes. Measurements and model results reside in SINOP. the System for Information in NOPEX, open for NOPEX participants. Data from CFE1 and CFE2 are released on CD as an integrated part of this Special Issue. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	MARSHALL, BE				MARSHALL, BE			ASPECTS OF ECOLOGY OF BENTHIC FAUNA IN LAKE MCILWAINE, RHODESIA	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												An investigation into the ecology of benthic fauna in the eutrophic Lake McIlwaine (Rhodesia) was carried out in 1968-1969. The profundal zone was only colonized in winter when the lake was isothermal and O2 was present. The littoral zone was greatly affected by lake level fluctuation during the study period, and the population of lamellibranchs was destroyed by a drop in water level. While the water level was low, numbers of oligochaetes were high, but they declined as the water level rose. Chironomid larvae colonized the newly-flooded land and their numbers increased considerably. The effects of eutrophication were less clear but it is suggested that the presence of Chironomus in the profundal in winter, and an increase in Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, was linked with eutrophication.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1978	8	3					241	249		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01445.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01445.x													WOS:A1978FD25600004
J	Li, CH; Wang, J; He, JH				Li, Chunhui; Wang, Jing; He, Jinhai			Impacts of atmospheric circulations on the interannual variability of springtime haze frequency in the Pearl River Delta region, China	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												The springtime haze events in Guangdong Province are mainly located in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, which has the second highest number of haze days among four seasons. The major regional-scale circulation patterns affecting the interannual spring haze days in the PRD region are closely associated with high pressure extending from Baikal Lake to Okhotsk Sea, the North Pacific low pressure, the East Asian Trough, low-level meridional wind over eastern China, and upper tropospheric East Asian Jet. We define a comprehensive circulation index (CCIDX) to express joint effects of major regional-scale circulations. The positive phase of the CCIDX is intimately linked to negative Scandinavian Peninsula (SCAND)-like and WP teleconnection patterns, which induces abnormal northerly winds, low temperatures, and less precipitation over the PRD region by modulating regional atmospheric circulations. In addition, the positive CCIDX favors the enhancement the negative 850 hPa Eady growth rate over the middle and high latitude areas in East Asia, thus weakening the atmosphere baroclinity in the lower troposphere and hampering transportation of pollutants north of southern China into the Pacific Ocean. As such, pollutants accumulated to the north of southern China are advected to the PRD region by pronounced low-level northerly airflows. The positive phase of the CCIDX can provide favorable local meteorological circumstances (i.e., enhanced vertical descending motion, reduced lower specific humidity, decreased surface wind speed, and enhanced low-level atmospheric inversion) required for the increased incidence of haze pollution over the PRD region. It is found that the increase of specific humidity with height, which is mainly contributed by horizontal moisture advection and apparent moisture sink, contributes largely to the sustainability of low-level atmospheric inversion in the PRD region via absorptions of long-wave radiation. Above 700 hPa, enhanced horizontal warm advection and diabatic heating also provide favorable conditions for maintenance of low-level atmospheric inversion.

J	Imran, M; Ahmad, U				Imran, Muhammad; Ahmad, Umair			Geospatially analysing the dynamics of the Khurdopin Glacier surge using multispectral and temporal remote sensing and ground observations	NATURAL HAZARDS												Karakorum glaciers are well known for the advancement and the formation of new glacial lakes due to accelerated climate warming. Its Shimshal valley is profoundly affected by glacier surges in the last couple of decades. Khurdopin glacier is one of the highly surging glaciers in the Karakorum region. Its continuous surge since the nineteenth century is blocking the Shimshal River and creating new lakes. Our objective is to investigate the Khurdopin glacier surge from 1999 to 2017. With this, we aim to identify possible climate and topographic controls on the glacier surge behaviour. We used Landsat 4-5, 7 and 8 satellite bands and ground observations to estimate the glacier retreat and new land cover types from the glacier surge. Our results show that the Khurdopin glacier surges every 20 years. We observed the first surge of 0.69 Km(2) in 2000 and the second surge of 0.63 Km(2) in 2017. Both events blocked the Shimshal River. We observed an increase of 1-4 degrees C in the glacier minimum and maximum winter temperatures. Moreover, we observed snowfall variations in the accumulation zone in the steep glacier slope with a north slope-aspect. The 64% of the glacier aspect is north that causes an increase in ice mass in the accumulation zone by receiving more snowfall in the winter season. The study output, combined with earlier findings, can further predict a surge event in the future.

Reservoir storage loss due to grounded ice during winter operation	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The immobilization of water in the form of deposited ice on the reservoir's embankments during winter operations has received little attention in hydrological literature. In Nordic countries like Canada, this phenomenon is likely to have significant negative impacts on reservoir operation. In a previous work (Seidou, O., Ouarda, T.B.M.J., Bilodeau, L., Hessami, M., St-Hilaire, A., Bruneau, P., 2006. Modeling ice growth on Canadian takes using artificial neural metworks. Water Resources Research 42. doi: doi:10.1029/2005WR004622); the authors developed a global artificial neural network model to predict ice thickness growth in unmonitored Canadian takes and reservoirs. This model is used in this paper to compute a time series of ice thickness on the Gouin reservoir (Saint-Maurice River, Quebec, Canada) and the Outardes 4 reservoir (Aux Outardes River, Quebec, Canada). This and the relationship between surface water area and water level were then used to evaluate the volume of ice left on the banks of the two reservoirs during winter operation, as its water level is progressively Lowered in order to release water for hydroelectric production at downstream power dams. Results show that the ratio of frozen water left on the banks to the active storage varies from 2% to 8% at the Gouin reservoir, and from 0.41% to 1.15% at the Outardes 4 reservoir depending on the water usage policy and the geometry of the reservoir.

Analysis of Hydrological Changes in Mineral Lakes in Northern Eurasia Based on SMOS Satellite Data	COSMIC RESEARCH												The climatic changes taking place in Northern Eurasia, which have become especially aggravated in the past few decades, in combination with the anthropogenic impact on ecosystems, are causing noticeable changes in the hydrological characteristics of mineral lakes. Based on the results of daily measurements of brightness temperature T-b from the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Solution) satellite, the long-term seasonal dynamics of hydrological changes in some large mineral lakes of Northern Eurasia (Caspian Sea, Kara-Bogaz-Gol Bay, Aral Sea, lakes Sarykamyshskoe, Kulunda, Ubsu-Nur) from 2012 to 2022 was studied. The analysis of the seasonal and interannual dynamics of T-b and thermodynamic temperature of the underlying surface was performed on the basis of the SMOS L1C and MODIS MOD11A1 (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products, respectively. Four periods were identified with different behavior of the radiative characteristics of mineral lakes, associated with a decrease in temperature below the freezing point of salt water, the formation and melting of ice cover on the water surface, changes in the area of the water table, and salinity of water. In the northern Caspian Sea, the influence of the phenological phases of ice cover on the change in the microwave radiation of the underlying surface was noted. The features of microwave radiation of the western (deep water) and northern parts of the Aral Sea are studied. The seasonal dynamics of Tb is associated with the processes of formation of ice cover on the water surface. Judging by the changed seasonal dynamics of the Tb, the Sarykamysh Lake was transformed into a year-round ice-free lake. Peculiarities of the seasonal dynamics of Tb for Lake Ubsu-Nur are revealed that may be associated with rainfall in the winter-spring season, as well as with the early opening of rivers and flooding of the ice cover of the lake with river water.

The messinian problem in the pannonian basin, eastern Hungary - Insights from stratigraphic simulations	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Earlier studies revealed a prominent unconformity in the Messinian stratigraphic record of the lacustrine Pannonian Basin, but it was unclear what factors were responsible for the formation of this unconformity, and thus its origin remained controversial. The problem was further complicated by the fact that stratal patterns in the Messinian varied significantly along the paleo-margins of the lake. Our study introduces quantitative stratigraphic simulations to analyze the role of subsidence, sediment supply, and lake-level changes in the formation of the unconformity and the various architectural patterns that evolved in response to the Messinian events. The results suggest that a relative lake-level fall occurred in the Messinian, accompanied and followed by tectonic inversion in several parts of the basin. Since the rate of tectonic subsidence and/or uplift varied in space and time, the size of the relative lake-level fall varied significantly across the basin, while various strata architectural patterns formed in the same time interval. The age of the unconformity was estimated, based on seismic correlations with paleomagnetic chronozones, to be between 5-6 Ma, which was refined by stratigraphic simulations. Galeacysta etrusca cysts were found in the unconformity, which confirmed its late Messinian age. The surface is called the Intra-Messinian Unconformity (IMU) in this paper. Seismic interpretations and simulations of stratal architecture led to the formulation of a basin fill model and identification of four stratigraphic architectural patterns related to Messinian events including a major lake-level fall and coeval and subsequent uplift events in certain parts of the basin.

Summer soil CH4 emission and uptake in taiga forest near Yakutsk, Eastern Siberia	AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY												Summer CH4 emission and uptake was measured in three contrasting environments (eutrophic lake bank, hummocky mesotrophic fen, forest floor) in taiga forest near the Spasskaya Pad field station (north of Yakutsk, Eastern Siberia). Wet eutrophic lake bank sites showed locally high emission rates (up to 49 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), average 11.9 mg m(-2) h(-1)). By contrast, fen emissions were an order of magnitude lower despite high water tables. Emission did not exceed 4.2 mg m(-2) h(-1) (average 1.3 mg m(-2) h(-1)). The emission was highly dependent on water table, slight differences in water table could turn a soil from a source into a sink of CH4. The dry forest sites show uptake of CH4 (average 0.4 mg m(-2) h(-1)), even at sites where the water table was situated a few centimeters below the soil surface. A clear relation with water temperature or soil temperature appears to be absent. Also in the wet year of 2006, with higher water table in the forest during the measurement period, CH4 uptake remained stable. Spatial variation of the uptake fluxes within the site is minimal, but on a larger scale spatial differences are caused by soil texture differences. Our data indicate that the Siberian taiga forest floor is a small sink for CH4 in the boreal summer. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Shangguan, ZG; Zhao, CP; Gao, L				Shangguan ZhiGuan; Zhao CiPing; Gao Ling			Carbon isotopic compositions of the methane derived from magma at the active volcanic regions in China	ACTA PETROLOGICA SINICA												The mean delta(13) C values of methane for 22 springs from the Tengchong volcanic area and for 11 springs from the Changbaishan Tianchi volcanic area (except Hubin springs) in China are respectively -19.0 parts per thousand and - 32.6 parts per thousand, similar to that from worlds geothermal area. But the mean 813 C values of methane at the Wudalianchi volcanic area and the Hubin strong gas discharge region located within the Tianchi crater lake are respectively -45.8 parts per thousand and - 47.9 parts per thousand, much more lower than that of other volcanic area, and similar to that from the lake Kivu in the Eastern Africa. We suppose that such methane could be directly derived from the upper mantle, and the main cause for the occurrence of methane with lower delta C-13 value is dynamically isotope fractionation during the ascending migration of methane derived from the deep magma chamber., The more deeply the magma chamber, the lower the delta C-13 value of methane. The correlation formula between the magma chamber depth and the methane delta C-13 value is: d (km) = 0. 0107 (delta C-13,)2 + 1.14 ( where d expresses the depth(km) of magma chamber, the delta C-13, is the delta C-13 value of methane). The authors suggest that the carbon isotope fractionation temperature between the carbon dioxide and methane derived from the mantle magma may be only the last reservoir depth of the gases, indefinitely the initial magma chamber depth.

Determining the spatial and temporal patterns of climate changes in China's western interior during the last 15 ka from lacustrine oxygen isotope records	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												China's western interior is a climatologically complex region, where climatic conditions are primarily controlled by the westerly jet stream and the Asian monsoon system. Observations reveal that the delta O-18 signatures of these atmospheric elements as expressed in their meteoric waters are different, and these differences are reflected ill the lacustrine systems that are ultimately fed by the meteoric waters. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition of 17 lacustrine delta O-18 records from this area clearly reveals the spatial and temporal structures of climate changes during the last 15 ka. The first EOF mode, dominated by sites in the NW sector, captures the temperature effect on the variability of the delta O-18 dataset. We interpret the variations through time in the amplitude of this mode to be indicative of changes in Summer air temperature. The second EOF mode, heavily weighted by sites in the SE sector, reveals the 'amount effect' on delta O-18, and thus its amplitude time series indicates changes in the intensity of the Asian Summer monsoon. Our EOF-based reconstruct ions of regional climate are generally consistent with the delta O-18 records of ice cores, cave speleothems and marine carbonates.

The oldest deposit ('Basal pumices') crops out mainly in the peripheral areas and is one of the largest plinian events in the Vulsini District, with a volume of about 9 km(3) and a calculated column height exceeding 30 km. Subcircular patterns of isopachs and isopleths around the Bolsena lake indicate emplacement in wind-free conditions and suggest a source vent location in the northernmost sector of the present Bolsena lake, where it is possible that an older central volcanic structure existed. The four younger plinian fall deposits are related to Bolsena activity. The oldest of these, named the 'Ponticello' and 'Orvieto-Bagnoregio' pumices, are mainly distributed on the north-eastern sector of the Vulsini District. Their volumes are an order of magnitude lower than that of the basal unit, and the estimated column heights do not exceed 20 km. The younger 'Ospedaletto' pumice deposit has a NE-SW dispersal axis, whereas the youngest 'Casetta' pumice deposit is found only in the north-eastern sector of the district. Their estimated volumes are respectively 1.2 and 0.1 km(3), whereas the inferred vent areas appear to be located slightly to the east of the Ponticello and Orvieto-Bagnoregio pumice deposit source areas. The chronology of the Ospedaletto and Casetta pumices indicates that the final plinian activity from the Bolsena complex is contemporaneous with the Latera activity. The decreasing volumes from the oldest to the youngest units, together with the progressive shifting north-eastwards of the source vents, may be related to the volcano-tectonic subsidence of the Bolsena area. The source vents for the post-Basal pumices events are mainly clustered just north of Bolsena village where the greatest displacement during subsidence occurred. Accordingly, source vent shifting appears to be related to the progressive opening of normal faults from the inner to the outer margin of the Bolsena depression.

The highest stream-flows ever recorded in the Onyx River, Wright Valley, were also recorded that year (the record goes back to the 1969/70 austral summer). In early January 2002, a groundwater seep was observed flowing in the southwest portion of Taylor Valley. This flow has been named 'Wormherder Creek' (WHC) and represents an unusual event, probably occurring on a decadal time-scale. The physical characteristics of this feature suggest that it may have flowed at other times in the past. Other groundwater seeps, emanating from the north-facing slope of Taylor Valley, were also observed. Little work has been done previously on these very ephemeral seeps, and the source of water is unknown. These features, resembling recently described features on Mars, represent the melting of subsurface ice. The Martian features have been interpreted as groundwater seeps. In this paper we compare the chemistry of the WHC groundwater seep to that of the surrounding streams that flow every austral summer. The total dissolved solids content of WHC was similar to 6 times greater than that of some nearby streams. The Na:Cl and SO4:Cl ratios of the seep waters are higher than those of the streams, but the Mg:Cl and HCO3: Cl ratios are lower, indicating different sources of solutes to the seeps compared to the streams. The enrichment of Na and SO4 relative to Cl may suggest significant dissolution of mirabilite within the previously unwetted soil. The proposed occurrence of abundant mirabilite in higher-elevation soils of the dry valley region agrees with geochemical models developed, but not tested, in the late 1970s. The geochemical data demonstrate that these seeps could be important in 'rinsing'the soils by dissolving and redistributing the long-term accumulation of salts, and perhaps improving habitat suitability for soil biota. The H4SiO4 concentration is 2-3 times greater in WHC than in the surrounding streams, indicating a large silicate-weathering component in the seep waters.

In this work, the analysis of the pore water and the solid phase of the sediment was carried out over a 9month monitoring period between February 2020 and April 2021 in two drained marshes (Marans and Genouille<acute accent>, France) distinct by their uses and management tools. Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) enrichment in the sediment was intimately controlled by iron oxide dissolution. The latter seemed highly controlled by seasonal nitrate inputs (winter and early spring) that favoured denitrification as a major benthic mineralization process promoting iron curtain development and stability. Following benthic mitigation of nitrate other anaerobic metabolisms developed such as iron dissolutive reduction promoting P recycling and planktic bioavailability. Surprisingly, sulphur cycle seemed to affect P dynamics, especially in the absence of nitrate. The absence of NO3 triggered high sulphate reduction rates in the two first centimeters depth, reaching -8.9 E- 03 f 0.5 E-03 and -5.0 E- 03 f 0.2 E-03 nmol cm- 3 s-1 in August and July at Marans and Genouille<acute accent> respectively. These values placed this process at higher rates than the denitrification (maximum in May at Marans with -5.0 E- 03 f 1.1 E- 03 nmol cm-3 s-1) and reduced iron production (maximum in July at Genouille<acute accent> with 0.5 E-03 f 0.1 E- 03 nmol cm- 3 s- 1). The rapidity with which process changes occur (monthly scale) testified to the dynamism of these systems. The similarity in geochemical patterns regarding NO3 -pressure at both sites underlines the importance of diffuse pollution in coastal systems for nitrogen mitigation and phosphorus trapping. The results obtained in this study could lead to the development of a generalized diagenetic operating model for temperate systems with high agricultural pressure. This would enable to target management efforts to both optimize the purification function and limit eutrophication risks in these systems.					metzger, edouard/D-1700-2010														0883-2927	1872-9134				DEC	2024	176								106200	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2024.106200	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2024.106200		NOV 2024											WOS:001355449000001

Environmental exposures to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) among older residents of upper Hudson River communities	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The upper Hudson River has been heavily contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) due to discharges from former electrical capacitor plants in Hudson Falls and Fort Edward, NY. An epidemiologic study was conducted to assess the impact of dietary and residential exposure on PCB body burden among older, long-term, non-occupationally exposed adults living in the vicinity of these former capacitor plants. The study population consisted of 133 persons 55-74 years of age who had lived in Hudson Falls or Fort Edward for 25 years or more. The comparison group consisted of 120 persons from Glens Falls, which is upriver. Both groups were interviewed, and blood samples were obtained for congener-specific PCB analysis. Persons from the study area reported greater past consumption of Hudson River fish than did the comparison area, but current rates were very low in both areas. The geometric mean serum PCB concentrations for the study and comparison populations did not differ significantly (3.07 ppb wet weight and 3.23 ppb, respectively, for total PCB). Serum PCB concentrations increased with cumulative lifetime exposure to PCBs from Hudson River fish consumption (p < 0.10). Persons who lived within 800 m of the river did not have significantly greater serum PCB concentrations than the control population, nor did persons who lived downwind and within 800 m of a PCB-contaminated site. The results indicate no detectable differences in serum PCB levels according to proximity or wind direction relative to local point sources, but lifetime consumption of Hudson River fish was positively associated with serum PCB concentrations.

TERRA NOVA												Calcifying tufa stromatolites are forming on a high energy coast of the South African Indian Ocean. The tufa stromatolites form in upper intertidal to supra tidal rock pools, encrust bedrock and are linked both laterally and vertically to physico-chemical properties of their pool water. Calcification only occurs in pools where dissolved carbonate-rich, spring-fed groundwater is routed, and delta(18)O values are consistent with calcification in a mixture of freshwater and seawater. Increasing pH and less negative isotope values away from the spring are consistent with CO(2) degassing and in-stream calcification, albeit with some in-mixing of seawater. The rocky shore setting of these active tufa stromatolites is new and invites serious comparison with some Archaean rocky substrate peritidal stromatolites (e.g. the c. 3.45 Ga Strelley Pool sequences, Pilbara Craton). This new association shows that initial encrustation of rocky intertidal substrates can begin with freshwater influence in the intertidal zone, a facies detail that should be sought in ancient peritidal stromatolites.					smith, Alan/NGS-4737-2025; Andrews, Julian/B-5306-2008														0954-4879					DEC	2011	23	6					375	381		10.1111/j.1365-3121.2011.01022.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3121.2011.01022.x													WOS:000297991100004

Evidence from 5 years of monitoring	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												A long-term database of weekly air concentrations was examined to establish temporal trends of PCBs in the Arctic atmosphere. Several methods were employed to reduce the intra-annual variability allowing the elucidation of longterm trends for a selection of congeners at Alert located in the Canadian Arctic. These methods included temperature normalization (TN), multiple linear regression (MLR), and digital filtration (DF). Estimation of the slope (m) resulting from the linear regression between the natural logarithm of the partial pressure in air versus reciprocal temperature (In P = m/T + b), required for TN and MLR, proved difficult due to the poor correlation with temperature experienced for the majority of congeners. Values of mwere considerably lower than those obtained from temperate studies, implying that regional air-surface exchange plays a minor role in supporting the observed air concentrations in the Arctic. The lighter congeners generally showed very low slopes, and some even showed positive correlation with 1/T. This might be a result of their relatively fast reaction rates with OH radicals following the onset of 24-h sunlight in spring. Use of DF (in combination with TN and MLR) revealed declining trends for several of the lower chlorinated congeners in the high Arctic atmosphere, with estimated first-order half-lives, t(1/2), ranging from similar to3 to 20 yr. Declining trends of the lower congeners probably reflect falling levels in source regions, as a result of long-range transport to this Arctic site. There were no apparent trends for the higher chlorinated congeners (penta-substituted and above), except for PCB 180, in marked contrast to temperate studies, indicating a lag time for decline between the Arctic and source regions.					; Halsall, Crispin/D-8135-2014	Stern, Gary/0000-0003-2160-0841; Halsall, Crispin/0000-0001-8007-9756													0013-936X	1520-5851				APR 1	2001	35	7					1303	1311		10.1021/es001704b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es001704b								11348061					WOS:000167817000017

Results for the eastern Mediterranean countries differ from one location to another in terms of consistent NAO signal. Patterns of precipitation, streamflow, and lake levels in Turkey are discussed to show the NAO impacts. A special attention is devoted to the NAO influences on the formation of streamflow homogeneous region and on the probability distribution functions of critical droughts. The results of all these analyses clearly showed that the NAO signals are quite identifiable in various hydrologic variables in Turkey. For example, the NAO during winter was found to influence precipitation and streamflow patterns. In contrast temperature patterns appeared to be less sensitive to the NAO. The results of wavelet analysis showed that the Tuz, Sapanca, and Uluabat lakes reflect strong NAO influences. In southwest Iran, the October-December season is influenced mostly by the NAO in both dry and wet spells. Positive significant correlation values were found between the NAO and the total rainfall in the centre and southern Israel and with some of the rainfall categories. High correlations between the winter mode of the NAO and temperature and sea level pressure in Israel were also noted. In conclusion, current evidences have shown that the NAO has detectable influences on the hydrology of eastern Mediterranean countries with different magnitudes.

However, the sampling protocol used in earlier studies did not allow the determination of precise timing of the deposition of exotic grains. The ongoing "Epilobe" project monitors the deposition of exotic grains on the western and eastern coasts of Greenland utilizing wind filters, which are changed weekly throughout the entire year. A combination of the identification of tree pollen grains, the dates of deposition of the pollen on the filters, and the distribution map of the trees identified, allows the selection of modeled backward trajectories of air parcels responsible for the capture of the grains in the growing area of northeastern North America and their long-distance transport to Greenland.

Results presented help to constrain the timing and rate of relative sea-level (RSL) change since deglaciation and also the timing of deglaciation itself in the Bjarkarlundur area. The marine limit is estimated to be approximately 80 m above sea level based on an isolation basin with sill altitude at 79.1 m. The maximum age of this marine limit and, hence, local deglaciation is estimated at 12.2 C-14 ka BP. Relative sea level then fell rapidly during the late Bolling-early Allerod at a rate of approximately -35 mm Ca-14(-1) to below 50 m by 11.4 C-14 ka BP. After this the rate of RSL fall decreased significantly during the late Allerod and Younger Dryas Chronozones (averaging -6 mm C-14 a(-1) between 11.4 and 9.7 C-14 ka BP). Based on isolation basins with sill altitudes of 51.1 and 41.1 m, our data constrain any possible fluctuation in RSL produced by regrowth of ice during the Younger Dryas to below 10m. After 9.7 14 C ka BP the rate of RSL fall increased significantly to approximately -23 mm 14 C a(-1) to at least 9.0 C-14 ka BP. If eustatic sea-level rise is taken into account and the calibrated timescale is used, actual crustal uplift rates are estimated at +56 and +46 mm cal. a(-1) during Lateglacial and early Holocene times, respectively. During the mid to late Holocene RSL then rose to at least 1 m above present-day levels, gradually falling to the present-day level from 3.1 C-14 ka BP. These results demonstrate the potential of isolation basin data for investigating the timing and rate of RSL change in Iceland. This can add important well-constrained information on RSL when combined with data from raised beaches. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

There was no correlation between parasites transmitted throughout prey organisms from benthic habitats (amphipods) and pelagic habitats(copepods). A strong relationship between infection with a parasite species and the corresponding intermediate host from the stomach content of individual charr, indicated an individual feeding specialization. Independent of size, charr specialized on the intermediate hosts of all three parasite species. Some charr maintained this specialization on specific prey items throughout the winter period. These parasite species are considered to be useful indicators of past prey selection.

J	Hodder, KR				Hodder, Kyle R.			Flocculation: a key process in the sediment flux of a large, glacier-fed lake	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												This study investigates the consequences of flocculation for sediment flux in glacier-fed Lillooet Lake, British Columbia based oil density, fractal dimension, in Situ profiles of sediment concentration and size distribution, and settling velocity equations presented in the literature. Sediment flux attributed to macroflocs during the late spring and summer accounts for a significant portion of sediment flux in the lake, equivalent to at least one-quarter of the average annual sediment flux. Fine sediment is reaching the lake floor faster in flocs than occurs if settling as individual grains. This flux varies both spatially and temporally over the observation period, suggesting a link between deposition Via flocculation and the properties of bottom sediments. Macrofloc flux increased through June, reached a peak during July, and then declined into August. Macrofloc flux Was greatest in the distal end of the first basin, approximately 10 km from the point of inflow. Relatively high excess densities (similar to 0.1 g cm(-3) at 500 mu m) for flocs in Situ are consistent with a composition dominated by inorganic primary particles. Microlaminations within Lillooet Lake varves have been linked by earlier workers to discharge events, and the action of turbidity currents, emanating from the Lillooet River. While turbidity currents undoubtedly Occur in Lillooet Lake, these results demonstrate flocculation as an adjunct process linking discharge, lake level, macrofloc flux, bulk density and microlaminations. In situ measurements of sediment settling velocity in glacier-fed lakes are required to better constrain flux rates, and permit comparison between flocculation in lacustrine environments with existing studies of estuarine, marine and fluvial flocculation.

A comparison of ozone exposure in Fresno and Shaver Lake, California	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH												Ground-level ozone is a pollutant that has been found to have detrimental effects on plants as well as in humans. Few studies, however, have measured ozone exposure in mountainous regions downwind from highly polluted urban centers, despite the popularity of these regions as summer destinations. The study reported here evaluated ozone levels in Fresno, California, and the downwind community of Shaver Lake, California, during the summer months of June, July, and august from 1997 to 2001. Findings from the study suggest that if Fresno is considered one of the most polluted cities in the nation, then Shaver Lake should be considered one of the most polluted rural sites. Continuing and expanded monitoring of surface ozone concentrations at remote and rural locations is needed, because it is important to assess the risk for humans, animals, and plants.

J	DEJOUX, C				DEJOUX, C			BENTHIC INVERTEBRATES OF SOME SALINE LAKES OF THE SUD-LIPEZ REGION, BOLIVIA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The benthic invertebrates fauna of most of the saline lakes of the Sud Lipez region (Bolivia, Altiplano) has been until now quite unstudied. Samples collected during an extensive survey of 12 lakes and two small inflow rivers allow a first list of the main macroinvertebrates living in these biotopes. The heterogeneous nature of these saline lakes with their freshwater springs and phreatic inflows offers a variety of habitats to macroinvertebrates. The benthic fauna in lakes with salinities > 10 g l-1 is not so low in density but includes few species and is dominated by Orthocladiinae and Podonominae larvae. In contrast, the freshwater springs and inflows are colonized by a diverse fauna, with a mixture of both freshwater and saline taxa, but dominated by Elmidae and Amphipoda. The lakes are quite isolated and, apart from some cosmopolitan organisms, their fauna can be quite distinctive.																			0018-8158					SEP 10	1993	267	1-3					257	267		10.1007/BF00018807	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018807													WOS:A1993MB13700021

Decreased Hatchery Rearing Density Improves Poststocking Harvest and Return to Spawning of Landlocked Fall Chinook Salmon	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE												Juvenile landlocked fall Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha were coded-wire-tagged and reared in 1.8-m-diameter circular tanks at a low or high density for up to 52 d prior to stocking in Lake Oahe, South Dakota, during late May of 1999, 2003, and 2004. Final hatchery rearing densities ranged from 7.29 to 11.72kg/m3 for the low-density tanks and from 15.02 to 25.22kg/m3 for the high-density tanks, with the higher densities being at least double the lower densities in each year. Flows were adjusted to maintain similar loadings (kg center dot L1 center dot min1) between the treatments each year. The fish used in this study came from spawns collected during the October prior to stocking; TL at the end of hatchery rearing ranged from 103mm in 1999 to 124mm in 2004. In each year-class, the percentage of fish that were harvested by anglers or that returned to spawn was significantly greater for the lower-density treatment than for the higher-density treatment. Angler harvest primarily consisted of age-3 fish, with a small number of age-4 fish harvested as well. Feed conversion ratios were significantly improved in the lower-density tanks relative to the higher-density tanks in 1999 and 2003, and fish from the lower-density tanks were also significantly longer just prior to stocking in 1999 and heavier prior to stocking in 2003. To maximize poststocking survival for landlocked fall Chinook Salmon, lower rearing densities are recommended.

The most common fungus species included Rhizophydium keratinophilum, Rhizophydium nodulosum, Blastocladiopsis parva, Catenophlyctis variabilis, Aphanomyces irregularis, Aphanomyces kerathinophilus, Saprolegnia ferax, and Zoophagus insidians. Rhizophydium keratinophilum and Aphanomyces irregularis were found on the hair of all the animals examined. The most fungi were noted to grow in water from lake Komosa (59), the fewest in water from spring Cypisek and spring Jaroszowka (each 49). Out of these 123 species, 33 are known as parasites or necrotrophs of fish. Twelve fungus species were recorded for the first time in Poland.

During early and late summer, 1994, both assemblages were nitrogen limited or co-limited by nitrogen-and phosphorus, indicating the potential for competition between benthic and planktonic communities. During late summer, there was evidence that high phytoplankton biomass reduced light penetration through the water column and may have suppressed periphyton growth. The similar phytoplankton and periphyton taxonomic structures, both dominated by Lyngbya sp. and pennate diatoms, suggested that in shallow regions of this lake, resuspended meroplankton might account for a large portion of phytoplankton biomass. This phenomenon has been observed in other shallow, wind-driven Florida lakes.

The lowland wetlands of the Pampas region in Argentina are key wintering areas for two flamingo species. The Chilean Flamingo Phoenicopterus chilensis is a year-round resident, while the Andean Flamingo Phoenicoparrus andinus is a partial altitudinal migrant that uses these wetlands in winter when some of the wetlands in the high Andes freeze over. We studied the association between the annual abundance of both flamingo species, wetland condition (water surface area and water salinity), and environmental conditions (flooding) driven by the El Ni & ntilde;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) over 15 consecutive winters (July-August 2008-2022) in 24 lowland wetlands in central Argentina. There were notable differences in wetland surface area and water conductivity between years, with some wetlands ranging from flooded to almost dried out. For any given year, there were also large differences in water surface area and water conductivity between wetlands. Both flamingo species showed marked fluctuations in abundance over the study period. Each year, the Chilean Flamingo was more abundant than the Andean Flamingo. The Chilean Flamingo was recorded at least once in every wetland, while the Andean Flamingo was absent from three wetlands and was not observed in two years during the study. The Chilean Flamingo was recorded in wetlands covering a larger range of water conductivity values than the Andean Flamingo (2.53-58.23 ms/cm vs 2.94-16.20 ms/cm, respectively). The abundance of both flamingo species was higher at intermediate water conductivity values and decreased at higher or lower values. These results show that these lowland wetlands are subjected to strong interannual variation in climatic conditions which affect lake conditions, and thus the abundance of both flamingo species, highlighting the importance of conserving wetlands encompassing a broad range of environmental conditions.

Hepatic Element Concentrations of Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis) During Spring Migration in the Upper Midwest	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												High concentrations of some hepatic elements might be contributing to the decline of the continental lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) population. We evaluated hepatic element concentrations of male and female lesser scaup collected from the upper Midwest (Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota) during the 2003 and 2004 spring migrations. We measured concentrations of 24 elements in livers of 117 lesser scaup. We found that only selenium concentrations were at levels (> 3.0 mu g/g wet weight [ww)]) proposed to adversely affect reproduction. Approximately 49% of females (n = 61) had individual hepatic concentrations > 3.0 mu g/g ww selenium (Se). Our observed hepatic concentration of Se was similar to that reported in lesser scaup collected from the mid-continental United States but less than Se concentrations reported from the Great Lakes region. We found that the liver cadmium (Cd) concentration for males was significantly higher than that for females. Gender differences in hepatic Cd concentrations have not been previously reported for lesser scaup, but Cd is known to have negative impacts on male reproduction. Our results indicate that lesser scaup migrating through the upper Midwest in spring have elevated Se levels and that males carry a significantly greater Cd burden than females. Moreover, elemental concentrations might be high enough to affect reproduction in both male and female lesser scaup, but controlled laboratory studies are needed to adequately assess the effects of Se and Cd on lesser scaup reproduction.

Data from the last 50 years are used to study the impact of rain and temperature on the cyclical changes of the water levels. Linear and nonlinear regression models are used to describe how rainfall and temperature change the water level, and to assess the future progression of the water level under three scenarios.

Synchrony dynamics of dissolved organic carbon in high-mountain streams: Insights into scale-dependent processes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												In high-mountain landscapes, organic carbon (OC) is often limited and heterogeneously stored in poorly developed soils, snow, ground ice, and glaciers. Climate change influences the dynamics of OC mobilization to-and processing into-the recipient streams. Dynamics vary from seasonal (e.g., snow melt in spring) to daily (e.g., ice melt in summer) depending on the location of the streams within the catchment. Capturing the temporal richness of stream biogeochemical signals has become a reality with the advent of high-resolution sensors. In this study, we applied wavelet analysis to high-frequency discharge (Q) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measurements from nine streams in the Swiss Alps to investigate the persistence of synchrony in Q (S-Q) and DOC (S-DOC) among streams, and their response to drainage network position, climate, and land cover gradients across different time scales. Our findings revealed that S-Q and S-DOC decayed non-linearly over the first similar to 5 km and stabilized from this point onwards, indicating that localized controls influenced synchrony within single basins, but drivers operating at regional scale acted as synchrony stabilizers. We also showed that short-term (0-10 d) S-Q and S-DOC were strongly influenced by the distance between streams and network connectivity. In contrast, catchment-related properties (i.e., altitude or land cover) were more important drivers of S-Q and S-DOC dynamics at longer time scales (> 50 d). However, the degree to which local catchment properties controlled synchrony patterns at the longest timescales depended both on response variables (i.e., Q vs. DOC) and land cover (i.e., vegetation vs. glacier). Elucidating the most prominent timescales of S-DOC is relevant given the hydrological alterations projected for high-mountain regions. We show that glaciers impose a unique seasonal regime on DOC concentration, potentially overriding the effects of other local hydrological or biogeochemical processes during downstream transport. Consequently, S-DOC dynamics in high-mountain streams may change as glaciers shrink, thereby altering downstream opportunities for biogeochemical transformations.					; Gómez-Gener, Lluís/L-1332-2017	Gomez-Gener, Lluis/0000-0003-3279-3589; Deluigi, Nicola/0000-0002-1524-8194; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				FEB	2025	70	2					411	425		10.1002/lno.12768	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12768		JAN 2025											WOS:001389804200001

Fresh-water shells (e,g,, Viviparus, Lymnaea) from Sparnacian deposits in the Paris basin show relatively high delta O-18 values, in the range -4 parts per thousand to -0.1 parts per thousand. Large intrashell delta O-18 variability, typically 3 parts per thousand, is consistent with significant seasonal variation in precipitation and/or temperature. We also present intrashell isotopic profiles for 22 recent fresh-water shells, mainly Viviparidae, representing the major middle- to low-latitude climate zones (e,g,, Sweden, France, Portugal, Lake Chad, Ceylon, Gambia, Congo, Lake Victoria, New Guinea). Distinct isotopic patterns, reflecting humidity and temperature, characterize each of the climate zones. Comparing the results for recent and fossil shells suggests that the climate in northern France during Sparnacian time was warm subtropical with a pronounced seasonal drought, The delta O-18 composition of Sparnacian lake water has been estimated from the fossil fresh-water shell delta O-18 and by using seasonal temperatures derived from delta O-18 profiles of fully marine shells. The best estimate of the delta O-18 composition of Sparnacian lake water (compared with Eocene mean ocean water) is -1 parts per thousand. This is consistent with paleorain delta O-18 values of -3 parts per thousand, to -5 parts per thousand, similar to present mean rain delta O-18 (standard mean ocean water) values close to -4 parts per thousand in Portugal at similar to 40 degreesN, the paleolatitude of the Paris basin during earliest Eocene time. The evaporated nature of Sparnacian lake water contradicts hypotheses of globally equable humid conditions in the warm early Eocene and instead suggests that dry subtropical highs occurred over the eastern parts of the oceans, similar to today. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of fossil fresh-water carbonates to reconstruct the development of subtropical highs and Hadley cell circulation in the past.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				JUN	2001	113	6					774	789		10.1130/0016-7606(2001)113<0774:AHALOD>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(2001)113<0774:AHALOD>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000169052300009

We found that 3% of the swimmers had pruritic maculopapular rashes on their legs, arms, necks, or other body parts and that between 9.1% (May 2006) and 52.4% (November 2004) of the snails examined were infected with the bird schistosome cercariae Trichobilharzia sp.					; Valdovinos, Claudio/AAQ-1625-2020	Balboa Luna, Cristian Marcel/0000-0002-8362-2002; Valdovinos, Claudio/0000-0002-9126-3978													0950-2688	1469-4409				MAR	2008	136	3					391	394		10.1017/S0950268807008734	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0950268807008734								17553177					WOS:000259198300011

Lake Taihu, China, is a large, shallow and eutrophic system. Since 2007, this lake has experienced extensive nutrient input reductions aimed at controlling cyanobacterial blooms. However, intense cyanobacterial blooms have persisted through 2017 with a record-setting bloom occurring in May 2017. Causal analysis suggested that this bloom was sygenerically driven by high external loading from flooding in 2016 in the Taihu catchment and a notable warmer winter during 2016/2017. High precipitation during 2016 was associated with a strong 2015/2016 El Nino in combination with the joint effects of Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), while persistent warmth during 2016/2017 was strongly related to warm phases of AMO and PDO. The 2017 blooms elevated water column pH and led to dissolved oxygen depletion near the sediment, both of which mobilized phosphorus from the sediment to overlying water, further promoting cyanobacterial blooms. Our finding indicates that regional climate anomalies exacerbated eutrophication via a positive feedback mechanism, by intensifying internal nutrient cycling and aggravating cyanobacterial blooms. In light of global expansion of eutrophication and blooms, especially in large, shallow and eutrophic lakes, these regional effects of climate anomalies are nested within larger scale global warming predicted to continue in the foreseeable future.

The multi-angle imaging spectro radiometer (MISR) and cloud-aerosol lidar with orthogonal polarisation (CALIOP) aerosol data are used to observe mineral dust distribution over Australia. In addition, the weather research and forecasting with chemistry (WRF/Chem) model is used to estimate direct radiative forcing by dust. At the surface, the model domain clear-sky short-wave and long-wave direct radiative forcing by dust averaged for a 6-month period (austral spring and summer) was estimated to be -0.67 W m(-2) and 0.13 W m(-2), respectively. The long-wave warming effect of dust therefore offsets 19.4% of its short-wave cooling effect. However, over Lake Eyre Basin where coarse particles are more abundant, the long-wave warming effect of dust offsets 60.9% of the short-wave cooling effect. At the top of the atmosphere (TOA), clear-sky short-wave and long-wave direct radiative forcing was estimated to be -0.26 W m(-2) and -0.01 W m(-2), respectively. This leads to a net negative direct radiative forcing of dust at the TOA, indicating cooling of the atmosphere by an increase in outgoing radiation. Shortwave and long-wave direct radiative forcing by dust is shown to have a diurnal variation due to changes in solar zenith angle and in the intensity of infrared radiation. Atmospheric heating due to absorption of short-wave radiation was simulated, while the interaction of dust with long-wave radiation was associated with atmospheric cooling. The net effect was cooling of the atmosphere near the surface (below 0.2 km), with warming of the atmosphere at higher altitudes.					alizadeh, omid/AAO-5922-2021	Sturman, Andrew/0000-0002-2103-3616; Alizadeh, Omid/0000-0003-4801-6338													1600-0889						2013	65								19856	10.3402/tellusb.v65i0.19856	http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/tellusb.v65i0.19856													WOS:000319272700001
J	McInnes, AS; Quigg, A				McInnes, Allison Skinner; Quigg, Antonietta			Near-Annual Fish Kills in Small Embayments: Casual vs. Causal Factors	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Fish kills are reported throughout the nation and a great deal of research is conducted in an attempt to determine the cause of these mortality events. Low dissolved oxygen concentrations, eutrophication, and/or harmful algal blooms are most commonly cited as causative factors. Lake Madeline and Offatt's Bayou on Texas' upper coast have low mixing environments due to their relatively small areal size, deep basins, small tidal inlets, and restricted exchange with the nearby Galveston Bay estuary complex. These physical attributes, along with near annual fish kills, make them an ideal study area for understanding the causes and effects of hypoxia and phytoplankton blooms on fish kills. We measured physical, chemical, and biological parameters twice weekly over the course of two summers. Fortuitously, a fish kill occurred in the summer of 2005 but not in 2006, which allowed us to narrow down the likely contributing factors that led to the kill, consisting of >10,000 Brevoortia partonus (Gulf menhaden). Large amounts of detritus from a cyanobacterial bloom, in conjunction with the strong stratification and hypoxic bottom waters, led to the fish mortality event in 2005. While the system was also stratified during the summer of 2006, chlorophyll and phaeophytin concentrations were 15-fold lower and no fish kill was observed. The combination of factors that led to the observed fish kill demonstrates the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to investigating the causes of ecological disturbances.

Little information exists regarding possible magititudes of nutrient losses from pastures that are managed for both grazing and hay production and how these might impact adjacent bodies of water. We examined the changes that have occurred in soil fertility levels of rhizoma peanut (Arachis glabrata Benth.)-based beef cattle pastures (n = 4) in Florida from 1988 to 2002. These pastures were managed for grazing in spring followed by having in late summer and were fertilized annually with P (39 kg P2O5 ha(-1)) and K (68 kg K2O ha(-1)). Additionally, we investigated trends in water quality parameters and trophic state index (TSI) of lakes (n = 3) associated with beef cattle operations from 1993 to 2002. Overall, there was no spatial or temporal buildup of soil P and other crop nutrients despite the annual application of fertilizers and daily infield loading of animal waste. In fact, soil fertility levels showed a declining trend for crop nutrient levels, especially soil P (y = 146.57 - 8.14 x year; r(2) = 0.75), even though the fields had a history of P fertilization and the cattle were rotated into the legume fields. Our results indicate that when nutrients are not applied in excess, cow-calf systems are slight exporters of P, K, Ca, and Mg through removal of cut hay. Water quality in lakes associated with cattle production was "good" (30 - 46 TSI) based on the Florida Water Quality Standard. These findings indicate that properly managed livestock operations may not be major contributors to excess loads of nutrients (especially P) in surface water.																			0047-2425	1537-2537				JAN-FEB	2006	35	1					240	252		10.2134/jeq2005.0246	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2005.0246								16397100					WOS:000235085000027

Asynchronous Holocene lake evolution in arid mid-latitude Asia is driven by glacial meltwater and variations in Westerlies and the East Asian summer monsoon	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Understanding the mechanisms driving a range of time scales is crucial for making predictions for future changes in fragile desert-lake ecosystems. As of yet, the drivers of hydrological changes in lake systems of arid and terminating in the arid Junggar Basin of northwestern China, presents a perfect natural laboratory to explore lake evolution in context to Holocene climate evolution in arid dating method was used to effectively date 20 paleolake shorelines with poorly bleached sediment to constrain lake level evolution over the past 18 k.y. Results indicate that Aibi Lake experienced a rapid increase in water levels, reaching a peak of similar to 36 m during the sequently, the lake level may have shown a (7-4 ka), with the lake reaching a low level of less than 10 m at ca. 4 ka. In the late Holocene, lake levels fluctuated by 10-30 m above modern levels during 4-1 ka, with generally low levels of < 9 m after 1 ka. The evolution of Aibi Lake underlines a clear out-of-phase relation- ship between Central Asian lake evolution and Westerlies precipitation changes, where Holocene lake changes were instead more directly controlled by the flux of glacial melt- water from the Tianshan Mountains, driven by change in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. Glacier meltwater, in combination with variable delivery of Westerlies and East Asian summer monsoon precipitation, are responsible for asynchronous lake evolution trends across Central to East Asia.

Wintertime storage of water in buried supraglacial lakes across the Greenland Ice Sheet	CRYOSPHERE												Increased surface melt over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is now estimated to account for half or more of the ice sheet's total mass loss. Here, we show that some meltwater is stored, over winter, in buried supraglacial lakes. We use airborne radar from Operation IceBridge between 2009 and 2012 to detect buried supraglacial lakes, and we find that they were distributed extensively around the GrIS margin through that period. Buried supraglacial lakes can persist through multiple winters and are, on average, similar to 1.9 + 0.2 m below the surface. Most buried supraglacial lakes exist with no surface expression of their occurrence in visible imagery. The few buried supraglacial lakes that do exhibit surface expression have a unique visible signature associated with a darker blue color where subsurface water is located. The volume of retained water in the buried supraglacial lakes is likely insignificant compared to the total mass loss from the GrIS, but the water may have important implications locally for the development of the englacial hydrologic system and ice temperatures. Buried supraglacial lakes represent a small but year-round source of meltwater in the GrIS hydrologic system.					; Casey, Kimberly/AAY-9033-2020; Lampkin, Derrick/U-1693-2019; Casey, Kimberly/A-4478-2013	KOENIG, LORA/0000-0002-6057-8483; Hamilton, Sara/0000-0002-0156-7610; Casey, Kimberly/0000-0002-6115-7525													1994-0416	1994-0424					2015	9	4					1333	1342		10.5194/tc-9-1333-2015	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-1333-2015													WOS:000360661700001

Lake Trout Population Dynamics in the Northern Refuge of Lake Michigan: Implications for Future Rehabilitation	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The Northern Refuge was established in 1985 as part of the lake trout Salvelinus namaycush rehabilitation effort for Lake Michigan. To evaluate progress toward lake trout rehabilitation in the Northern Refuge, we conducted annual (1991-2008) gill-net surveys in the fall to assess the adult population and beam trawl surveys in the spring to assess naturally reproduced age-0 lake trout. Our criteria for evaluating progress included the density of "wild'' age-0 fish within the Northern Refuge, the proportion of wild fish within the adult population, density of spawners, adult survival, growth, and wounding rate by sea lampreys Petromyzon marinus. No wild age-0 lake trout were caught in the Northern Refuge during 1991-2008. Overall, wild lake trout did not recruit to the adult population to any detectable degree. The mean density of spawning lake trout decreased from 45 fish.305 m of gill net(-1).d(-1) during 1991-1999 to only 4 fish.305 m(-1).d(-1) during 2000-2008. Although the sea lamprey wounding rate more than doubled between these two time periods, catch curve analysis revealed that mortality of adult lake trout actually decreased between the two periods. Therefore, the 90% decrease in abundance of spawning lake trout between the two periods could not be attributed to increased sea lamprey predation but instead was probably due in part to the reduced lake trout stocking rate during 1995-2005. The paucity of natural reproduction in the Northern Refuge during 1991-2008 most likely resulted from alewife Alosa pseudoharengus interference with lake trout reproduction and from the relatively low lake trout spawner density during 2000-2008. Our results suggest that the annual stocking rate of lake trout yearlings should be increased to at least 250,000 fish/reef to achieve greater densities of spawners.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				JUN	2010	30	3					629	641		10.1577/M09-108.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M09-108.1													WOS:000279885000002

The bio-invasion and population dynamics of Cherax quadricarinatus in Zambian waters	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Since the 1990s, the exotic Australian redclaw crayfish, Cherax quadricarinatus, has been spreading in the Zambezi River basin in Zambia. The population structure of crayfish was determined at locations along the north shore of Lake Kariba 'near Siavonga' and the Kafue River. Crayfish were sampled from the sites using the catch of fishers at the sites on a monthly basis. Population structure was analysed by length-frequency plots using total length or carapace length measurements. Estimates of population growth rates were estimated by cohort analysis. Data reveal that population structures of crayfish in both areas are robust with multiple year classes present. Estimates of the Von Bertalanffy growth parameters of crayfish were L-infinity = 196.15 mm, ranging from 168 to 215.25 mm total length (TL), k = 0.238, ranging from 0.14 to 0.43 y(-1), and mean t(o) = -0.465 y, ranging from -0.71 to 2.107. Gravid females were trapped primarily during the austral spring and early summer. There is evidence of growth overfishing at heavily fished sites, but no evidence of recruitment overfishing, suggesting difficulty of extirpation once populations become established. The presence or absence of crayfish at sites throughout Zambia was determined by use of an online survey administered to staff from the Fisheries Department at the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock, Zambia, assigned to various districts around the country, and to local officials at towns along the Zambezi, Kafue and Kwando Rivers in areas where crayfish may have extended their range. Data were verified by focus group interviews of fishers. Crayfish in Zambia have been spreading unabated throughout western and southern regions of the country. The crayfish have appeared in six previously unreported locations in the Zambezi River basin including the Kabompo River in the Northwestern Province and the Chingola Reservoir in the Copperbelt Provinces, and in the Kwando sub-watershed of the Zambezi Basin in Western Province that borders with Angola and has a seasonal aquatic connection to the critical Okavango Delta Wildlife Refuge in Botswana.

Novel technique for suppressing an invasive apex predator minimally alters nitrogen dynamics in Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming, USA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Non-native species have invaded most ecosystems and methods are needed to manage them, especially in locations with sensitive species where they cannot be easily extirpated. Gillnetting for invasive lake trout [Salvelinus namaycush (Walbaum, 1792)] in Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park, USA began in 1995 and their carcasses are deposited into deep areas. This suppression method was recently supplemented by adding carcasses to shallow (< 20 m) spawning sites during the autumn spawning period to decrease dissolved oxygen through decomposition, suffocating lake trout embryos. We measured ammonium concentrations (shallow and deep sites), algal biomass, and ammonium uptake by phytoplankton and periphyton (shallow sites only) to investigate the degree to which carcasses caused bottom-up effects. Ammonium concentrations increased in autumn and were higher at deep sites than shallow sites. Algal biomass and ammonium uptake did not increase after adding carcasses, suggesting minimal effects. Periphyton biomass was 9 times higher than phytoplankton, but phytoplankton demanded 4.5 times more ammonium. Returning lake trout carcasses to deep areas of the lake may cause a second algal bloom. Assessing how novel management techniques alter the environment helps managers develop the most successful mitigation strategies that are effective without causing adverse effects to other portions of the ecosystem.

J	Hong, B; Lin, QH; Hong, YT				Hong Bing; Lin Qinghua; Hong Yetang			Interconnections between the Asian monsoon, ENSO, and high northern latitude climate during the Holocene	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												The article emphatically reviews the research progress in interconnections between the East Asian and Indian Ocean summer monsoons, between the Asian monsoon and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity, and between the monsoon, ENSO and the changing of the North Atlantic climate during the Holocene. According to the studies of recent years, it is found that the intensity variations of the East Asian and Indian Ocean summer monsoons show an opposite relationship, which may be closely related to the phenomena of ENSO in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and the variation of the deep-water formation of the North Atlantic Ocean on the interannual to orbital time scales. The 4k and 8k events occurring at around 4200 and 8200 a BP, respectively, might be the two in a series of severe paleo-El Nino events during the Holocene, strongly reflecting the interactions and influences of the monsoons, ENSO and the North Atlantic climate. In order to better understand the relationships between these paleoclimatic phenomena, scientists need to strengthen the research work on the Asian monsoon division and the comparison between monsoon proxy records, and the study on the proxy record of sea surface temperature with high time-resolution in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and the simulation research of paleoclimate condition.

Variation in large-bodied fish-community structure and abundance in relation to water-management regime in a large regulated river	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Variation in life-history traits (growth, condition, mortality and recruitment) and relative abundance of 11 large-bodied fish species was investigated among three water-management regimes (unimpounded, run-of-the-river and winter reservoirs) in the large regulated Ottawa River, Canada. If waterpower management had an effect on fishes, then (1) would be expected community structuring among water-management regimes and (2) species with similar life-history traits should be affected in a similar manner. Large-bodied fish communities were assessed using two different standard index-netting techniques, one using trap nets and the other gillnets. Community structure could be discriminated based on species caught in nets using holographic neural networks (78.8% correct overall classification rate using trap nets and 76.0% using gillnets); therefore, water-management regimes affected community structure in the Ottawa River. Littoral zone benthivores were significantly lower in abundance (P < 0.001) or absent in winter reservoirs, whereas the abundance of planktivores or species that were planktivorous at young ages were significantly greater than in unimpounded river reaches. Growth, condition and mortality did not vary among reach types except smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu were in better condition in winter reservoirs than unimpounded reaches. Lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens recruitment was impaired in run-of-the-river reaches, whereas recruitment for other species that spawn in fast water was not affected.

Fifty-three adult fish were angled from the discharge canal at the beginning of the 1994 spawning season and implanted with temperature sensing radio transmitters. The distribution of tagged fish in the discharge canal was continuously monitored and recorded from late June to early October using three fixed monitoring stations. Seventeen of the tagged fish left the discharge canal immediately following tagging and did not return. The remaining fish, particularly males guarding nests, resided in the heated discharge during the spawning period despite daily temperature fluctuations of up to 16 degrees C. Some females and non-nesting and post-nesting males moved in and out of the discharge canal throughout the study period. Fish numbers within the canal declined throughout the summer and, by early October, all tagged bass had left the discharge. Water temperatures experienced by discharge residents closely matched station outflow values, as there was little difference in temperature throughout the 550 m long discharge canal. On several occasions temperatures were near the published upper avoidance and tolerances, but the nesting males did not leave the canal, until after the broods dispersed.					; Cooke, Steven/F-4193-2010	Cooke, Steven/0000-0002-5407-0659; 													0270-5060					SEP	2000	15	3					307	316		10.1080/02705060.2000.9663749	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2000.9663749													WOS:000088709800003

The release of endogenous P during freezing periods carries significant ecological implications for these systems. However, it remains unclear whether microbial dissimilatory iron reduction maintains a dominant role under anoxic freezing conditions, and the potential impact of weakened microbial-mediated P release via this pathway has not been adequately addressed. This study established an overlying water-porewater-sediment core microcosm system based on the ecological principle of stratified microbial communities along natural redox gradients to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of iron-dissimilatory reduction processes driven by distinct microbial species on endogenous P release during the freeze period. The results demonstrated higher P concentrations in overlying water for microbial treatment groups than controls, particularly during early stages with high microbial activity. Enhanced microbial metabolism intensified iron oxide reduction and organic P (OP) degradation. A significant correlation between inorganic P (IP) and Fe2+in the water-porewater-sediment system indicated that the interfacial processes of sediments substantially influence overlying water chemistry via the bridging effect of porewater, highlighting endogenous pollution on water quality. It was observed that nitrate-reducing bacteria preferentially degraded OM and OP to release P, while dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria primarily reduced dissolved iron oxides, liberating iron-bound P. These findings reveal distinct P release mechanisms and sources under varying microbial activity and environmental conditions. Furthermore, the sediment's iron reduction zone (8-10 cm) was identified as a hotspot layer for P release, offering critical insights for optimal dredging depth in lake management. This study emphasizes the role of microbial activity in the endogenous P release during freezing periods, particularly OP release, which may serve as an initial nutrient supply for algal blooms in spring and summer. These findings advance understanding of the role of iron oxides in seasonal redox boundary shifts and P dynamics in lake sediments within cold and arid regions.

Atmospheric concentrations of current-use pesticides across south-central Ontario using monthly-resolved passive air samplers	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												In this study passive air samplers (PAS) were deployed on a monthly basis at a number of sites along a south-north transect, extending 700 km north from Toronto, Ontario, characterizing an urban-agricultural-forested gradient, to investigate the spatial and temporal trends of current-use pesticides (CUPs), between spring 2003 and spring 2004. The most frequently detected CUPs were chlorpyrifos, dacthal, trifluralin, and alpha-endosulfan. Highest air concentrations of chlorpyrifos were observed in May, whereas a-endosulfan and dacthal peaked in July and August. reflecting differences in usage patterns. At the agricultural site, representing the source region of CUPs, chlorpyrifos air concentrations (pg m(-3)) varied from 2700 to 3.2 and alpha-endulsulfan from 1600 to 19. The most frequently detected legacy pesticides were the hexachlorocylcohexanes (alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH). For the forested sites, located on the Precambrian Shield, a region with limited agricultural activity, seasonal differences were less pronounced and air concentrations were observed to be much lower. For instance, air concentrations (pg m(-3)) of chlorpyrifos and a-endosulfan ranged from 7.6 to 0.3 and 50 to 2.0, respectively. By combining PAS data with trajectory air shed maps it is demonstrated that potential source-receptor relationships can be assessed. Air shed maps produced in this study indicate a potential of increased deposition of CUPs to Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Fluxes measured in chambers were higher, but irrespective of the method, both lakes were heterotrophic and were annual sources of carbon gases to the atmosphere. However, with the annual CO2 flux of 6.85 (chambers) or 5.43 mol m(-2) (gradients), the humic lake had notably higher emissions than the clear-water lake, where the fluxes were 3.97 and 3.38 mol m(-2), respectively. The annual CH4 flux from the clear-water lake was 28.5 (chambers) or 20.5 mmol m(-2) (gradients) and from the humic lake 20.7 or 16.2 mmol m(-2), respectively. There were interlake differences in seasonal patterns, but the most obvious changes in fluxes occurred during or just after the rains. In the humic lake, the resulting peak in CO2 and CH4 flux was responsible for 46% and 48% of the annual flux, respectively. Before the rains, the clear-water lake was a small sink of CO2 or had near-zero efflux but afterwards became a source of CO2. In the humic lake, biological mineralization explained the majority of the fluxes, whereas in the clear-water lake the association between the biological processes and fluxes was less pronounced.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2011	56	1					61	76		10.4319/lo.2011.56.1.0061	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2011.56.1.0061													WOS:000290677200005

J	Ryabtsev, VV				Ryabtsev, Vitaliy V.			Easternmost Eastern Imperial Eagle Population in Crisis	ACTA ZOOLOGICA BULGARICA												The area surrounding Lake Baikal is home to the easternmost population of the Eastern Imperial Eagle (Aquila heliaca SAVIGNY 1809). Until recently, this was one of the largest populations in the whole of Russia. However, in recent years its numbers have declined dramatically and it is now extremely small, fragmented and vulnerable. Early observations of the population at Baikal attest to the fact that in the 1960s, in the west of the Baikal region, there were approximately 300 pairs of eagles, by the start of the 1980s - 150-200 pairs, in 1999-40 pairs, and in 2005-2007 - 25-30 pairs. Fertility over the period 1980-1990s changed insignificantly. The most reasonable explanation for the observed slump in numbers is the increased rate of fatalities outside the breeding period. Satellite-assisted radio tracking has shown that the eagles of the Baikal population pass the winter in China on the Yunnan plateau, and also in neighbouring regions of Burma and northern Thailand. Action for the conservation of the given population must first and foremost be directed towards reduction of winter mortality. An expedition to the eagles' wintering area is necessary to understand the reasons for mortality increase.																			0324-0770					JUL	2011				3			29	36																WOS:000294086600005
J	Jones, NE; Mackereth, RW				Jones, Nicholas E.; Mackereth, Robert W.			Resource subsidies from adfluvial fishes increase stream productivity	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Anadromous fishes are well known to shape the structure and function of recipient ecosystems by introducing nutrients and rich organic matter from the ocean. In contrast, the importance of potamodromous migrations, confined to freshwater, and the subsidies they provide to stream ecosystems has received much less attention. Our objective was to determine the importance of excretion, eggs, milt, and carcasses as nutrient and energy sources from a large population (82449 suckers) of migrating longnose (Catostomus catostomus) and common white (Catostomus commersonii) suckers into a small (wetted width c. 10m) oligotrophic river system. We hypothesise that the adfluvial suckers provide a large material subsidy that increased the productivity of the Cypress River and that this resource subsidy rivals or exceeds those delivered by other native and non-native fishes (e.g. Pacific salmonids). In total there was an estimated 5635kg of eggs, 2025kg of milt, and 1kg of carcasses from suckers that spawn in the Cypress River. Relative to other mainly non-native fishes, suckers provided 92% of the annual egg biomass and 95% of the milt. Suckers, however, only provided <1% (1kg) of the annual carcass biomass, whereas, pink salmon provided 50% (600kg). Overall, suckers provided 84% and 78% of the annual subsidies of N and P, or 212 and 14kg respectively. Ambient NH4 concentrations in the river were consistently below that predicted from excretion equations suggesting that microorganisms may have rapidly taken up much of the released ammonium. Downstream of the falls, epilithon biomass was over nine times more abundant, benthic invertebrate densities were approximately two times higher, and fish biomass was eight times greater compared to upstream. There were no upstream-downstream differences in substrate organic matter biomass. Fishes downstream of the falls had higher C-13 and N-15 values than biota upstream of the falls consistent with the anticipated effect of lake derived subsidies. Using stable isotopes values and a mixing model, we estimated that sucker eggs comprised 25-58% of the diet of stream fishes during the growing season. Suckers provided a large subsidy, greater than all other fishes, without mass mortality and significantly enhanced the productivity of the recipient river system. Stable isotopes revealed that subsidies were incorporated into the stream food web. Differences between salmon and sucker subsidies related to the type, magnitude, timing, and the life history of the donor highlight the potential importance of spawning migrations of adfluvial suckers, and other potamodromous fishes, in streams and rivers around the world.

Our results show that the drylands in NW China might have been regulated both by the westerlies and by the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) in a roughly synchronous manner. It seems that cold-dry intervals in the central Hexi Corridor may generally correspond to cooling phases in high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, and that cold/warm-wet intervals largely correlate with relatively warm phases in northern high latitudes. A candidate mechanism involving NAO/AO and ENSO dynamics is tentatively proposed to account for this synchroneity. Climatic patterns may be spatially different in the NW China drylands in response to the changing predominant control of either the westerlies or the EASM, depending on the contrast of their relative strengths. Glacier meltwater discharges associated with alpine warming may be partly responsible, at least for the two records discussed in this paper, for such spatial heterogeneity of climatic changes during the Holocene. More work is needed to evaluate the individual roles and combined impacts of the EASM, the westerlies and alpine glacier meltwater regulation on the NW China dryland dynamics. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

J	Bodaly, RA; Fudge, RJP				Bodaly, RA; Fudge, RJP			Uptake of mercury by fish in an experimental boreal reservoir	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												We studied the uptake of mercury (Hg) by finescale dace (Phoxinus neogaeus) in an experimental boreal reservoir for 2 years prior to flooding and 3 years after flooding, and in a natural wetland pond over the same 5-year period. Hg uptake was much higher after flooding as compared to uptake before flooding and in the natural pond. After flooding, Hg concentrations in late summer were usually 2-3 X higher than concentrations observed prior to flooding. Net uptake of Hg by fish over the summer in the experimental reservoir was 0.25 and -0.07 mu g per fish in the 2 years before flooding as compared to 0.63, 0.64, and 0.42 mu g per fish in the 3 years after flooding. Thus, Hg uptake by fish responded quickly to flooding and was highest in the first 2 years following impoundment. Uptake in the reference pond ranged from 0.10 to 0.28 pg of Hg per fish over the same 5-year period. Calculated fluxes of Hg on an areal basis ranged from 0.04-0.09 mu g m(-2) year(-1) in the reference pond, were 0.08 and -0.02 mu g m(-2) year(-1) in the experimental reservoir prior to flooding, and ranged from 0.14-0.22 mu g m(-2) year(-1) in the experimental reservoir after flooding. These fluxes were much smaller than fluxes of methyl mercury (MeHg) through the zooplankton and emerging insect communities. Most (71-89%) of the mercury measured in the muscle of finescale dace was MeHg, and the proportion that was MeHg decreased over the summer period prior to flooding, but increased over the summer after flooding. Growth of fish was not significantly affected by flooding. Fish ate predominantly benthic invertebrates (64-84% of food items found in stomachs), with lesser proportions of crustacean zooplankton (16-31% of items found in stomachs) and feeding was similar after as compared to before flooding. Therefore, differences in Hg uptake did not appear to be the result of changes in diet.																			0090-4341					JUL	1999	37	1					103	109		10.1007/s002449900494	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002449900494								10341047					WOS:000080623700012

Algal biomass was low in winter with diatoms and cryptomonads the most prominent forms. Zooplankton biomass was about 1/10 the algal standing crop and cyclopoid copepods predominated. Phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass declined downriver, providing evidence that most plankton was imported from Lake Ontario. Benthic invertebrate standing crop was greatest near Lake Ontario where mollusks were abundant. The downriver macroinvertebrate community shifted to coarse particle feeders, i.e., annelids and chironomids. Beds of accumulated detrital material, derived primarily from dieback of macrophytes, were particularly rich in benthic invertebrates.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1981	79	1					65	75		10.1007/BF00005820	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00005820													WOS:A1981LK41600006

According to the characterization results, cerium was successfully loaded onto MIL-101-NH2 and that Ce-MOFs might be generated during the loading process, which modified the crystal structure of MIL-101-NH2 and resulted in MOFs with different microstructures. In single-uptake systems containing only phosphate or As(V), isothermal adsorption experiments showed that 1Ce-MIL-101-NH2 exhibited better adsorption properties of phosphate and As(V) than MIL-101-NH2. Furthermore, the uptake amounts of phosphate and As(V) reached 341.5 mg/g and 249 mg/g, respectively. Superior uptake amounts for binary phosphate (167.36 mg/g) and As(V) (87.55 mg/g) were achieved with 1Ce-MIL-101-NH2. Kinetic experiments revealed a higher uptake rate of phosphate than of As(V). FT-IR and XPS analyses showed that the main mechanism for the removal of phosphate and As(V) from water by 1Ce-MIL-101-NH2 was the formation of an Fe/Ce-O-P inner complex through ligand complexation and electrostatic attraction. Furthermore, 1Ce-MIL-101-NH2 exhibited high selectivity and excellent efficiency in removing phosphate and As (V) in contaminated spring water in the presence of competing anions; this further confirms the application potential of the novel adsorbent.					yang, xiangjun/E-6195-2019	Zhu, Guiping/0000-0003-4570-4346													0304-3894	1873-3336				FEB 5	2022	423		A						126981	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126981	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126981		AUG 2021						34474358					WOS:000696989000005
J	Zhang, MH; Liu, D; Wang, SY; Xiang, HB; Zhang, WX				Zhang, Minghui; Liu, Di; Wang, Siyuan; Xiang, Haibing; Zhang, Wenxiu			Multisource Remote Sensing Data-Based Flood Monitoring and Crop Damage Assessment: A Case Study on the 20 July 2021 Extraordinary Rainfall Event in Henan, China	REMOTE SENSING												On 20 July 2021, an extraordinary rainfall event occurred in Henan Province, China, resulting in heavy waterlogging, flooding, and hundreds of fatalities and causing considerable property damage. Because the damaged region was a major grain-producing region of China, assessing crop food production losses following this event is very important. Because the crop rotation production system is utilized in the region to accommodate two crops per year, it is very valuable to accurately identify the types of crops affected by the event and to assess the crop production losses separately; however, the results obtained using these methods are still inadequate. In this study, we used China's first commercial synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data source, named Hisea-1, together with other open-source and widely used remote sensing data (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel 2), to monitor this catastrophic flood. Both the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and Sentinel-1 dual-polarized water index (SDWI) were calculated, and an unsupervised classification (k-means) method was adopted for rapid water body extraction. Based on time-series datasets synthesized from multiple sources, we obtained four flooding characteristics, including the flooded area, flood duration, and start and end times of flooding. Then, according to these characteristics, we conducted a more precise analysis of the damages to flooded farmlands. We used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to obtain normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series data for the disaster year and normal years and overlaid the flooded areas to extract the effects of flooding on crop species. According to the statistics from previous years, we calculated the areas and types of damaged crops and the yield reduction amounts. Our results showed that (1) the study area endured two floods in July and September of 2021; (2) the maximum areas affected by these two flooding events were 380.2 km(2) and 215.6 km(2), respectively; (3) the floods significantly affected winter wheat and summer grain (maize or soybean), affecting areas of 106.4 km(2) and 263.3 km(2), respectively; and (4) the crop production reductions in the affected area were 18,708 t for winter wheat and 160,000 t for maize or soybean. These findings indicate that the temporal-dimension information, as opposed to the traditional use of the affected area and the yield per unit area when estimating food losses, is very important for accurately estimating damaged crop types and yield reductions. Time-series remote sensing data, especially SAR remote sensing data, which have the advantage of penetrating clouds and rain, play an important role in remotely sensed disaster monitoring. Hisea-1 data, with a high spatial resolution and first flood-monitoring capabilities, show their value in this study and have the potential for increased usage in further studies, such as urban flooding research. As such, the approach proposed herein is worth expanding to other applications, such as studies of water resource management and lake/wetland hydrological changes.																				2072-4292				NOV	2022	14	22							5771	10.3390/rs14225771	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14225771													WOS:000887570900001
J	Patricola, CM; Cook, KH				Patricola, C. M.; Cook, K. H.			Atmosphere/vegetation feedbacks: A mechanism for abrupt climate change over northern Africa	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Modeling studies and paleoclimate data of the mid- Holocene provide strong evidence of abrupt climate change over northern Africa. Regional climate model simulations are used to isolate and diagnose the role of interactions between vegetation and the dynamics of the West African summer monsoon in generating abrupt climate change. Simulations with both fixed and interactive vegetation distributions are included. The modeled climate is largely insensitive to the latitude of the desert border when the border is located south of 17.9 degrees N. But when the desert border is located only 180 km north of 17.9 degrees N, the climate is quite sensitive, with summer precipitation rates a factor of 5 greater over the Sahara desert and an African easterly jet that is 50% weaker. Prescribing vegetation north of the threshold latitude places moist soil beneath the thermal low, increasing the low-level moist static energy and convective instability. The atmospheric model is asynchronously coupled with a simple vegetation model that allows the vegetation to respond to and influence climate. When the model is initialized with the desert border at 10.0 degrees N, the resulting equilibrium vegetation distribution is similar to that of the present day. In contrast, when the model is initialized with the desert border at 20.9 degrees N, a new equilibrium vegetation distribution results in which the central Sahara is vegetated. The existence of these two stable climate and vegetation states and the threshold latitude indicates that interactions between vegetation (specifically through soil moisture) and the atmosphere (through the African easterly jet) can produce abrupt climate change.

Pisidium species (Sphaeriidae) are difficult to distinguish, notably the common pea clam, Pisidium casertanum (Poli, 1791), which is a polymorphic species, often misidentified and confused with other Pisidium species. This is especially true since this species is the most euryecious of the genus, being able to colonize very different habitats. In this study, elliptic Fourier Analysis, a geometric morphometric method, was used to assess intraspecific variation in P. casertanum. Sampling of specimens was done in three habitat types - springs, lakes and streams - in the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot region, using the Sebou basin in Morocco as a study area. In addition to the geometric morphometric method, linear measurements of the shell were used to assess growth patterns. Results revealed differences in the hinge plate, which is broader in shells collected from lakes, whereas it is higher in shells of springs. The geometric morphometric method clearly showed shape differences between individuals of the three habitats. Specimens of lakes were the most distinguishable, presenting more elongated shells than those from springs and streams, which are shorter but higher. Individuals from the three habitat types presented a negative allometric growth pattern whereby the shell of animals grows more slowly in height than in length. The use of linear and geometric morphometric methods led to conclude that the morphology of P. casertanum is, in fact, highly influenced by its environment, in particular, its habitat type.

The assessment of cyanobacterial blooms was carried out in shallow, eutrophic water bodies: Lake Jeziorak, Lake Bninskie, and Sulejow Reservoir. Samples for DNA, phycological, and toxin analyses were collected from July till October. Molecular analysis of the 16S rRNA region was used to detect cyanobacteria in water samples. The microscopic analysis was performed to investigate seasonal variation of phytoplankton. Cyanobacteria, with domination by Microcystis, Planktothrix, and Planktolyngbya were detected during the whole monitoring period in Sulejow Reservoir, Lake Bninskie, and Lake Jeziorak, respectively. The presence and identification of toxic strains in water bodies was studied by PCR amplification of mcy genes in the microcystis synthesis pathway. The presence of the mcyA, mcyB, mcyD, and mcyE genes in water samples indicated the genetic potential to produce microcystins. Toxicity of water samples and microcystin concentrations were established by PPIA and HPLC, respectively. The maximum concentration of microcystins was 11.13 mu g/L and 4.67 mu g/L in samples dominated by P agardhii and V. aeruginosa, respectively. Molecular analysis showed that toxigenic strains of cyanobacteria occurred in the three lakes throughout the summer season. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Grasby, SE; Chen, ZH				Grasby, SE; Chen, ZH			Subglacial recharge into the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin - Impact of pleistocene glaciation on basin hydrodynamics	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Brine springs discharging from Devonian carbonates of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin have distinct water chemistry from brines in laterally equivalent units deeper in the basin. Stable isotope data suggest that the brine springs originated as Pleistocene meltwater. These waters are interpreted to originate as an influx of subglacial meltwater related to a reversal of the basin-scale flow system, caused by the overriding ice sheet. Esker distribution shows a notable relationship between shield and sedimentary rocks. An integrated sedimentary basin/ice sheet model supports the interpretation that high permeability carbonate units acted as preferential subglacial drains that in turn affected esker development. The fluid flow history of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin is characterized by back-and-forth movement through geological time in response to changing boundary conditions. Modern-day flow systems may not then be indicative of historic movement of economic fluids through the basin.

The ice road season start, end and duration principally depend upon ice thickness, which is controlled by surface air temperature (SAT) in terms of freezing and thawing degree-days (FDD and TDD, respectively). Both FDD and TDD are indicators of climate variability and change, and are naturally influenced by large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (ACPs). This study examined the role of ACPs in interannual variations in the operating season of the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road in the Bay of Bothnia, northern Baltic Sea, during 1974-2009. Significant (p < .05) shortening in duration of the ice road season, mainly attributable to later start and earlier end days, was observed. In the Oulu-Hailuoto area, maximum ice thickness showed significant declines over time. This sea ice thinning was associated with SAT warming in cold months, manifested by statistically significant decreases in cumulative FDD during October-January within the water year (September-August). Significant increases in cumulative TDD during February-April, reflecting warmer SAT in mild months, resulted in earlier end day for the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road season. The Arctic Oscillation (AO) was the most influential ACP for variations in cumulative FDD (October-January), and accordingly for sea ice thickness and start day of the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road season. However, cumulative TDD (February-April) showed significant positive correlations with the East Atlantic (EA) pattern, which also controlled the end day of the Oulu-Hailuoto ice road season.					; Moradkhani, Hamid/B-1571-2012; Ronkanen, Anna-Kaisa/AAZ-1000-2020	Irannezhad, Masoud/0000-0002-9634-5622; Moradkhani, Hamid/0000-0002-2889-999X; Kiani, Sepideh/0000-0003-0581-2385; Ronkanen, Anna-Kaisa/0000-0003-3137-6388; Klove, Bjorn/0000-0002-2353-1440; 													0165-232X	1872-7441				JUL	2018	151						1	8		10.1016/j.coldregions.2018.02.010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2018.02.010													WOS:000432682200001

The addition of 2 degrees C to the fluctuating summer cycle of inshore Lake Ontario and H2SO4 to synthetic soft water resulted in four treatments: control, acidification of control, simulated global warming alone, and global warming plus acidification. The twice-daily feeding regime raised metabolic rates to similar to 75% of Mo-2(max). Large increases (from 4.5 to 11.5%) in whole-body lipid, smaller increases (from 12.0 to 15.5%) in protein, and compensating decreases in water content (from 77 to 71%) occurred in all treatments over time. The addition of 2 degrees C resulted in depressed appetites and growth, particularly after the period of peak temperature (days 60-90; 26 degrees C). Metabolic rate and nitrogenous waste excretion were also depressed. Overall, exposure to low pH resulted in increased appetites and growth, the increase of 2 degrees C reduced gross energy intake and increased fecal energy losses, and exposure to low pH resulted in increased energy intake and gain and better conversion efficiency. The lack of ionoregulatory disturbance in trout chronically exposed to pH 5.2 suggested that dietary NaCl may have compensated for branchial ion losses.

Many of them originate from the Ponto-Caspian region and influence European ecosystems with their migrations. One of these species, Limnomysis benedeni, a mysid shrimp, thrives in shallow waters and plays a crucial role as a food source for fish. L. benedeni was first recorded in Croatia in 2004 in Lake Sakada & scaron; (Kopa & ccaron;ki Rit). Prior to the study on aquatic macroinvertebrates in Kopa & ccaron;ki Rit Nature Park, conducted from July 2020 to July 2023, there had been no documented records in recent years. Sampling was carried out seasonally for macroinvertebrates and monthly for environmental parameters at 15 sites within the park or in the immediate vicinity. Samples were collected according to standard AQEM methodology. A total of 21 macroinvertebrate groups (407 taxa), out of which the most diverse were Diptera with 20 families, were identified in this study, including nine allochthonous species in addition to L. benedeni. The most abundant populations of L. benedeni were found in the Danube, the Petre & scaron; channel, and Vemeljski Dunavac channel, which supply the floodplain with water from the Danube. Most individuals were collected in summer and spring, with the highest density being 741 individuals per square meter. Environmental parameters such as water level, type of habitats, pH values, chemical oxygen demand, and phosphorus content, were statistically significant for the distribution of species. The dominant microhabitat for L. benedeni in Kopa & ccaron;ki Rit was argyllal in combination with coarse particulate organic matter and wood debris, and the composition of these microhabitats remained consistent throughout the seasons. L. benedeni was the only crustacean species to establish a stable population in the floodplain area, excluding Asellus aquaticus (water louse), a cosmopolitan species.

BC) and following desertification. In the last dry period of the Holocene, human societies had to cope with changing environments and they selected refuges where water was permanently available. Some of the archaeological investigations in the Western Desert have studied the available water resources and the role of irrigation in the building of soils. In some cases, they have explained the abandonment of sites by the progressive depletion of water resources. This paper focuses on the site of Amheida (the Roman Trimithis) located in the Dakhla depression in the Western Desert of Egypt. It is an elongated area located south of a limestone plateau, where spring mounds provided abundant water during the period of occupation, which lasted from the Old Kingdom (2700 cal. BC) to the Late Roman period (end of the 41th century AD). Trimithis was abandoned after a long period of prosperity. The reasons for its abandonment, as well as that of other settlements in the oasis in the same period, have not been clarified yet. Geoarchaeological surveys carried out in 2011 and 2013 point to several phases including 1) the use of a spring mound during part of the Pharaonic period (2700 to 1069 cal. BC) and the formation of irrigation soils in the vicinity of spring mounds from the Late Pharaonic times (712 to 332 BC) to the beginning of the Roman period (30 BC); 2) the degradation of these soils by wind deflation in the irrigated perimeter during the early Roman period; 3) a recovery until the 3rd century AD, made possible by the digging of wells, before; 4) a severe phase of deflation and sand drifting which destroyed the irrigation soils and forced farmers to till the poorly irrigated bedrock.The Trimithis case exemplifies the way former societies could cope with harsh constraints (aridity, drifting sand and wind erosion) as long as water was plentiful. Water scarcity due to the progressive depletion of groundwater resources was probably compensated by an increase in human labour until thresholds were crossed, recovery being impossible due to water scarcity. A model summarizes the main findings of this study.

J	Lipson, DA; Raab, TK; Goria, D; Zlamal, J				Lipson, David A.; Raab, Theodore K.; Goria, Dominic; Zlamal, Jaime			The contribution of Fe(III) and humic acid reduction to ecosystem respiration in drained thaw lake basins of the Arctic Coastal Plain	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Previous research showed that anaerobic respiration using iron (Fe) oxides as terminal electron acceptor contributed substantially to ecosystem respiration (ER) in a drained thaw lake basin (DTLB) on the Arctic coastal plain. As DTLBs age, the surface organic layer thickens, progressively burying the Fe-rich mineral layers. We therefore hypothesized that Fe(III) availability and Fe reduction would decline with basin age. We studied four DTLBs across an age gradient, comparing seasonal changes in the oxidation state of dissolved and extractable Fe pools and the estimated contribution of Fe reduction to ER. The organic layer thickness did not strictly increase with age for these four sites, though soil Fe levels decreased with increasing organic layer thickness. However, there were surprisingly high levels of Fe minerals in organic layers, especially in the ancient basin where cryoturbation may have transported Fe upward through the profile. Net reduction of Fe oxides occurred in the latter half of the summer and contributed an estimated 40-45% to ecosystem respiration in the sites with the thickest organic layers and 61-63% in the sites with the thinnest organic layers. All sites had high concentrations of soluble Fe(II) and Fe(III), explained by the presence of siderophores, and this pool became progressively more reduced during the first half of the summer. Redox titrations with humic acid (HA) extracts and chelated Fe support our view that this pattern indicates the reduction of HA during this interval. We conclude that Fe(III) and HA reductions contribute broadly to ER in the Arctic coastal plain.					; Raab, Ted/A-7478-2008	Raab, Theodore K./0000-0002-3965-8729; 													0886-6236	1944-9224				APR	2013	27	2					399	409		10.1002/gbc.20038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gbc.20038													WOS:000322236000011

Wayne			Late-summer phytoplankton in western Lake Erie (Laurentian Great Lakes): bloom distributions, toxicity, and environmental influences	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Phytoplankton abundance and composition and the cyanotoxin, microcystin, were examined relative to environmental parameters in western Lake Erie during late-summer (2003-2005). Spatially explicit distributions of phytoplankton occurred on an annual basis, with the greatest chlorophyll (Chl) a concentrations occurring in waters impacted by Maumee River inflows and in Sandusky Bay. Chlorophytes, bacillariophytes, and cyanobacteria contributed the majority of phylogenetic-group Chl a basin-wide in 2003, 2004, and 2005, respectively. Water clarity, pH, and specific conductance delineated patterns of group Chl a, signifying that water mass movements and mixing were primary determinants of phytoplankton accumulations and distributions. Water temperature, irradiance, and phosphorus availability delineated patterns of cyanobacterial biovolumes, suggesting that biotic processes (most likely, resource-based competition) controlled cyanobacterial abundance and composition. Intracellular microcystin concentrations corresponded to Microcystis abundance and environmental parameters indicative of conditions coincident with biomass accumulations. It appears that environmental parameters regulate microcystin indirectly, via control of cyanobacterial abundance and distribution.					; Litaker, Richard/AAH-2036-2021; Fahnenstiel, Gary/ABD-6133-2020	Rediske, Richard/0000-0002-5048-1063; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				DEC	2009	43	4					915	934		10.1007/s10452-009-9238-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-009-9238-7													WOS:000272847400011

Long-term paleo-hydrological and paleo-temperature variations and their mechanisms over the NETP remain ambiguous, primarily due to the limited availability of well-dated, long-term depositional archives and suitable proxies. In this paper, we investigate climate variations and their underlying mechanisms in the region using Glycerol Dialkyl Glycerol Tetraethers (GDGTs) spanning the last 350 ka. Our results suggest that the NETP underwent substantial drying during glacial periods, with the driest period occurring during the last glacial period. The intensity of drought during glacial periods is comparable to that in the Westerlies-dominated region but differs from that in the East Asian monsoon region. This suggests that the influence of the Westerlies surpassed that of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), becoming the major driver of warm-season drought events on the NETP during glacial periods. Additionally, the peaks of aridity events coincide with summer insolation maxima during glacial periods, which may be related to the direct influence of local insolation on regulating evaporation. The reconstructed land surface temperatures were about 6.7 degree celsius during interglacial periods and 2.6 degree celsius during glacial periods, which may be linked to a combination of variations in insolation, CO2 levels, and other internal feedback mechanisms. However, an unusual warming occurred during the last glaciation, with an average temperature of about 4.8 degree celsius. This warming may be related to variations in soil moisture and vegetation resulting from extreme drought. Our study highlights the sensitivity of hydrological variations over the NETP to insolation and Westerlies, as well as the critical roles of soil moisture and vegetation in land surface temperature variations.

J	Rimmer, A				Rimmer, A			The mechanism of Lake Kinneret salinization as a linear reservoir	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The salinity of Lake Kinneret, Israel, is significantly higher than the salinity of the water from surface streams that flow to the lake. The relatively high salinity is a result of the activity of saline springs located at the bottom of the lake. The purpose of this work is to establish a general model for the salinization mechanism of Lake Kinneret. The model is based on the main components of the annual water and solute balance. Changes in time of the solute mass of the lake were described as a differential equation of a linear reservoir on an annual time scale. The model assumes that under any long-term operation policy of the lake, the components of the annual solute and water balance stay nearly constant in time. The model was tested for both steady-state conditions, and during changes in time, against measured lake salinity over the years 1968-2000. It was found that the major changes of lake salinity throughout the years were described well, despite the variety of rainfall amounts. Predictions of the expected lake salinity changes were proposed for the cases of controlled increase or decrease of saline springs discharge to the lake; for the changes of water quantity allowed to flow into or pumped out of the lake; and for various initial salinities. Predictions agree well with previous predictions made by statistical models. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Some limnological features and the structure of their algal assemblages were strongly influenced by the eutrophication caused by sea-birds activity in their areas. Such differences among lakes were evidenced by the results of Principal Component Analyses, based on both physico-chemical and phytoplankton data. Oligotrophic lakes showed a scarce phytoplankton, commonly dominated by small flagellated Chrysophyceae, and a well developed phytobenthos. Water bodies enriched by ornithogenic nutrients revealed an abundant phytoplankton usually dominated by Chlorophyceae (Volvocales) and planktonic Cyanobacteria. A study on one particular lake showed that summer changes in the phytoplankton community were mainly affected by physical phenomena such as variation in light intensity, and thawing, mixing and freezing processes.

However, modeling studies of Lake Superior to date have not included dynamic and thermodynamic ice cover. These physical characteristics of the lake in turn can have significant impacts on biogeochemical cycling within the lake. We present a new three-dimensional model of Lake Superior that includes a dynamic and thermodynamic ice model and a biogeochemical model. Results from the model forced by observed meteorological conditions for the period 1985 to 2008 are discussed and compared with available observations. Modeled long-term interannual trends in increasing water temperature and decreasing ice cover are compared with observed rates. In the model, total annual gross primary productivity is found to correlate positively with mean annual temperature and negatively with mean winter ice-cover magnitude.

Variations in microcrustacean (Crustacea: Cladocera, Copepoda) assemblages from selected groundwater-dependent ecosystems in the greater Luzon and Mindoro Island faunal regions (Philippines): insights to tropical groundwater ecology	INLAND WATERS												In the Philippines, the ecology of microcrustaceans from groundwaters and their dependent ecosystems remain poorly understood, yet knowledge about this group can elucidate patterns in groundwater biodiversity to develop sound conservation policies. In this study, microcrustaceans were studied by collecting samples from 102 groundwater-dependent ecosystems, including 51 artesian wells, 23 caves, 14 springs, and 14 piped groundwater pumps during the dry (Nov 2014 to Apr 2015) and wet (May-Oct 2015) seasons. Results indicate the presence of 21 species from Cladocera and Copepoda, including 2 obligate stygobionts and 19 species consist with surface water and facultative stygobiotic taxa. Significant differences in microcrustacean assemblages were noted among types of groundwater-dependent ecosystems (P < 0.05), wherein wells and caves harbored more abundant assemblages with higher total species richness; however, no significant variations were observed between seasons (P > 0.05). Furthermore, principle component analysis revealed that sampling sites were highly characterized by altitude, specific conductivity, and total water hardness. Microcrustacean assemblages in sampled sites were highly dominated by the influence of temperature, dissolved oxygen, and altitude. Species rarefaction analysis revealed low species richness in sampled sites within the region, supporting the existing notion that temperate groundwater-dependent ecosystems were more diverse, and faunal composition in terms of ecological groups is extremely different in tropical and temperate settings.					; Magbanua, Francis/AAQ-2743-2021; Papa, Rey Donne/AES-4252-2022	Papa, Rey Donne/0000-0003-0146-2525; Magbanua, Francis/0000-0001-7373-373X													2044-2041	2044-205X					2017	7	4					428	439		10.1080/20442041.2017.1368597	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2017.1368597													WOS:000423406300005

Yellow-stage American eel movements determined by microtagging and acoustic telemetry in the St Jean River watershed, Gaspe, Quebec, Canada	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The hypothesis that a part of the yellow American eel Anguilla rostrata sub-population of the St Jean River in eastern Quebec feeds in the brackish environment during summer and returns to the river to overwinter was tested. Three years of microtagging and the acoustic tagging and tracking of 40 American eels demonstrated that a part of the downstream migrants exploited the estuary as a summer feeding area. Upstream movement of some microtagged American eels provided support for the hypothesis that a part of those American eels returned to the river to overwinter. In addition to the demonstration of amphidromous behaviour of yellow eels, the study revealed that American eels in the estuary were active at night but homed to specific daytime resting sites.

A 5-yr (2002-2006) study was initiated following grazing and fire disturbances on an Upland Gravelly Loam ecological site in the sagebrush steppe of northern Utah, to evaluate broom snakeweed invasion in different plant communities. The study site originally had two plant communities: a sagebrush/bunchgrass community that received alternate-year, fall cattle grazing, and was dominated by bluebunch wheatgrass (Elymus spicatus) and an open stand of Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata subsp. wyomingensis), and a sagebrush community that received continuous, annual, spring cattle grazing that removed the bunchgrasses, leaving a dense stand of Wyoming big sagebrush with an understory of Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda). Portions of these two plant communities were burned in a wildfire in 2001, removing the sagebrush, and creating two additional communities. The burned portion of the sagebrush/bunchgrass community became a bluebunch wheatgrass-dominated community, and the burned portion of the sagebrush community became a snakeweed-dominated community. Foliar cover, aboveground biomass, and sagebrush and snakeweed densities were compared among the four communities. Mature snakeweed plants that existed in the sagebrush/bunchgrass community were eliminated in 2003, because of drought conditions. Snakeweed was eliminated in the bluebunch wheatgrass community by the wildfire in 2001, and there was no reestablishment. Snakeweed density and cover remained constant in the sagebrush community. Snakeweed cover increased from 2% to 31% in the snakeweed community, despite the presence of Sandberg bluegrass. The data were used to evaluate and update the current Upland Gravelly Loam (Wyoming big sagebrush) ecological site description in the Great Salt Lake Major Land Resource Area and its state-and-transition model to reflect vegetation changes associated with snakeweed invasion.

Seasonality, Hydrology, and Norovirus Epidemiology in Toronto, Canada	ECOHEALTH												Norovirus is a common cause of gastroenteritis, and is thought to be the causative agent in 68-90% of all gastroenteritis outbreaks. The seasonality of disease occurrence is sufficiently stereotyped to result in this disease being dubbed "winter vomiting disease." The genesis of this seasonality has been obscure. We sought to identify environmental factors associated with Norovirus outbreaks in Toronto, Canada. We evaluated 253 outbreaks of gastroenteritis linked to Norovirus between November 2005 and March 2008. Poisson regression models were constructed to evaluate associations between average environmental exposures and case counts. A case-crossover approach was used to evaluate associations between acute changes in environment and outbreak risk. Case-crossover analysis indicated an association between low Lake Ontario temperature (a parts per thousand currency sign4A degrees C) (hazard ratio [HR], 5.61 [95% CI, 2.81-11.12]) and high flow (> 2.5 m(3)/s) in the Don River (HR, 3.17 [95% CI, 2.30-4.36]), 1-7 days prior to case occurrence. For both exposure variables, the highest hazard ratios were found 24-48 h prior to case onset. Regression models provided further support for these patterns. The association between local watershed conditions and Norovirus outbreak risk suggest a source-water reservoir for this pathogen. We hypothesize that the reservoir may be maintained through the discharge of wastewater containing virus particles; wintertime seasonality may be explained by enhanced viral persistence at low temperatures.

This penetrometer is suitable for use in a variety of fresh water lake settings. Data are collected on a laptop PC, Palm OS handheld, or a Texas Instruments handheld data collection unit and are analysed using commercially available software. The quality of these data are adequate for determining changes in substrate type based on hardness. The unit can also be used to locate sites for optimum penetration of gravity cores and to calibrate sonar records. Addition of up to three optional transducers could expand the capabilities of the unit. Other potential uses include the determination of specific geotechnical properties of the lake sediment including the undrained shear strength.																			0921-2728					OCT	2004	32	3					305	310		10.1023/B:JOPL.0000042997.78454.e2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:JOPL.0000042997.78454.e2													WOS:000225691200008
J	JEWELL, PW				JEWELL, PW			A SIMPLE SURFACE-WATER BIOGEOCHEMICAL MODEL .2. SIMULATION OF SELECTED LACUSTRINE AND MARINE SETTINGS	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A linear, three-component (nitrate, phytoplankton, and zooplankton) biogeochemical model coupled to a one-dimensional turbulence closure fluid dynamic model successfully reproduces most of the thermal and biogeochemical features of three marine settings (Bermuda Station ''S'' in the oligotrophic portion of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, Ocean Weather Station ''India'' in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre, and the 60-m isobath of the New York Eight) and one freshwater lake (South Bluehill Pond in Newfoundland). Model reproduction of temperature in all four settings is good. Model temperature gradients in the thermocline are somewhat steeper than those observed in the data of the three marine settings due to the inability of the one-dimensional fluid flow model to reproduce internal waves which can be a significant source of vertical mixing in large water bodies. Nitrate and chlorophyll are predicted reasonably well by the model at Bermuda Station ''S'' and the New York Eight. Underprediction of surface nitrate at Station ''India'' is probably due to the lack of an ammonium component in the model. Model reproduction of the spring bloom productivity in the marine settings is good, although post-bloom model productivity is generally too low. Biogeochemical simulations of South Bluehill Pond are strongly dependent on the value of the light attenuation coefficient used in the model. A relatively high attenuation coefficient (most likely representing high inorganic sediment concentrations) is necessary to accurately reproduce nitrate and chlorophyll concentrations. These results illustrate the necessity of accurately characterizing the light regime prior to using the model in lacustrine settings.																			0043-1397					AUG	1995	31	8					2059	2070		10.1029/95WR01020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/95WR01020													WOS:A1995RM64400021

Karst relief is considered an important carbon sink, but it can also be a natural source of carbon and CO2 emission. Aquatic systems in karst areas facilitate carbon exchange between the karst and the atmosphere, often through groundwater geochemical carbonate rock dissolution (carbon sink) and in the form of secondary calcium carbonate precipitation (possible carbon source). The protected area of Plitvice Lakes National Park, located in the karst region of Croatia, was chosen as a case study on karst geochemical processes. The lakes are also specific for their authigenic calcite precipitation in the form of tufa barriers and lake sediment. Physical and chemical data (temperature, pH, Ca2+, HCO3-, Mg2+ and CO2 concentrations, calcite saturation index (SIcalc), calcite dissolution ionic ratio (IRcalc), and Mg/Ca ratio) from water samples collected at 8 locations (2 springs, 2 rivers, and 4 lakes) from 1981 to 2014 were studied. The data were not collected systematically, so long-term changes have been mostly assessed through comparison between parameters from two selected periods (1981-1986 and 2010-2014) and through temporal correlations for each observed parameter in each calendar month. For the 33 years studied, an increase in air and water temperature, Ca2+ and HCO3- concentrations, calcite saturation index (SIcalc) calcite dissolution ionic ratio (IRcalc), and a decrease in the Mg/Ca ratio were observed. No statistically significant change was observed for pH or CO2 and Mg2+ concentrations. Average discharge rates did not display any significant change over the past three decades, however there was a change in their seasonal distribution. The significant increase in Ca2+ and HCO3- concentrations at lake locations were primarily caused by an increase in Ca2+ and HCO3- values in the water of the springs. Simultaneously, Mg2+ concentrations remained constant, which indicates higher levels of limestone (calcite) dissolution than dolomite dissolution. One of the reasons for this could be higher air/soil temperatures, resulting in higher soil CO2 production, which appears to result in the higher dissolution of calcite exclusively. An increase in HCO3- concentrations at the springs implies that karst groundwater is a carbon sink. Furthermore, the fact that the spatial decrease in HCO3- concentration in downstream waters was the same during the 1981-1986 and 2010-2014 periods implies that the entire observed karst lake system itself is a carbon sink. Temporal and spatial changes in SIcalc and IRcalc values in surface waters were mainly attributed to an increase in the intensity of bioactivity, which is in turn connected with an increase in water temperature.

J	KYLE, DE; NOBLET, GP				KYLE, DE; NOBLET, GP			SEASONAL DISTRIBUTION OF THERMOTOLERANT FREE-LIVING AMEBAS .1. WILLARDS POND	JOURNAL OF PROTOZOOLOGY												A quantitative study of the seasonal distribution of thermotolerant (37.degree.C and 45.degree.C), small free-living amoebae (FLA) was conducted in Willard''s Pond, a warm, monomictic lake in the Piedmont region of South Carolina. Correlation of physical and chemical parameters with the seasonal distribution was facilitated by partitioning the aquatic ecosystem into benthic, planktonic, and neurostonic habitats. Population densities of FLA peaked in late summer in each habitat; however species composition varied between habitats. Littoral sediment appeared to be the major habitat for FLA, with peaks in populations of Acanthamoeba and Naegleria in August, Hartmannella in July, and Vahlkampfia in May. Populations in profundal sediment underwent dramatic seasonal shifts, apparently in response to the seasonal chemical changes in the hypolimnion. Acanthamoeba was most prevalent in late summer, representing as much as 82% of the FLA in profundal sediment. Distribution patterns and species composition of FLA from surface water were similar to those from littoral sediment; however, a greater percentage of Naegleria was found in surface water. Numerous FLA were isolated from the neustonic community (surface film), and the number of FLA isolated in the surface film at the deep water station was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) greater than the number from subsurface (5-10 cm) samples. In the water column, FLA populations consistently were highest in the detrital layer, which persisted at a depth of 3.0-3.4 m throughout the summer period. The large percentage of Naegleria contributing to FLA in the detrital layer suggests that Naegleria amoeboflagellates sink through the layer, flagellate, and swim back up, such migrations possibly being triggered by a reduction of nutrients below the layer or by the presence of anoxic, reducing conditions in the hypolimnion. In addition, weather events were found to play a major role in the redistribution of FLA between various habitats in the aquatic ecosystem, with such changes probably due to resuspension of FLA from littoral sediment by wind action and input from the watershed via runoff.

J	Samui, G; Antony, R; Thamban, M				Samui, Gautami; Antony, Runa; Thamban, Meloth			Fate of Dissolved Organic Carbon in Antarctic Surface Environments During Summer	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												While the role of supraglacial environments such as the cryoconite holes and surface snow in cycling of carbon and nutrients has gained momentum in the last decade, little has been done to assess how interactions with sunlight and microbes control the dissolved organic matter cycling in these environments. In this study, the cryoconite holes, which are subjected to different light conditions, were monitored in the coastal Antarctica during the summer in order to determine how the geochemistry of these environments varied through the melt season. Additionally, mesocosm experiments were conducted to understand the impact of photochemical and microbial activities on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ionic constituents in the snow and cryoconite holes. In situ measurements of primary and bacterial production carried out in the surface snow and cryoconite holes showed that the primary production rates were higher than the bacterial production rates. Both photochemical and microbial processes resulted in changing the concentration of DOC, carboxylate, and nitrate ions in these environments. Sunlight-induced production of biologically labile compounds, such as acetate and formate, and photochemical degradation of oxalate were also observed. Microbial activity had the opposite effect, resulting in an increase in oxalate and decrease in acetate and formate concentrations. Consequences of these combined processes would determine the fate of DOC and associated nutrients in the Antarctic supraglacial environments and potentially influence the local productivity within these systems.					; Samui, Gautami/AGM-8337-2022	Antony, Runa/0000-0003-4829-4207; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				DEC	2020	125	12							e2020JG005958	10.1029/2020JG005958	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JG005958													WOS:000603282000013
J	Zeng, LF; Schmitt, M; Li, L; Zhu, XX				Zeng, Lingfang; Schmitt, Michael; Li, Lin; Zhu, Xiao Xiang			Analysing changes of the Poyang Lake water area using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Poyang Lake is the largest freshwater lake in China. Monitoring changes of its water area is essential for the conservation of important wetlands and ecological resources, and plays an important role for sustainable water use and management. Landsat and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor images are widely used for mapping waterbodies, because of their sensitivity for spectral reflectance of water. However, studies using Landsat images have limited their investigations of changes of Poyang Lake to dry season due to the impairment by cloud cover. Further limited by the rather long 16 day revisit cycle, most existing studies build on the vague assumption that Poyang Lake undergoes only relatively slow changes during this season. MODIS, in contrast, provides a very short revisit period, but has been proven not to be able to assess the water area of Poyang Lake accurately due to low spatial resolution. Therefore, the contribution of this study is to investigate recent Poyang Lake water area changes both during high-and low-water period with unforeseen temporal and spatial resolution using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. More specifically, we aim at investigating Poyang Lake's recent water area changes in intra-month scales. During the observation period from October 2014 to March 2016, October 2014 was the month with the largest max/min water coverage ratio. Water coverage of winter in 2014 and 2015 was completely different, as a severe drought happened in 2014 and an unusual winter flood happened in 2015. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential of using Sentinel-1 SAR data to reveal intra-month variations, benefiting from the sensor's regular observation capabilities independent of weather conditions. It is shown that Sentinel-1 SAR data, with rapid availability and free-of-charge distribution policy, as well as relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions, is becoming an indispensable data source for a detailed monitoring of important inland waterbodies and wetlands.

They harbor distinct chemosynthetic bacterial communities, depending on temperature (16-110 degrees C) and electron donor supply (H2S <1 to > 100 mu M; NH3 < 0.5 to > 10 mu M). Members of the Aquificales, most closely affiliated with the genus Sulfurihydrogenibium, are the most frequently recovered bacterial 16S rRNA gene phylotypes in the hottest samples; the detection of these thermophilic sulfur-oxidizing autotrophs coincided with maximal dark CO2 fixation rates reaching near 9 mu M Ch (1) at temperatures of 50-60 degrees C. Vents at lower temperatures yielded mostly phylotypes related to the mesophilic gammaproteobacterial sulfur oxidizer Thiovirga. In contrast, cool vent water with low chemosynthetic activity yielded predominantly phylotypes related to freshwater Actinobacterial clusters with a cosmopolitan distribution.

J	SCHINK, B; ZEIKUS, JG				SCHINK, B; ZEIKUS, JG			MICROBIAL ECOLOGY OF PECTIN DECOMPOSITION IN ANOXIC LAKE-SEDIMENTS	JOURNAL OF GENERAL MICROBIOLOGY												Anaerobic digestion of pectin by bacteria was examined in 2 freshwater lakes in Wisconsin [USA] and in defined laboratory cultures of species prevalent in the lake sediment. The turnover times for protein biodegradation to methane in sediments incubated at in situ temperature were much longer (100 h in Lake Mendota and 185 h in Knaack Lake) than either that observed for glucose (12 h in Lake Mendota) or previously reported for acetate (0.22 h in Lake Mendota). The numbers of pectinolytic anaerobes varied seasonally in both sediments (102-105 and 103-105 ml-1 in Knaack Lake and Lake Mendota, respectively), and were highest during the fall after sedimentation of algal blooms and/or leaf detritus. Clostridium butyricum was identified as a prevalent pectinolytic anaerobe in both lakes. In mono-culture pectin fermentations, C. butyricum produced methanol, H2/CO2, acetate, ethanol and butyrate; growth stopped in the presence of excess energy source when the pH fell to 4.3. In co-culture pectin fermentations of C. butyricum/Methanosarcina barkeri, H2/CO2, methanol and acetate were detected as intermediary metabolites, and pectin was completely degraded to CH4 and CO2, the pH remaining neutral. 14C-radiotracer analysis substantiated the simultaneous conversion of H2/CO2, methanol and acetate to CH4 by M. barkeri, as these metabolites were generated from pectin hydrolysis by C. butyricum.																			0022-1287						1982	128	FEB					393	404																WOS:A1982NE54900021

Tracking the hydro-climatic signal from lake to sediment: A field study from central Turkey	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Palaeo-hydrological interpretations of lake sediment proxies can benefit from a robust understanding of the modern lake environment. In this study, we use Nar Golu, a non-outlet, monomictic maar lake in central Turkey, as a field site for a natural experiment using observations and measurements over a 17-year monitoring period (1997-2014). We compare lake water and sediment trap data to isotopic, chemical and biotic proxies preserved in its varved sediments. Nar Golu underwent a 3 m lake-level fall between 2000 and 2010. delta O-18(lakewater) is correlated with this lake-level fall, responding to the change in water balance. Endogenic carbonate is shown to precipitate in isotopic equilibrium with lake water and there is a strong relationship between delta O-18(lakewater) and delta O-18(carbonare), which suggests the water balance signal is accurately recorded in the sediment isotope record. Over the same period, sedimentary diatom assemblages also responded, and conductivity inferred from diatoms showed a rise. Shifts in carbonate mineralogy and elemental chemistry in the sediment record through this decade were also recorded. Intra-annual changes in delta O-18(lakewater) and lake water chemistry are used to demonstrate the seasonal variability of the system and the influence this may have on the interpretation of delta O-18(carbonate) We use these relationships to help interpret the sedimentary record of changing lake hydrology over the last 1725 years. Nar Golu has provided an opportunity to test critically the chain of connection from present to past, and its sedimentary record offers an archive of decadal- to centennial-scale hydro-climatic change.

Simple correlation analysis of the data obtained from both types of collection indicated that the smelter was a major source of Zn, Cd, Pb, As and Cu in bulk precipitation in the Flin Flon area. Metal deposition with respect to distance from the smelter fit exponential curves. Integration of the deposition curves to selected levels (1 mg/m2 per yr for Zn, Pb and Cu, 0.1 mg/m2 per yr for As and 0.01 mg/m2 per yr for Cd) gave the following radii for affected zones: Zn, 131-264; Cd, 113-284; Pb, 44-87; As, 37-68 and Cu, 33-60 km. Total deposition within these zones was as follows: Zn, 850-1616; Cd, 2.0-8.0; Pb, 14-55; As, 0.4-4.0 and Cu, 14-48 t [ deposit within circular area]. Direct comparison of the 2 collection methods, possible for only 1 winter period, showed that bulk precipitation collections yielded estimates of metals deposition that were, on the average, only 55% of estimates determined from winter snow samples from the same location and time period.																			0013-936X	1520-5851					1979	13	12					1513	1522		10.1021/es60160a014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es60160a014													WOS:A1979HW20200022
J	Deneke, R; Nixdorf, B				Deneke, R; Nixdorf, B			On the occurrence of clear-water phases in relation to shallowness and trophic state: a comparative study	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Trophic Interactions in Shallow Freshwater and Brackish Waterbodies	AUG 03-08, 1998	BLOSSIN, GERMANY	Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisher, Tech Univ Cottbus				We present a comparative study on the occurrence of spring clear-water phases in six eutrophic lakes (two deep, four very shallow lakes dominated by plankton, TP: 0.06-0.13 mg l(-1)) in the Scharmutzelsee region (Germany). Our aim was to analyse the occurrence and intensity of clear-water phases in relation to shallowness and trophic state. We defined a clear-water phase by a continuous increase of Secchi depth, a corresponding decrease in algal biomass and a shift in phytoplankton species composition during the growth phase of cladoceran zooplankton. For shallow lakes, we used the increase of the euphotic depth up to maximum depth as an additional criterion. Only in two of six lakes a clear-water phase occurred. In two lakes, no spring peak of cladocerans developed. In two other lakes, a high biomass of grazing resistant cyanobacteria was not affected by cladoceran maxima. Daphnia galeata was an important component of the grazer community in lakes with a clear-water phase, whereas lakes without a clear-water phase were dominated by Bosmina longirostris. Top-down control of grazing by fish predation is discussed as the main factor determining biomass, composition and timing of the cladoceran spring peak. The assumed relative strength of fish predation between lakes corresponds to the response in algal biomass, dominance of cyanobacteria and is inversely related to the potential grazing pressure (ratio of cladoceran and algal biomass). Bottom-up effects (food quality) and additional factors (fungal infection, flushing rate) may also influence growth and timing of cladocerans. Our results support the view that a high biomass of grazing zooplankton is essential for the occurrence of a clear-water phase, but not sufficient to explain variability between lakes. High cladoceran maxima in hypertrophic lakes indicate that food quality seems not to limit grazer biomass. Decoupling of zooplankton and phytoplankton may be the result of early and fast growth of grazing resistant algae. We conclude that shallowness and trophy may indirectly reduce the extent and predictibility of a clear-water phase by enhanced growth of cyanobacteria and increasing predation pressure at least for lakes on this TP level.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1999	408						251	262		10.1023/A:1017088008761	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017088008761													WOS:000084892400027

Water from the warm water plumes that is washed onshore by prevailing winds and currents then percolates down through the beach sands and gravels. Precipitation of amorphous silica, triggered by cooling of the mixed spring and lake water, is preferentially focused on the epilithic and chasmolithic filamentous microbes, which act as templates for silica nucleation and precipitation.

Various hydraulic structures change the longitudinal slope and cross-sectional shape of the riverbed, which has a significant impact on the simulation of water-head evolution. With continuous population growth, the hydrological characteristics of the Yongding River Basin have undergone significant changes. Too little or too much water discharge may be insufficient to meet downstream ecological needs or lead to the wastage of water resources, respectively. It is necessary to consider whether the total flow in each key section can achieve the expected value under different discharge flows. Therefore, a reliable computer model is needed to simulate the evolution of the water head and changes in the water level and flow under different flow rates to achieve efficient water resource allocation. A one-dimensional hydrodynamic coupling model based on the Saint-Venant equations was established for the Yongding River Basin. Different coupling methods were employed to calibrate the coupling model parameters, using centralised water replenishment data for the autumn of 2022, and the simulation results were verified using centralised water replenishment data for the spring of 2023. The maximum error of the water-head arrival time between different river sections was 4 h, and the maximum error of the water-head arrival time from the Guanting Reservoir to each key cross-section was 6 h. The maximum flow error was less than 5 m3/s, and the changing trend of the flow over time was consistent with the measured data. The model effectively solved the problem of low accuracy of the water level and flow calculation results when using the traditional one-dimensional hydrodynamic model to simulate the flow movement of complex river channels in the Yongding River. The output results of the model include the time when the water head arrives at the key section, the change process of the water level and flow of each section, the change process of the water storage of lakes and gravel pits, and the change process of the total flow and water surface area of the key section. This paper reports data that support the development of an ecological water compensation scheme for the Yongding River.

For all taxonomic groups we found a hierarchical structure in the community assemblage using distinct scales of lake clustering (number of k-means groups) based on species composition similarity (Hellinger distance). We determined the optimal partition in assemblage types (i.e. number of lake clusters) for each taxonomic group by maximising the sum of the taxon indicative value (IndVal) and performed discriminant analyses, using environmental variables not conditioned by geographical patterns. Relevant environmental variables differed among and within taxonomic groups. Therefore the assemblages respond to a complex environmental mosaic, with the exception of diatom assemblages, which followed an acid-base gradient. The significant environmental variables could be grouped into four general factors: lake size, tropho-dynamic status, acid-base balance and ice-cover duration (i.e., altitudinal gradient). Lake size was significant for the highest number of assemblage types; however, the most significant factor differed among taxonomic groups: acid-base balance for diatoms, lake size for rotifers, ice-cover duration for chydorids and planktonic crustaceans and tropho-dynamic status for chironomids. No single environmental typology accounted for the assemblage structure of all taxonomic groups. However, defining ecological thresholds as values within environmental gradients at which the rate of change in assemblages is accelerated relative to points distant from that threshold, we were able to find specific threshold values for each of the four main general environmental factors identified, which were relevant across several taxonomic groups: 3 ha for lake area; 0.6 mg L-1 for dissolved organic carbon; 190 days for ice-cover duration and 200 mu eq L-1 for acid neutralising capacity. Above and below these values ecosystem organisation change substantially. They have direct applications in establishing lake typologies for environmental quality and biodiversity conservation programmes, and in improving predictions about global change impacts.

The recent application of micro-X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning provides the potential for high-resolution study on the laminations deposited in the East/Japan Sea. In this study, we present a geochemical study by using micro-XRF core scanning on a 730?cm core recovered from the East/Japan Sea. Elemental variations and factor analysis indicate that the sedimentary environment changed from anoxic to suboxic conditions from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 23 to MIS 1, which is induced by increased contribution of high-salinity sea water from the open ocean due to the rising sea level. The dark and light laminations during MIS 23 were correlated with DansgaardOeschger cycles and summer monsoon proxy, with dark-colored sediments related to higher terrigenous concentration, corresponding to warmmoist and enhanced summer monsoon period. During the interstadial period, more terrigenous sediments were transported to the East/Japan Sea via the strengthened fluvial discharge from the surrounding continents, caused by enhanced monsoon rainfall. Thus the development of the East Asian summer monsoon and consequent variations in fluvial discharge would have significantly affected the paleoceanographic conditions in the East/Japan Sea during the MIS 23 sea-level lowstand.

Precipitations throughout the Altiplanic winter (December to March) and austral winter (June to September) caused ponds to enlarge and surface salt crusts to dissolve driving roughness and dielectric features of the salar surface change over time. A four-year time series backscattering coefficient analysis, obtained by Sentinel 1 and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 with 10 m of spatial resolution, demonstrated the capability of microwaves to discriminate seasonal patterns illustrated in this paper. Both sensors showed to be sensitive to changes in the surface crust due to weather conditions. Backscattered power gradually increased during the driest months as the rough salt crusts develop and decreased rapidly due to precipitations or flooding events, which lead to a smoothing appearance to radar. The high temporal frequency of acquisition in Sentinel 1 (5-13 scenes/month) allowed the discrimination among climate and annual seasonality and episodic events in the C-band backscatter coefficient. On the other hand, ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 showed subsurface changes at L-band since the salinity of the brine in the soil reduces the penetration depth of backscattered power for shorter wavelengths. Results might be useful to monitor salars with geographic and weather conditions similar to Salar de Aguas Calientes Sur.					; Briceño-de-Urbaneja, Idania/AAR-5707-2020; Delsouc, Analia/AAQ-6541-2020; Pérez-Martínez, Waldo/ABG-1049-2021	Vidal-Paez, Paulina/0000-0003-1836-5684; Delsouc, Analia/0000-0003-4311-5812; Perez-Martinez, Waldo/0000-0002-3670-6190; Gallaud, Audrey/0000-0002-3206-9999														2072-4292				MAR	2020	12	6							941	10.3390/rs12060941	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs12060941													WOS:000526820600043

Fish and light affected the biomass of primary producers and the benthic grazers in both lakes. The biomass of primary producers was generally higher in the turbid than the clear lake, and in both lakes fish positively affected the biomass, while shading reduced it. Total biomass of benthic grazing invertebrates was higher in the clear than in the turbid lake and the lakes were dominated by snails and chironomids + ostracods, respectively. While light had no effect on the biomass of grazers in the clear lake, snail breeding was delayed in the most shaded enclosures and presence of fish reduced the number of snails and the total biomass of grazers. In the turbid lake ostracod abundance was not influenced by light, but was higher in fish-free enclosures. Density of chironomids correlated positively with periphyton biomass in summer, while fish had no effect. Generally, light-mediated regulation of primary producers was stronger in the turbid than in the clear lake, but the regulation did not unambiguously influence the primary consumers. However, regulation by fish of the benthic grazer community was stronger in the clear than in the turbid lake, and in both lakes strong top-down effects on periphyton were seen. The results indicate that if present-day climate in Denmark in the future is found in coastal areas at higher latitudes, the effect of lower light during winter in such areas will be highest in clear lakes, with typically lower fish biomass and higher invertebrate grazer density.

Comparison of isotopic mass balance and instrumental techniques as estimates of basin hydrology in seven connected lakes over 12 years	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X												Mass-balance models using stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen provide useful estimates of the water balance of lakes, particularly in the absence of instrumental data. However, isotopic mass balances are rarely compared directly to measured water fluxes. Here we compared instrumental and isotope-based determinations of water fluxes in seven connected lakes over 12 years to quantify how agreement between the two approaches is affected by lake type and its position in the landscape. Overall, lake-specific ratios of evaporation to inflow (E/I) from instrumental measurements (median, (x) over tilde = 0.06, median absolute deviation, MAD = 0.06) agreed well with isotopic estimates using headwater models ((x) over tilde = 0.14, MAD = 0.08), with the exception of one lake with limited channelized inflow of surface waters ((x) over tilde instrumental = 0.51 vs. (x) over tilde headwater = 0.24). Isotope-instrument agreement improved ((x) over tilde = 0.09 vs. (x) over tilde = 0.03) when basin-specific ('best-fit') isotope models also considered local connectivity to upstream water bodies. Comparison among years revealed that mean isotopic E/I values were lowest in 2011 (mean, mu = 0.06, standard deviation, sigma = 0.09) during a 1-in-140 year spring flood, and highest during a relatively arid year, 2003 (mu = 0.22, sigma = 0.19), while interannual variability in E/I generally increased with distance downstream along the mainstem of the watershed. Similar patterns of agreement between methods were recorded for water-residence time. Isotope models also documented the expected low water yield from lake catchments (mu = 36.2 mm yr(-1), sigma = 62.3) suggesting that isotope models based on late-summer samples integrate annual inputs from various sources that are difficult to measure with conventional methods. Overall, the strong positive agreement between methods confirms that water isotopes can provide substantial insights into landscape patterns of lake hydrology, even in ungauged systems.					; Simpson, Gavin/KFQ-1110-2024; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013; yi, yi/HHY-7381-2022	Wissel, Bjoern/0000-0001-6312-149X; Sauer, Heather/0000-0002-0208-8179; Simpson, Gavin/0000-0002-9084-8413; Hodder, Kyle/0000-0002-1447-2557; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307; 														2589-9155				JAN	2020	6								100046	10.1016/j.hydroa.2019.100046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hydroa.2019.100046													WOS:000658533900001

The inventory of Pu239+240 in those lakes was larger than that in soil in Rokkasho, which indicated the inflow of Pu239+240 from the catchment area in addition to direct deposition on the lake surfaces. The Cs-137 inventory in sediments of the brackish lakes was lower than that in the soil, which showed that part of the Cs-137 was removed from the sediments by the brackish water or that it was not deposited into the sediments, because of the high solubility of Cs in brackish water. The Cs-137 inventory in sediments of the freshwater lakes was higher than that of the brackish lakes, and comparable with that in soil except for one core sample out of four. The Pu239+240/Cs-137 ratio in freshwater lake sediments was higher than that in soil, and that indicated that part of the Cs-137 was lost from the sediments. The low inventory of Cs-137 may be attributable to competition for absorption sites in sediments with ammonium ions formed in the reducing environment which occurs from summer to fall in the sediments. Those data will be used as background data on the artificial radionuclides in the lakes to assess the effect of released radionuclides on their concentrations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Global patterns of light saturation and photoinhibition of lake primary production	INLAND WATERS												The effect of light availability on lake gross primary production (GPP) depends on the physical setting and meteorological and chemical conditions characterizing the lake. Although it has long been recognized that complex interactions between external and in-lake conditions affect whole-lake GPP, few studies have evaluated the importance of different drivers of daily and seasonal variability in GPP for a diverse set of lake types. In this study, we used a unique dataset covering a wide spectrum of lakes in terms of size, nutrient loading, and phytoplankton biomass, combined with high-frequency meteorology, dissolved oxygen (DO), and light data to determine the GPP of the lakes and to investigate the degree of light limitation and photoinhibition of GPP over multiple time scales. A Bayesian modeling approach was employed to model diel changes in DO as a nonlinear function of light and temperature, making it possible to determine the parameters describing the light dependency of hourly GPP rates under in situ conditions. Of the 900 days analyzed, 43% had moderate to strongly light-saturated GPP during midday summer conditions, and photoinhibition occurred on 77% of these days. GPP became increasingly light-limited with increasing nutrient and phytoplankton concentrations, conditions that also reduced the likelihood of photoinhibition. The highest summer rates of GPP were found in the light-limited, nonphotoinhibited lakes with elevated nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass, although annual rates were much lower in these systems. Our results show that the interaction of light and nutrients affects the magnitude and temporal variability of GPP in lake ecosystems.

A cross-scale view of N and P limitation using a Bayesian hierarchical model	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We propose a bivariate Bayesian hierarchical model (BBHM), which adds a perspective on a century-long subject of research, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) dynamics in freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems. The BBHM is differentiated from existing approaches by modeling multiple aspects of N-P relationships?N and P concentration variability, ratio, and correlation?simultaneously, allowing these aspects to vary by seasonal and/or spatial components. The BBHM is applied to three aquatic systems, Finnish Lakes, Saginaw Bay, and the Neuse Estuary, which exhibit differing landscapes and complexity of nutrient dynamics. Our model reveals N and P dynamics that are critical to inferring unknown N and P distributions for the overall system as well as for within system variability. For Finnish lakes, strong positive within- and among-lake N and P correlations indicate that the rates of N and P biogeochemical cycles are closely coupled during summer across the different lake categories. In contrast, seasonal decoupling between N and P cycles in Saginaw Bay is evidenced by the large variability in monthly correlations and the seasonal changes in the N distribution. The results underscore the pivotal role that dreissenids have had on the cycling of nutrients and resurgence of eutrophication. The presence of clear seasonality and a spatial gradient in the distributions and N and P in the Neuse Estuary suggest that riverine N input is an important source in the season-space N dynamics, while summer sediment release is a major process regulating seasonal P distribution.					; Alameddine, Ibrahim/D-9365-2013; Qian, Song/I-6544-2012; Stow, Craig/AAG-8109-2020	Qian, Song/0000-0002-2346-4903; Alameddine, Ibrahim/0000-0002-8974-1985; Stow, Craig/0000-0001-6171-7855; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2016	61	6					2276	2285		10.1002/lno.10375	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10375													WOS:000387749500023

C10S12	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												[ 1] A study of respiration to photosynthesis ( R: P) ratios in Lake Superior, based on the fraction of O-2 saturation and the isotopic composition of O-2, was undertaken to evaluate spatial and temporal variations in the trophic status of a large oligotrophic freshwater environment. The lake was predominantly net heterotrophic from April to October 2000 ( R: P ratios: 1.2 - 2.5). Uniform R: P ratios of similar to 1.5 with depth and across the lake in April 2000 and 2001 revealed the homogeneity of the water column during spring. A brief period of net autotrophy was observed during summer thermal stratification in 2000 and 2001, and surveys showed this condition to be prevalent and lake-wide in August 2001 ( R: P ratios: 0.5 - 0.9). Strong net autotrophy ( R: P ratios: 0.6) was found near Duluth, Minnesota, and suggested the potential for the formation of mesotrophic conditions within areas of increased nutrient loadings from urbanization. Respiration and photosynthesis were shown to exert a strong control on O-2 gas exchange within Lake Superior, as evidenced by significant correlations between R: P ratios and O-2 gas exchange during periods of net heterotrophy and autotrophy. This observation was unexpected since [O-2] in the lake appears to be dominated by atmospheric O-2 gas exchange, given that the fraction of O-2 saturation is continuously near levels expected for equilibration with the atmosphere. Furthermore, the relationship between the biological and physical O-2 fluxes may enable the use of R: P ratios to calculate O-2 gas exchange and ultimately estimate CO2 fluxes between lakes and the atmosphere.						gandhi, hasand/0000-0003-3866-9845; Urban, Noel/0000-0002-3586-0399													2169-9275	2169-9291				JUL 8	2004	109	C10							C10S12	10.1029/2003JC001890	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2003JC001890													WOS:000222656500001

Automated digital processing techniques were used to preprocess and classify 36 ERS-2 images acquired during April 2009. Lakes within the study area were extracted from the imagery and classified to produce frozen (no liquid water present) and unfrozen (liquid water present under ice) classes. Bathymetric data from 105 lakes were compiled from existing sources and were used as validation for the classification results based on an expected maximum ice depth of 1.6 m. Lake locations with a depth of less than 1.6 m were considered to be frozen while those greater than 1.6 m were considered unfrozen. Bathymetric locations that were classified as frozen were found to be less than 1.6 m in depth at 94% of the sample locations. Classification error within the unfrozen class was typically greatest within 50 m of the frozen/unfrozen class boundary. Bathymetric locations that were greater than 1.6 m in depth and which were more than 50 m from the frozen/unfrozen class boundary were correctly identified as unfrozen at 98% of the verification locations. Shallow areas less 1.6 m in depth were sometimes misclassified as unfrozen areas resulting in an overall classification accuracy of 89%. Three sources of classification error were considered; spatial mis-registration, ice depth variation, and talik presence. Mapping winter liquid water content within lakes on the North Slope coastal plain provides a useful tool for the evaluation of individual lakes during development planning and also provides a broad regional description of lake morphology that is relevant to landscape level physical and ecological interpretation.

Spatial and temporal variations in moss-inhabiting summer diatom communities from Potter Peninsula (King George Island, Antarctica)	POLAR BIOLOGY												This work represents the first analysis of the spatial and temporal variations in the diversity and community structure of diatoms associated with mosses, either dry or wet, sampled during the summer season from the littoral zone of three ponds in Potter Peninsula (King George Island, South Shetland Islands). It also seeks to explore the effect moisture content in the mosses can have on the structure of the diatom assemblages. The ponds approximately had the same number of species, and differences were found between the dry and wet sampling points. The same 4 species were predominant in the three ponds (Nitzschia alpina, N. perminuta, Staurosira oldenburgiana, and Pinnularia subantarctica var. elongata), but not in the same proportions. The first three species differed from those which were found to be dominant in other basins covered by mosses in southern South America and in the sub-Antarctic region. The latter, P. subantarctica var. elongata, had only been found to be abundant in a moss sample from another South Shetland Island. The diatom assemblages were found to be more strongly related to habitat traits (e.g. distance to the sea, ponds' areas, and the vegetation's moisture levels) than to the physical-chemical variables measured in the water.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study was conducted in a wetland on the Lower Parana River (Argentina). Algal assemblages from a permanent shallow lake, three relict oxbow lakes (ROL) and an isolated small pond were sampled fortnightly during the spring-summer time of 1998-99. The algal assemblages strongly differed among the permanently vegetated ROLs and the shallow lake and small pond, both temporarily covered by floating macrophytes. Anoxic conditions and poor light penetration have been pointed out in previous studies to be the leading factors in the selection of algal species in this wetland. Two or three Cyanobacteria species and some large pennate diatoms dominated the algal biomass in the ROLs, whereas only the former taxa contributed significantly to density. Assemblages were characterised by their low diversity and species richness; the highest SIMI values between consecutive samplings were registered in the ROLs. Even though some characteristics of the Z and S-2 Reynolds associations describe the ROLs assemblages, they do not strictly match with them. Changes in algal density and biomass were more pronounced in the shallow lake. An alternative dominance of Cryptomonas spp., Peridinium spp., Euglena spp., Monoraphidium spp., Oscillatoriales and Chroococcales occurred, with a consequent replacement of the Y, L-0, W-1 X-1, S-2, K, and F Reynolds associations. Variation in the macrophytic cover of the small pond accounted for the fluctuations in its algal composition. When the cover was complete, the assemblages resembled those of the ROLs, whereas when its surface was free of plants, they were more similar to those of the shallow lake. Steady state assemblages related to the persistence of a dense macrophyte cover may be found in wetlands in environments with constant and extreme ecological conditions such as those recorded in the ROLs. In contrast, 'unpredictable' assemblages can be expected in shallow lakes with fluctuating conditions.

Serological studies on some of the patients from whom virus was not isolated suggest that most, if not all, were adenovirus infections. Of the adenovirus types isolated, type 8 was by far the most common (72%), while type 4 was the only other type isolated with any frequency (13%). In addition, types 2, 3, 7, 10, 11 and several adenoviruses not types 1 to 18 were isolated. Of the patients in whom follow-up examinations were carried out, 14 of 18 from whom type 8 was isolated developed subepithelial punctate keratitis (SPK), while only 3 of 11 with other types developed this pathognomonic sign. In all, SPK was found in 32 patients including 1 from whom type 4 was isolated, 1 with type 11 and 2 with unclassified types. Type 8 was isolated from throat swabs and from the eyes of 13 patients. The average length of incubation time to isolate 129 strains of type 8 was 27 days as compared to averages of 13 to 20 days for the other types isolated. Conjunctival swab specimens were as good or slightly better than scrapings were for the isolation of adenovirus. Most EKC cases occurred in the lake summer and fall. All ages were involved, but SPK was not seen in patients under 13 years. Detailed clinical findings are reported on a portion of the- patients. Most cases were unilateral, had conjunctival petechial hemorrhage and preauricular lymphadenopathy. Only a few had pharyngeal or generalized symptoms. The clinical severity was similar, irrespective of virus type isolated.																			0002-9637	1476-1645					1964	13	3					492	+		10.4269/ajtmh.1964.13.492	http://dx.doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.1964.13.492								14159990					WOS:A19643686A00016

However, our understanding about the phenological process and driving mechanism is still very limited due to the shortage of long-term observation data. We used all available daily MODIS-Aqua data from 2003 to 2017 to determine bloom start dates (BSDs) in a typical trophic lake (Lake Taihu) and investigate how phytoplankton BSDs respond to climate change and environmental factors. The results indicate that BSDs have advanced 29.9 days for the entire Lake Taihu from 2003 to 2017. Spatially, an earlier phytoplankton bloom was recorded in the northern bays and the littoral regions than in the center of open water. Air temperature, wind speed, and N/P ratio (N, total nitrogen; P, total phosphorus) were three important factors affecting phytoplankton phenology. Multiple linear correlation showed that air temperature, wind speed, and N/P ratio in Spring could explain 59.9% variability of BSDs for Lake Taihu. This study provides a quantitative assessment of phytoplankton phenological shifts and elucidates the inter-relationship between phenology parameters and environmental factors, thus improving our understanding on the potential impact of climate change and eutrophication on lake ecosystems. The starting earlier and lasting longer of phytoplankton are consistent with the expected effects of climate warming on aquatic ecosystem in recent decades, which will bring new challenges for algal bloom management in eutrophic Lake Taihu.					; Zhang, Yunlin/N-5464-2014; , 张一波/AAY-5453-2020; Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013; li, na/MIK-8798-2025	Zhou, Yongqiang/0000-0003-1402-345X; Zhang, Yunlin/0000-0002-3382-4570; Zhang, Yibo/0000-0001-5542-2495; Shi, Kun/0000-0002-6124-7512													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 5	2019	53	5					2324	2331		10.1021/acs.est.8b06887	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b06887								30776220					WOS:000460709100007

A deep layer of warm, moist, southwesterly flow overran a shallower layer of subfreezing, easterly flow ahead of a surface warm front. Precipitation at the surface changed from snowfall to ice pellets, to freezing rain, and, finally, to ordinary rain as an elevated layer of above-freezing air moved into the region and eventually extended to the ground. Measurements from a scanning Doppler radar, wind profilers, a microwave radiometer, and mobile rawinsondes provided detailed information on the storm's kinematic and thermodynamic structure and evolution, and allowed its basic microphysical structure to be inferred. The remote sensors detected signatures of the melting aloft that may be useful for improving detection and forecasts of freezing-rain hazards.																			0027-0644					SEP	1993	121	9					2562	2577		10.1175/1520-0493(1993)121<2562:ARSVOA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(1993)121<2562:ARSVOA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1993LU35300008

Lake sediments from the northern Yukon Territory have recorded sedimentation, vegetation, summer temperature and precipitation changes since similar to 16 cal ka BP. Herb-dominated tundra persisted until similar to 14.7 cal ka BP with mean July air temperatures <= 5 degrees C colder and annual precipitation 50 to 120 mm lower than today. Temperatures rapidly increased during the Bolling/Allerod interstadial towards modern conditions, favoring establishment of Betula-Salix shrub tundra. Pollen-inferred temperature reconstructions recorded a pronounced Younger Dryas stadial in east Beringia with a temperature drop of similar to 1.5 degrees C (similar to 2.5 to 3.0 degrees C below modern conditions) and low net precipitation (90 to 170 mm) but show little evidence of an early Holocene thermal maximum in the pollen record. Sustained low net precipitation and increased evaporation during early Holocene warming suggest a moisture-limited spread of vegetation and an obscured summer temperature maximum. Northern Yukon Holocene moisture availability increased in response to a retreating Laurentide Ice Sheet, postglacial sea level rise, and decreasing summer insolation that in turn led to establishment of Alnus-Berula shrub tundra from similar to 5 cal ka BP until present, and conversion of a continental climate into a coastal-maritime climate near the Beaufort Sea.

We examine the temporal variability of winter snow depth and number of days of snow cover at 69 Chinese Meteorological Administration stations above 2000 m a.s.l. in the eastern and central TP during 1961-2005. Snow depth is positively correlated with the number of snow days (R = 0.89, p < 0.0001). Regional mean winter (DJF) depth and days of snow cover increase at rates of 0.32 mm decade(-1) and 0.40 d decade(-1) from 1961 to 1990, but at rates of -1.80 mm decade(-1) and -1.59 d decade(-1) (i.e. decrease) between 1991 and 2005. The long term trends are weakly positive, but unrepresentative of shorter time periods. Thus snow depth and cover change depends on the timescale examined and cannot be attributed solely to increased greenhouse gas forcing. The decreasing snow depth in recent years will influence hydrological processes and water resources on the plateau and downstream. Both snow depth and duration have positive correlations with the winter Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO) index and Nino-3 region (5 degrees N-5 S, 150 degrees-90 degrees W) sea surface temperature (SST). During high AO/NAO index years, both a deeper India-Burma trough and an intensified cyclonic circulation near Lake Baikal bring more snowfall to the TP, consistent with a higher water vapor flux. The opposite is true in low AO/NAO years. Thus secular changes of snow depth and duration in the TP are not independent of changes in the macro-scale atmospheric circulation.

J	van Dam, H; Meesters, K				van Dam, Herman; Meesters, Koos (J)			Did desmid assemblages in Dutch moorland pools recover from acidification in the past century?	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In order to monitor recovery from acidification caused by acid atmospheric deposition, desmids and water chemistry were sampled in three Dutch moorland pools regularly from 1978 to 2014. Reference desmid samples from the early twentieth century were retrieved from old collections. Changes of the desmid assemblages were assessed by analyses of traits, including indicator values for pH and total phosphate, conservation value, cell volume and surface/volume (s/v) ratio. Direct correspondence analysis (DCA) traced relations between desmids and environmental variables. Between 1916 and 2014, species composition altered due to changes in acidifying atmospheric deposition: The change was most pronounced in pools with relatively flat shores exposed to the atmosphere in extremely dry summers. After the dry summer of 1921, changes were slight, but after the dry summer of 1976, changes were dramatic, when the sulphur and nitrogen compounds stored in the water bottom oxidized and acidified the water. The conservation value declined sharply but increased again until the 1990s, partly due to the decrease in acidifying deposition. Although the acid atmospheric deposition continued to decline until the early 21th century, the conservation value declined again, as did the stability of the desmid assemblages. It is likely that internal eutrophication (nutrients), presence of toxic substances (such as hydrogen sulphide), the decline of aquatic macrophytes (substrate), shading by afforestation (light) and/or reduced supply of carbon dioxide (due to decreased local seepage) play a role. The chemical dynamics due to the large stock of sulphur and nitrogen compounds will hamper the development of rare desmids, bound to stable environmental conditions.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	2021	848	21					5011	5031		10.1007/s10750-021-04690-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04690-y		OCT 2021											WOS:000711378000002

Two lakes are currently located within the rift: the fresh-water Sea of Galilee (210 m below mean sea level [bmsl]) and the hyper-saline Dead Sea (415 m bmsl). Fresh groundwaters and hot brines flow toward these lakes through carbonate, basaltic, sandstone, and alluvium aquifers. The Dead Sea rift is a unique global site for studying the coupled relationships between basin evolution and groundwater flow. The temporal and spatial distributions of elevations and salinities of groundwaters and lakes are strongly related to past conditions of tectonics, sedimentation, and erosion. Moreover, climate variations have induced changes in the rift's water mass balance, triggering lake level fluctuations and temporal and spatial changes in lake salinity. These effects were analyzed using basin-scale transient hydrogeological numerical models that solve the coupled variable-density groundwater flow and transport of heat and solutes. Furthermore, several ambiguous hydrological phenomena are currently observed at the Dead Sea rift: the existence of fresh and saline springs near each other as well as hot and cold ones; direct and opposite relationships between springs' discharge-salinity-temperature; different geochemical compositions of waters and brines; and complicated spatial distribution of groundwater heads. These phenomena are also explained and analyzed using various hydrogeological numerical models. In addition, quantitative examples of groundwater flow regimes in a few aquifers at the rift vicinity are provided.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2401-0				2006	401						95	111		10.1130/2006.2401(06)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2006.2401(06)													WOS:000271639300007

From the adverse to diverse!	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES												Every year, new organisms that survive and colonize adverse environments are discovered and isolated. Those organisms, called extremophiles, are distributed throughout the world, both in aquatic and terrestrial environments, such as sulfurous marsh waters, hydrothermal springs, deep waters, volcanos, terrestrial hot springs, marine saltern, salt lakes, among others. According to the ecosystem inhabiting, extremophiles are categorized as thermophiles, psychrophiles, halophiles, acidophiles, alkalophilic, piezophiles, saccharophiles, metallophiles and polyextremophiles. They have developed chemical adaptation strategies that allow them to maintain their cellular integrity, altering physiology or improving repair capabilities; one of them is the biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), which constitute a slime and hydrated matrix that keep the cells embedded, protecting from environmental stress (desiccation, salinity, temperature, radiation). EPS have gained interest; they are explored by their unique properties such as structural complexity, biodegradability, biological activities, and biocompatibility. Here, we present a review concerning the biosynthesis, characterization, and potential EPS applications produced by extremophile microorganisms, namely, thermophiles, halophiles, and psychrophiles. A bibliometric analysis was conducted, considering research articles published within the last two decades. Besides, an overview of the culture conditions used for extremophiles, the main properties and multiple potential applications of their EPS is also presented. ? 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Salinity tolerance of Round Goby: Informing invasion potential in North American coastal watersheds	PLOS ONE												Since being introduced into the Laurentian Great Lakes in the 1990s, round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) has spread rapidly, reaching the Hudson River Estuary, NY in 2021. To address the expansion potential into saline environments from this North American coastal invasion front, we experimentally assessed the salinity tolerance of adult round gobies. Water temperatures vary widely in temperate aquatic ecosystems, and our study is the first to investigate the effect of temperature on the salinity tolerance of round goby, conducting tolerance trials at three temperatures: a preferred temperature of 20 degrees C, 26 degrees C reflective of summer conditions, and 5 degrees C reflective of winter conditions. Adult round gobies were subjected to weekly salinity increases of 3 parts per thousand (ppt), concluding at 33ppt. Study specimens were monitored for stress cues (behavior changes and color changes), and mortality. We found significant salinity tolerance differences dependent on water temperature, with the highest tolerance at 5 degrees C and the lowest tolerance at 26 degrees C. By 30ppt, survival was 87% at 5 degrees C and only 7% at 26 degrees C. Based on mortality results, round goby expansion may occur year-round into brackish portions (<21ppt) of the Hudson River Estuary as far south as the Harlem River. This would open access to portions of Long Island Sound, potentially rendering other coastal watersheds to be at risk of invasion. However, temperature-dependent salinity tolerance findings suggest round goby expansion potential into high salinity habitats may be seasonally dependent, with expansion opportunities occurring in colder months and expansion barriers occurring in warmer months. To assess longer term survival and body condition, another experiment maintained round gobies at four sustained salinities (<= 21ppt) for ten weeks at 20 degrees C. Growth and hepatosomatic index at 21ppt were significantly lower (p<0.001) than at 1, 9, and 15ppt, indicating sustained exposure to higher salinities may affect energy stores, potentially limiting establishment potential.																				1932-6203				APR 18	2025	20	4							e0316327	10.1371/journal.pone.0316327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316327								40279318					WOS:001488706100038

Estimating Summer Nutrient Concentrations in Northeastern Lakes from SPARROW Load Predictions and Modeled Lake Depth and Volume	PLOS ONE												Global nutrient cycles have been altered by the use of fossil fuels and fertilizers resulting in increases in nutrient loads to aquatic systems. In the United States, excess nutrients have been repeatedly reported as the primary cause of lake water quality impairments. Setting nutrient criteria that are protective of a lakes ecological condition is one common solution; however, the data required to do this are not always easily available. A useful solution for this is to combine available field data (i.e., The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) National Lake Assessment (NLA)) with average annual nutrient load models (i.e., USGS SPARROW model) to estimate summer concentrations across a large number of lakes. In this paper we use this combined approach and compare the observed total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TN) concentrations in Northeastern lakes from the 2007 National Lake Assessment to those predicted by the Northeast SPARROW model. We successfully adjusted the SPARROW predictions to the NLA observations with the use of Vollenweider equations, simple input-output models that predict nutrient concentrations in lakes based on nutrient loads and hydraulic residence time. This allows us to better predict summer concentrations of TN and TP in Northeastern lakes and ponds. On average we improved our predicted concentrations of TN and TP with Vollenweider models by 18.7% for nitrogen and 19.0% for phosphorus. These improved predictions are being used in other studies to model ecosystem services (e. g., aesthetics) and dis-services (e. g. cyanobacterial blooms) for similar to 18,000 lakes in the Northeastern United States.

Oxygen and dissolved organic carbon control release of N, P and Fe from the sediments of a shallow, polymictic lake	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												We examined potential causes of nutrient release from the sediments of a shallow polymictic reservoir that, unlike many other shallow lakes, had not received large amounts of nutrient loading. It was hypothesised that the sediments released greater amounts of nutrients under anoxic rather than oxic conditions and that nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) release was limited by the availability of different types of organic substrate. Sediment incubation experiments under oxic and anoxic conditions were conducted in summer and in winter. One anoxic incubation experiment with the addition of different types of dissolved organic substrate (glucose, acetate, formate and propionate) was carried out. Concentrations of nitrite and nitrate (NOx (-)-N), ammonium (NH4 (+)-N), soluble reactive P (srP) and iron (Fe(II)) were monitored in the supernatant of the incubation chambers over 28 days. Thermal stratification was monitored in situ for 17 months and sediment composition was analysed. NOx (-)-N concentration increased by 5.67 +/- 0.33 mg N l(-1) in anoxic conditions but was much lower in oxic treatments. Release of srP was low in anoxic and oxic treatments (0.004 +/- 0.001 mg P l(-1)) but was stimulated by 0.027 +/- 0.015 mg P l(-1) under additions of formate. Fe(II) release was mostly stimulated by glucose additions (25.59 +/- 4.28 mg Fe l(-1)). P release was much lower than observed in eutrophic lakes. P release does not appear to be as a result of the reduction of Fe minerals and concurrent dissolution of orthophosphate, often reported as the most prevalent pathway for P release from anaerobic lake sediments. Iron and P flux from lake sediments can be independent from each other and can be controlled by dissolved organic C. Further, the study confirms the role of oxygen availability in controlling nutrient release from the sediments.

Monitoring Lake Ice Phenology (LIP) is useful because long-term freezing and thawing patterns serve as sentinels to understand regional and global climate change. We report a study for the Oberengadin region of Switzerland, where several small- and medium-sized mountain lakes are located. We observe the LIP events, such as freeze-up, break-up and ice cover duration, across two decades (2000-2020) from optical satellite images. We analyse the time series of MODIS imagery by estimating spatially resolved maps of lake ice for these Alpine lakes with supervised machine learning. To train the classifier we rely on reference data annotated manually based on webcam images. From the ice maps, we derive long-term LIP trends. Since the webcam data are only available for two winters, we cross-check our results against the operational MODIS and VIIRS snow products. We find a change in complete freeze duration of - 0.76 and - 0.89 days per annum for lakes Sils and Silvaplana, respectively. Furthermore, we observe plausible correlations of the LIP trends with climate data measured at nearby meteorological stations. We notice that mean winter air temperature has a negative correlation with the freeze duration and break-up events and a positive correlation with the freeze-up events. Additionally, we observe a strong negative correlation of sunshine during the winter months with the freeze duration and break-up events.

Our decadal to centennial scale records identified five positive and three negative excursions of the ISM since last similar to 13 ka. The most prominent abrupt negative ISM shift was observed during the termination of the Younger Dryas (YD) between similar to 11.7 and 11.4 ka. While, ISM was stable between similar to 11 and 6 ka, and declined prominently between 6 and 3 ka. Surprisingly, during both the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice age (LIA) spans, ISM was strong in this part of the Himalaya. These regional changes in ISM were coupled to southward shifting in mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and variations in East Asian monsoon (EAM). Our rainfall reconstructions are broadly in agreement with local, regional reconstructions and PMIP3, CSIRO-MK3L model simulations.					; SHARMA, ANUPAM/AAK-7338-2020; Agrawal, Shailesh/O-6255-2015; Mohammad, Arif/G-8454-2011; ali, sheikh'nawaz/NRY-7735-2025	Dimri, A P/0000-0002-7832-8669; Shekhar, Mayank/0000-0002-4245-8605; Arif, Mohammad/0000-0002-9885-1991; sharma, Anupam/0000-0002-4152-763X; 													2045-2322					JUN 18	2018	8								9287	10.1038/s41598-018-27597-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-27597-6								29915324					WOS:000435448300030

However, relatively little is known about community changes of pelagic lake bacteria due to leaf litter input which includes both the release of leaf leachates and microorganisms from the leaf litter into the surrounding water. Therefore, we have experimentally studied the effects of different types of leaf litter (Betula pendula, Fagus silvatica, and Pinus silvestris) on the pelagic bacterial community composition by adding leaves to different treatments of epilimnic water samples (unfiltered, 0.2 A mu m and 5.0 A mu m-pre-filtered) from humic Lake Grosse Fuchskuhle (Northeastern Germany). The addition of leaf litter led to a significant increase in DOC concentration in lake water, and each leaf litter type produced significantly different amounts of DOC (p = < 0.001) as well as of specific DOC fractions (p = < 0.001), except of polysaccharides. DGGE banding patterns varied over time, between types of leaf litter, and among treatments. Bacteria belonging to known bacterial phylotypes in the southwest basin of Lake Grosse Fuchskuhle were frequently found and even persisted after leaf litter additions. Upon leaf litter addition, alpha-proteobacteria (Azospirillum, Novosphingobium, and Sphingopyxis) as well as beta-proteobacteria (Curvibacter and Polynucleobacter) were enriched. Our results indicate that supply of leaf litter DOM shifted the bacterial community in the surrounding water towards specific phylotypes including species capable of assimilating the more recalcitrant DOC pools. Statistical analyses, however, show that DGGE banding patterns are not only affected by DOC pools but also by treatment. This indicates that biological factors such as source community and grazing may be also important for shifts in bacterial community structure following leaf litter input into different lakes.

About 7100 images were acquired using a scanning electron microscope and processed to obtain measurement of particles from 2845 varves. Several particle-size distributions indices were calculated and can be linked to high-energy sedimentary facies. Moreover, the coarse grain size (98th percentile) of these high-energy facies is strongly correlated with summer rainfall (and also summer temperature) of instrumental data from nearby stations. Particle-size distributions show a similar trend through time, especially for the standard deviation and the 98th percentile. Climatic reconstruction suggests that Cape Bounty recently experienced an unprecedented increase of rainfall events since similar to AD 1920. On the other hand, changes in varve thickness are weakly correlated with the particle-size distribution. Altogether, these results highlight the need to obtain annual grain-size data to identify a meteorological signal.

Recent river and wetland conservation and restoration efforts have been partially focused on reinstating the natural river-floodplain connectivity to ameliorate the ecological effects of regulation in river systems. However, in regions where human well-being is tightly linked with the cultivation of the floodplain (such as fisheries), management options are constrained and trade-offs among competing social, economic and ecological goals may be necessary for the wise use of wetlands. Poyang Lake in east central China includes numerous sub-lakes with different types of hydrological regulation; therefore, this lake may provide a useful context for exploring the likelihood of such trade-offs. In this study, we used multiyear simultaneous waterbird survey data together with habitat maps derived from satellite imagery for Poyang Lake to examine-the variations in waterbird community structure and abundance within sub-lakes with different types of hydrological regulation. Using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, we built generalized linear mixed models to explore the differences in wetland composition and waterbird abundance/diversity among three lake types (i.e. isolated, freely connected, and controlled) at community, guild and species levels.. The results showed hydrological connectivity alteration clearly affects wintering waterbirds; in addition, the ecological benefits of a natural flow regime were most unambiguous at the community level. Nevertheless, little evidence exists to indicate that the lakes' ecological values as waterbird foraging grounds were compromised by partial regulation. That is, species richness and population size were comparable in naturally connected and controlled lakes. Our results suggest that, with carefully designed management plans, a delicate balance between waterbird conservation and development can be accomplished in large river floodplains.

Due to the rapid rate of climate change over the recent decades, it is expected that suitable heat conditions for apple growing will expand to the areas that were previously too cold. This study analyses the heat suitability of future climate (2021-2100) under the RCP8.5 scenario for 6 common apple varieties in Norway: Discovery, Gravenstein, Summerred, Aroma, Rubinstep and Elstar. Previously established heat requirement criteria (based on the temperature threshold for the full blooming and growing degree days sum between the full bloom and harvest) are applied to the temperature outputs of the regional climate models downscaled to 1 km resolution. The assessment indicates that as temperature rises, heat conditions suitable for cultivation of all 6 apple varieties will expand. According to the ensemble median value, areas with the favorable heat conditions for growing at least one of the considered apple varieties will increase 25 times in the period 2021-2040 and 60 times in the period 2041-2060, compared to the referent period 1971-2000. At the same time, areas suitable for all 6 apple varieties will increase 3 times in the first, and 3.8 times in the latter period. The favorable areas will advance from south and southeast northwards and inland in the eastern region, along the west and northwestern coastline towards higher latitudes, and along continental parts of fjords. The fastest expansion of heat suitable conditions is expected for Discovery and Gravenstein. The findings of this study are relevant for zoning apple production future potential and for strategical planning of climate change adaptation measures within the sector. Weather-related risks, such as risks from winter low temperatures, spring frost, drought and extreme precipitation were not considered.

Three key climatic factors were selected including chilling in May, high temperature heat damage during July to early August and low temperature damage in autumn in this study. Furthermore, based on the analysis of climatic conditions suitable for double cropping super rice cultivation and climatic disasters, 8 similar to 22 degrees C active accumulated temperature, sunshine duration from late March to October, climatic risk index of the low temperature in autumn, and climatic risk index of chilling in May were selected as key climatic factors to study the precise agro-meteorological regionalization of double cropping super rice in Hunan province. The results showed that: the high-yielding zones of double cropping super rice in Hunan were mainly located in Zhuzhou, Hengyang, Yongzhou and Chenzhou City, the moderate-yielding zones were primarily located in the east and north reaches of Dongting Lake, together with most of Changsha, Zhuzhou and Xiangtan City, and other regions in Hunan were not suitable for double cropping super rice. These findings can provide valuable information for the large-scale cultivation of double cropping super rice in Hunan province.																			1006-8775					JUN	2018	24	2					199	208		10.16555/j.1006-8775.2018.02.008	http://dx.doi.org/10.16555/j.1006-8775.2018.02.008													WOS:000446040200008
J	Izbicki, JA				Izbicki, John A.			Physical and temporal isolation of mountain headwater streams in the western Mojave Desert, southern California	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION												Streams draining mountain headwater areas of the western Mojave Desert are commonly physically isolated from downstream hydrologic systems such as springs, playa lakes, wetlands, or larger streams and rivers by stream reaches that are dry much of the time. The physical isolation of surface flow in these streams may be broken for brief periods after rainfall or snowmelt when runoff is sufficient to allow flow along the entire stream reach. Despite the physical isolation of surface flow in these streams, they are an integral part of the hydrologic cycle. Water infiltrated from headwater streams moves through the unsaturated zone to recharge the underlying ground-water system and eventually discharges to support springs, streamflow, isolated wetlands, or native vegetation. Water movement through thick unsaturated zones may require several hundred years and subsequent movement through the underlying ground-water systems may require many thousands of years contributing to the temporal isolation of mountain headwater streams.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				FEB	2007	43	1					26	40		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00004.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2007.00004.x													WOS:000244429900004
J	Woo, MK; Mielko, C				Woo, Ming-Ko; Mielko, Corrinne			An integrated framework of lake-stream connectivity for a semi-arid, subarctic environment	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					Joint Meeting of the 32nd Annual Meeting of the Canadian-Geophysical-Union/Canadian-Society-of-Soil-Science	MAY 14-17, 2006	Banff, CANADA	Canadian Geophys Union, Hydrol Sect, Canadian Soc Soil Sci				Lake-stream networks dominate the semi-arid, subarctic Precambrian shield. Such a network consists of a number of lake basin elements linked to each other by surface channels. To investigate the processes causing seasonal severance of flow connection in the lake-stream system, a chain of lakes in northern Canada was studied in 2004. Water balance shows that rapid and substantial runoff from the local basin slopes during the snowmelt period led to a rise of lake levels above their outlet elevations to generate outflow. Continued summer evaporation caused draw down of lake storage below the outflow thresholds, represented by the lake outlet elevations. Outflow ceased and the lakes became disconnected. Summer rainfall in a semi-arid environment was insufficient to overcome storage deficit to re-establish flow connectivity among all lakes. For the drainage system as a whole, streamflow interruption or continuity depends on the linkage of its lake-stream sub-units. The principle of fill and spill governs runoff generation and flow connection between the lake elements. This principle is applied to a conceptual model of flow along a chain of lakes, taking account of (1) antecedent storage in individual lakes, (2) their storage change calculated through water balance and (3) the thresholds to be exceeded for outflows to occur.

To better understand these changes, we studied the ecological niches of planktonic diatoms in 42 temperate Chilean lakes (36-43 degrees S). We used morphological analysis of spring and early summer diatom communities, as well as sub-fossil sedimentary assemblages along gradients in mixing regime, light climate, and water chemistry. For Asterionella formosa and the species belonging to the genus Aulacoseira, morphology based enumerations were combined with molecular phylogenies using the 18S rDNA and rbcL genes to determine their taxonomic position and explore potential hidden diversity. Analysis of extant and sub-fossil communities revealed similar patterns, with small Discostella species (D. mascarenica and D. pseudostelligera) and Urosolenia eriensis being characteristic for large, well-mixed lakes, whereas Aulacoseira pusilla (previously erroneously identified as A. distans in Chile) is more dominant in smaller, warmer, and stratified water bodies. This suggests that recent increases in the latter taxon might be related to changes in the physical lake properties in the region, rather than a recent increase in nutrient concentrations. By contrast, Asterionella formosa occurred in lakes with a high Si concentration. Phylogenetic data of the most common species belonging to the genera Aulacoseira and Asterionella showed little evidence for hidden diversity in most of the taxa, except for the Aulacoseira granulata complex. This indicates that the Chilean strains are closely related to populations in the Northern Hemisphere. The results of this study will allow for more accurate diatom-based reconstructions of limnological changes in South-Central Chilean lakes. This is crucial to better understand climate dynamics in the region, as these lakes are known to be sensitive to alterations in windiness and precipitation in response to changes in the intensity and latitudinal position of the Southern Hemisphere Westerlies and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.					; Van+Wichelen, Jeroen/AAP-6900-2021; Pinseel, Eveline/ABF-5980-2020	Van Wichelen, Jeroen/0000-0002-0255-9591; Pinseel, Eveline/0000-0002-1801-2187													0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2022	68	3					279	296		10.1007/s10933-022-00247-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-022-00247-8		JUL 2022											WOS:000827384600001

Timing and magnitude of early to middle Holocene warming in East Greenland inferred from chironomids	BOREAS												Much of Greenland experienced summers warmer than present in parts of the early to middle Holocene, during a precession-driven positive anomaly in summer insolation. However, the magnitude of that warmth remains poorly known, and its timing and spatial pattern are uncertain. Here we describe the first quantitative Holocene palaeotemperature reconstruction from central East Greenland based upon insect (chironomid) assemblages preserved in lake sediments. We postulate that landscapes like our study site, characterized by minimal soil and vegetation development through the Holocene and thus little influenced by some important secondary gradients, are especially well suited to the use of chironomids to reconstruct Holocene temperatures. The inferred timing of warmth at our study site near Scoresby Sund agrees well with other nearby evidence, including glacial geological reconstructions and temperatures inferred from precipitation isotopes at Renland ice cap, supporting the use of chironomids to reconstruct temperatures at this site. We infer highest temperatures from c. 10 to 5.5 ka, followed by gradual cooling after 5.5 ka and progressively colder and less productive conditions after 3.5 ka. Models based upon two independent training sets yield similar inferred temperature trends, and suggest an average summer temperature anomaly from c. 10 to 5.5 ka of 3 to 4 degrees C relative to the preindustrial last millennium. The estimated overall rate of Neoglacial cooling averaged over the period from 5.5 to 0.5 kawas 0.6 to 0.8 degrees C per thousand years, more than twice the rate previously estimated for the Arctic as awhole. Given strong apparent spatial variability in Holocene climate around the Arctic, and the utility of palaeoclimate data for improving climate and ice-sheet models, it should be a priority to further quantify past temperature changes around the margins of the Greenland Ice Sheet, where few quantitative reconstructions exist and future warming will affect global sea level.

In this project, an automatic weather station was deployed on Byers Peninsula (Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands) near several freshwater ecosystems under research. Here the multi-year data recorded are presented and compared with meteorological time series from the observatories at the Spanish Juan Carlos I Station, Deception Island and Bellingshausen Station. Lake freezing and thawing periods and snow cover are also investigated. The main results indicate that Byers Peninsula is affected by the very cloudy and wet Antarctic maritime climate. Mean annual temperature is -2.8 degrees C and summer mean temperatures are above freezing. The region shows moderate winds over the year and with moderate, mostly liquid precipitation during the summer. There is a significant linear relationship with meteorological records obtained from Juan Carlos I Station located on the east of Livingston Island. Correlations between meteorological data from both sites are high but with colder and much windier conditions on Byers Peninsula.

J	Deevey, ES Jr				Deevey, ES Jr			Laimnological studies in Connecticut. V. A contribution to regional liminology.	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Analysis of limnological data obtained from 49 lakes in Connecticut and adjacent New York gives evidence of a close relationship between regional geology and quantity of phytoplankton. Within the Central Lowland, underlain by soluble sedimentary and igneous rocks known to be rich in Fe, occur lakes rich in phytoplankton and P, while lakes surrounded by the metamorphic rocks composing the Eastern and Western Highlands are correspondingly poor. Although P seems to be the most important element controlling the growth of phytoplankton, N, as estimated by winter nitrate, also has a significant effect; the multiple correlation coefficient between chlorophyll content and P plus N in 30 lakes is 0.964. The distribution of bicarbonate alkalinity is closely correlated with the occurrence of limestone formations, but bicarbonate alone probably has no significant effect upon plankton production, except in hard-water lakes. It is not known whether the characteristic regional distribution of limnological features owes its origin to a differential abundance of P or to other lithologic differences. Humus color, a non-geologic correlative, appears to be of greater importance in reducing the penetration of light into the lakes than is the quantity of plankton. Comparison of the amts. of soluble and total P in the lakes with other bodies of data indicates that Connecticut resembles northeastern Wisconsin and Japan in being oligo-typic for P. From the standpoint of the increment of the areal hypolimnetic O2 deficit, however, the region is mesotrophic, and the lowland lakes may fall in the lower range of eutrophy. Evidently edaphic factors are only partly responsible for the phenomena of regional limnology, and climatic influences are also effective.																			0002-9599	1945-452X				OCT	1940	238	10					717	741		10.2475/ajs.238.10.717	http://dx.doi.org/10.2475/ajs.238.10.717													WOS:000200256000003

Effectiveness of an Image-based Sorter to Select for Kernel Color within Early Segregating Hard Winter Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Populations	CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS												This study evaluated the effectiveness of an image sorter to select for kernel color within early generations of segregating hard winter wheat populations. The wheat crosses originated from different combinations of white and red parents. Three generations (F-3, F-4 and F-5) of sorting were applied to six segregating populations. At each generation, samples of white-sorted, red-sorted, and unsorted populations, along with the parents of the populations, were planted in replicated trials at multiple locations. The sorter processed 1kg sized samples in similar to 30 min and samples were sorted for 108 plots per season. similar to 10% of the F-3 populations were sorted and planted as white-sort population. This resulted in minimal changes in the % of white kernels. similar to 3% of the F-4 and F-5 populations were sorted and planted as white-sorted populations and significant advancement occurred. The F-6 populations of white-sorted samples from Dakota Lake ranged from 80% to 92% white kernels. The F-6 populations from Brookings ranged from 53% to 83% white kernels. Sorting for red seed decreased the frequency of white seed as compared to the unsorted reference populations; however reductions, of white seeds in the red populations, were modest and required three cycles of selection for significant effect. The effectiveness of the image-sorter varied with population and environment and sorting methods.					; Guttieri, Mary/ABN-8519-2022	Brabec, Daniel/0000-0001-8192-865X; 													0133-3720	1788-9170				SEP	2017	45	3					488	499		10.1556/0806.45.2017.034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1556/0806.45.2017.034													WOS:000407673200013
J	Bekele, A; Kellman, L; Beltrami, H				Bekele, Asfaw; Kellman, Lisa; Beltrami, Hugo			Soil Profile CO2 concentrations in forested and clear cut sites in Nova Scotia, Canada	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Subsurface soil CO2 concentration is an important component of the terrestrial C budget and site specific information on the spatial and temporal variability and how it responds to forest management is needed for accurately estimating ecosystem C budgets. The objectives of this study were to examine the within site spatial and seasonal variability, and differences between sites of subsurface CO2 concentrations as affected by microtopography, clear cut harvesting, and soil texture. To address these objectives, we used two paired forested and clear cut sites of contrasting soil texture in Nova Scotia, Canada. The soil texture at the Lakevale pair (LF=intact forest and LCC=clear cut) was sandy while that of Pomquet (PF: intact forest and PCC=clear cut) was clayey. Two and half-years after clear cut harvesting, data were collected from each site on an approximately monthly time interval for 1 year from four mineral soil depths (0, 5, 20 and 35 cm) and 10 microsites separated by approximately 10 m and representing three local topographic features (level, trough and hump). We also monitored soil temperature and moisture with depth at a representative location at each site. Soil CO2 showed high within site variability and ranged between 346 and 28,086 ppmv (median=2835) for LF, 319-29,135 (median=2802) for LCC, 364-29,016 (median=2345) for PF, and 407-81,053 (median=5690) for PCC. Differences due to microtopographic positions were not statistically significant (p>0.05). Median CO2 concentration and its variability generally increased with depth. Seasonally aggregated data indicated a distinct pattern with median CO2 concentrations as high as 8646 ppmv (95% confidence interval=6937-12,142) during summer at PCC and as low as 1570 ppmv (95% confidence interval=1290-1920) at LCC during winter. Despite the high within site variability, PCC showed significantly higher median CO2 concentration than PE No significant difference in subsurface CO2 concentration was found between LF and LCC. Subsurface CO2 concentration showed significant quadratic correlation (R-2=0.32-0.85, p<0.05) with soil temperature and volumetric water content only for the Lakevale sites, suggesting the presence of strong soil texture control on subsurface CO2 concentration dynamics at these sites.

As an important prehistoric human hand and footprint site for studying prehistoric human activities, Quesang, on the central Tibetan Plateau, has witnessed prehistoric human arrivals at least twice: in the Middle Pleistocene and early-middle Holocene. Recent investigations along the gully incised by water flow of the active spring have discovered a series of prehistoric human footprints and repeated trampling marks on the residual travertine in the different locations of gully and their ichnological characteristics and ages are unknown. To determine whether and when the imprints were left by Hominin and explore their association with the surrounding environment and landform evolution, we conducted detailed stratigraphic and geomorphological analysis of travertine deposit, 3D modelling and morphological study of hand and footprints, as well as Uranium-Thorium and optically stimulated luminescence dating of hand and footprints and strata. Based on these analyses, we obtained the following results: The active hot springs formed after 17.37 ka BP, probably when the Bolling-Allerod Interstadial began. The newly discovered footprints and repeated trampling traces are ichnologically identified as Hominin traces, which were unintentionally impressed at similar to 8.5-9.2 ka BP and similar to 14.2 ka BP, respectively, and are related to the development of the gully. In the cold, dry, and anoxic environment of the Tibetan Plateau, the Quesang hot spring is undoubtedly a very attractive survival resource, attracting prehistoric humans to frequently patronise it for a long time. The discovery of these imprints provides new evidence of prehistoric human expansion and occupation on the Tibetan Plateau before and in the Holocene.

Estimation of satellite-derived lake water surface temperatures in the western Mediterranean: Integrating multi-source, multi-resolution imagery and a long-term field dataset using a time series approach	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is a key parameter to help study the environmental and ecological impacts of climate change. In this work, we measured the LSWT of 1 natural and 23 artificial lakes located on the island of Sardinia in the western Mediterranean, which is a region where changes in climate are projected to have significant impacts. By integrating multi-source and multi-resolution datasets of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat and long-term in situ temperature observations, we detected, measured, and analysed the LSWT trends during the period of 2000-2018 across all the investigated lakes. Methodologically, we demonstrated that a simplified approached based on Planck's equation for Landsat thermal infrared (TIR) data could be a valid alternative to radiative transfer equation retrieval methods for the retrieval of LSWT without loss of accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrated that rescaled and independently validated MOD112A-derived LSWT showed good accuracy, efficiently filled the spatial and temporal gaps in long-term in situ LSWT, and could be used for long-term LSWT trend detection and measurement. All 24 lakes showed an annual warming trend of +0.010 degrees C/y, warming winter trend of +0.013 degrees C/y, and cooling summer trend of -0.038 degrees C/y during the period of 2000-2018. This study demonstrated that the measured trend rates could be explained by and were strongly correlated with the climatology of Italy for the 2000-2018 period. Finally, we demonstrated the key role and the importance of the availability of long-term in situ temperature datasets. The approach used in this study is up-scalable to other medium to low-resolution TIR sensors as well as to other long-term monitoring sites, such as LTER-Italy, LTER-Europe, or ILTER sites.

However, after 2004, the multiyear mean water levels of West Dongting Lake (WDL), South Dongting Lake (SDL), and East Dongting Lake (EDL) in the high-water stage decreased by 1.05 m, 1.15 m, and 1.32 m, respectively. Different areas of Dongting Lake experienced various degrees of shrinkage. It is necessary to study the dominant driving factors and their contributions to the falling water level. In this study, the water level changes in Dongting Lake were analyzed, and a long short-term memory neural network model was constructed to simulate the water level of Dongting Lake. Moreover, the contribution of changes in streamflow and topographic conditions to the water level changes in different areas of Dongting Lake was estimated with scenario analysis. The research results show that the changes in the streamflow were the main driving factors for the water level decline of WDL, SDL, and EDL in the high-water stage, and their contributions were 0.74 m, 0.97 m, and 1.16 m, respectively. The topographic changes had a great falling effect on the water level of Dongting Lake, and the falling effect on the water levels from October to June of the following year was the strongest in EDL (0.81 m), followed by WDL (0.49 m), and the weakest in SDL (0.3 m). These results can provide a scientific reference for the management of the water resources of Dongting Lake.

Here we use a high-resolution, well-dated delta C-13 record from Lake Tengchongqinghai (TCQH) in southwestern China, together with other proxy indices, to reconstruct the paleolimnological history over the past 18.5 ka. Organic matter in the sediments of Lake TCQH is derived predominately from aquatic macrophytes. The lacustrine primary productivity is closely linked with lake-level changes affected by variations in the strength of the Asian summer monsoon and modified by evapotranspiration. Similar to lake sediments world-wide, a ca. -3 parts per thousand shift occurred in the delta C-13 values of Lake TCQH in response to the significant increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration during the last deglaciation. In the Holocene, the availability of dissolved CO2 in the lake water of Lake TCQH was determined by variations in hydraulic energy: low water turbulence creates a thick, stagnant boundary layer around aquatic plants, which will restrict the rate of CO2 diffusion and result in more positive delta C-13 values of aquatic plants. In contrast, significant water turbulence dramatically reduces the boundary layer thickness leading to more negative delta C-13 values of aquatic plants. (C) 2015 University of Washington.

To gain deeper understanding of variations in marine microbial biodiversity and function with inorganic nutrient loading, a large-scale mesocosm (1,000 L) experiment was conducted in southern KCW for 10 days in summer (July 27 through August 6, 2015) and the bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) was investigated using 16S rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing method. The bioassays established in the mesocosm were designed with the following each nutrient dosing treatments: nitrate (+N), phosphate (+P), and nitrate plus phosphate (+NP). Among the three treatments, the +NP and +N treatments exhibited the largest and second-largest increases in phytoplankton abundance, respectively, whereas there was relatively less variation under the +P treatment. Enhanced growth of phytoplankton not only induced increases in pH and bacterial abundance (p < .05) but also led to changes in the BCC: the orders Flavobacteria, Micrococcales, Oceanospirillales, and Rhodobacterales exhibited increases in relative abundance, whereas Methylophilales, Puniceicoccales, SAR11, SAR116, and SAR86 showed a decreasing trend. Inorganic nutrients may directly contribute to variation in the BCC, as the relative abundance of Sphingobacteriales, containing members that undergo chemotaxis toward inorganic nutrients, was increased by the +N treatment. Given that these findings, changes in phytoplankton abundance due to nutrient addition may be the most crucial component resulting in variation in the BCC.					; PARK, Bum Soo/W-3178-2017; Park, Bum/W-3178-2017	BAEK, SEUNG HO/0000-0002-5402-2518; PARK, Bum Soo/0000-0002-5441-6779; Lee, Minji/0000-0001-6834-6874; 													0173-9565	1439-0485				JUN	2020	41	3							e12591	10.1111/maec.12591	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maec.12591		APR 2020											WOS:000527793000001

We found 8 marten used 57 resting sites on 141 occasions. Marten rested primarily in subnivean sites associated with coarse woody debris, including logs and stumps. Use of spruce (Picea spp.)-fir (Abies lasiocarpa) stands by adults was greater than expected and use of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands was less than expected on the basis of spatial availability. Juveniles used stand types in proportion to spatial availability. Fidelity to individual resting sites and to subnivean sites associated with coarse woody debris was highest among adults. Type of resting site used depended on air temperature at the time of resting; above-snow sites were used during the warmest weather, and subnivean sites associated with coarse woody debris were used during the coldest weather. Marten rested for longer periods where coarse woody debris formed all or part of the resting site than they did at other sites. Log densities were higher and mean log diameters greater in spruce-fir stands than in lodgepole pine stands. Resting sites associated with coarse woody debris occurred primarily in spruce-fir stands, whereas other resting sites occurred in other stand types. Resting sites were closer to streams and lakes than expected. The importance of resting where coarse woody debris is available to provide thermal cover may explain the apparent dependence of marten on old-growth forest in the central Rocky Mountains in winter.

Brian			Fine scale habitat use by age-1 stocked muskellunge and wild northern pike in an upper St. Lawrence River bay	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Radio telemetry of stocked muskellunge (n = 6) and wild northern pike (n = 6) was used to track late summer and fall movements from a common release point in a known shared nursery bay to test the hypothesis that age-1 northern pike and stocked muskellunge segregate and have different habitat affinities. Water depth, temperature, substrate and aquatic vegetation variables were estimated for each muskellunge (n = 103) and northern pike (n = 131) position and nested ANOVA comparisons by species indicated differences in habitat use. Muskellunge exhibited a greater displacement from the release point and used habitat in shallower water depths (mean = 0.85 m, SE = 0.10) than northern pike (mean = 1.45 m, SE = 0.08). Both principal components analysis (PCA) and principal components ordination (PCO) were used to interpret underlying gradients relative to fish positions in two-dimensional space. Our analysis indicated that a separation of age-1 northern pike and muskellunge occurred 7 d post-release. This first principal component explained 48% of the variation in habitat use. Northern pike locations were associated with deeper habitats that generally had softer silt substrates and dense submersed vegetation. Muskellunge locations post-acclimation showed greater association with shallower habitats containing firmer sandy and clay substrates and emergent vegetation. The observed differences in habitat use suggest that fine-scale ecological separation occurred between these stocked muskellunge and wild northern pike, but small sample sizes and potential for individual variation limit extension of these conclusions. Further research is needed to determine if these patterns exist between larger samples of fishes over a greater range of habitats. (C) 2014 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

General water quality characteristics are extracted through a low-frequency dataset, which allows analyses of long-tenn trends and seasonality. Plitvice Lakes National Park freshwater ecosystem includes springs, rivers, streams and lakes with its specific process of tufa formation. The aim of this study was to determine, based on long-term water quality data, potential changes in physico-chemical parameters required for ongoing tufa deposition processes. The dataset encompasses a 12-year period (2006-2017), with measurements performed from April to October per each year on a weekly basis, covering thirteen sites belonging to karst springs, streams or lotic biotopes. Positive trends were observed for dissolved oxygen, conductivity, water hardness, alkalinity, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrites. Negative trends were observed for temperature, pH and most nutrients (nitrates, ammonia and orthophosphates). Temperature values showed different trend slopes among monitored types. Negative correlations between water level and/or discharge with conductivity and alkalinity probably indicate the effect of dilution. Conversely, nutrients and COD have a positive correlation with discharge, possibly indicating resuspension from sediment during high flows. The analyses of spatial and temporal variations in hydrochemistry through a longer period imply annual alterations, correlations between hydrological components and water chemistry, and significant differences among monitored types, while the tufa deposition process is stable. Long-term monitoring and continuous data analyses can help in future planning of monitoring programs and the improved understanding of climate changes.

M.			Seasonal Dynamics of Atlantic Herring (Clupea harengus L.) Populations Spawning in the Vicinity of Marginal Habitats	PLOS ONE												Gillnet sampling and analyses of otolith shape, vertebral count and growth indicated the presence of three putative Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus L.) populations mixing together over the spawning season February-June inside and outside an inland brackish water lake (Landvikvannet) in southern Norway. Peak spawning of oceanic Norwegian spring spawners and coastal Skagerrak spring spawners occurred in March-April with small proportions of spawners entering the lake. In comparison, spawning of Landvik herring peaked in May-June with high proportions found inside the lake, which could be explained by local adaptations to the environmental conditions and seasonal changes of this marginal habitat. The 1.85 km 2 lake was characterized by oxygen depletion occurring between 2.5 and 5 m depth between March and June. This was followed by changes in salinity from 1-7% in the 0-1 m surface layer to levels of 20-25% deeper than 10 m. In comparison, outside the 3 km long narrow channel connecting the lake with the neighboring fjord, no anoxic conditions were found. Here salinity in the surface layer increased over the season from 10 to 25%, whereas deeper than 5 m it was stable at around 35%. Temperature at 0-5 m depth increased significantly over the season in both habitats, from 7 to 14 degrees C outside and 5 to 17 degrees C inside the lake. Despite differences in peak spawning and utilization of the lake habitat between the three putative populations, there was an apparent temporal and spatial overlap in spawning stages suggesting potential interbreeding in accordance with the metapopulation concept.					johannessen, arne/IVV-1275-2023; Olsen, Esben/B-1894-2012; Moland, Even/A-7788-2013; Berg, Florian/M-9678-2014; Slotte, Aril/OBO-7933-2025	Slotte, Aril/0000-0001-9401-4929; Berg, Florian/0000-0003-1543-8112; Nash, Richard/0000-0003-0958-149X; Olsen, Esben Moland/0000-0003-3807-7524; Moland, Even/0000-0002-6521-2659													1932-6203					NOV 5	2014	9	11							e111985	10.1371/journal.pone.0111985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111985								25372461					WOS:000344556900101

Sampling of P. americana, P. myriophylla, and several other species of Polygonella in the Southeast from 1998 to 2003 provided further evidence for the restricted host and distributional ranges of both mirids. Whereas the range of K. rubrofemorata coincided with that of P. myriophylla, which essentially is a Lake Wales Ridge endemic, that of K. wheeleri on P. americana did not; the bug was not found in northern areas of the Fall-line Sandhills of South Carolina or in disjunct populations of P. americana in Georgia. Both mirids are multivoltine, the overwintered eggs of K. wheeleri hatching about mid-March and those of K. rubrofemorata in January.

J	ELLIOTT, JM				ELLIOTT, JM			A QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF THE LIFE-CYCLE OF THE CASE-BUILDING CADDIS ODONTOCERUM-ALBICORNE (TRICHOPTERA, ODONTOCERIDAE) IN A LAKE DISTRICT STREAM	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												O. albicorne (Scopoli) took 1 yr to complete its life cycle in a 3-yr study of this species in a small, stony stream in the English Lake District. Adults were present from May to Aug. (1967, 1968) or from June to Sept. (1969); most eggs were laid in July and Aug. There were 5 larval instars and most larvae were in instars III, IV and V by Oct. Larvae usually overwintered in instar V or III and some 3rd instars were in a resting state in sealed cases. Most 5th instars became male pupae in spring; most 3rd instars grew rapidly to instar V in spring and then became female pupae. The duration of the pupal stage was short and was shown in laboratory experiments to require 87.5 degree-days (95% CL = 79-98 degree days) above a threshold temperature of 6.7 .+-. 0.01.degree. C. Pupation in the stream did not commence until temperatures exceeded 6.8 .degree. C. As the sample variance-mean relationship followed a power-law, the spatial distribution of larvae and pupae was density-dependent. Relative clumping remained fairly constant between year-classes but increased markedly between the larval and pupal stages. Although population density varied between year-classes, it remained remarkably constant in each year-class for about 9 mo. between the end of egg hatching and the start of adult emergence. The growth pattern was similar in each year-class but growth rates varied between year-classes. The mean instantaneous growth rate was highest (range 3.9-8.0% dry wt day-1) in the first 3 mo. of the life cycle (Aug.-Oct.), close to zero in winter (Nov.-Feb.) and slightly higher than 1% day-1 (range 1.1.-1.7%) for the rest of the life cycle (March-Aug.). Production varied considerably between years and year-classes, and was closely related to growth rates for March-Aug. Annual production estimates were 243, 160 and 257 mg dry wt m-2 in 1967, 1968 and 1969, respectively. The ratio of production to mean standing crop (P/.hivin.BB) also varied between year-classes and the mean annual value was 3.9 (range 3.2-4.5). Life tables were similar for the 1966 (latter part only), 1967, 1968 and 1969 year-classes. Losses were vey high (Circa 99%) in the egg stage and early instars. About 30% (range 27-31%) of the population in instars III-V did not reach the pupal stage, and circa 25% (range 20-29%) of the pupal population died. About 37% (range 35-39%) of the emerging adults were females.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1982	12	3					241	255		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1982.tb00619.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1982.tb00619.x													WOS:A1982NQ73000005
J	Grego, J; Pesic, V				Grego, Jozef; Pesic, Vladimir			First record of stygobiotic gastropod genus Travunijana Grego & Gloer, 2019 (Mollusca, Hydrobiidae) from Montenegro	SUBTERRANEAN BIOLOGY												The stygobiotic genus Travunijana Grego & Gloer, 2019 is one of the typical elements of the subterranean freshwater fauna of the Trebisnjica River Basin in Bosnia and Hercegovina. The previous records of the genus suggested that its distribution was limited to the basin of the Trebisnjica River and adjacent parts of the southwestern Neretva Basin. In this paper we describe a new species, Travunijana djokovici sp. nov. from "Vrijesko Vrelo" spring in Montenegro. The recent finding of a new species in the Skadar Lake basin (The Drin River system) suggests the possibility of a subterranean route between the Trebisnjica and the Drin drainages, indicating that likely the endemic subterranean fauna in both basins has a lower level of historical isolation than has been considered so far.

The numerical modeling is based on the Navier-Stokes equations for a two-phase fluid. The results of the simulation of a meteorite entering the water at an angle of 20 degrees are given. Numerical experiments are carried out both when the lake is covered with ice and when it is not. The estimation of size of the destructed ice cover is made. It is shown that the size of the observed ice hole at the place of the meteorite fall is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions, as well as with other estimates. The heights of tsunami waves generated by a small meteorite entering the lake are small enough (a few centimeters) according to the estimations. However, the danger of a tsunami of meteorite or asteroid origin should not be underestimated.

Isoprenoid GDGTs (iGDGT), in particular GDGT-0, are biosynthesized by a large range of Archaea. To assess the potential of GDGT-0 as a tracer of past methane cycle variations, three sediment cores from the Mackenzie River Delta have been studied for iGDGT and diploptene concentration, distribution and stable carbon signature. The absence of crenarchaeol, high GDGT-0 vs crenarchaeol ratio values, and C-13-enriched carbon signature of GDGT-0 indicate production by acetoclastic methanogens as well as heterotrophic Archaea. The oxidation of methane seems to be dominated by bacteria as indicated by the high abundance of C-13-depleted diploptene. Branched GDGTs (brGDGT), thought to be produced by heterotrophic bacteria, are dominated by hexa-and penta-methylated 5- and 6-methyl compounds. The presence of 5,6-methyl isomer IIIa" points towards in situ production of brGDGTs, with only a minor input from soil branched GDGT brought by the Mackenzie River. Carbon isotopic compositions of brGDGTs are in agreement with heterotrophic producers, likely living during summer. The reconstructed temperatures using a global lake calibration reflect recorded summer air temperature (+/- 2 degrees C) during the last 60 years, and further highlight the absence of warming in summer in this region during the last 200 years. Oxygen availability and connection time to the Mackenzie River also seem to control the distribution of brGDGT with an increase in 6-methyl and 5,6-methyl isomers during periods of increased anoxia.

The information regarding the hydrology of the lake, derived from a previous publication and survey of one year on the lake, indicate that pH is low during the wet season and higher during the dry season. Therefore, variations in lake water pH may be considered as a proxy record for past changes in precipitation. In the sediment, high/low relative abundance of acidophilous diatom species indicates high/low precipitation. The diatom record of the past 18.5 ka BP shows that precipitation decrease during the periods 17.0-15.0, 13.3-11.3, and 0.7-0.3 ka BP corresponding to the Heinrich Event 1 (H1), the Younger Dryas cold event (YD), and the Little Ice Age (LA). A marked precipitation increase between 15.0 and 14.5 ka BP occurred at the end of H1 and before the Bolling-Allerod (BA), which indicates a strong pre-Bolling wetting. The start of the Holocene is recorded at 11.3 ka BP. The climate was the wettest between 113 and 7.5 ka BP., then the wetter between 7.5 and 3.4 ka BP. Between 3.4 and 0.7 ka BP, the precipitation decrease in general, but in the period from 1.3 to 0.8 ka BP the precipitation was higher corresponding to the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). Our results support the hypothes that the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) was strongest during the Early Holocene. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methane and Primary Productivity in Lakes: Divergence of Temporal and Spatial Relationships	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												In lakes, the production and emission of methane (CH4) have been linked to lake trophic status. However, few studies have quantified the temporal response of lake CH(4)dynamics to primary productivity at the ecosystem scale or considered how the response may vary across lakes. Here, we investigate relationships between lake CH(4)dynamics and ecosystem primary productivity across both space and time using data from five lakes in northern Wisconsin, USA. From 2014 to 2019, we estimated hypolimnetic CH(4)storage rates for each lake using timeseries of hypolimnetic CH(4)concentration through the summer season. Across all lakes and years, hypolimnetic CH(4)storage ranged from <0.001 to 7.6 mmol CH4 m(-2) d(-1)and was positively related to the mean summer rate of gross primary productivity (GPP). However, within-lake temporal responses to GPP diverged from the spatial relationship, and GPP was not a significant predictor of interannual variability in CH(4)storage at the lake scale. Using these data, we consider how and why temporal responses may differ from spatial patterns and demonstrate how extrapolating cross-lake relationships for prediction at the lake scale may substantially overestimate the rate of change of CH(4)dynamics in response to lake primary productivity. We conclude that future predictions of lake-mediated climate feedbacks in response to a shifting distribution of trophic status should incorporate both varying lake responses and the temporal scale of change.

However, the "barrier effect" might be different in the case of different species. The effect of geographic distance and water barriers on the genetic structure of populations of two common rodent species - the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) and the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) living in the area of a lake (on its islands and on two opposite shores) was investigated with the use of microsatellite fragment analysis. The two studied species are characterised by similar habitat requirements, but differ with regard to the socio-spatial structure of the population, individual mobility, capability to cross environmental barriers, and other factors. Trapping was performed for two years in spring and autumn in north-eastern Poland (21 degrees E, 53 degrees N). A total of 160 yellow-necked mouse individuals Q microsatellite loci) and 346 bank vole individuals (9 microsatellite loci) were analysed. The results of the differentiation analyses (F-ST and R-ST) have shown that both the barrier which is formed by a ca. 300 m wide belt of water (between the island and the mainland) and the actual distance of approximately 10 km in continuous populations are sufficient to create genetic differentiation within both species. The differences between local populations living on opposite lake shores are the smallest; differences between any one of them and the island populations are more distinct. All of the genetic diversity indices (the mean number of alleles, mean allelic richness, as well as the observed and expected heterozygosity) of the local populations from the lakeshores were significantly higher than of the small island populations of these two species separated by the water barrier. The more profound "isolation effect" in the case of the island populations of the bank vole, in comparison to the yellow-necked mouse populations, seems to result not only from the lower mobility of the bank vole species, but may also be attributed to other differences in the animals' behaviour.

J	ENGEL, S; NICHOLS, SA				ENGEL, S; NICHOLS, SA			LAKE SEDIMENT ALTERATION FOR MACROPHYTE CONTROL	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												The bottom of Marion Millpond, Wisconsin [USA] was partly blanketed with sand, gravel and plastic liners to control macrophytes by altering sediment texture and preventing roots from contacting the sediments to extract nutrients. Other areas were dredged to expose nutrient-poor soil. For the first 2 summers after treatment, filamentous algae invaded the blankets and Chara spread to both dredged and blanketed areas. By the 3rd summer the vegetation changed to broad-leaved pondweeds (Potamogeton spp.) on the dredged areas and to najas (Najas flexilis (Willd.) Rostk. et Schmidth) and elodea (Elodea canadensis Michx.) on the blanketed areas. By the 7th year, all areas were densely covered with coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum L.), watermilfoil (Myriophyllum exalbescens Fern.) and pondweeds. Dredging and covering sediments, consequently, proved ineffective for the long-term vegetation control in the pond.																			0146-6623						1984	22	JAN					38	41																WOS:A1984SL84600006

Increasing temperature and flow management alter mercury dynamics in East Fork Poplar Creek	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												East Fork Poplar Creek (EFPC) is a mercury (Hg) contaminated creek in east Tennessee, USA. Stream restoration activities included the initiation of a flow management programme in 1996 in which water from a nearby lake was pumped to the head of the creek. We conducted regular water sampling for 2 years along the length of EFPC during active flow management and for 5 years after flow management stopped. Total Hg and total monomethylmercury (MMHg) concentration and flux decreased in the uppermost reaches of EFPC that were closest to the point of water addition. Most water quality parameters, including DOC concentration, remained unchanged after flow management termination. Nevertheless, SUVA(254), a measure of dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition, increased and coincided with increased dissolved Hg (Hg-D) concentration and flux and decreased Hg solid-water partitioning coefficients throughout EFPC. Higher SUVA(254) and Hg-D concentration have potential implications for bioavailability and MMHg production. Total and dissolved MMHg concentrations increased in lower reaches of EFPC after the end of flow management and these increases were most pronounced during spring and early summer when biota are more susceptible to exposure and uptake. A general warming trend in the creek after active flow management ended likely acted in concert with higher Hg-D concentration to promote higher MMHg concentration. Total and dissolved MMHg concentrations were positively correlated with water temperature above a threshold value of 10 degrees C. Concentration changes for Hg and MMHg could not be accounted for by changes in creek discharge that accompanied the cessation of flow management. In addition to the changing DOM composition in-stream, other watershed-scale factors likely contributed to the observed patterns, as these changes occurred over months rather than instantaneously after flow management stopped. Nevertheless, similar changes in MMHg have not been observed in a tributary to EFPC.					; Brooks, Scott/B-9439-2012; Dickson, Johnbull/I-3637-2016	Riscassi, Ami/0000-0003-1767-7459; Brooks, Scott/0000-0002-8437-9788; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				AUG	2021	35	8							e14344	10.1002/hyp.14344	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.14344													WOS:000691011400011
J	Higgins, SN; Hecky, RE; Guildford, SJ				Higgins, Scott N.; Hecky, Robert E.; Guildford, Stephanie J.			The collapse of benthic macroalgal blooms in response to self-shading	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Our goal was to use physiological indicators [photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I) response, nutrient status], population level feedbacks (self-shading) and ambient environmental conditions (dissolved nutrients, light, temperature) to improve our understanding of the seasonal and spatial population dynamics of Cladophora. 2. Cladophora grew in three distinct phases, rapid growth early in the season (May-July), a mid-season population collapse (July-August) and autumn re-growth. Across all sites and dates, mean net maximal photosynthesis [P(M) (NET)] was 6.9 +/- 3.9 mg O(2) g DM(-1) h(-1), and alpha was 0.055 +/- 0.025 mg O(2) g DM(-1) mu m photons(-1) m(-2). Mean values for critical irradiance (I(CR)) and the half-saturation light intensity (I(K)), were 42.9 +/- 32.1 and 189.3 +/- 123.8 mu m photons(-1) m(-2) s(-1) respectively. 3. At most sites growth was phosphorus-limited. Values of alpha were significantly higher at a site influenced by a nutrient enriched river plume, where algal growth was phosphorus-sufficient. 4. Photoinhibition was not apparent in any of our P-I experiments. Even if photoinhibition had been apparent during in vitro P-I experiments, population level photosynthetic rates in the field would be little affected because intense self-shading restricts inhibiting irradiances to the upper few mm-cm of the algal canopy. 5. Our physiological (P-I response) experiments contradicted previous assertions that high ambient temperatures, or nutrient deficiency, were primary causes of mid-summer sloughing. In our study, sloughing occurred simultaneously at nutrient enriched and nutrient deficient sites, at temperatures well below critical values found during in vitro experiments, and our indicator of physiological condition (P-I response) remained unchanged leading up to, or immediately after, the sloughing event. 6. Self-shading can reduce the convexity of the P-I response within in vitro incubations, even when the amount of algal material is low. Our experiments used 0.08 g DM of algal material that formed clumps c. 1 cm thick. Under these conditions, we estimated negligible (< 1%) effects on P(M), a 12% reduction in apparent values of alpha, and 14% and 17% increases in values of the alpha-dependent terms I(CR) and I(K,) respectively. 7. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a population-level negative feedback (self-shading) is responsible for sloughing in dense macroalgal beds. Sloughing was probably inevitable once macroalgal bed density and thickness surpassed a critical threshold. Cells towards the base of the bed received insufficient light to maintain metabolic balance, began to decay and weaken, and became increasingly susceptible to physical detachment from shear stress.

J	Sherony, DF				Sherony, DF			The fall migration of Jaegers on Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												There is a regular annual fall migration of jaegers (Stercorarius spp.) over the Great Lakes. Data from shoreline observation sites show that higher numbers of jaegers have been reported from Lake Ontario. Parasitic Jaegers account for 80% of identified jaegers and 70% of these are juveniles. Peak migration of Parasitic Jaegers (S. parasiticus) occurs between 22 September and 27 October. Peak migration of Pomarine Jaegers (S. pomarinus) was 1-2 wk later. Approximately 70% of the days of high jaeger counts occurred on the day of or day after the passage of a cold front. Two weather conditions, one dominated by a strong low pressure system and the other by a strong high pressure system, are associated with 90% of the high-count days. Weather and occurrence data support the hypothesis that jaegers seen on Lake Ontario originate from James Bay.																			0273-8570					WIN	1999	70	1					33	41																WOS:000080066900005

Two current meters were configured on each subsurface mooring at 14 m below the water surface and 2 m above the bottom, and current speed, direction, and water temperature were recorded at 15 minute intervals. These data represent nearly 1.2 million observations and are the longest continuous set of observations conducted anywhere in Lake Huron and the first extensive set of winter observations conducted in Saginaw Bay. The winter months showed the highest mean currents from the moorings closest to Lake Huron, whereas the stratified season showed high mean currents at the moorings located in the bay proper. There was little consistency in mean flow vectors other than the bottom currents at the southeastern mooring which showed consistent flow from the bay into Lake Huron. Only a small fraction of the kinetic energy was contained in the mean flow. The variability in the orientation of the principal axes of variation on semi-annual to inter-annual time scales suggests using caution in generalizing about circulation patterns based solely upon limited data sets.

Water samples were gathered at intervals of 3, 5, and 15days, for 60days during summer 2012, for physical, chemical, and biological analyses (abundance and maximum linear dimension of subsurface zooplankton, phytoplankton, and glass slide-colonized periphyton) in both lake zones. A summer storm on the 20th day disturbed the periphyton succession in the littoral and pelagic zones. Phytoplankton size classes varied similarly to the smaller size of zooplankton in the pelagic zone, whereas most of periphyton size classes coincided with the larger zooplankton in the littoral zone, evidencing that zooplankton in Lake Mangueira may exploit both communities and both compartments (littoral and pelagic zones). The study demonstrated that the patterns of those communities are dynamic and closely related to the environmental variability in Lake Mangueira.

Although the existence of these springs has been known for decades, until recently estimates of spring water discharge into the Dead Sea were scarce. In this study, we developed a methodology of water discharge estimation for channels incising into a lacustrine bed using remotely sensed data and a single hydraulic geometry variable, water-surface width. Based on calibration of over 400 in situ measurements and simultaneous hydrometric data from aerial images, width-discharge rating curves were established, tested, and found suitable (r(2)=0.92, p=0.001) for the estimation of water discharge, with 5% uncertainty. Furthermore, we used these relationships to estimate retrospectively the temporal changes in water discharge of seven main channels traceable in historical aerial images. The reconstructed trend reveals a major (63%) reduction in average freshwater inflow between 1990 and 2006. Our results maximize the use of water-surface width information from aerial imagery, and suggest applicability to areas experiencing rapid exposure of sea/lake bed and consequent access difficulties in in situ discharge monitoring.					; LARONNE, JONATHAN/F-1119-2012	Laronne, Jonathan/0000-0002-2889-9316; 													0262-6667	2150-3435				AUG	2014	59	8					1593	1605		10.1080/02626667.2013.852278	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02626667.2013.852278													WOS:000340172900010

Structural Analysis of the Tourist Flow and Forecasting of Anthropogenic Impacts: A Case Study of Olkhon Island (Baikal, Irkutsk Oblast)	GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES												This article presents the results of research into the flow of holidaymakers to the most popular part of Lake Baikal (Irkutsk oblast): Olkhon Island (the largest island in the lake). The Khuzhir rural municipal district receives 200 000 to 500 000 tourists and vacationers per year (the number of permanent residents is about 2000 people). To perform the assessment, a differentiated approach was used, taking into account the structure, dynamics, and territorial organization of tourism and recreational activities, as well as its confinement to the most significant objects of infrastructure and tourist interest. The data obtained during the field observations and provided by specialized organizations (Federal State Budgetary Institution Zapovednoe Pribaikal'e, the Revyakin Museum of Local History, the territorial department of the statistical office, etc.) are summarized. This article reveals the features of the annual dynamics of the tourist flow, which is characterized by seasonal fluctuations with a summer maximum in July-August and a winter maximum in February-March. Groups of tourists are identified according to the form of accommodation. The prevalence of tourists using collective accommodation facilities (CAFs) has been established, while the number of those using tents has decreased. The spatial distribution of the flow of vacationers can be characterized as monofocal: the predominant number of CAFs is located in the village of Khuzhir and its environs; automobile tourists also prefer the shore of Khuzhir Bay. Based on the analysis of the occupancy of accommodation facilities, a forecast of the demand for hospitality facilities is made. The problems caused by tourists and vacationers (whose number exceeds many times that of permanent residents under conditions of a lack of accessible environmental protection infrastructure) are identified. The formation of consumer solid municipal waste generated in the process of consumption by tourists is calculated. This article demonstrates the possibility of using this approach for a comprehensive assessment of the tourist flow, as well as the need to provide areas with adequate environmental protection infrastructure.

J	Zhou, BT; Wang, ZY; Sun, B; Hao, X				Zhou, Botao; Wang, Zunya; Sun, Bo; Hao, Xin			Decadal Change of Heavy Snowfall over Northern China in the Mid-1990s and Associated Background Circulations	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Analyses of observation data from 1961 to 2014 by using the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) method indicate that the primary mode (a monosign pattern) of heavy snowfall over northern China in winter shows evident variations from a negative polarity to a positive polarity in the mid-1990s. Associated with this decadal change, the southward displacement of the polar front jet stream and northward shift of the subtropical jet stream in the upper troposphere are apparent. Accordingly, a negative height anomaly dominates the region from Lake Balkhash to Lake Baikal and a positive height anomaly occupies the midlatitudes of the North Pacific in the middle troposphere. Such anomalous patterns in the middle and high troposphere correspond approximately to the northern mode of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and may favor the interaction of cold air with moist airflows over northern China, which helps increase local heavy snowfall. Further investigation shows that the shift in the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) from a cold phase to a warm phase in the 1990s may also play a role, through its linkage to the above atmospheric circulations with the aid of a downstream propagation of wave train that emanates from the Atlantic Ocean.																			0894-8755	1520-0442				JAN	2021	34	2					825	837		10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0815.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0815.1													WOS:000615485000023

Rongcheng Swan Lake is a shallow coastal lagoon in eastern Shandong Peninsula, China, suffering from extensive macroalgal blooms dominated by Chaetomorpha spp. during the early summer and autumn. In the present study, the sediments collected from different lake regions and filamentous Chaetomorpha linum were incubated in the laboratory to investigate the influence of macroalgal decomposition on phosphorus (P) release from the sediments. In additon, some water quality parameters, including dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and pH, were monitored during the 30-day experiment. Due to the Chaetomorpha decomposition, DO concentration and pH value in overlying water declined greatly. DO concentrations in sediment + 30 g algae + water treatment were very low (< 0.15 mg L-1), which remained anaerobic throughout the incubation. In addition, COD concentration in the treatments with algae increased dramatically and the maximum varied between 20.07 and 69.26 mg L-1. In general, with the addition of greater amount of decomposing algae, a more visible change in each parameter was observed. During the decomposition process, SRP concentration in overlying water increased significantly, with the maximum of 1.51 mg L-1. At the two studied regions, SRP concentrations in sediment + 30 g algae + water were significantly higher than those in sediment + water and algae + water treatments, respectively (p < 0.05). The remarkable increase in P level in overlying water in sediment + algae + water treatment was mainly due to the P release from decomposing macroalgae during the initial 5 days of incubation and from the sediments at late stage, respectively. The decomposition of large qualities of Chaetomorpha promoted sediment P release obviously through changing environmental conditions, whose influence effect differed between the macroalgal dominated and non-dominated zone. In the macroalgal bloom zone, P release amount was high and the P released from sediments constituted the most part of P increase in overlying water. Our results indicate that the influence of Chaetomorpha blooms on sediment P release can not be neglected during the degradation phase in Swan Lake. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

This has led to substantial changes in terrestrial ecosystems and the hydrological cycle, which have affected the distribution of vegetation and the patterns of water flow and accumulation. Various remote sensing techniques, including optical and microwave satellite observations, are useful for monitoring these terrestrial water and vegetation dynamics. In the present study, satellite and reanalysis datasets were used to produce water and vegetation maps with a high temporal resolution (daily) and moderate spatial resolution (500 m) at a continental scale over Siberia in the period 2003-2017. The multiple data sources were integrated by pixel-based machine learning (random forest), which generated a normalized difference water index (NDWI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and water fraction without any gaps, even for areas where optical data were missing (e.g., cloud cover). For the convenience of users handling the data, an aggregated product is provided, formatted using a 0.1 degrees grid in latitude/longitude projection. When validated using the original optical images, the NDWI and NDVI images showed small systematic biases, with a root mean squared error of approximately 0.1 over the study area. The product was used for both time-series trend analysis of the indices from 2003 to 2017 and phenological feature extraction based on seasonal NDVI patterns. The former analysis was used to identify areas where the NDVI is decreasing and the NDWI is increasing, and hotspots where the NDWI at lakesides and coastal regions is decreasing. The latter analysis, which employed double-sigmoid fitting to assess changes in five phenological parameters (i.e., start and end of spring and fall, and peak NDVI values) at two larch forest sites, highlighted a tendency for recent lengthening of the growing period. Further applications, including model integration and contribution to land cover mapping, will be developed in the future.

J	Groce, JE; Morrison, ML				Groce, Julie E.; Morrison, Michael L.			Habitat Use by Saw-Whet Owls in the Sierra Nevada	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Northern saw-whet owls (Aegolius acadicus) are secondary cavity-nesters and their dependence on snags has potential repercussions on forest management practices. Descriptive studies exist regarding habitat characteristics around saw-whet nest and roost areas, yet few studies have examined associations within larger areas or relative to snag characteristics (e. g., density). We conducted owl broadcast surveys and snag sampling during the spring and summer of 2006 and 2007 in the Lake Tahoe Basin of the central Sierra Nevada; we measured additional habitat variables from Geographic Information System layers. We modeled detection and occupancy probabilities for saw-whets using sampling and site covariates at survey sites. In addition, we used stepwise logistic regression to compare habitat characteristics at owl use sites and nonuse sites at 2 spatial scales. Detection probability was low in 2006 and decreased throughout the survey period; detection probability was slightly higher in 2007 and unaffected by day of survey. Probability of occupancy was affected by elevation and dominant tree species in 2007. Similarly, stepwise logistic regression indicated saw-whet occurrence was negatively correlated with the percentage of area dominated by white fir (Abies concolor) at both the macrohabitat (approx. 260 ha) and microhabitat (approx. 20 ha) scales and was positively correlated with the percentage of area containing open canopy at the microhabitat scale. We did not find correlations between saw-whet occurrence and snag characteristics. Current restoration projects in areas of the Sierra Nevada aim to decrease relative abundance of white fir and the number of snags in forest stands. We recommend continued monitoring of saw-whets to understand potential effects of these restoration activities. Our estimates of saw-whet occupancy and detection probabilities can be used by forest managers to determine necessary survey effort for reliable results when developing monitoring protocols.																			0022-541X					SEP	2010	74	7					1523	1532		10.2193/2008-571	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/2008-571													WOS:000281361200014
J	Stapanian, MA; Bur, MT; Adams, JV				Stapanian, Martin A.; Bur, Michael T.; Adams, Jean V.			Temporal trends of young-of-year fishes in Lake Erie and comparison of diel sampling periods	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												We explored temporal trends of young-of-year (YOY) fishes caught in bottom trawl hauls at an established offshore monitoring site in Lake Erie in fall during 1961-2001. Sampling was conducted during morning, afternoon, and night in each year. Catches per hour (CPH) of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) YOY were relatively low and exhibited no temporal trend. This result was consistent with the species' intolerance to Lake Erie's adverse winter water temperatures. Gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum) YOY decreased sharply after 1991, which was consistent with recent oligotrophication of the lake. Following the establishment in 1979 and rapid increase of white perch (Morone americana) YOY, white bass (Morone chrysops) and freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens) YOY decreased. Troutperch (Percopsis omiscomaycus) YOY decreased during 1986-1991, but recovered to previous levels during 1991-2001. The recovery coincided with the resurgence of mayflies (Ephemoptera) in the lake. CPH of spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius) and emerald shiner (N. atherinoides) YOY exhibited no temporal trend between 1961 and the late 1970s to early 1980s. CPH of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) YOY decreased during 1961-1988, and walleye (Sander vitreum) YOY increased overall during the time series. These observations were consistent with published studies of adults in the region. CPH of 4 of the 10 species of YOY considered were greatest during night. CPH for walleye YOY was higher in the morning than in the afternoon, but there was no significant difference between night and morning abundances. The results suggest that (1) CPH of YOY fishes may be a useful monitoring tool for Lake Erie, and (2) offshore monitoring programs that do not include night sampling periods may underestimate recruitment for several common species.

J	Wang, XR; Zhou, LZ				Wang, Xinran; Zhou, Lizhi			Effect of Anthropogenic Disturbance Intensity on the Vigilance Mode of Wintering Hooded Crane (Grus monacha)	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Wetland degradation has resulted in waterbirds choosing more habitats to forage and facing increased intensity of anthropogenic disturbance. Usually feeding in a large flock could provide safety by the vigilance partners through coordinated and synchronous vigilance modes. In this paper, we aimed to shed light on behavioral strategies adaptive to anthropogenic disturbances. Vigilance behavior of wintering Grus monacha was observed to assess the effect of traffic intensity on their vigilance mode at Shengjin Lake, a Ramsar Site in China. Disturbance intensity was divided into three levels, and the influence of disturbance intensity on collective vigilance was compared by one-way analysis of variance (low disturbance: F = 1.854, P < 0.001; moderate disturbance: F = 1.854, P < 0.001; high disturbance: F = 1.637). The relationship between disturbance intensity and vigilance mode was determined by analyzing the influence of disturbance intensity on the vigilance mode of the crane group. Anthropogenic disturbance intensity had a significant influence on vigilance mode of the wintering cranes. However, there were no significant differences between low and moderate disturbance groups (coordinated vigilance, low vs. moderate: Q = 3.27, P = 0.056; synchronized vigilance, low vs. moderate: Q = 1.92, P = 0.364), probably because of the close distance between both habitats and the presence of patrol boats and photography enthusiasts. Moreover, results showed that there was a significant difference in the frequency of the synchronized vigilance wave among disturbance intensity levels (low vs. high: Q = 33.94, P < 0.001; low vs. moderate: Q = 3.557, P = 0.033730; high vs. moderate: Q = 28.24, P < 0.001). Under high anthropogenic disturbance, wintering cranes mostly adopted coordinated vigilance mode (50%, 482.28 +/- 113.12s), while under low anthropogenic disturbance intensity, they adopted both coordinated (26%, 247.56 +/- 101.14s) and synchronous vigilance (45%, 289.28 +/- 88.29s). These behavioral strategies are of great significance to anti-predation vigilance.

However, the efficacy of dredging to reduce internal loading of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and to improve water quality has been questioned by some researchers. In this study, the long-term (similar to 15 years) effects of dredging to reduce internal N and P loading in a closed, polluted urban lake were investigated. The results showed that the release of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) could be suppressed quickly after dredging, and that the dredging effect was sustained for about 18 months. A significant release of NH4+-N was discovered during the first 2-8 months after dredging, followed by maintenance of low-level release rates for about 21-32 months. The continuous inflowing of external pollution loading led to the increase in the release rates of SRP and NH4+-N. The external pollution loading was therefore reduced three years after dredging to strengthen the remediation effect. After that, high diffusive flux from the sediment was observed for both NH4+-N and SRP during summer seasons for about six years, followed by a decreasing trend. The NH4+-N concentration in the overlying water was reduced after the reduction of external loading, while a high concentration of SRP in the overlying water was still observed during summer seasons. In conclusion, the mid-term (<3 years) reduction of internal N and P loading could be achieved by dredging if the external pollution loading were not reduced. Achieving long-term control would require modification of external loading. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Saito, T; Yamazawa, H; Mochizuki, A				Saito, Tatsuo; Yamazawa, Hiromi; Mochizuki, Akihito			Numerical reproduction of the seasonal variation in dissolved uranium in Lake Biwa	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												The seasonal variation in dissolved uranium (DU) concentrations in the epilimnion of Lake Biwa, the largest lake in Japan, was successfully reproduced by geochemical calculations.The DU in Lake Biwa's epilimnion was calculated using an ion-exchange-equilibrium model. The model used the water-DU simple mixing based on monthly observations of water sources (river water, rainwater, evaporation, and groundwater) and thermocline depths from previous studies (Mochizuki et al. (2016)), the adsorbed uranium (AU) on the soil surface based on work by Saito et al. (2021), and the chemical equilibrium of major chemical species such as H, C, and Ca. The total uranium (TU = AU + DU), which determines the peak DU level in summer, and cation-exchange capacity of the soil surface (CECZp), which determines the DU decrease in winter, were optimized by reproducing the DU measurements.The DU value calculated by PHREEQC with the ion-exchange-equilibrium model can be expressed as the sum of three dissolved chemical species (DUeq), which constitute on average 97% of the DU calculated by PHREEQC. DUeq values were decomposed and the contribution of each factor was ranked by comparing their seasonal variabilities. The complexation equilibrium had the greatest variability and was proportional to the reciprocal of the cube of hydrogen ions. This indicates that the seasonal variation in DU is caused mainly by variation in pH.The peak in the DU observations lagged behind the peak in the pH observations by approximately 1 month. However, DUeq did not reproduce this peak delay. Therefore, we assumed that when DU fails to reach the ion-exchange equilibrium concentration and the peak delay occurs, it follows a first-order reaction, and the rate coefficient is determined by the reproducibility of the DU measurements. The DUlim, as the adsorption/desorption rate-limited DU, improved the reproducibility of the DU and the delay after the pH peak. This implies that the delay of the DU peak after the pH peak represents the lag from equilibrium to a first-order rate reaction caused by the soil uranium adsorption/desorption rate.

Dust emissions in this region would therefore be expected to be sensitive to changes in these systems, in particular the strength and position of the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM). Here, we present a late-Holocene multi-proxy study where changes in dust flux, reconstructed from a high-altitude peat mire, are examined in light of climate variability and human impacts. Results show that for most the 4300 cal. yr BP record, dust flux sensitively tracked changes in SASM activity. Prior to 2600 cal. yr BP relatively high dust flux implies dry conditions prevailed across the Puna-Altiplao in association with reduced SASM activity. The chemistry of dust deposited at this time matched the large endorheic basins on the Puna, which host ephemeral lakes and terminal fans, indicating these were actively supplying dust to the airstream. After 2600 cal. yr BP, SASM activity increased while dust flux decreased and the dust chemistry changed, collectively implying the shutting down of the Puna-Altiplano as a significant dust source. Dust flux increased after 1000 cal. yr BP during the 'Medieval Warm Period', associated with a return to drier conditions and reactivation of dust sources across the endorheic basins of the Puna. Natural variability in dust flux was dwarfed, however, by the very significant increase in flux after 400 cal. yr BP following Spanish Colonisation and associated changing landuse practices. This finding attests to the globally significant role of humans on dust emissions.

Quiroga			Crop performance and soil properties in two artificially eroded soils in north-central Alberta	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Field experiments were conducted from 1991 to 1995 at Josephburg (Orthic Black Chernozem, Typic Cryoboroll) and Cooking Lake (Orthic Gray Luvisol, Typic Cryoboralf), Alberta, to determine the impact of topsoil removal on selected soil properties, N-mineralization potential, and crop yield, and the effectiveness of various amendments for restoring the productivity of eroded soils. The simulated-erosion levels were established in the autumn of 1990 by removing 20 cm of topsoil in 5-cm depth increments. The four amendments were: control, addition of 5 cm of topsoil, fertilizers to supply 100 kg N ha(-1) and 20 kg P ha(-1), and cattle manure at 75 Mg ha(-1). Topsoil and manure were applied once in the autumn of 1990, while fertilizers were applied annually from 1991 to 1995. Available N and P; total C, N, and P; and N-mineralization potential decreased, while bulk density increased with increasing depth of topsoil removal. Tiller number, plant height, spike density, thousand-kernel weight, and leaf area index decreased with simulated erosion. Grain yield reductions due to simulated soil erosion were either linear or curvilinear functions of nutrient removal. Application of N and P fertilizers and manure improved grain yield and reduced the impact of yield loss due to erosion. Return of 5 cm of topsoil also increased grain yield, but to a lesser extent than manure or fertilizers. Grain yields were maximized when fertilizers were also applied to organic amendment treatments. Our findings suggest the importance of integrated use of organic amendments and chemical fertilizers for best crop yields on severely eroded soils.

The daytime DGM levels in the lake exhibited a two-phase diurnal trend; the DGM concentrations rose in the morning, peaked around noontime and then fell in the afternoon through the evening; these trends followed the general pattern of diurnal solar radiation variations. The morning and afternoon phases appeared to be asymmetrical with the former relatively steep and the latter gradual. A variety of daytime DGM level variations other than the typical two-phase diurnal patterns were also observed. For the time spans studied, the daytime mean DGM concentrations of the lake ranged from 12 to 68 pg L-1 (60-340 fM). The daytime mean DGM levels in the summertime (June, July, August) showed values above 30 pg L-1 (150 fM) in most cases and a large number of peak DGM concentrations above 50 pg L-1 (250 fM). The summer DGM levels in the lake appear to be comparable to those observed in the large northern lakes for the summertime. The daytime DGM levels in the lake were found to correlate with solar radiation to various degrees (cases of r values above 0.8 similar to 12% and similar to 18% of the total sampling days for correlation with global solar radiation and UVA radiation, respectively). Correlating trends are recognizable between the daytime mean DGM concentration and the corresponding mean global solar radiation (r = 0.66, p < 0.0005) and between the daytime mean DGM concentration and the corresponding mean UVA radiation (r = 0.62, p < 0.0005).

J	Franchi, F; Frisia, S				Franchi, Fulvio; Frisia, Silvia			Crystallization pathways in the Great Artesian Basin (Australia) spring mound carbonates: Implications for life signatures on Earth and beyond	SEDIMENTOLOGY												Recent studies of continental carbonates revealed that carbonates with similar fabrics can be formed either by biotic, biologically-induced, biologically-influenced or purely abiotic processes, or a combination of all. The aim of this research is to advance knowledge on the formation of carbonates precipitated (or diagenetically altered) in extreme, continental environments by studying biotic versus abiotic mechanisms of crystallization, and to contribute to the astrobiology debate around terrestrial analogues of Martian extreme environments. Both fossil (upper Pleistocene to Holocene) and active carbonate spring mounds from the Great Artesian Basin (South Australia) have been investigated. These carbonates consist of low-Mg to high-Mg calcite tufa. Four facies have been described: (i) carbonate mudstone/wackestone; (ii) phytohermal framestone/boundstone; (iii) micrite boundstone; and (iv) coarsely crystalline boundstone. The presence of filaments encrusted by micrite, rich in organic compounds, including ultraviolet-protectants, in phytohermal framestone/boundstone and micrite boundstone is clear evidence of the existence of microbial mats at the time of deposition. In contrast, peloidal micrite, despite commonly being considered a microbial precipitate, is not directly associated with filaments in the Great Artesian Basin mounds. It has probably formed from nanocrystal aggregation on colloid particulate. Thus, where biofilms have been documented, it is likely that bacteria catalyzed the development of fabrics. It is less certain that microbes induced calcium carbonate precipitation elsewhere. Trace elements, including rare earth element distribution from laminated facies, highlight strongly evaporative settings (for example, high Li contents). Carbon dioxide degassing and evaporation are two of the main drivers for an increase in fluid alkalinity, resulting in precipitation of carbonates. Hence, although the growth of certain fabrics is fostered by the presence of microbial mats, the formation of carbonate crystals might be independent from it and mainly driven by extrinsic factors. More generally, biological processes may be responsible for fabric and facies development in micritic boundstone whilst micrite nucleation and growth are driven by abiotic factors. Non-classical crystallization pathways (aggregation and fusion of nanoparticles from nucleation clusters) may be more common than previously thought in spring carbonate and this should be carefully considered to avoid misinterpretation of certain fabrics as by-products of life. It is proposed here that the term 'organic-compound catalyzed mineralization' should be used for crystal growth in the presence of organic compounds when dealing with astrobiological problems. This term would account for the possibility of multiple crystallization pathways (including non-classical crystallization) that occurred directly from an aqueous solution without the direct influence of microbial mats.					frisia, silvia/B-2672-2010	Frisia, Silvia/0000-0001-6568-2696													0037-0746	1365-3091				AUG	2020	67	5					2561	2595		10.1111/sed.12711	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12711		MAR 2020											WOS:000521434600001
J	Long, CJ; Whitlock, C				Long, CJ; Whitlock, C			Fire and vegetation history from the coastal rain forest of the western Oregon coast range	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												High-resolution charcoal and pollen analyses were used to reconstruct a 4600-yr-long history of fire and vegetation near Taylor Lake in the wettest forests of coastal Oregon. Today, fires in these forests are rare because the season of ignition does not coincide with months of dry fuels. From ca. 4600 to 2700 cal yr B.P. fire episodes occurred at intervals of 140 +/- 30 yr while forest vegetation was dominated by disturbance-adapted taxa such as Alnus rubra. From ca. 2700 cal yr B.P. to the present, fire episodes have become less common, occurring at intervals of 240 +/- 30 yr, and fire-sensitive forest taxa, such as Tsuga heterophylla and Picea sitchensis, have become more prominent. Fire occurrence during the mid-Holocene was similar to that of the more xeric forests in the eastern Coast Range and suggests that summer drought was widespread. After ca. 2700 cal yr B.P., a decrease in fire episode frequency suggests that cooler conditions and possibly increased summer fog allowed the establishment of present-day Picea sitchensis forests within the watershed. These results provide evidence that fire has been an important disturbance agent in the Coast Range of Oregon, and variations in fire frequency and climate have led to the establishment of present-day forests.

Environmental multimedia samples (water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sediments) and tidal flat organisms ( polychaetes, decapods, amphipods, and bivalves) were collected from regions inside and outside of the estuary dam for MCs analysis. Phytoplankton communities in the Geum River (freshwater) and estuarine area (brackish water) were also analyzed in order to understand the relationship with MCs concentrations. Seasonal variation in the structure of phytoplankton communities was detected in the Geum River, with a relatively high density of Cyanophyta in summer. MC concentrations were strongly correlated to water temperature, chlorophyll a, and cyanobacterial density. MC-LR was the most abundant MC variants in environmental samples. Dissolved MCs remained for longer periods and were more widely distributed in the coastal environments compared to particulate MCs. The distribution coefficients between water and SPM (Kd-SPM) and between water and sediments (Kd-sediment) of MCs showed that the phase shift of MCs in the environmental samples occurred in the estuary. Kd-SPM declined from the inside to outside regions of the estuary dam, and was mainly attributed to differences in the half-lives of MCs in dissolved (4.7 d for MC-LR) and particulate phases (0.44-0.52 d for MC-LR). Species-specific bioaccumulation of MCs occurred in tidal flat organisms, with relatively high bioaccumulation factors of MCs being detected in polychaetes and decapods compared to amphipods and bivalves. Overall, this study advances our understanding on the distribution, transport, fate, and bioaccumulation of MCs in estuarine and coastal environments. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A comparative study of P load and speciation on particles in water columns was conducted in eutrophic aquaculture pond and Chesapeake Bay estuarine systems. Particle size separation, Hedley's sequential extraction, and microscopic observations were performed to characterize particle size-dependent distribution and speciation of P in water columns. For both aquatic systems, particles shared similar morphologies and P partitioning patterns. However, aquaculture ponds exhibited significantly higher particle loads and greater presence of colloid- and nanoparticle-associated P. Specifically, over 70 % of both inorganic P (Pi) and organic P (Po) enriched in particles with sizes smaller than 100 nm in ponds. It is the concentration of particulate and dissolved Po that controls the extent of algal blooms in P-rich aquaculture ponds. These Po fractions are mainly derived from suspended colloidal and nanoparticulate matter instead of large algae (>1,000 nm). Seasonal comparisons revealed that both diversity and bulk P (BP) concentrations were greater in summer than winter in both pond and estuarine systems. In the estuarine system, P was mainly present in the form of Si/Al-bound species, whereas in aquaculture ponds, Fe- and Ca-bound P forms were more prevalent. This suggests that P in estuarine systems primarily originates from internal sediment release, while P in ponds is largely derived from external inputs, such as fish feed. Correlation analysis further indicated that soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations in ponds were significantly associated with water hardness and dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. Increased DO availability may promote the formation of metal phosphate minerals, thereby reducing free orthophosphate in the water column. The Ca-bound nanoparticulate P-often overlooked in traditional P assessment-was found to be a dominant form in high-P aquaculture ponds. This fraction has the potential to suppress algal bloom development by promoting microbial degradation of Po and limiting the availability of bioactive Po.

However, climate change, anthropogenic impacts, and the complex coupling between surface water and groundwater increase the difficulty of predicting groundwater levels. The model proposed in this paper combines external data as well as multiple models. The method leverages long and short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models, combined with secondary modal decomposition and slime mould algorithm (SMA), together with an adaptive weight module (AWM). The study applies this method to predict GWL for three different hydrological conditions in China, specifically for the Jinan Baotu Spring, Heihu Spring, and Zhongtianshe watershed of Taihu Lake. A comparison of metrics such as mean absolute error and Nash efficiency coefficient for single and hybrid models shows that the model in this paper is more advantageous than the single model and other hybrid models. The interpretability of the model is enhanced by SHAP values that demonstrate the degree of contribution of the input variables. This paper uses SHAP analyses to identify the key drivers affecting groundwater levels. These factors must be detected in order to develop groundwater resource protection measures.					zhaocai, wang/JFA-9761-2023; Xu, Nannan/GRX-7174-2022; Yao, Zhiyuan/JTS-3681-2023; Wu, Junhao/JAD-1073-2023	zhaocai, wang/0000-0003-1396-6835; 													1364-8152	1873-6726				APR	2024	175								105969	10.1016/j.envsoft.2024.105969	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2024.105969		FEB 2024											WOS:001199542100001

This was well illustrated during winter 2013/2014 when a prolonged series of deep Atlantic depressions over a 3 month period resulted in damaging wind storms and exceptional rainfall accumulations. The impact on livelihoods and property from the resulting coastal surge and river and surface flooding was substantial. This study reviews the observational and modelling toolkit available to operational meteorologists during this period, which focusses on precipitation forecasting months, weeks, days and hours ahead of time. The routine availability of high-resolution (km scale) deterministic and ensemble rainfall predictions for short-range weather forecasting as well as weather-resolving seasonal prediction capability represent notable landmarks that have resulted from significant progress in research and development over the past decade. Latest results demonstrated that the suite of global and high-resolution UK numerical weather prediction models provided excellent guidance during this period, supported by high-resolution observations networks, such as weather radar, which proved resilient in difficult conditions. The specific challenges for demonstrating this performance for high-resolution precipitation forecasts are discussed. Despite their good operational performance, there remains a need to further develop the capability and skill of these tools to fully meet user needs and to increase the value that they deliver. These challenges are discussed, notably to accelerate the progress towards understanding the value that might be delivered through more integrated environmental prediction.					; Neal, Robert/AAU-2045-2021; Scaife, Adam/ADN-9599-2022; Golding, Brian/AAG-2326-2020	Neal, Robert/0000-0003-2678-6016; 													1350-4827	1469-8080				JAN	2015	22	1			SI		90	104		10.1002/met.1493	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/met.1493													WOS:000348861400009

Ice thickness affects physical, biological, and chemical processes as well as safety conditions for scientists and the general public. Measurements of ice thickness that are both temporally frequent and spatially extensive remain a technical challenge. Here new observational methods using repurposed soil moisture sensors that facilitate high spatial-temporal sampling of ice thickness are field tested on Lake Mendota in Wisconsin during the winter 2015/16 season. Spatial variability in ice thickness was high, with differences of 10 cm of ice column thickness over 1.05 km of horizontal distance. When observational data were compared with manual measurements and model output from both the Freshwater Lake (FLake) model and General Lake Model (GLM), ice thickness from sensors matches manual measurements, whereas GLM and FLake results showed a thinner and thicker ice layer, respectively. The FLake-modeled ice column temperature effectively remained at 0 degrees C, not matching observations. We also show that daily ice dynamics follows the expected linear function of ice thickness growth/melt, improving confidence in sensor accuracy under field conditions. We have demonstrated a new method that allows low-cost and high-frequency measurements of ice thickness, which will be needed both to advance winter limnology and to improve on-ice safety.

Ambala and Yamunanagar districts of eastern Haryana, India, were faecal sampled monthly over a 6-year period (January, 1986-December, 1991) to study the pattern of chronic fascioliosis. High incidence of Fasciola gigantica infection was observed in both species of livestock during winter (November-February). Species-wise incidence was more in buffaloes than in cattle. District-wise incidence was more in animals of Kurukshetra than the remaining districts and it might be attributed to the ideal ecosystem provided by man-made lake in that area (or persistence, propagation and infection of Lymnaea auricularia with F. gigantica. Fasciola gigantica cercariae were seen in high percentage of L.auricularia from August Lo November and climatic conditions during this period were conducive for their shedding. The present observations made it clear that the animals picked up infection during rainy season (July - October) and excreted eggs in higher percentage during winter. The chemotherapeutic trials against natural infection of F. gigantica in buffaloes with many flukicides demonstrated that closantel is better than nitroxynil, oxyclozanide and triclabendazole. Chronic fascioliosis can be combated successfully with any of thee flukicides when administered regularly at an interval of not more than 3 months.																			0367-8318					JUN	1993	63	6					600	605																WOS:A1993LL93100003

The substrates and bathymetry of the study area had been mapped recently by side-scan sonar. Burbot density determined from videotapes covering 6,900 m2 of lake bed at depths of 23-41 m averaged 139 individuals/hectare (range, 0-571/hectare). This density was substantially higher than the highest burbot density (59-95/hectare) reported in the literature. Burbot were present on the lake bed at depths of 23-36 m, but were most abundant near the crest of the reef at 23-28 m, where the water temperature was 8-13-degrees-C, their preferred summer temperature range. Substrates in that temperature range on the reef were bedrock, bedrock ridges, and bedrock and rubble. Burbot were most abundant on the bedrock and rubble. Small fish and macroinvertebrates typically eaten by burbot elsewhere in western Lake Michigan were distributed on the reef according to their summer preferred temperatures and were not seen in abundance where burbot density was highest. We saw no lake trout Salvelinus namaycush on Jawline's Reef, although large numbers of juvenile lake trout have been stocked there annually and temperatures on the reef were in the preferred summer temperature range for lake trout.																			0002-8487					JUL	1993	122	4					560	574		10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0560:DAARMO>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1993)122<0560:DAARMO>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1993LW05400005

The drift was performed downstream from Daugavpils City by a manned research platform constructed from a small maritime life raft and an inflatable boat. All measurements and water sampling procedures were performed in the middle of the river at hourly intervals. Main physical and chemical properties of the drifting water mass were measured at the 0.5 m depth by a Hach Hydrolab DS5 multiprobe. At each sampling position, subsurface samples of water, phytoplankton and zooplankton were also taken. The correlation analysis and the Principal Component Analysis were applied for the obtained data series. The drift continued uninterruptedly for 12 hours, and about 51 km long distance was travelled. The range of variation of most parameters exceeded their respective measurement accuracy levels. During the drift, the water temperature, pH and conductivity gradually increased, the turbidity and transparency remained almost constant, whereas the abundance, total biomass and diversity of the phyto-and zooplankton communities changed unpredictably. Possible impact of weather conditions, water mass turbulence and stagnant floodwaters are discussed in detail. The experiment highlighted the role of turbulence at different scales and validated hypotheses about the longitudinal transformation of the water mass properties and composition during its downstream drift during the spring flood. It also demonstrated the usefulness of the applied methodology for the in situ observations of the drifting water masses and highlighted possible ways for further improvements of such techniques in river system research.

The exergies (Ex) and structural exergies (Exst) were calculated based on phytoplankton biomass (BA) and zooplankton biomass (BZ). A trophic state index (TSI) scaling from 0 to 100 was developed to classify trophic status for Chinese and Italian lakes based on three indicators, chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a, in mg/m(3)), total phosphorus (TP in mg/m(3)) and transparency in Secchi disk depth (SD in m). The relationships between TSI and Ex, Exst, total biomass, BZ/BA ratios were analyzed. The following results were obtained: (1) with the increase of TSI in Chinese and Italian lakes, there is an increasing trend for Ex, and a decreasing trend for Exst, generally. The obvious negative correlations exist between TSI and Exst, at the significant level of 0.01 for Italian lakes, and 0.05 for Chinese lakes. The obvious positive correlations exist between TSI and Ex, at the significant level of 0.01 for Chinese lakes, and for Italian lakes in Spring, Autumn and the all-year. (2) The structural exergy is more dependent on the ratio of phytoplankton biomass to zooplankton biomass (BZ/BA) than the exergy, and the exergy is more dependent on total biomass than the structural exergy. (3) The phytoplankton biomass (BA) and zooplankton biomass (BZ) are increased with the increasing TSI in Chinese and Italian lakes, and phytoplankton biomass (BA) increases more rapidly then zooplankton biomass (BZ) does. This results in the definite decrease of BZ/BA ratio with the increasing trophic status index. Such changes of BA, BZ and BZ/BA ratio could explain successfully the variations of exergies and structural exergies along eutrophication gradients in Chinese and Italian lakes. From the two separate case studies of Chinese lakes and Italian lakes, it could be concluded that exergy and structural exergy are feasible to serve as the system-level ecological indicators to give appropriate information on the trophic status of different lakes.

J	Grant, SCH; Tonn, WM				Grant, SCH; Tonn, WM			Effects of nutrient enrichment on recruitment of age-0 fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas):: potential impacts of environmental change on the Boreal Plains	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Eutrophication in lakes on the Canadian Boreal Plains is predicted to increase because of climate and land-use changes. The resulting increase in lake productivity might then increase recruitment of young fish via increased food availability, growth, and survival. To assess this hypothesis, we manipulated nutrient concentrations in experimental ponds and examined mechanisms influencing production and survival of age-0 fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Nutrient enrichment increased phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) sevenfold in treatment compared to reference systems. In response, fish laid more eggs and survival of age-0 fish was enhanced, both of which contributed to a more than fivefold increase in total number of age-0 fish that survived to the end of the growing season in treatment versus reference systems. A complementary enclosure experiment suggested that enhanced growth and decreased susceptibility to starvation contributes to the greater survival of age-0 fish when food resources are increased. Furthermore, overwinter mortality of age-0 fathead minnows in experimental ponds was strongly size-selective; no fish smaller than 20 mm survived winter. Because of these effects on egg production and growth and survival of age-0 fish, environmental changes predicted for the Boreal Plains could significantly alter the dynamics of fish populations.

The observation data includes horizontal visibility and present weather phenomena achieved in Tabriz, Urmia, and Saqez stations. The ERA5, MERRA-2, and CAMS data were prepared for this research. The long-term dusty day analysis was conducted from 2000 to 2019. The synoptic-dynamic analysis and RegCM simulations were done during dust events on 28-31 October 2017-the HYSPLIT model and MODIS image usage to consider more detail. The results show that the Urmia Basin experiences two peaks, dusty days in the May and autumn months, including September and October. The persistent and widespread dust event in Urmia resulted from the approaching trough at 500 hPa to the north of Saudi Arabia and Iraq, trigged low pressure and increasing wind speed over the area. Based on the synoptic-dynamic analysis, MODIS satellite images, and the outputs of HYSPLIT, Iraq deserts were the primary source of dust on 28-31 October 2017. The dust distribution in the RegCM model, MERRA-2 data, and MODIS image agree. The RegCM aerosol optical depth (AOD) output time series agreed with MERRA-2 data, with a correlation coefficient of 0.84 and an index of agreement (IOA) of 0.56 in Urmia stations. The local dust source detected by the surface emission flux in the eastern Lake Urmia close to Tabriz can be a reason for the dustiest day in Tabriz. The AOD diurnal variation obtained from RegCM, MERRA-2, and CAM are similar in Tabriz and Urmia. The AOD of RegCM is underestimated compared to MERRA-2 and CAM in three selected stations.

Growth of a high-elevation large inland lake, associated with climate change and permafrost degradation in Tibet	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												This study analyzed satellite images and long term climate variables from a high-elevation meteorological station (4730 m) and streamflow records to examine hydrological response of Nam Co Lake (4718 m), the largest lake on the Tibetan Plateau, over the last 50 years. The results show the lake area extended by 51.8 km(2) (2.7% of the total area) when compared with the area in 1976. This change is associated with an annual precipitation increase of 65 mm (18.6%), annual and winter mean temperature increases of 0.9 degrees C and 2.1 degrees C respectively, an annual runoff increase of 20% and an annual pan evaporation decrease of about 2%, during the past 20 years. The year of the change point in annual precipitation, air temperature, annual pan evaporation and runoff occurred in 1971, 1983, 1997 and 1997, respectively. The timing of the lake growth corresponds with the abrupt increase in annual precipitation and runoff since the mid-1990s.

We compared body mass, fat scores, and rates of mass gain of adults and immatures of 52 species of birds during autumn migration stopover at Long Point, Ontario, Canada, on the north shore of Lake Erie. Mean body mass of adults was greater than that of immatures in the majority of species with a detectable difference, but the average difference across species was only 1%. Fat scores were also higher for adults in many species, suggesting that mass differences were due to differences in condition rather than body size. Mean rate of mass gain, estimated from changes in body mass of first captures over the course of the day, did not differ significantly between adults and immatures of most species. However, the power to detect differences was low. Averaged across species (n = 117 903 birds), the estimated rate of mass gain for adults was 10% higher than that for immatures, but with 95% confidence limits ranging from 12% lower to 32% higher. The observed differences in body mass could be produced by a small difference in rate of mass gain. Small differences in body mass and rate of mass gain between immatures and adults could indicate that young passerines rapidly develop similar foraging skills to those of adults, or that young birds are not particularly disadvantaged at Long Point either because of good food supply, or because there is little need to accumulate large amounts of fat in the early stages of migration.																			0010-5422					FEB	2002	104	1					49	58		10.1650/0010-5422(2002)104[0049:ARDIBM]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1650/0010-5422(2002)104[0049:ARDIBM]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000179348100005

The south pit lake developed from alkaline ground water infiltration and had an initial pH of 7.2. It contained high concentrations of boron and chloride, indicating that it consisted of a mix of meteoric and evolved connate waters. Numerous carbon dioxide gas vents were present initially in the shallow south pit lake, but as the pit lake increased in depth, gas venting ceased and carbon dioxide is retained in the lower layer of the chemically stratified lake. Continued increase of dissolved carbon dioxide in the lower layer increases the potential for a limnic eruption. A chemocline occurs at a depth of 47 m. The upper layer of the lake has lower pH, temperature, and conductivity than the lower layer. Effluent from ore and waste rock piles directed into the south pit lake has contributed to high levels of antimony, arsenic, cobalt, copper, mercury, nickel, and zinc. Iron oxyhydroxide is abundant in mine effluent that enters the pit lake and adsorption onto this phase has lowered the arsenic and antimony concentrations. The north pit lake formed primarily from winter surface runoff. The acidic water, pH 4.56, initially had high concentrations of cobalt, mercury, and nickel derived from weathering products of pyritized serpentinite and shales. Buffering by wall rocks has established a slightly alkaline pH of 7.62. The concentrations of trace metals in the north pit lake have substantially decreased due to continued dilution of the lake by surface runoff and remediation of parts of the pit walls that have been covered by backfill.																					0-87335-182-7				2000							367	375																WOS:000169875500039

Within forty years (1951-1990), the spawning of bream shifted, on average, to a ten days earlier period but the range of spawning temperature remained unchanged, while there was no shift in the spawning time for roach, which started to spawn at about three degrees higher water temperature than earlier. The difference between spawning times of roach and bream decreased from an average 22 to 13 days and the difference in average temperatures at the onset of spawning by about 3 C. Besides water temperature, the timing of spawning was also related to the water level in spring: in years with higher water levels in March or April both fish species started to spawn earlier. The effect of water level changes on spawning was more pronounced in shallower Vortsjarv than in Lake Peipsi.

J	VALLENTYNE, JR				VALLENTYNE, JR			PRINCIPLES OF MODERN LIMNOLOGY	AMERICAN SCIENTIST												The distribution of heat in a lake markedly affects the stability of the lake to mixing by the wind. Since less dense water overlies the dense in a thermally stratified lake, the center of gravity of the lake is necessarily depressed below the isothermal position. Stability can be theoretically measured by the amount of work done in moving the center of gravity down. Lakes with the greatest stability have the greatest depressions of the center of gravity. Effective circulation is limited to the epilimnion during thermal stratification. In very deep lakes the maximum theoretical stability is never reached, and in very shallow water it is quickly bypassed in the spring. The whole economy of the lake is dependent on the sums energy because it is this energy that the microscopic plants and rooted vegetation use to make carbohydrates from CO2. Due to active photosynthesis we find that dissolved O2 in epilmnetic water lies near the saturation point at all times. However, in the hypolimnion the thermocline barrier does not permit contact of water with air. Consequently the penetration of dissolved materials into the hypolimnion is thus reduced to low values in summer. Production rate rises as mean depth decreases. The shallower the lake the higher the production. In the future we may expect the development of quantitative techniques for the study of turbulent transfer processes in the lake and between the lake and its surroundings. We may also expect an understanding of the dynamics of phytoplankton growth on a molecular level and the extension of absolute dating methods as applied to lake sediments. If absolute time scales were available, then quantitative estimates of sediment deposition rates might give quantitative measures of production rates during past time. These could then be related to other factors such as changing climate.																			0003-0996	1545-2786					1957	45	3					218	244																WOS:A1957WE05500004

Assessing the effectiveness of translocation outcomes requires a clear understanding of success metrics and long-term monitoring data. As such, the outcomes of conservation translocations remain underreported, limiting their potential for informing adaptive management and future translocation efforts. Here, we assess the post-translocation demography of multiple populations of the critically endangered Nubian giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis) in Uganda. Since 2015, there have been a series of giraffe conservation translocations designed to reintroduce them to habitats where they were previously extirpated and to reinforce a small population. In 2015, Nubian giraffe were found in only two protected areas in Uganda: Murchison Falls National Park (NP) (north of the Nile River) and Kidepo Valley NP. Through several conservation translocations that used Murchison Falls NP as a source population, Nubian giraffe were translocated to Lake Mburo NP, Murchison Falls NP (south of the Nile River), and Pian Upe Wildlife Reserve, while the population in Kidepo Valley NP was reinforced. In this study, we evaluated the post-translocation demography of all Nubian giraffe populations in Uganda. Using individual-based photographic surveys and a combination of complete enumeration and mark-recapture analyses with Cormack Jolly Seber modeling, we estimated abundance and survival rates for all giraffe populations. After an average post-translocation latency period of 36 months, all giraffe populations in Uganda showed subsequent population growth and high survival rates across all age classes. Additionally, the donor population in northern Murchison Falls NP continued to show positive population growth. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of translocations and monitoring as conservation tools for the critically endangered Nubian giraffe in Uganda. Such comparisons allow for critical evaluations of post-translocation ecology and can be used to inform best practices for future translocation activities.																				2578-4854				2025 SEP 4	2025									e70127	10.1111/csp2.70127	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/csp2.70127		SEP 2025											WOS:001564076600001

Normalization of heavy metal concentrations to Al is a promising method for intersite comparison and for the identification of metal-contaminated sites. We determined that Al significantly correlates with Pb (r2 = 0.88), Cd (r2 = 0.81), Cr (r2 = 0.45) in sediment samples from coastal Louisiana. These relationships were used to evaluate sites for metal contamination. Data from two potentially contaminated sites, Capitol Lake (Baton Rouge) and Bayou Trepagnier, fell well outside the prediction limits of the Al metal regression line for several of the metals. Samples from additional sites with no known metal contamination fell within the predictive limits of the regression equations. Metal: Aluminum regression relationships provide another tool for identifying areas of potential metal contamination in coastal wetlands but must be regionally correlated.

Distribution of Dissolved Nitrogen Compounds in the Water Column of a Meromictic Subarctic Lake	NITROGEN												In order to better understand the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen in meromictic lakes, which can serve as a model for past aquatic environments, we measured dissolved concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, and organic nitrogen in the deep (39 m maximal depth) subarctic Lake Svetloe (NW Russia). The lake is a rare type of freshwater meromictic water body with high concentrations of methane, ferrous iron, and manganese and low concentrations of sulfates and sulfides in the monimolimnion. In the oligotrophic mixolimnion, the concentration of mineral forms of nitrogen decreased in summer compared to winter, likely due to a phytoplankton bloom. The decomposition of the bulk of the organic matter occurs under microaerophilic/anaerobic conditions of the chemocline and is accompanied by the accumulation of nitrogen in the form of N-NH4 in the monimolimnion. We revealed a strong relationship between methane and nitrogen cycles in the chemocline and monimolimnion horizons. The nitrate concentrations in Lake Svetloe varied from 9 to 13 mu M throughout the water column. This fact is rare for meromictic lakes, where nitrate concentrations up to 13 mu M are found in the monimolimnion zone down to the bottom layers. We hypothesize, in accord with available data for other stratified lakes that under conditions of high concentrations of manganese and ammonium at the boundary of redox conditions and below, anaerobic nitrification with the formation of nitrate occurs. Overall, most of the organic matter in Lake Svetloe undergoes biodegradation essentially under microaerophilic/anaerobic conditions of the chemocline and the monimolimnion. Consequently, the manifestation of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle is expressed in these horizons in the most vivid and complex relationship with other cycles of elements.

An inverse relationship between lake size and DM was obtained in lakes in the regions as was found for European boreal lakes. There was no evidence indicating an effect of thawing permafrost on DM in these lakes. DM in lakes in the taiga region, however, were higher than those in the tundra region. All lake images on a map larger than 0.001 km(2) were analyzed, and the area and number distributions were obtained in order to calculate regional mass fluxes of diffusive methane. The total area of all lakes (339,733) in the Alaskan Arctic zone (northern region from 64.00 degrees N) is 25.5 x 10(3) km(2). Regional summer diffusive flux of methane from lakes in the Alaskan arctic zone was estimated to be 22 Gg CH4 yr(-1). Average diffusive flux density (per lake area) was 0.86 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1), which is similar to that in European boreal lakes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR. All rights reserved.

INDUSTRIAL AND ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY												A sanitary survey of the rivers and of Lake Ontario [long dash]2377[long dash]near Rochester, New York, was made during the summer of 1929, to determine the source and extent of pollution at lake bathing beaches. The possible sources of pollution studied are noted. Results of the survey show that there was relatively little pollution at any of the beaches; that the pollution existing was due principally to the carrying of Genesee River water to the beaches, to violent wave action on the banks, and to the bathers. A consideration of all the conditions led to the conclusion that the health hazard attending bathing at the beaches of Rochester during the summer of 1929 was negligible.																			0019-7866						1930	22						1336	1340		10.1021/ie50252a027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ie50252a027													WOS:000188450300379

We investigated fresh air-fall tephra and conducted both dry- and wet-sieving to assess the size distribution of both aggregate-bearing deposits on the ground and particles in the plume prior to aggregation. The tephra was asymmetrically distributed in the ENE direction, with a relatively wide distribution and small maximum grain sizes north of the depositional axis, reflecting different wind directions at each altitude. The secondary accumulation maxima at 4-8 km NE from the vent was characterized by the segregation of lapilli followed by accretionary pellets that were rapidly created by aggregation in the wet plume, thereby enhancing the removal of airborne ash. Coalesced aggregates possibly arose from salt precipitation processes. For dry aggregates fallen in medial-to-distal regions, observed deposition duration and fall velocity calculations concluded that fine ash was deposited not as individual particles but as aggregates. Most grain-size distributions along the dispersal axis based on the two sieving methods used were multimodal, with the coarser mode fining according to distance from the vent and the finer mode stabilizing at around 4 phi; this is interpreted as resulting from the mixture of grain-size distributions with different origins, i.e., the normal settling of individual clasts and particle aggregation. The wet-sieved total grain-size distribution included 20.4 wt% fine ash compared with only 2.4 wt% fine ash in the dry-sieved distribution, suggesting that aggregated particles accounted for 18 wt% of the deposit. Total grain-size distributions based on wet-sieving showed extremely poor sorting that could be explained by the following causes: the release of coarse-grained ejecta originating from the host rock of the crater, fine particles due to fragmentation from a phreatomagmatic eruption, the supply of water and salt from the crater to the plume, and aggregation enhancement of the fine ash on the ground, reflecting the effect of the crater lake as external water source.					; Tsuji, Tomohiro/OMK-6710-2025	Tsuji, Tomohiro/0000-0002-1237-7062; Nishizaka, Naoki/0009-0002-2391-0122; 														1880-5981				JUL 16	2020	72	1							104	10.1186/s40623-020-01233-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40623-020-01233-y													WOS:000552324700002
J	Martin, PA; Mcdaniel, TV; Hunter, B				Martin, PA; Mcdaniel, TV; Hunter, B			Temporal and spatial trends in chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations of mink in Canadian Lakes Erie and St. Clair	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Mink (Mustela vison) carcasses were collected from local commercial trappers from fall 1998 to spring 2003 from tributaries and marshes within 4.8km from the shores of Lakes Erie and St. Clair, including the Wheatley Harbour and St. Clair River Areas of Concern (AOCs), as well as from inland sites (8 to 40km from shore). Liver concentrations, on a lipid weight basis, of chlorinated hydrocarbons were measured and compared among sites and to tissue concentrations of mink from two previous collections from similar sites over the past 25 years. Mink from the western Lake Erie sites, which included the Wheatley Harbour AOC, had significantly higher concentrations of sum PCBs and PCB Aroclors than those from the St. Clair corridor or inland sites, with concentrations from the rest of Lake Erie being intermediate. Dieldrin concentrations were also significantly higher in western Lake Erie than many other sites, and those of oxychlordane and mirex also tended to be higher (0.05 < p < 0.1). There were no differences in contaminant concentrations between the St. Clair River AOC and the downstream non-AOC Lake St. Clair site, with the exception of slightly higher levels of octachlorostyrene (OCS). Concentrations of PCBs and other chlorinated hydrocarbons in mink showed a general decrease over the past two decades. In contrast, PCBs and some organochlorine pesticides tended to increase, significantly so with oxychlordane, in western Lake Erie mink over the same time period. DDE declined at all sites. Currently, mink liver PCB concentrations are within the range associated with reproductive impairment, as determined from captive mink studies, in 11.7% of all animals collected from the Lakes Erie and St. Clair basin overall, but in almost 40% of individuals from western Lake Erie.																			0167-6369					FEB	2006	113	1-3					245	263		10.1007/s10661-005-9083-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-005-9083-7								16502039					WOS:000236511700013

Phacoemulsifier occlusion break surge volume reduction	JOURNAL OF CATARACT AND REFRACTIVE SURGERY												Purpose: To compare the volumetric occlusion break surge responses of phacoemulsification units from 1 company over 3 generations under varying vacuum limits and target intraocular pressure (IOP) settings. Setting: Alcon Research, Ltd., Lake Forest, California, USA. Design: Experimental study. Methods: Three generations of phacoemulsification units (Infiniti Vision System, Centurion Vision System, and Centurion Vision System with Active Sentry upgrades) were tested. Volumetric surge responses were measured after occlusion breaks at vacuum limits of 200 mm Hg, 300 mm Hg, 400 mm Hg, 500 mm Hg, and 600 mm Hg and target IOPs of 30 mm Hg, 55 mm Hg, and 80 mm Hg. An acrylic test chamber with a piston attached to 3 springs modeled the human eye in this study. The springs were calibrated to mimic volumetric changes in the eye over a wide range of IOPs. Results: Occlusion break surge volumes varied from 17.4 mu L to 153 mu L, corresponding to 7% and 61%, respectively, of the aqueous volume in the average phakic eye and to 4% and 33% of the aqueous volume in the average aphakic eye. Conclusion: Occlusion break surge volumes decreased with increasing target IOP, decreasing vacuum limit, and each generational increment in the phacoemulsification system.

In this study, 33 new optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages and other measurements from aeolian sediment sections are used to reconstruct the timing of wet-dry climate variation in the Mu Us and Otindag dune fields of north China. The results indicate dune activity and dry climate in the last few hundred years, 14 ka to about 7 - 8 ka, and 50 ka to 60 ka. The dunes were mainly stable, implying a wetter climate, between about 7 - 8 ka and 2.4 ka. These results imply a lag of several thousand years between peak summer insolation at 10 - 11 ka and high summer monsoon rainfall after 7 - 8 ka. In the investigated regions, the monsoon climate may not respond directly to orbital forcing over millennial time scales. Land surface feedbacks may account for lagged dune field response.

J	Leonard, EM				Leonard, EM			A varve-based calibration of the Bridge River tephra fall	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												A 1 cm thick layer of Bridge River tephra is preserved in a core of varved lake sediments recovered from Hector Lake, Alberta. The varve sequence extends from the core top to well below the tephra layer and has been calibrated to calendar years. A varve count yields a calendar age of 2332 BP for the ash layer, with a potential error of about +/-50 years. This age is about 30 years younger than the current best radiocarbon-based estimate of the time of the eruption. However, in light of the potential errors in both the varve count and the radiocarbon age, the two ages are not inconsistent. The tephra contains no biotite. In the past, biotite-free Bridge River tephra has been associated with a possible late (ca. 2000 BP) tephra fall, but the tephra from Hector Lake is clearly associated with the main (2300-2400 BP) eruptive event.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				DEC	1995	32	12					2098	2102		10.1139/e95-163	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e95-163													WOS:A1995TV97900011

However, excessive phyto-plankton growth due to eutrophication significantly threatens ecologic, economic, and public health. Therefore, phytoplankton identification and quantification are essential to understanding the productivity and health of freshwater ecosystems as well as the impacts of phytoplankton overgrowth (such as Cyanobacterial blooms) on public health. Microscopy is the gold standard for phytoplankton assessment but is time-consuming, has low throughput, and requires rich experience in phytoplankton morphology. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is accurate and straightforward with high throughput. In addition, qPCR does not require expertise in phytoplankton morphology. Therefore, qPCR can be a useful alternative for molecular identification and enumeration of phytoplankton. Nonetheless, a comprehensive study is missing which evaluates and compares the feasibility of using qPCR and microscopy to assess phytoplankton in fresh water. This study 1) compared the performance of qPCR and microscopy in identifying and quantifying phytoplankton and 2) evaluated qPCR as a molecular tool to assess phytoplankton and indicate eutrophication. We assessed phytoplankton using both qPCR and microscopy in twelve large freshwater rivers across the United States from early summer to late fall in 2017, 2018, and 2019. qPCR-and microscope-based phytoplankton abundance had a significant positive linear cor-relation (adjusted R2 = 0.836, p-value < 0.001). Phytoplankton abundance had limited temporal variation within each sampling season and over the three years studied. The sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers had higher phytoplankton abundance than those in the eastern and western rivers. For instance, the concentration (geo-metric mean) of Bacillariophyta, Cyanobacteria, Chlorophyta, and Dinoflagellates at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers was approximately three times that at the sampling sites in the western rivers and approximately 18 times that at the sampling sites in the eastern rivers. Welch's analysis of variance indicates that phytoplankton abundance at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers was significantly higher than that at the sampling sites in the eastern rivers (p-value = 0.013) but was comparable to that at the sampling sites in the western rivers (p-value = 0.095). The higher phytoplankton abundance at the sampling sites in the midcontinent rivers was presumably because these rivers were more eutrophic. Indeed, low phytoplankton abundance occurred in oligotrophic or low trophic sites, whereas eutrophic sites had greater phytoplankton abundance. This study demonstrates that qPCR-based phytoplankton abundance can be a useful numerical indicator of the trophic conditions and water quality in freshwater rivers.					; Zhang, Chiqian/O-7959-2017	Graham, Jennifer L./0000-0002-6420-9335; Zhang, Chiqian/0000-0003-4532-7376													0043-1354	1879-2448				MAY 15	2023	235								119679	10.1016/j.watres.2023.119679	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2023.119679		APR 2023						37011576					WOS:000968934300001

We present total diatom concentrations and diatom community composition preserved in a high-altitude peat deposit located in the headwaters of the Mandakini River, Central Himalaya, India, to reconstruct the hydroclimatic conditions which prevailed during the mid-late Holocene. Since diatom productivity is associated with water table height/ elevation, the high diatom concentrations during -5656-5307 cal yr BP, -4310-4264 cal yr BP, -3515-3024 cal yr BP and - 1679-988 cal yr BP are inferred to have been periods of relatively high water table, denoting improved hydrological conditions. Conversely, low concentrations of diatoms occurred during -8077-5866 cal yr BP, -5263-4332 cal yr BP, -4241-3570 cal yr BP, -2970-1715 cal yr BP, and - 697-370 cal yr BP. The temporal changes in the diatom suggest stressed hydrological conditions. The water table fluctuations inferred from diatom concentration variability show a positive correlation with the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) intensity and a negative correlation with the westerlies. The observed low concentrations of diatoms was associated with the relatively dry climatic conditions, which is detrimental to the peat environment and therefore suggests the need for in-situ data monitoring for the Indian peat deposits. As dry conditions can result in the deterioration of peat deposits, which may prove a significant source of atmospheric carbon dioxide in a changing climate, their conservation strategies will help limit carbon emissions.					; Agarwal, Shravi/KFA-5686-2024; Shukla, Sunil/GLR-0323-2022; Srivastava, Pradeep/AAC-3039-2020	Shukla, Sunil/0000-0002-7517-5564; Srivastava, Pradeep/0000-0002-9591-7764; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				FEB 15	2023	612								111381	10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111381	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2022.111381		JAN 2023											WOS:000974599900001
J	HARRITS, SM; HANSON, RS				HARRITS, SM; HANSON, RS			STRATIFICATION OF AEROBIC METHANE-OXIDIZING ORGANISMS IN LAKE MENDOTA, MADISON, WISCONSIN	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The microflora responsible for CH4 oxidation are stratified in a narrow band in the thermocline of Lake Mendota where dissolved O2 is low during summer. O2 sensitivity of growth of these organisms or of CH4 oxidation cannot account for their absence from the epilimnion because O2 does not inhibit either process under in situ conditions at concentrations exceeding those measured in natural samples. The dissolved inorganic N content of samples where CH4 oxidation rates were highest was > 1 mg/l in summer 1977. Evidence of in situ N fixation could not be obtained, although enrichment cultures grew on N free media and fixed 15N2. Nitrite was present at the position in the water column of maximum CH4 oxidation; apparently, methanotrophic bacteria co-oxidized NH3. The distribution of methanotrophs in the lake indicated that their position in the water column at each time of year was determined by the concentration profiles of O2 and CH4. CH4 oxidation in summer depletes the CH4 in the epilimnion and the absence of O2 in the hypolimnion precludes growth of the organisms there. At other times of year, the rates of oxidation of CH4 may be determined by the concentration of CH4 in the water. The rate of oxidation of CH4 by a sample was increased by additional CH4 when the in situ concentration was < 5 .mu.M.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1980	25	3					412	421		10.4319/lo.1980.25.3.0412	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1980.25.3.0412													WOS:A1980JU61700003
J	Jain, A; Rai, AC; Pal, J; Sharma, E				Jain, A; Rai, AC; Pal, J; Sharma, E			Hydrology and nutrient dynamics of a sacred lake in Sikkim Himalaya	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The hydrology and nutrient dynamics of a sacred lake in the western part of the Sikkim Himalaya were studied. The lake watershed has broad-leaved mixed forest and agriculture land, two perennial and five seasonal inlets, and one major outlet. Annual inflow was 1103x10(6) l while outflow was 4279x10(6) l. About 70% of its water was from subsurface flow and seepage. More than 50% of the discharge was recorded in August (peak rainy season month) and the least in March (lean month). Sediment flow to the lake was 346 Mg y(-1) and outflow 316 Mg y(-1). The remaining 30 Mg was deposited in the lake. High sediment runoff in the rainy season turned the lake turbid and caused expansion of the bog. The nutrient (dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, total-N, ammonium-N, phosphate-P and chloride) levels of the lake, inlets and outlet varied between seasons and sites. Plankton productivity ranged from 16 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in winter to 247 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in the rainy season. Its respiratory loss was 12 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in winter and 160 mg C m(-2) d(-1) in the rainy season. Religious activities, agriculture, cattle grazing and forestry in the watershed should be controlled for maintaining the longevity of the lake.

J	STAUFFER, MR; LEWRY, JF				STAUFFER, MR; LEWRY, JF			REGIONAL SETTING AND KINEMATIC FEATURES OF THE NEEDLE FALLS SHEAR ZONE, TRANS-HUDSON OROGEN	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Needle Falls Shear Zone is the southern part of a major northeast-trending ductile shear system within the Paleoproterozoic Trans-Hudson Orogen in Saskatchewan. Throughout its exposed length of approximately 400 km, the shear zone separates reworked Archean continental crust and infolded Paleoproterozoic supracrustals of the Cree Lake Zone, to the northwest, from mainly juvenile Paleoproterozoic arc terrains and granitoid plutons of the Reindeer Zone, to the southeast. It also defines the northwest margin of the ca. 1855 Ma Wathaman Batholith, which forms the main protolith to shear zone mylonites. Although not precisely dated, available age constraints suggest that the shear zone formed between ca. 1855 and 1800 Ma, toward the end of peak thermotectonism in this part of the orogen. In the Needle Falls study area, shear zone mylonites exhibit varied, sequentially developed, ductile to brittle fabric features, including C - S fabrics, winged porphyroclasts (especially delta type), small-scale compressional and extensional microfaults ranging from thin ductile shear zones to late brittle faults, early isoclinal and sheath folds, later asymmetric folds related to compressional microfaults, and variably rotated and (or) folded quartz veins. All ductile shear-sense indicators suggest dextral displacement, as do most later ductile-brittle transition and brittle features. In conjunction with a gently north-northeast-plunging extension lineation, such data indicate oblique east-side-up dextral movement across the shear zone. However, preexisting structures in country rock protoliths rotate into the shear zone in a sense contrary to that predicted by ideal dextral simple shear, a feature thought to reflect significant flattening across the shear zone. Other ductile to brittle fabric elements in the mylonites are consistent with general noncoaxial strain, rather than ideal simple shear. Amount of displacement cannot be measured but indirect estimates suggest approximately 40 +/- 20 km. The Needle Falls Shear Zone is too small and has developed too late in regional tectonic history to be considered a crustal suture. Rather, it is interpreted as either a late-tectonic oblique collisional structure or as the result of counterclockwise oroclinal rotation of the southern part of the orogen.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				JUL	1993	30	7					1338	1354		10.1139/e93-115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e93-115													WOS:A1993MC95500005

Thus an improved understanding of the long-terminfluences of climatic and anthropogenic disturbances is necessary for the management of lake ecosystems. In order to address these issues, a sedimentary record was obtained from Lake Yilong in Yunnan Province in southwestern China, where the climate and natural environment are dominated by the Indian Summer Monsoon and there is a long history of human occupation and intensive human activity. The chronology is based on AMS C-14 dates from 13 samples of plant macrofossils and charcoal, which show that the record spans the last similar to 12,000 yr. Geochemical indices were used to reconstruct hydroclimatic variations and lake ecosystem responses. The results indicate that a cold and humid climate prevailed from the late Pleistocene to the beginning of the Holocene, which was interrupted by an abrupt decrease in precipitation during 9.7-8.7 ka (1 ka= 1000 cal yr BP, corresponding to the 9.3 ka event). A persistent drying trend occurred during the middle and late Holocene, and there was an increase in the intensity of human activity during the past 1500 years. A comparison of the effects of a natural climatic event and human disturbance reveals contrasting lake ecosystem responses. The lake ecosystem was resilient to the 9.3 ka event and subsequently recovered; however, long-term human activity in the watershed, including deforestation and cultivation, reduced the stability of the lake ecosystem and positive feedback effects were strengthened, leading to the deviation of the system far from its previous stable state. It is concluded that, compared to climate change, human activities have had a much more serious impact on lake ecosystem. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

METHODS OF LONG-TERM FORECAST OF THE SIDE INFLOW INTO THE RESERVOIR OF THE BOGUCHANSKAYA HPP ON THE ANGARA RIVER	TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL												Angara is the largest inflow of the Yenisei, a unique river of our country. Its main distinctive feature is the natural overregulation of the river drain of Lake Baikal. This circumstance, as well as favorable topographical and ecological conditions, leads to a fact that the cascade of the hydroelectric power station on the Angara is one of the most effective in Russia by technical and economic indicators. The article investigates the factors influencing the drain of high spring water and develops the method of long-term forecast. The Chadobets and the Mura rivers are used as basins-analogs. The Chadobets characterizes the right-bank territory of the Boguchansky reservoir, the Mura its left-bank. These rivers were used for the calculation of a daily lateral inflow of water into the Boguchansky reservoir which is connected with the drain of thawed snow of the rivers-analogs (the coefficient of correlation is 0.891). Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method of spring drain forecast of the rivers for long-term forecast of water inflow into the Boguchansky reservoir. The method of the forecast is based on the infiltration and capacitor model of absorption of water by a reservoir (E.G. Popov, D.A. Burakov). In this model, indirect indicators of water penetration into the soil before the snowmelt are various characteristics of the pre-spring condition of the river basin. Their selection is made in the following ways: 1) on the basis of pair correlation of the drain of thawed snow (Y) with various indicators of pre-spring moistening and frost penetration in the reservoir; 2) by calculation of coefficients of multiple linear correlation of the drain of thawed snow and the factors determining it (water-supplies in the snow cover, rainfall during the snowmelt and various indirect indicators of water penetration into the frozen soil); 3) by optimization of parameters of nonlinear approximation of the water-balance dependence for the forecast of the drain of thawed snow following from the infiltration and capacitor model. The analysis showed that the best characteristics of water penetration into the reservoir are consumption of the water of the rivers-analogs for November and temperature of the soil at a depth of 0.2 m. The optimization parameters of the infiltration-capacitive model give equations for the forecast of the melted water runoff of the rivers-analogues, which is closely associated with the lateral inflow into the reservoir of the Boguchanskaya HPP. The rating scale adopted in hydrological forecasts characterizes the forecast of the lateral inflow into the reservoir of the Boguchanskaya HPP as "good".

J	Muylaert, K; Sabbe, K				Muylaert, K; Sabbe, K			Spring phytoplankton assemblages in and around the maximum turbidity zone of the estuaries of the Elbe (Germany), the Schelde (Belgium/The Netherlands) and the Gironde (France)	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												In spring 1993 phytoplankton samples were taken along the longitudinal salinity gradient of the estuaries of the Elbe, Schelde and Gironde. A minimum in phytoplankton abundance, biomass and diversity was observed in the inner to upper reaches of all estuaries, suggesting massive mortality in these zones. Due to a combination of high turbidity and high river runoff, phytoplankton of the Gironde estuary differed in species composition and had lower cell abundancies and biomass compared with Elbe and Schelde. Phytoplankton structure and biomass of the polyhaline reaches of the Elbe and Schelde were quite comparable. They were characterized by the diatoms Skeltonema costatum and several Thalassiosira spp. and most probably developed in situ. The presence of tychoplanktonic species in these reaches indicates exchange with the intertidal flats. On the other hand, some marked differences were observed in the upper and tidal freshwater reaches of these two estuaries. In the oligohaline Schelde stations, phytoplankton populations were dominated by the diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana. The diatom Stephanodiscus hantzschii was dominant in the limnetic stations of the Elbe estuary. Despite the unfavourable light climate, the presence of the halophilous. diatom C. meneghiniana in the Schelde estuary might indicate in situ development of phytoplankton populations. This could be attributed to the high residence time and the absence of grazers due to oxygen stress. In the Elbe, river runoff is too high (at least in spring) to permit in situ development of phytoplankton in the upper and freshwater tidal reaches. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

A landscape ecosystem approach was used to distinguish low- and high-elevation segments of the landscape, as well as 11 local ecosystem types. The ecosystems were distinguished by physiography, microclimate, soil, and vegetation. The early occurrence of the warblers was strongly related to landscape structure, i.e., to the broad low- and high-elevation areas and the local ecosystem types within them. Territories of male warblers were observed in 5 of the 11 ecosystems. The five ecosystem types where warblers were observed were characterized by (1) a physiography of level or rolling terrain; (2) soil series of Grayling, Graycalm, Montcalm, or Rubicon; (3) uplands with relatively warm temperature during the breeding season; (4) vegetation dominated by low sweet blueberry, bearberry, wintergreen, northern pin oak, blue stem grasses, and hair cap moss; and (5) canopy of relatively tall, dense, and patchy jack pine and oak. Landscape structure appears to be an important factor affecting the occurrence of the warbler in its summer habitat in northern Lower Michigan.

Shorebird Response to Post-Flood Drawdowns on Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Mudflats are important stopover sites for shorebirds during migration, but management plans typically do not provide mudflat habitat in the reservoirs of the Tennessee River Valley (TRV) during May-July. In May 2010, flooding delayed drawdowns on Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge and created wetlands for shorebirds from May-August. We studied wetland use and behavior of shorebirds during delayed drawdowns in 2010, and we compared shorebird abundance between years with delayed and typical drawdowns using International Shorebird Survey data. We found that shorebirds consistently used wetlands for foraging throughout summer during 20110. In addition, abundance of 43% of species tested was greater in years with delayed than typical drawdowns. Our results suggest extending availability of mudflats throughout summer in the TRV may provide important habitat for migrating shorebirds.

Diurnal changes in the photoinhibition of Microcystis cells incubated immediately below the surface in clear bottles for 30 min and in situ samples under natural conditions were measured. At solar noon during the three days, the mean values of maximum quantum yield (F (v)/F (m)) and effective quantum yield (Delta F/F (m)') for unicellular cells (F (v)/F (m) = 0.15, Delta F/F (m)' = 0.10) were lower than those for colonial cells (F (v)/F (m) = 0.25, Delta F/F (m)' = 0.15). For in situ samples, the values of F (v)/F (m) and Delta F/F (m)' for colonial cells at solar noon on the three days (F (v)/F (m) 0.30, 0.25, 0.29; Delta F/F (m)' 0.24, 0.21, 0.22) were also higher than those of unicellular cells (F (v)/F (m) 0.26, 0.18, 0.25; Delta F/F (m)' 0.15, 0.11, 0.14).

Methods: Fourteen young healthy adult Caucasian subjects were studied at sea-level rest and then after >150-minute exposure to acute normobaric hypoxia (NH) equivalent to 4800 m and again at sea-level rest at 2 hours post-NH exposure. Cardiac function, using transthoracic echocardiography, physiological variables, and Lake Louise Scores for acute mountain sickness (AMS) were collected. Results: All subjects completed the study, and there was an equal balance of men (n = 7) and women (n = 7) who were well matched for age (25.9 +/- 3.2 vs. 27.3 +/- 4.4; p = 0.51). NH exposure led to a significant increase in AMS scores and heart rate, as well as a fall in oxygen saturation, systolic blood pressure, and stroke volume. Stroke volumes and cardiac output were overall significantly higher in men than in women, and acute NH heart rate was higher in women (80.3 +/- 10.2 vs. 69.7 +/- 10.7/min; p < 0.05). NH led to a significant fall in the estimated left ventricular filling pressure (E/E'), an increase in the septal A' and S' and septal and lateral isovolumic contractile velocities (ICVs), and a fall in the E' A' S' ratio. The mitral E, lateral ICV, and E' velocities were all higher in men. Acute NH led to a significant increase in right ventricular systolic pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. There was no interaction between NH exposure and sex for any parameters measured. Conclusion: Despite several baseline differences between men and women, the cardiopulmonary effects of acute NH are consistent between men and women.																			1527-0297	1557-8682				JUN	2016	17	2					108	115		10.1089/ham.2015.0114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ham.2015.0114								27008376					WOS:000378044900008

The physical functioning of such systems is usually only inferred by hydrodynamical and environmental tracer data, whose interpretation often relies on invalidated assumptions. The new approach is a way for experimentally validating or complementing the classical approaches. The lake of Fontaine de Rivire is an auxiliary karst system in the Frasnian limestones of the Ourthe Valley in Belgium. Its particular confinement was studied by conjunctional use of natural responses and single-point dilution tracer test, with an injection of 41 g of uranine on 22 March 2017. The tracer test was monitored during one year using fluorometers, water and charcoal samplings at five points in the lake and six points at the surface (no connection having been established outside). A slow flow (in the order of magnitude of 1 m/h) of the lake could be observed and some mixing processes identified. The dilution of the tracer along the year indicates an average discharge of only 0.16 l/s. This low discharge is compatible with the high confinement of the lake also proved by its high homogeneity and stability (temperature and conductivity). However, the level fluctuations are apparently not compatible with this renewal, and especially with the low rate of dilution of the tracer observed during winter in the lake. This can thus be explained by pressure transfers from the surroundings, without necessarily high fluxes of water. The delays for the responses have also been quantified by cross-correlations for the whole period of monitoring from 2007 to 2018.																			2511-2066	2511-2082	978-3-030-14015-1; 978-3-030-14014-4				2020							173	182		10.1007/978-3-030-14015-1_20	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-14015-1_20													WOS:001054815800020

Based on a total number of 4500 samples, trophic state ranges are proposed and related to intervals of each parameter. The strong correlation between the average values and maximum values during the summer period enables reliable average values to be used for predicting the worst possible summer situation, a situation that is of special interest to the public but hard to define with a normal, low frequency sampling program. Determinations of whether N or P is the most growth-limiting nutrient based on the ratio between the elements may be misleading if the trophic state of the lake water is not considered.																			0003-9136						1980	89	1-2					189	207																WOS:A1980KA38500013

Results indicate that the Saiyong Co basin was a marshy environment with sparse vegetation cover from 21.3 to 6.6 cal. ka BP, before becoming a lake. Highest water level is inferred for 3.9-3.4 cal. ka BP followed by a gradual drying up until 100 years ago. Since then, the lake level has begun to rise again. Pollen spectra are dominated by Artemisia, Poaceae and Cyperaceae, and vegetation changes are mainly reflected by changes in the proportion of these three taxa, especially Artemisia and Cyperaceae. Two major events occurred at 3.9 cal. ka BP and 1.2 cal. ka BP, in response to climate change. Our results also reveal that lake-level changes affect the interpretation of the pollen assemblages due to the relationship between lake size and the pollen source area. Local pollen became the dominant component in pollen assemblages at 0.6 cal. ka BP when the lake level fell to below a certain depth. A higher percentage of Cyperaceae marks the lake's retreat and reflects the local vegetation around Saiyong Co during 0.6 to similar to 0.1 cal. ka BP. In the last 100 years, a high value of Cyperaceae is linked to a wetter climate with no obvious evidence for human activities. Our results have important implications for the interpretation of fossil pollen assemblages from small lakes as the size of the lake through its history also needs to be known to prevent erroneous interpretations of the pollen data.					; hou, xiaohuan/HJB-1484-2022; Cao, Xianyong/L-7168-2019	Cao, Xianyong/0000-0001-5633-2256; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUN	2022	32	6					543	553	09596836221080763	10.1177/09596836221080763	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836221080763		MAR 2022											WOS:000768421400001

A.			Cold-Adapted Protein Kinases and Thylakoid Remodeling Impact Energy Distribution in an Antarctic Psychrophile	PLANT PHYSIOLOGY												The Antarctic psychrophile Chlamydomonas sp. UWO241 evolved in a permanently ice-covered lake whose aquatic environment is characterized not only by constant low temperature and high salt but also by low light during the austral summer coupled with 6 months of complete darkness during the austral winter. Since the UWO241 genome indicated the presence of Stt7 and Stl1 protein kinases, we examined protein phosphorylation and the state transition phenomenon in this psychrophile. Light-dependent [gamma-P-33] ATP labeling of thylakoid membranes from Chlamydomonas sp. UWO241 exhibited a distinct low temperature-dependent phosphorylation pattern compared to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii despite comparable levels of the Stt7 protein kinase. The sequence and structure of the UWO241 Stt7 kinase domain exhibits substantial alterations, which we suggest predisposes it to be more active at low temperature. Comparative purification of PSII and PSI combined with digitonin fractionation of thylakoid membranes indicated that UWO241 altered its thylakoid membrane architecture and reorganized the distribution of PSI and PSII units between granal and stromal lamellae. Although UWO241 grown at low salt and low temperature exhibited comparable thylakoid membrane appression to that of C. reinhardtii at its optimal growth condition, UWO241 grown under its natural condition of high salt resulted in swelling of the thylakoid lumen. This was associated with an upregulation of PSI cyclic electron flow by 50% compared to growth at low salt. Due to the unique 77K fluorescence emission spectra of intact UWO241 cells, deconvolution was necessary to detect enhancement in energy distribution between PSII and PSI, which was sensitive to the redox state of the plastoquinone pool and to the NaCl concentrations of the growth medium. We conclude that a reorganization of PSII and PSI in UWO241 results in a unique state transition phenomenon that is associated with altered protein phosphorylation and enhanced PSI cyclic electron flow. These data are discussed with respect to a possible PSII-PSI energy spillover mechanism that regulates photosystem energy partitioning and quenching.

Therefore, this matter is receiving increasing attention. A typical arid area with a fragile ecological environment and frequent dust activities, Xinjiang, China, was investigated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily aerosol optical thickness and angstrom ngstro center dot m wavelength exponent data to obtain the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of longterm dust aerosols over 20 years. The frequency of occurrence was calculated to accurately identify anthropogenic and natural sources, and data, such as wind speed, were superimposed to quantitatively estimate dust aerosol emissions. The factors that influenced dust aerosol emissions are discussed. The results show that the distribution of dust aerosols in South and North Xinjiang is obviously different, and the average dust aerosol optical depth (DOD) in spring is higher than that in other seasons. The sources of natural dust have little variation and are primarily located in Lop Nur, on the edges of the Taklamakan and Gurbantunggut deserts, in the central Tuha Basin, and in dried-up lakes. The sources of anthropogenic dust are mainly distributed in the farmland areas of the oasis plain and the impact fan plain. Natural dust aerosols are dominant in Xinjiang, with high natural dust emissions in spring. Changes in anthropogenic dust aerosols are caused by production activities, and the annual average anthropogenic dust emissions account for 8% of the total dust emissions. Precipitation can promote a reduction in natural dust emissions. Topography has an obvious effect on the formation and transportation of dust aerosols, which manifests as the frequent occurrence of dust in the basin. The population density data and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) nighttime light data reveal, that the intensity of human activities has a great impact on anthropogenic dust aerosols. This study provides support for research on how aerosols affect climate and environmental changes in Xinjiang.					; Ge, Xiangyu/AFB-6602-2022; qingling, bao/GPW-9450-2022	Ge, Xiangyu/0000-0001-7855-6525; Ding, Jianli/0000-0001-9329-9424; 													1352-2310	1873-2844				OCT 1	2021	262								118651	10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.118651	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2021.118651		AUG 2021											WOS:000686896900003

Environmental and Endogenous Factors Influencing Emigration in Juvenile Anadromous Alewives	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We analyzed migration of juvenile anadromous alewives Alosa pseudoharengus at Bride Lake, a coastal lake in Connecticut, during summer 2006 and found that migration on 24-h and seasonal time scales was influenced by conditions of the environment and characteristics of the individual fish. To identify environmental cues of juvenile migration, we continuously video-recorded fish at the lake outflow and employed information-theoretic model selection to identify the best predictors of daily migration rate. More than 80% of the approximately 320,000 juvenile alewives that migrated from mid-June to mid-August departed in three pulses lasting 1 or 2 d. Pulses of migration were associated with precipitation events, transient decreases in water temperature, and transient increases in stream discharge. Diel timing of migration shifted over the summer. Early in the season, most migration occurred around dawn; late in the season, migration occurred at night. To identify individual characteristics associated with migratory behavior, we compared migrating juveniles collected as they were exiting Bride Lake with nonmigrating juveniles collected from the center of the lake. Migrants were a nonrandom subset of the population; they were on average 1-12 mm larger, were 2-14 d older, had grown more rapidly (11% greater length at age), and were in better condition (14% greater mass at length) than nonmigrant fish. We infer that the amount of accumulated energy has a positive effect on the net benefit of migration at any time in the migratory season.

J	Wynn-Williams, DD; Edwards, HGM; Garcia-Pichel, F				Wynn-Williams, DD; Edwards, HGM; Garcia-Pichel, F			Functional biomolecules of Antarctic stromatolitic and endolithic cyanobacterial communities	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												For activity and survival in extreme terrestrial Antarctic habitats, lithobiontic cyanobacteria depend on key biomolecules for protection against environmental stress and for optimization of growth conditions. Their ability to synthesize such molecules is central to their pioneering characteristics and major role as primary producers in Antarctic desert habitats. Pigmentation is especially important in protecting them against enhanced UVB damage during stratospheric ozone depletion (the Ozone Hole) during the Antarctic spring and subsequent photoinhibition in the intense insolation of the summer. To be effective, especially for the screening of highly shade-adapted photosystems of cyanobacteria, protective pigments need to be located strategically. Antarctic lithic cyanobacterial communities are therefore stratified, as in soil biofilms of Alexander Island, the benthic stromatolitic mars of ice-covered hypersaline lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, and the endolithic communities within translucent Beacon sandstone outcrops of Victoria Land. The protective pigments include scytonemin, carotenoids, anthroquinones and mycosporine-like amino acids. To detect and locate photoprotective pigments in situ in free-living cyanobacteria and cyanolichens from hot and cold desert habitats, we have used Fourier-transform Raman microspectroscopy. With appropriate power inputs for labile molecules, this high-precision, non-intrusive laser-based technique can not only identify biomolecules in their natural state but also locate them spatially within the habitat relative to the components of the community, which require protection In conjunction with direct and epifluorescence microscopy it provides a spatial and functional description of the protective strategy of a community. We present the unique Raman spectrum of scytonemin and use its primary and corroborative peaks to identify it within the plethora of other biochemical constituents of several natural cyanobacterial communities, including an Antarctic endolith. The remote-sensing aspect of this technique makes it suitable not only for spatial biochemical analysis of present and palaeontological Antarctic communities but also for analogous putative habitats on Mars.																			0967-0262					OCT	1999	34	4					381	391		10.1017/S0967026299002309	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0967026299002309													WOS:000083751200007

Lawrence			Great Basin hydrology, paleoclimate, and connections with the North Atlantic: A speleothem stable isotope and trace element record from Lehman Caves, NV	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We present a record of speleothem stable isotope (delta O-18, delta C-13) and trace element (Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca) variations from Lehman Caves, Nevada for an interval of time (139-128 ka) that encompasses the penultimate glacial termination, Termination II (T-II). Additional growth phases provide data from about 123 ka, a time that correlates with Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e, and about 84 ka and between 82 and 81 ka (MIS 5a). Chronologies from two new stalagmites are anchored by thirty-six uranium thorium dates. We also present new trace element data from stalagmite LC-2, which has a previously published uranium thorium chronology and stable isotope record of T-II (Shakun et al., 2011). Our T-II delta O-18 record broadly replicates that of the Shakun et al. (2011) and Lachniet et al. (2014) records of this time, recording low values from 139 to 135 ka followed by an approximately 3.5 parts per thousand increase over an extended interval between 134 and 129 ka. This rise in delta O-18 values occurs during Heinrich Stadial 11 and the associated Weak Monsoon Interval observed in Chinese caves; our record broadly follows the marine termination, rising boreal summer insolation, and the rise in atmospheric CO2. We infer that this shift results from temperature increase due to increasing atmospheric CO2 and potentially a change in moisture source or precipitation seasonality from greater influence of the North American Monsoon accompanying summer insolation increase. It is also plausible that the melting of the ice sheet itself may have contributed to both temperature and precipitation seasonality changes. Trace element ratios and delta C-13 values are largely decoupled from delta O-18 values, showing minimal variation between 139 and 130 ka, for the duration of the Chinese Weak Monsoon Interval. However, these values increase sharply between 130 and 128 ka, which we interpret as increased prior calcite precipitation driven by a transition from wet to dry conditions. This abrupt drying event coincides within dating uncertainties with the abrupt strengthening of the East Asian summer monsoon, which marks the end of both the Weak Monsoon Interval and Heinrich Stadial 11. Our records demonstrate a link between North Atlantic climate and Great Basin moisture during this time that is consistent with the interpretation of data from the last glacial period and may result from abrupt shifts in Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation affecting the strength of the Aleutian Low.

J	Harvey, FE; Welker, JM				Harvey, FE; Welker, JM			Stable isotopic composition of precipitation in the semi-arid north-central portion of the US Great Plains	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Where data are available, hydrologic studies may use stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes to investigate, groundwater/ surface water interaction, groundwater recharge and advective/diffusive transport, to estimate groundwater ages or to unravel paleohydrology. Such studies require that the isotopic composition of precipitation be known, as precipitation is a major input to groundwater and surface water systems. Oxygen-18 (delta O-18) and deuterium (delta H-2) data for precipitation are lacking for the semi-arid portion of the north-central Great Plains of the US, and thus there is need to establish additional meteoric water lines as isotope input functions across the region, as well as to develop better understanding of the isotopic climate linkages that control oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios in precipitation. This study examines the delta O-18 and delta H-2 composition of precipitation for a representative site near North Platte, Nebraska in the semi-arid north-central Great Plains during the years 1989 through 1994. Oxygen-18 values range from -30.5 to +1.7 parts per thousand. Deuterium values range from -228 to +11 parts per thousand. Yearly arithmetic mean values for the North Platte station are -9.8 and -71 parts per thousand, respectively. Weighted yearly means for delta O-18 and delta H-2 over the 6-year period were -9.6 and - 69 parts per thousand, respectively. North Platte values show a strong isotopic enrichment between winter and summer precipitation, and a strong delta O-18-T correlation r(2) = 0.845 for mean monthly values of 0.54 parts per thousand per degree Celsius. The local meteoric water line for the site is delta H-2 = 7.66 delta O-18 + 4.96. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

NATURAL HISTORY OF CHLAENIUS CORDICOLLIS KIRBY (COLEOPTERA: CARABIDAE) ON BEACHES OF LAKE WINNIPEG, MANITOBA, CANADA	COLEOPTERISTS BULLETIN												Observational and experimental natural history studies were carried out on Chlaenius cordicollis Kirby (Coleoptera: Carabidae) from beaches with limestone slabs (mostly 10-100 cm in diameter) on Hecla Island in Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Adult beetles moved down the beaches from overwintering sites in May, and in response to photoperiodic cues, females were gravid in June and July. Larval numbers peaked in early July and teneral adults in late August. At 21 degrees C, development from oviposition through three larval instars to adult eclosion took 44 days. Larvae were observed feeding on the remains of Ephemeroptera that had washed ashore and on Diptera larvae feeding on the remains. From mid-May until early September, guts of adult beetles contained insect fragments, primarily Chironomidae (Diptera) and Ephemeroptera. Outside this period, adult guts contained no solids and most were empty. In September, adults moved up beaches to overwintering sites, even though temperatures were similar to those during the down-beach movement of May. In fall, beetles aggregated in sites in gravel or shingle where leaf litter had accumulated; in these sites, snow accumulated in winter and temperatures in aggregations remained close to 0 degrees C-essential for survival of the adults. Survival of cold-adapted adults was jeopardized at temperatures of-5 degrees C or-9 degrees C, depending on the rate of cooling. Beetles became less agile at temperatures <= +5 degrees C; at <= +10 degrees C walking speed was negatively related to temperature. Hence, the normal up-slope movement in response to inundation could be impaired at temperatures experienced in September, atime when wind-driven, rapid increases in lake levels frequently occur.																			0010-065X	1938-4394				JUN	2025	79	2					215	231		10.1649/0010-065X-79.2.215	http://dx.doi.org/10.1649/0010-065X-79.2.215													WOS:001521683700011

In this study, we first delineated the hydroclimatic changes at both regional and local scales within and around the lower Yellow River floodplain and then examined the relationships of human settlements with hydroclimatic settings between the pre-Longshan and Longshan periods. The results indicate that the site distribution, site density and hydroclimatic conditions exhibited significant shifts during the pre-Longshan and Longshan periods. In the pre-Longshan period, the intense East Asian summer monsoon and abundant monsoon-related precipitation caused widespread development of lakes and marshes in the lower Yellow River floodplain. As a result, the circumjacent highlands of the lower Yellow River floodplain contained concentrated human settlements. However, the persistent weakening of the East Asian summer monsoon and consequent precipitation decline, in conjunction with accelerated soil erosion due to decreasing forest vegetation and strengthening of human activities on the upstream Loess Plateau in the Longshan period, are likely to have jointly caused both shrinking and faster filling of preexisting lakes and marshes. Subsequently, a large area of arable land had been created in the lower Yellow River floodplain and thus was occupied by locally rapid increasing population, resulting in the notable spatial expansion of human settlements during the Longshan period.					jin, rui/KHW-6854-2024; Wu, Li/E-3821-2013; Gao, Wenhua/HJH-2671-2023	Wu, Li/0000-0003-2578-2769; Gao, Wenhua/0000-0002-5507-220X														2073-445X				JUL	2021	10	7							712	10.3390/land10070712	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land10070712													WOS:000679163100001

Through an appropriate sampling strategy an area of 13297 Km(2) with a population density of 330 persons/Km(2) was studied. 40 Wells, 20 hand pumps and 30 major springs were selected for measuring 30 in situ and laboratory water quality parameters over a period of 4 years providing base line data on underground water source of Kashmir. The study also encompasses seasonal variations over hydrological cycles and effect of anthropogenic activity. The results indicate the presence of major nutrients (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) within WHO thresholds and of trace metal presence of Fe2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Co2+; Cd and Pb show elevated amounts irrespective of seasonal changes or dilution by precipitation. This is a cause of concern endangering the fragile ecosystem of this area. Human activity is also aggravating it.

Effect of Under-Ice Light Intensity and Convective Mixing on Chlorophyll a Distribution in a Small Mesotrophic Lake	WATER RESOURCES												Data of long-term measurements of under-ice solar radiation, water temperature, and chlorophyll a are analyzed in four phytoplankton groups (green, diatoms, blue-green, and cryptophyte algae) in a small mesotrophic Vendyurskoe Lake (Karelia) in the period of spring under-ice convection. It is shown that, after thawing away of snow cover from lake surface, under-ice illumination increases, water temperature rises, the depth of convectively mixed layer (CML) increases, and microalga photosynthesis intensifies. In the daytime, chlorophyll a extremums appear in the CML, and, unlike the homogeneous characteristics (water electric conductivity, mineralization, etc.), the cells of different phytoplankton species can be used as tracers in studying convective mixing. A prognostic equation is obtained, reflecting an inverse dependence of the coefficients of variation of chlorophyll a concentration in CML on solar radiation fluxes, penetrating under ice bottom surface. A direct relationship was shown to exist between the increase in chlorophyll concentration in CML and its thickness.					; Zdorovennova, Galina/L-8214-2013; Zdorovennov, Roman/L-8294-2013; Efremova, Tatiana/M-1943-2013; Palshin, Nikolay/L-8634-2013; Terzhevik, Arkady/L-7911-2013	Palshin, Nikolay/0000-0003-1540-3788; Zdorovennova, Galina/0000-0003-2726-0104; Zdorovennov, Roman/0000-0003-1695-4872; Efremova, Tatiana/0000-0003-0313-6731; 													0097-8078	1608-344X				MAY	2019	46	3					384	394		10.1134/S0097807819030175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807819030175													WOS:000470255900007
J	Lee, HY				Lee, Haiyan			The Ruins of Yuanmingyuan Or, How to Enjoy a National Wound	MODERN CHINA												Yuanmingyuan (Garden of Perfect Brightness), or the Old Summer Palace, was once a massive complex of gardens, pavilions, lakes, hills, and pleasure grounds. After it was looted and burnt down by Anglo-French troops in 1860, it commenced a long "afterlife" as a site of farmsteads, factories, school campuses, a bohemian colony, and a public park. This article explores the politics of spatial configuration and signification, or "the relations of proximity," in the present-day Ruins Park by revisiting the debates of the 1990s surrounding restoration/development issues, the disquiet over the xiyanglou ruins in literary and visual representations, and a more recent environmental controversy that has brought a new political life to the park. Analytically, the author proposes to read the park as a heterotopia of multiple emplacements: ruinscape, gardenscape, Disneyscape, and civicscape. As such, the park is a spatial metaphor of contemporary China and a schooling ground for the art of socialist neoliberal citizenship.																			0097-7004	1552-6836				MAR	2009	35	2					155	190		10.1177/0097700408326911	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0097700408326911													WOS:000263364100002

F.; Helseth, Christina M.; Weyers, Sharon; Papanicolaou, Thanos; Busche, Dennis			The LTAR Cropland Common Experiment at Upper Mississippi River Basin-Morris	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY												The Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) watershed is hydrologically complex, with a notable temperature and precipitation gradient across four locations: Ames, IA; Platteville, WI; Morris, MN; and St. Paul, MN. Each location established LTAR Croplands Common Experiment (CCE) scenarios to fit local climatic and cultural practices. This paper describes the UMRB-Morris location, which was established in 2016 and is the most northern of the sites and contributes to the major watersheds of the UMRB and the Red River of the North. Both on-farm and plot-scale studies are included. The prevailing system is a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation with annual deep ripping tillage. The signature alternative system is alternative 1, which is a shallow strip-till in a corn-soybean rotation. A second alternative system includes shallow tillage/rotational no-tillage in a corn-soybean-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with winter oilseed and cover crops, and it is considered a test ground for future alternative systems. On-farm fields are equipped with eddy covariance towers and include 16 geo-referenced soil core sampling sites for incremental samplings. Each field is sampled annually for crop yield and management data are recorded. Plot-scale versions of the treatments are managed at the Swan Lake Research Farm. On-farm and plot-scale fields are instrumented with Phenocams to capture continuous photographic records. The CCE at UMRB-Morris aims to integrate soil, crop, weather data, and image classification to assess benefits and challenges across different management strategies. Plain Language Summary The Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network is a group of researchers across the nation. The network's goal is finding solutions to advance agricultural productivity, protect environmental quality, promote human well-being, and respond to a changing climate. Four locations: Ames, IA; Morris, MN; Platteville, WI; and St. Paul, MN, represent the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) research team. The UMRB contributes to the LTAR Croplands Common Experiment, which compares locally prevailing practices to alternative practices. The goal of this paper is to serve as site description of the Morris site (UMRB-Morris), which is the most northern of these four locations with cold, relatively dry winters, and a short growing season. The prevailing (PREV) practice is a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation with annual deep (30 cm) ripping tillage, and the two alternative practices are (1) shallow (5 cm) strip tillage in a corn-soybean rotation (ALT1) and (2) shallow strip tillage or without tillage in a corn, soybean, and wheat rotation with a winter oilseed or other winter cover following wheat. Two local farmers provide access to their fields for monitoring crop growth, water use, and carbon dioxide exchange with advanced technologies/equipment. Soil samples are collected to understand how the practices might alter soil properties. Similar practices are studied at the plot scale on the Swan Lake Research Farm. The information collected is useful to producers interested in the potential benefits of prevailing and alternative practices to meet many demands on American producers.					; Weyers, Sharon/ABA-6454-2020	Weyers, Sharon/0000-0003-3873-7748; Helseth, Christina/0009-0003-9426-8795													0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV	2024	53	6					989	998		10.1002/jeq2.20631	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.20631		SEP 2024						39318120					WOS:001319383600001

Additionally, the extent to which proxies reflect abrupt climatic changes rather than proxy-specific thresholds is unclear. To address these questions, we summarize a 9200-year record from Yilong Lake in Yunnan China using multiple proxies including oxygen and carbon isotopes of authigenic calcite as well as Ti/Al ratio to characterize lake hydrologic balance and catchment erosion, respectively. We compare these results to two other well-studied nearby lakes on the Yunnan Plateau. At all three lakes, the Holocene-scale waning of the ISM is evident, but punctuated by abrupt shifts indicative of lower precipitation and/or greater evaporation at 7900, 5500, and 4500 cal yr B.P. We suggest that a shift to a positive mean-state of the Indian Ocean Dipole lasting multiple centuries can account for these events, with possible moderating influence from El Nin tilde o Southern Oscillation. After 1500 cal yr B.P., Yilong oxygen isotopes shift to less negative values as a result of human manipulation of hydrologic balance, coincident with the deposition of a red clay layer from catchment erosion. These results are similar to other Yunnan lakes although the intensity of anthropogenic management of Yilong's hydrologic bal-ance is substantially smaller than at the other regional lakes. These results underscore the diversity of anthro-pogenic impacts to lakes, even ones that are only a few kilometers apart, and demonstrate spatiotemporal differences in freshwater resource use.

However, to date, the needed long-term precipitation-based isotopic dataset is too limited to predict the interactions and patterns. This paper presents an evaluation of hydrometeorological processes and climate dynamics in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau based on a 7-yr precipitation isotope dataset covering the summer monsoon periods from 2012 to 2018. Results illustrated remarkable seasonal isotopic variability, characterized by lower delta O-18 and delta H-2 values in June with an average of -10 parts per thousand and -66.7 parts per thousand, respectively. Higher delta O-18 and delta H-2 values in July averaged -6.7 parts per thousand and -39.5 parts per thousand, respectively. This clear isotopic variability is largely related to seasonal changes of moisture sources and hydrometeorological processes. These precipitation isotopic values were primarily determined by the amount of precipitation, relative humidity, and convective activity, but showed no correlation with air temperature. Backward trajectory model results showed that Xinjiang, northern China, the Arctic, central Asia, and the South China Sea (SCS) were the primary sources of precipitation for the study site with varying seasonal contributions. The maritime moisture source of the SCS primarily resulted in the lowest precipitation delta O-18 values during the prevailing summer monsoon, which is mainly as a result of the strong convective activity and rainout processes along the air trajectory. The higher average deuterium excess (d-excess) value of precipitation in September indicated continental sources from central Asia (e.g., 75.4%) as land vapor recycling increases d-excess concentration in the atmosphere. These findings provide further insights into the main factors of precipitation isotopic variability related to atmospheric processes along the trajectory and the relevant factors in the monsoon regions. Significance StatementRecently, scientists and policy makers have become aware that Tibetan hydroclimate variability provides evidence of changes in regional and global circulation patterns that may result in the intensification of climate-driven extremes. However, these studies largely depend on crucial paleoclimate records of past precipitation isotopes in monsoon regions, which contain great uncertainties because of the complex relationship between climatic variability and precipitation isotopes. This study first presented a 7-yr isotopic dataset to understand the hydrological processes and climate dynamics controlling the isotopic variability in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The findings reveal important factors on the isotopic variability associated with atmospheric processes and their key climatic variables, which can enhance our interpretation of the paleoclimate records in monsoon regions.

The long-term signal was reconstructed by a procedure based on the anomaly method and consisting in the superimposition of two fields which were computed independently: 1961-1990 monthly climatologies and gridded anomalies. Model accuracy was evaluated by means of station series reconstruction in leave-one-out approach and monthly relative mean absolute errors were found to range between 14% in summer and 24% in winter. Except for the period before the 1870s when station coverage is rather low, reconstruction errors are quite stable. The 1845-2016 monthly areal precipitation series integrated over Adda basin was finally computed. The robustness of this series was evaluated and it was investigated for long-term trend. While no significant trend emerged for precipitation, the analysis performed on 1845-2016 annual runoff values recorded at Lake Como outlet highlighted a negative trend. Runoff decrease is supposed to be mostly due to an increasing role of evapotranspiration linked to temperature increase, which is only partially compensated by the increase in glacier melting rate. In order to test the applicability of the gridded database for the reconstruction of extreme past events, the episode with the highest precipitation in Adda basin series (November 2002) was considered and the corresponding gridded fields of monthly anomalies and precipitation values were evaluated both with actual station density and with station densities corresponding to 1922 and 1882. Even considering 1882 station density, the main spatial patterns are well depicted proving the suitability of anomaly method to deal also with sparse station networks.

In this study, reported delta C-13 data from 76 surface soils in northeast China are compiled, and a delta C-13 record of pyrogenic carbon (delta C-13(pyc)) from Lake Xingkai in northeast China since the last interglacial period is presented. The aim was to investigate the orbital timescale environmental implication of geological delta C-13(pyc) data for northeast China. The results showed a distinct increase in delta C-13 values of surface soils, which correlated with increasing temperature of the warmest month. Higher temperature favored the expansion of C-4 plants, while precipitation had only a weak correlation with delta C-13 values of surface soils in the region. On an orbital timescale, the delta C-13(pyc) record from Lake Xingkai generally reflected paleovegetation change, suggesting that the abundance of C-4 plants was relatively high during the warm periods, changing to almost purely C-3 plants during the cold periods. Both modern and geological analysis suggest that the climatic factor determining the delta C-13 in northeast China was temperature of the warmest month. This is similar to the situation for mid-latitudes such as the Chinese Loess Plateau, in contrast to low latitudes such as southern China. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sun, BW; Li, N; Wang, GY; Gao, XP; Zhou, XS; Kong, FQ				Sun, Bowen; Li, Na; Wang, Guoyu; Gao, Xueping; Zhou, Xushen; Kong, Fanqing			Contribution for lake phytoplankton community succession under multi-source artificial hydrological regulation	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In aquatic ecosystems, phytoplankton, as key primary producers, are extremely sensitive to environmental changes. Artificial hydrological regulation, as a water resource management strategy, affects the water quality and ecological environment of the receiving water area. Particularly under multi-source replenishment conditions, the spatiotemporal nonlinear response of water quality poses a challenge to quantify the contribution of multi-source replenishment to the phytoplankton community succession in large lakes. For example, Baiyangdian Lake (BL) has implemented multi-source artificial hydrological regulation measures, including the diversion of the Yellow River into the BL (Xiaobai River), the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (Baigouyin River) and the replenishment of upstream reservoirs (Xiaoyi River, Bao River and Fu River). Physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton community data were surveyed from 2017 to 2020 in July (summer) and October (autumn). The ecological impacts of artificial hydrological regulation were investigated by quantifying the correlations between physicochemical parameters and phytoplankton communities and by quantifying the contribution of artificial hydrological regulation to key factors. The results show that under the artificial hydrological regulation, the phytoplankton community was still dominated by Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta, but the emergence of Xanthophyta and Chrysophyta indicated that the cleanliness of the water column was improved, and the biodiversity indicators showed a fluctuating upward trend, which suggested that the succession trend was favorable. Ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total phosphorus (TP), and dissolved oxygen (DO) are the key factors affecting phytoplankton community succession in BL. The replenishment sources contribution index (RSCI) was used to characterize the spatiotemporal response of the key factors, and it was found that Fu River has the highest contribution of more than 30%, followed by Xiaoyi River with a contribution of more than 25%. The spatial distribution of RSCI shows that the area with high RSCI values (>0.9) of Fu River accounts for more than 50% of the total area, the area with high RSCI values (>0.9) of Xiaoyi River accounts for more than 35%. Under the comprehensive influence of the RSCI of each replenishment source, the phytoplankton biodiversity index of BL increased from north to south. This study provides basic support for BL in realizing the optimized artificial hydrological regulation strategy and enhancing the ecological restoration benefits in the receiving water area.					li, na/MIK-8798-2025; sun, bowen/HDM-6724-2022; Wang, Guoyu/OEO-5371-2025														0301-4797	1095-8630				DEC	2024	372								123351	10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123351	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.123351		NOV 2024						39550952					WOS:001361434300001
J	Mateo, EI; Daniels, JM				Mateo, Emilio I.; Daniels, J. Michael			Surface hydrological processes of rock glaciated basins in the San Juan Mountains, Colorado	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												Glaciers in the western USA contribute summer meltwater to regional hydrological systems. In the San Juan Mountains of Colorado, where glaciers do not exist, rock glaciers serve that function during the summer runoff period. Most rock glaciers in Colorado are located on northern slopes in mountainous areas; however, some rock glaciers in southwest Colorado have different aspects. In this study, we asked how slope aspect and rising air temperatures influence the hydrological processes of streams sourced from rock glaciers in the San Juan Mountains. We focused on three adjacent basins, Yankee Boy basin, Blue Lakes basin, and Mill Creek basin, which share a common peak, Gilpin Peak. Using HOBO (R) U20-001-04 water-level loggers, streamflow data were collected in each of these basins, below each rock glacier. Air temperature significantly influenced stream discharge below the rock glacier. Discharge and air temperature patterns indicate a possible air temperature threshold during late summer when rock glacier melt increases at a greater rate. The results also suggest that the aspect of rock glacier basins influences stream discharge, but that temperature and precipitation are likely larger components of melt regimes.

This work describes, for the first time, cestodiasis in M. electricus and H. bidorsalis. Corallobothrium solidum and Proteocephalus sp. were identified morphologically and molecularly from M. electricus and H. bidorsalis, respectively. Using PCR, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis, the two cestodes shared rRNA gene sequence similarities yet were unique and the two new sequences for the proteocephalid genera were submitted to the GenBank database. The prevalence of infection was 75% and 40% for the two fish species, respectively. Infections significantly increased in the summer and spring and were higher in female fish than in male fish. The intestine was the preferred site of the two adult cestodes. However, in the case of C. solidum some larval cestodes were found outside the intestine in between the skin and abdominal musculature, attached to the mesentery, and within intestinal tunica muscularis. Desquamation of the intestinal epithelium and inflammation at the site of infection in addition to congestion of the intestinal wall of the tapeworm infected fish were evident, indicating that C. solidum and Proteocephalus sp. impacted the infected fish. The larval stages of C. solidum attempted to penetrate the intestine and sometimes they were encircled within fibrous layers infiltrated with inflammatory cells. The infected fish's musculature was free of cestode infections. Preventive measures should be implemented to prevent the spread of infections.					; Hamouda, Awatef/AAZ-4523-2020; Younis, Abuelhassan Elshazly/A-6835-2019	Hamouda, Awatef/0000-0003-1168-2951; Younis, Abuelhassan Elshazly/0000-0001-7476-9320														1746-6148				MAY 20	2024	20	1							213	10.1186/s12917-024-04048-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-024-04048-1								38769538					WOS:001227844300001

Palaeoclimatic Signatures Based on Pollen Fingerprints: Reconstructing Mid-Late Holocene Climate Dynamics in Northwestern Himalaya, India	QUATERNARY												This study presents a high-resolution palaeoclimate reconstruction based on a radiocarbon-dated 240 cm deep trench profile from Renuka Lake, Northwestern Himalaya, India. The palynological analysis provides insight into the palaeovegetation and palaeoclimatic dynamics of a subtropical, dense, mixed deciduous forest, predominantly characterized by Sal (Shorea robusta). The fossil pollen reveals the presence of tropical Sal mixed deciduous taxa, including Shorea robusta, Emblica officinalis, Murraya koenigii, Toona ciliata, Syzygium cumini, and Terminalia spp., which indicate that the region experiences a warm and humid climate with the strong Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) during similar to 7500-4460 cal yr BP. Subsequently, Sal-mixed deciduous forests were replaced by highland taxa, viz., Pinus roxburghii and Abies pindrow, suggesting dry and cold conditions during similar to 4460-3480 cal yr BP. Additionally, warm and humid (similar to 3480-3240, similar to 3060-2680, similar to 2480-2270 cal yr BP) and cold and dry conditions (similar to 3240-3060, similar to 2680-2480, similar to 2270-1965 cal yr BP) recorded alternatively in this region. Improved ISM prevailed similar to 1965-940 cal yr BP, followed by cold and dry conditions similar to 940-540 cal yr BP. From similar to 540 cal yr BP to present, the appearance of moist deciduous taxa alongside dry deciduous and highland taxa in similar proportions suggests moderate climate conditions in the region. Environmental reconstructions are supported by the Earth System Palaeoclimate Simulation (ESPS) model, providing an independent validation of the pollen-based interpretations.

J	Littlefield, EF; Calvin, WM				Littlefield, Elizabeth F.; Calvin, Wendy M.			Geothermal exploration using imaging spectrometer data over Fish Lake Valley, Nevada	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The U.S. currently leads the world in installed geothermal capacity with power plants in eight states, and exploration for new electrical-grade geothermal systems is ongoing. Geothermal systems at depth may be identified at the surface by hot springs and fumaroles or by minerals produced by thermal fluids (hydrothermal alteration and hot spring deposits). Northern Fish Lake Valley, Nevada hosts two previously known geothermal fields. This study expanded prospects and identified new areas for future exploration within the valley. We demonstrated the potential for using remote sensing data to evaluate regions that are not well explored. We used visible, near, and shortwave infrared (0.4-2.5 mu m) remote sensing data to map surficial mineralogy. Data were collected by three airborne imaging spectrometer instruments, AVIRIS, HyMap, and ProSpecTIR, each over different parts of Fish Lake Valley. Minerals were identified using diagnostic spectral features. We verified remote sensing results in the field using a portable spectrometer to confirm agreement between field and remote spectra. The discovery of additional geothermal resources in Fish Lake Valley may provide the necessary added incentive to build costly transmission lines to this remote location. We used remote sensing data to delineate four new targets for future geothermal exploration in northern Fish Lake Valley. Two new areas of sinter and travertine deposits were identified northwest of the playa, likely deposited around fault-controlled hot springs during the Pleistocene when the water table was higher. Previously undocumented Miocene crystalline travertine was identified within the Emigrant Hills. Argillic alteration was mapped within ranges, where thermal fluids were likely discharged from faults to alter rhyolite tuff. Here we explain our data processing techniques which include a novel decorrelation stretch designed for geothermal prospecting, and discuss how remote sensing results guided our interpretation of the region's geothermal systems.

Phosphorus input by nordic geese to the eutrophic Lake Arendsee, Germany	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Phosphorus import by nordic geese (Anser fabalis and Anser albifrons) was investigated in Lake Arendsee. located in the Saxony-Anhalt region, Altmark. Germany during file peirod 1996 to 1997. Phosphorus contained in geese excrement oil the ice was measured ill the winters 1996 and 1997. In February 1996 (after 9 days of frozen lake Surface) two excrement fields amounted to 80 ha and 30 ha ill area and in January 1997, 10 days after ice Closure. the excrement held was 106 ha large. The weight of excrement was estimated to be 148 to 266 g m(-2) fresh weight (mean 201 g m(-2)) in 1996 and 83 g m(-2) to 408 g m(-2) (mean of 243 g m(-2)) in 1997. The average of phosphorus content was 8.5 mg g(-1) dry weight in 1997 and 9.2 mg(-1) in 1996. Based oil these values the phophorus input attributed to nordic geese was calculated. Our results demonstrated a phosphorus import in 1996 after 9 days of frozen lake surface of 251 kg and in 1997 after 10 days of freezing of 173 kg. During 100 days of wintering, the nordic geese oil Lake Arendsee produced a Phosphorus load of 2.8 t in 1996 and 1.7 t in 1997. Compared with the annual phosphorus import from different Sources, the contribution by nordic geese was 88% in 1996 and 92% in 1997. Its yearly phosphorus load during the winter months appears as a significant eutrophication factor for the trophic level of Lake Arendsee. However. the annual external load is approximately 10% of the phosphorus poolsize in the lake water. and even less when considering the amount lodged in the bottom sediments.

The results indicated a geographical distribution of MFO activity in the Great Lakes corresponding to levels of organic chemical contamination. Lake trout from the industrialized area of western Lake Ontario had a 6 to 62-fold-higher enzyme activity compared to all other sites. A seasonal variation in mixed-function oxidase activity occurred in the two-year study. The AHH activity decreased sharply in the autumn at spawning and increased thereafter. No correlation was found between the sex, age, or size of lake trout and their AHH activities at any location. This field study demonstrated the utility of measuring MFO activity in lake trout for monitoring biologically meaningful levels of polyaromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated hydrocarbons in contaminated environments on the Great Lakes.																			0730-7268	1552-8618					1987	6	9					649	657		10.1897/1552-8618(1987)6[649:HAHHAO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1897/1552-8618(1987)6[649:HAHHAO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1987K176100002
J	Granfors, Q				Granfors, Quinn			Barotrauma related mortality of Florida-strain largemouth bass from winter tournaments in Diamond Valley Lake, California	CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME												Fish captured and retained during fishing tournaments can experience initial or delayed mortality from barotrauma caused by the rapid elimination of hydrostatic pressure that occurs when a fish is brought from depth to the surface. Florida-strain largemouth bass (FLMB), (Micropterus salmoides floridanus) in Diamond Valley Lake, California are vulnerable to barotrauma-related stress when caught, due to their consistent habitation in depths that result in barotrauma (9 to 27 meters; personal observations). Bass tournaments are held on Diamond Valley Lake (DVL) up to 85% of all weekends annually. The small size of the reservoir, large number of tournaments and the vulnerability of FLMB to barotrauma-related stress can potentially affect the fishery. Eight bass tournaments were sampled for the incidence of barotrauma-related symptoms and 36-hour delayed mortality rates of bass with and without physical signs of barotrauma, caught as part of catch-and-release fishing tournaments during winter. The 36-hour delayed mortality rates of manually deflated FLMB with barotrauma were determined to be significantly lower than those that were not deflated following capture in winter tournaments. Florida-strain bass caught in tournaments with physical symptoms of barotrauma were also more likely to die than those asymptomatic. Bass tournament organizations that manually deflate barotrauma afflicted FLMB by knowledgeable and qualified staff would reduce 36-hour mortalities.																			0008-1078					FAL	2013	99	4					165	175																WOS:000343274500002

Are anurans of Great Lakes coastal wetlands reliable indicators of ecological condition?	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Frogs and toads (anurans) are sensitive to a variety of anthropogenic stressors and are widely suggested as indicators of ecological condition. We surveyed 220 coastal wetlands along the U.S. shores of the Laurentian Great Lakes and quantified relationships between presence of anuran species and degree of anthropogenic disturbance. Results were used to derive explicit, functional relationships between environmental condition and anuran occurrences. These functions were subsequently used to calculate a multi-species indicator of ecological condition at other (novel) wetlands. Of 14 anuran species observed, spring peeper (Pseudacris crucifer) exhibited the strongest and most consistent relationship with environmental condition across the entire study area. Other species exhibited significant relationships with the environmental gradient, but the direction of association varied geographically or the overall species abundance was very low (e.g., mink frog, Rana septentrionalis). Even if applied to separate ecological provinces (Laurentian Mixed Forest or Eastern Deciduous Forest), multi-species estimates of wetland condition based on anurans are not much better indicators of environmental condition based on human disturbance than are indices based solely on occurrence of spring peeper. Nevertheless, indicators grounded in explicit relationships with environmental stress are superior to traditional measures (e.g., species richness) that combine species with different responses to the stress gradient. At least one anuran species (spring peeper) can contribute meaningfully to the assessment of ecological condition in Great Lakes coastal wetlands; its value as an indicator will be improved if it can be combined with information from other wetland species such as birds, fishes, and vascular plants.																			0380-1330						2007	33				3		211	223		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[211:AAOGLC]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[211:AAOGLC]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000254896200014
J	Poulain, AJ; Roy, V; Amyot, M				Poulain, Alexandre J.; Roy, Virginie; Amyot, Marc			Influence of temperate mixed and deciduous tree covers on Hg concentrations and photoredox transformations in snow	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Mercury dynamics in snowpacks under forested canopy are currently unknown, even though these snowpacks may represent important Hg pools eventually released towards lakes at snowmelt. We followed Hg distribution and partitioning in snowpacks under different temperate canopy types over space and time, and conducted short-term experiments on Hg redox behaviour in these snowpacks. Hg concentrations were ca. two times higher in snow deposited under coniferous than deciduous canopies; the lowest concentrations were observed in snow over a frozen lake in the same watershed. In snow on the ground, up to 80% of the Hg was bound to particles between 10 and 70 gm. Incubations of snow in situ showed that (i) Hg photoreduction and evasion was significant in open areas (lake surface) but was greatly hampered by light attenuation under winter canopies and (ii) oxidation of newly produced Hg 0 was a significant process in boreal snow, affecting Hg evasion to the atmosphere. We used a mass balance approach to compare Hg pools in snowpacks with wet deposition measured by precipitation collectors. A net gain of Hg was observed in snow under mixed canopies whereas, under a deciduous canopy, the pool of Hg stored at the end of the winter was comparable to that of wet deposition. Snow over lake acted as a winter source of Hg. Whereas most Hg deposited by snow on lakes is lost before snowmelt, Hg deposited on the forested watershed is largely retained in snowpacks, presenting a threat to systems receiving meltwaters.

The breeding birds of Kesonsuo were censused in 1969 (supporting data from 1964-80); the 9.5 km2 area studied was estimated to have about 1400 pairs and 34 species of breeding birds. The waterfowl assemblage is particularly rich (about 340 pairs, with Anas crecca, A. acuta, A. platyrhynchos and Aythya fuligula as dominants). The shorebirds include eight wader species (Philomachus pugnax, , Vanellus vanellus and Numenius arquata as the three most abundant species) and five larids (colonies of Larus ridibundus, L. argentatus and L. canus). The most abundant passerine is Motacilla flava. The birds breeding in an area of 1.7 km2 were censused by the mapping method. The census area represents a sample of the different habitats in Kesonsuo. The species composition and species abundances vary considerably among the habitats, presumably owing to differences in the tree cover (sparsely wooded and open treeless habitats) and in the pool area. Kesonsuo is an important area for migrating birds, because it lies on the flyway of many arctic migrants. The observations of migrants are summarized; they include strikingly many northern waders (e.g. a mass migration of Calidris canutus, and also many resting waders) and unusually many Anthus cervinus. Apart from the northern guests, the species composition of both the breeders and the occasional visitors resembles that of the bird assemblages of eutrophic "bird lakes" in Finland. The assessment of the conservation value of mires is discussed. The following points seem to be particularly relevant: number of breeding species, biomass of the breeding birds, number of endangered species, the migrants and the species of surrounding habitats that use the mire for foraging or as display areas.

The lake-skin-water temperature (LSWT) is an average lake temperature proxy and responds to changes in surroundings, affecting biological and physical lake processes. In this study, M*D11A1 products are used to develop daytime and nighttime LSWT time series for 20 SCSL in South America. The influence of climatic (air temperature, surface net solar radiation, wind speed, and wind direction) and non-climatic (latitude, lake area, perimeter, width, length, and morphology) factors are evaluated from 2001 to 2017. Pearson's coefficients (rho) and auto- and cross-correlations are used to establish the relation between LWST and the selected factors. We identify that the dynamic of LSWT is sensitive to geomorphological factors (latitude and lake width) throughout the year, especially in summer. In winter, the LSTW regime is mainly affected by wind direction (rho = -0.66, p value < 0.01). Linear models are fitted to the temperature series to check the trend changes in the inflection points and the warming or cooling trend for LSWT. Considering the complete series, the maximum warming rate of LSWT is 0.25 <degrees>C per decade (degrees C/dec). The analysis of the identified sub-periods reveals that warming and cooling can occur (significantly) in shorter periods. The average trends within sub-periods for skin temperature-daytime (+/- 0.0105 degrees C/dec), skin temperature-nighttime (0.0041 degrees C/dec), and air temperature (- s0.006 degrees C/dec; 0.007 degrees C/dec) are estimated. Our approach has the potential to be applied in future studies due to the expansion of knowledge about the behavior of SCSL and the understanding of the current and potential effects of climate change in association with physical and geomorphological traits.

Arctic bacteria were isolated from twelve different high Arctic habitats pertaining to active layer permafrost soil, saline spring sediments, lake sediments, and endoliths. This was achieved using (1) the cryo-iPlate, an innovative in situ cultivation device within active layer permafrost soil and (2) bulk plating of Arctic samples by undergraduate students that applied standard culturing methods. To mitigate the possibility of identifying isolates with already-known antibacterial activities, a cell-based dereplication platform was used. Ten out of the twelve Arctic habitats tested were found to yield cold-adapted isolates with antibacterial activity. Eight cold-adapted Arctic isolates were identified with the ability to inhibit the entire dereplication platform, suggesting the possibility of new mechanisms of action. Two promising isolates, initially cultured from perennial saline spring sediments and from active layer permafrost soil (Paenibacillus sp. GHS.8.NWYW.5 and Pseudomonas sp. AALPS.10.MNAAK.13, respectively), displayed antibacterial activity against foodborne and clinically relevant pathogens. Paenibacillus sp. GHS.8.NWYW.5 was capable of inhibiting methicillin resistant and susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA and MSSA), Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli O157:H7. Pseudomonas sp. AALPS.10.MNAAK.13 was observed to have antagonistic activity against MRSA, MSSA, Acinetobacter baumanii, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis. After whole genome sequencing and mining, the genome of Paenibacillus sp. GHS.8.NWYW.5 was found to contain seven putative secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters that displayed low homology (<50% coverage, <30% identity, and e-values > 0) to clusters identified within the genome of the type strain pertaining to the same species. These findings suggest that cold-adapted Arctic microbes may be a promising source of novel secondary metabolites for potential use in both industrial and medical settings.

J	Mattheus, CR				Mattheus, C. R.			Recovery of urban Great Lakes beaches after lake-level rise: The roles of infrastructure, sand supply, and management activities	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Managing beaches along urban waterfront corridors of the North American Great Lakes is challenging, as already complex lacustrine hydro-, littoral sand-supply, and coastal morphodynamics are impacted by shoreline and offshore infrastructure in ways not yet fully understood. This paper addresses the legacy controls of geomorphic developments and changes in sand volume within lakefront embayments, during high decadal base water-level conditions, on subsequent beach-recovery dynamics, during lake-level fall. Showcased are insights from annual topobathymetric assessments from 2021 through 2024, over which time Lake Michigan's base water level fell by similar to 1 m from its 2020 highstand. Data from ongoing geological monitoring activities were supplemented with federal datasets, which provided information on 2012-2020 sand volumetric changes across urban lakefront embayments with similar to 1.5 m of lake-level rise. Beach geomorphic developments with 2020-2024 interannual lake-level fall are shown to have been influenced by the legacy of preceding morphodynamic and sand-sequestration patterns. Unlike the shared lake-level and storm histories, these parameters are beach-specific. While all Chicago beach shorelines retreated and experienced overwash into backshore regions during lake-level rise, shoreline advance and foredune re-establishment with lake-level fall have been influenced by preceding sand volumetric changes. This has implications for coastal managers, who must develop site-specific mitigation plans that take intrinsic controls of lakefront structures and time-varying sand-transport patterns on beach morphodynamics into account. The re-establishment of ecologically important foredune areas within urban beaches is of particular interest, given that the urban lakefront of Chicago has recently hosted nesting pairs of the endangered Great Lakes piping plover.																			0380-1330					AUG	2025	51	4							102603	10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102603	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2025.102603													WOS:001540922200005
J	Das, L; Meher, JK; Dutta, M				Das, Lalu; Meher, Jitendra Kumar; Dutta, Monami			Construction of rainfall change scenarios over the Chilka Lagoon in India	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												The present study attempted to quantify long-term seasonal and annual rainfall change for the period 1901-2004 over the Chilka Lagoon in India, the second largest lagoon in the world using multiple gridded data sources. The future rainfall projection is also constructed using the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) of the Global Circulation Models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). Skill of GCMs to simulate the observed rainfall over the lagoon was investigated through estimation of long-term trends and comparison of mean seasonal cycles using Taylor diagram. Finally based on the combined results obtained through trend analysis as well as seasonal cycles, 12 better performing GCMs were selected. Ensemble mean of better performing GCMs reveal that the rainfall in annual, monsoon and winter seasons have increased in the last century similar to three observational gridded data sources. The projected seasonal cycle of rainfall from different RCPs shows a dipole like characteristics where the drier (winter) and moist (monsoon) seasons show a surplus of rainfall (11-25%) while the premonsoon and the postmonsoon seasons show a deficient rainfall (3-52%) at the end of 21st century. It is interesting to note that the Chilka Lake will expected to receive an increasing amount of annual rainfall by 3-7% in 2020s, 7-11% in 2050s and 10-21% in 2080s. Ensemble mean of future downscaled scenarios revealed that the annual rainfall will increase slightly higher rate as compared to without downscaling indicating high uncertainty in future projection.

J	DEMERS, E; KALFF, J				DEMERS, E; KALFF, J			A SIMPLE-MODEL FOR PREDICTING THE DATE OF SPRING STRATIFICATION IN TEMPERATE AND SUBTROPICAL LAKES	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The date of onset of spring stratification in northern hemisphere lakes is predictable from mean annual air temperature. The prediction is further improved by also considering lake surface area (surrogate of wind exposure) and by the ratio (R) of lake surface area to mean depth, with R reflecting aspects of lake morphometry and heat storage capacity. Mean annual air temperature and R together explain 68% of the variance in the date of onset of stratification in a combined 70-lake data set from North America, Europe, and Asia. Nearly identical fractions were explained when the lakes were separated into dimictic and warm monomictic data sets. The remaining unexplained variation is probably largely attributable to interyear variation in weather, but also to unexamined differences in regional wind strength, local protection from winds, lake shape, and lake turbidity, as well as differences in the intervals at which temperature profiles were taken.																			0024-3590					JUL	1993	38	5					1077	1081		10.4319/lo.1993.38.5.1077	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1993.38.5.1077													WOS:A1993MZ48500017

Framework for incorporating spectral observations into steady state analysis of groundwater discharge around the margins of the Great Artesian Basin	18TH WORLD IMACS CONGRESS AND MODSIM09 INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: INTERFACING MODELLING AND SIMULATION WITH MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCES					IMACS World Congress/Modelling and Simulation Society-of-Australia-and-New-Zealand (MSSANZ)/18th MODSIM09 Biennial Conference on Modelling and Simulation	JUL 13-17, 2009	Cairns, AUSTRALIA	IMACS, MSSANZ, CSIRO, Australian Math Sci Inst, Griffith Univ, eWater Cooperat Res Ctr, Dept Sustainabil & Environm, HEMA Consulting, Hellenic European Res Comp Math & Applicat, Int Council Ind Appl Math, Int Soc Grid Generat (ISGG), Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing (ISPRS), Japan Soc Simulat Technol, Pacific Rim Math Assoc, Rutgers, State Univ New Jersey				Diffuse groundwater discharge (also known as vertical leakage) forms an important and poorly constrained component of the water balance of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB), Australia's largest groundwater resource. Around the south-western margin of the GAB, the diffuse leakage from the artesian aquifer discharges into the unconfined water table and subsequently into the atmosphere via evapotranspiration (ET). Under steady state conditions (i.e. prior to the development of the GAB), the evaporative flux, in addition to natural artesian discharge from springs, are considered to equal the potentiometric head driven flow to the Basin margin. Since 2007, a project has been collecting field data on the evaporative discharge rates using a number of essentially point-based techniques. These techniques involved bare soil evaporation measured by microlysimeters, evapotranspiration measured by an eddy covariance flux station, and long-term evaporative discharge rates through the soil column estimated from soil solute profiles using an advection-diffusion model. Spatial heterogeneity provides a major challenge in utilizing these data for estimating the diffuse groundwater discharge over a large area. In this study we use spectral data from the ASTER, Landsat and Quickbird satellites, in addition to geomorphic mapping and digital elevation data, to characterize discharge zones according to a conceptual framework based on the physical attributes of varying evaporative discharge, in particular the salt content at the surface, soil moisture and thermal properties. The conceptual framework aims to relate subsurface processes, and ultimately rates of diffuse discharge, with their expected surface expressions. The framework classifies discharge areas into zones which represent approximately order of magnitude variations in discharge rates, as defined by their subsurface processes. The field-based estimates of discharge ranges are assigned to the land surface classes according to spatial location and spectral similarities. This method was applied to a study area (Public House Springs) located on the margin of the GAB with the Gammon Ranges in South Australia. An analysis of groundwater flux rates over the study area was conducted to determine if the estimated evaporative discharge and artesian spring discharge rates complied with steady state conditions. Inflow to the model domain was estimated with Darcy's Equation, using measured differences between the artesian head and the artesian spring mean elevation and best estimates of aquifer parameters from other studies of the GAB. This approach provides a framework for both estimating diffuse discharge at large spatial scales and further investigating the effects of uncertainties in the major input data sources.

Based on multi-isotopes of water (2H, 18O and 3H) and dissolved radon (222Rn), the temporal and spatial variabilities of major hydrological processes along the main flow and tributaries in the Nianchu River catchment were examined and the isotopic response to climate variation was identified. Geographic variation in changes of isotopic composition that differ from other rivers in the Nianchu River catchment was apparent. Along the direction of runoff, river 818O exhibited more depletion, which was closely related to water mixing and groundwater discharge. End-member mixing analysis using isotopic tracers suggested that annual recharge from summer rainfall and glacial meltwater maintained the surface water resources (their respective contributions rate were 65.9% and 26.5%); groundwater had a significant contribution on runoff in the dry season (about 46.6%). Summer rainfall and meltwater rapidly infiltrated through a series of faults and fissures and were, stored in underground reservoirs and released to runoff in the dry season, thereby ensuring rapid circulation and renewal of water resources (annual renewal proportion was about 40%). It was concluded that rainfall infiltration, meltwater and groundwater storage play important roles in the hydrology of this alpine-cold catchment. Similar to a general alpine-cold catchment, the stable isotopes (82H, 818O) of river runoff will gradually be enriched, while groundwater reserves will increase in the Nianchu River catchment as a result of climate warming and an acceleration of glacial-melting.

J	STAUFFER, RE				STAUFFER, RE			CYCLING OF MANGANESE AND IRON IN LAKE MENDOTA, WISCONSIN	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												On the basis of field evidence from 1966-1967 and 1977-1979, Delfino''s laboratory studies, and thermodynamic calculations, Mn2+ accumulation in the hypolimnion of Lake Mendota is regulated neither by rhodochrosite equilibrium nor by pH-dependent desorption from hydrous oxides. Instead, the recurring patterns of Mn2+ accumulation are best explained by microstratigraphy and redox shifts in the upper sediments, coupled with seasonally dependent dispersion into the overlying water column. During each summer Mn2+ accumulation in and below the thermocline is equivalent to 2.5-years'' supply from external sources. Because of rapid removal by oxidation accompanying turnover, Mn concentrations are low in the epilimnion and the long-term sediment retention coefficient (RMn) is 0.94. On the basis of mass budget analysis, sedimentology, thermodynamic calculations, and experimental confirmation, the low concentrations of soluble Fe in the hypolimnion in late summer (< 0.04 mg L-1) are the results of FeS equilibrium acting both in the lower water column and in the surface microzone of the sediment. Total Fe in the water column shows little or no systematic seasonal variation; the relatively low and erratic concentrations probably represent recent detrital influxes from the draining basin (average 1-4 weeks supply) and/or the resuspension and focusing of sediments; RFe=0.99.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				MAY	1986	20	5					449	457		10.1021/es00147a002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es00147a002								19994927					WOS:A1986C117800010
J	Pasvanoglu, S; Gültekin, F				Pasvanoglu, Suzan; Gultekin, Fatma			Hydrogeochemical study of the Terme and Karakurt thermal and mineralized waters from Kirsehir Area, central Turkey	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The Terme and Karakurt thermal resorts are located in the center of KirAYehir city in central Anatolia. Thermal waters with temperatures of 44-60A degrees C are used for central heating and balneologic purposes. Paleozoic rocks of the KirAYehir Massif are the oldest units in the study area. The basement of the Massif comprises Paleozoic metamorphic schist and marbles which partly contain white quartzite layers of a few tens of cm thickness. The metamorphic schists which are cut by granites of Paleocene age are overlain by horizontally bedded conglomerate, sandstone, claystone, and limestone of upper Paleocene-Eocene age. Among the thermal and cold waters collected from the areas of Terme and Karakurt, those from thermal waters are enriched with Ca-HCO3 and cold waters are of Ca-Mg-HCO3 type waters. The pH values of samples are 6.31-7.04 for the thermal well waters, 6.41 for thermal spring, 7.25 and 7.29 for the cold waters, and 7.52 for the Hirla lake water. EC values are 917-2,295 mu S/cm for the thermal well waters, 2,078 mu S/cm for thermal spring, and 471 and 820 mu S/cm for the cold springs. The lowest TDS content is from water of T10 thermal well in the Terme area (740.6 mg/l). The hot and cold waters of Terme show very similar ion contents while the Karakurt hot waters at western most parts are characterized by distinct chemical compositions. There is ion exchange in thermal waters from the T5 (5), T6 (6), T12 (7), and T1 (8) wells in the Terme area. The thermal waters show low concentrations of Fe, Mn, Ni, Al, As, Pb, Zn and Cu. Waters in the study area are of meteoric origin, and rainwater percolated downwards through faults and fractures, and are heated by the geothermal gradient, later rising to the surface along permeable zones. delta C-13(VPDB) values measured on dissolved inorganic carbon in samples range from -1.65 to +5.61aEuro degrees for thermal waters and from -11.81 to -10.15aEuro degrees for cold waters. Carbon in thermal waters is derived from marine carbonates or CO2 of metamorphic origin while carbon in cold waters originates from freshwater carbonates.					pasvanoglu, suzan/GXF-0587-2022; Gültekin, Fatma/AAR-4067-2020	pasvanoglu, Suzan/0000-0002-0026-9259; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				MAY	2012	66	1					169	182		10.1007/s12665-011-1217-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-011-1217-3													WOS:000302744100015

Independent data of Cs-137 and Pb-210 indicate that these are annually deposited varves. Varves appear as rhythmic units of light-colored silt layer capped by a dark clay layer under microscope. Varve thickness in Lake Xinluhai is sensitive to precipitation because sediment accumulation is strongly affected by monsoon rainfall in the area. A general decreasing trend can be observed in the varve thickness over the past 160 years. Spectral analyses of the varve record are dominated by cycles which are similar to ENSO periodicities. It implies that the decreasing trend of the South Asia monsoon may be linking with ENSO. Spatially, the decreasing trend can be observed across different proxy records in the south of the Tibetan Plateau. Although arguments still remain for the dynamic mechanisms and spatial rainfall difference, the South Asian summer monsoon could be weakened due to rising temperatures.

The cyanobacterial community is recognized morphologically as being dominated by species belonging to the genera Aphanizomenon, Oscillatoria, Anabaena, and Microcystis. HPLC analyses were performed on phytoplankton samples collected on the lake from July to September 1997. A HPLC peak that had the same retention time as saxitoxin was detected in the sample collected on August 19. In addition, extracts from shellfish and fish tissues showed the same peak. In electrophysiological experiments, extracts of cyanobacteria showed an almost complete inhibition of Na+ channels, the typical biological effect of saxitoxin. The genomic region corresponding to the phycocyanin intergenic spacer of cyanobacteria from the last summer bloom has been characterized by means of a PCR amplification technique.

Habitat structure or cover can affect both of these factors and hares may make foraging decisions that integrate all of these influences. We tested the hypothesis that moonlight would reduce the amount of time hares spent foraging in open clearings far from cover. Our track transects, near Kluane Lake, Yukon, indicated that hares were less active in open areas during moonlit nights compared with dark nights during the new moon. In a large clearing, we offered free ranging hares measured amounts of commercial rabbit food from both control and covered feeders. We measured nightly consumption during both bright and dark phases of the moon and found that hares preferred the covered feeders, but we found no additional effect due to moonlight conditions.

Molecular and isotopic compositions of HMW-DOM are generally far different from those of POM and LMW-DOM. In this study, we further investigate large proportions of 24-ethylcholesta-5,22-dien-3 beta-ol (stigmasterol) in the HMW-DOM (but not in POM and LMW-DOM) during summer in three types of lakes: freshwater Lakes Kizaki and Suwa and a brackish-water Lake Suigetsu, in Japan. Moreover, from the carbon and hydrogen isotope analysis, we reveal autochthonous algae (perhaps some minor, specific phytoplankton) as a major source of the abundant stigmasterol in the lakes. These results suggest that HMW-DOM in summer is derived from autochthonous phytoplankton rather than allochthonous terrestrial plants and that HMW-DOM likely has few interaction (e.g., exchange of components) with POM and DOM in the lakes.

J	Auer, NA; Kahn, JE				Auer, NA; Kahn, JE			Abundance and distribution of benthic invertebrates, with emphasis on Diporeia, along the Keweenaw Peninsula, Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The benthic invertebrate community in Lake Superior is an important component in the fisheries food web. Among the Great Lakes, only Lake Superior contains populations of Diporeia spp. that have not been reduced or extirpated in the last 20 years. The objectives of this study were to determine the abundance and distribution of benthic invertebrates along the Keweenaw coast, and to investigate the reproductive ecology of Diporeia. The benthic community was sampled monthly from 1998 to 2000, using a ponar dredge along three transects with distinctly different bathymetry. Each transect contained shelf, slope, and profundal depth regions. Diporeia was the most abundant invertebrate, accounting for 48% of the invertebrate community, while chironomids composed 21.3%, oligochaetes 18.7%, and sphaeriids 8.4%. Only chironomids showed a statistically significant change in monthly density, being more abundant in September than earlier or later in the year. Diporeia and Sphaeriidae were most densely distributed along the slope, and the distribution of chironomids and oligochaetes was even more specific within the slope region, with peak densities occurring at 50 meters on all three transects. Diporeia reproduced when the water temperature was 4 degrees C or colder. Along the shelf Diporeia released their young in May, whereas in the slope and profundal regions young appeared in June and September, suggesting two periods of reproduction, late spring and summer. In the shelf area Diporeia grew at a faster rate than those offshore. There was a linear correlation between the length of,female Diporeia and the number of eggs carried, similar to what has been shown for the other Great Lakes. The benthic invertebrate community peaks in abundance in the slope region of Lake Superior along the Keweenaw Peninsula. This region may provide important habitat and nutrients for other organisms in the Lake Superior food web.					; Kahn, Jason/S-7300-2019	Kahn, Jason/0000-0001-6426-9189; 													0380-1330						2004	30			1			340	359		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70396-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70396-2													WOS:000227991500024

Holocene temperature and landscape history of southwest Greenland inferred from isotope and geochemical lake sediment proxies	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Terrestrial temperature reconstructions from the ice-free margins of Greenland are critical for constraining the sensitivity of the Greenland ice sheet to past climate change. Numerous investigations have clarified the glacial history of southwest Greenland in recent decades; however, very few local quantitative temperature reconstructions exist as context for changes in the cryosphere. We examine sedimentary records from two lakes south of Nuuk, Greenland (informally named lakes T1 and T2), and investigate millennial scale Holocene climate change using a multi-proxy approach. Changes in X-Ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), delta N-15, delta C-13 and biogenic silica concentrations of bulk lake sediments mark the transition from a marine environment to isolated lakes as relative sea level fell in the early Holocene. delta O-18 values of subfossil insects (chironomids) from lakes T1 and T2 decreased by 2-3 parts per thousand from c. 8.8 ka BP (minimum limiting age for the onset of lacustrine sediment deposition in lake T2; ka BP = thousands of years before 1950) to 1 ka BP. Existing isotope-independent temperature reconstructions from the west coast of Greenland suggest that these changes in delta O-18 values accompanied gradual cooling of 2-4 degrees C, concomitant with decreasing summer insolation. There is widespread regional evidence that this cooling resulted in progressive regrowth of local glaciers and of the ice sheet. The regional consensus on the magnitude of this temperature change indicates that the local, modern modeled temperature - precipitation delta O-18 relationship cannot be used to quantify millennial-scale temperature changes at these sites through the Holocene. This reinforces that studies utilizing delta O-18-based proxies to infer temperature change should carefully assess local isotope-temperature relationships over space and time. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

During the spring sampling period several yellow-sand events characterized by long-range transport from China and Mongolia impacted the area. During these events the mass fluxes were statistically the same as during springtime nonyellow-sand events. However, most elemental fluxes were higher. In general, the flux ratios of both crustal (Al, Ca, Mn) and anthropogenic (Ni, Pb) elements to total mass measured during the daytime yellow-sand events were substantially higher than those measured in spring daytime during nonyellow-sand time periods. During all seasons the average measured daytime fluxes were about two times higher than nighttime fluxes. The flux of primarily anthropogenic metals (Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) and Mn was on average one to two orders of magnitude lower than the flux of the crustal metals Al and Ca. As is typically found, two modes, fine (0.1 similar to 1.0 mum) and coarse (1.0 similar to 10.0 mum) were present in the measured size distributions (< 10 <mu>m). The particles in the coarse mode constitute a major portion of the measured mass size distribution during the yellow-sand events, possibly due to the long-range transport of those particles from China.

Wetlands developed in this hostile region are restricted to spring areas, terraces of shallow lakes or floodplains along rivers, and provide diversified ecosystem services e.g. as water reservoirs, refugia for rare species and pastures for domestic cattle. These ecosystems are particularly susceptible to climate changes, that in the Pamir Mountains result in increased temperatures, intense permafrost/glacial melt and alterations of precipitation patterns. Climatic changes affect pasture management in the mountains, causing overutilization of sites located at lower elevations. Thus, both climate and man-induced disturbances may violate the existing ecological equilibrium in high mountain wetlands of the Eastern Pamir, posing a serious risk to their biodiversity and to food security of the local population. In this context, we sought to assess how environmental drivers (with special focus on soil features and potential water sources) shape the distribution and diversity of halophytic plant communities developed in valleys in the Eastern Pamir. This task was completed by means of a vegetation survey and comprehensive analyses of habitat conditions. The lake terraces and floodplains studied were covered by a repetitive mosaic of plant communities determined by differences in soil moisture and salinity. On lower, wetter sites, this patchwork was formed by Blysmus rufus dominated salt marshes, saline small sedge meadows and saline meadows with Kobresia royleana and Primula pamirica; and on drier, elevated sites, by endemic grasslands with Hordeum brevisubulatum and Puccinellia species and patches of xerohalophytic vegetation. Continuous instability of water sources and summer droughts occurring in the Pamir Mountains may lead to significant structural and functional transformations of described wetland ecosystems. Species more tolerant to decreased soil moisture and/or increased soil salinity will expand, leading to alterations of ecosystem services provided by the Pamirs' wetlands. The described research will help to assess the current state of the wetlands and to predict directions of their future changes.					; Mętrak, Monika/HMO-6034-2023; Suska-Malawska, Małgorzata/AAT-9188-2021	Chachulski, Lukasz/0000-0002-8290-0816; Rojan, Elzbieta/0000-0003-0550-1480; Sulwinski, Marcin/0000-0001-9248-4513; Pawlikowski, Pawel/0000-0002-0656-5067; Metrak, Monika/0000-0002-6069-6041; Suska-Malawska, Malgorzata/0000-0002-5400-9508													1932-6203					MAR 30	2017	12	3							e0174496	10.1371/journal.pone.0174496	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0174496								28358825					WOS:000399174800043
J	Persson, L; Byström, P; Wahlström, E				Persson, L; Byström, P; Wahlström, E			Cannibalism and competition in Eurasian perch:: population dynamics of an ontogenetic omnivore	ECOLOGY												In many cannibalistic populations, cannibals share resources with their victims, leading to a size-dependent mixture of cannibalistic and competitive interactions. We analyze the impacts of such interactions on the population dynamics of Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) by considering effects of intercohort competition, habitat heterogeneity, habitat selection, and energy gain made by cannibals. Over a six-year period, we measured mortality and recruitment patterns, individual growth, body condition, resource levels, diets, and habitat use as functions of density for an allopatric perch population in a low-productivity lake. During the course of the study, two major die-offs took place, selectively affecting larger cannibalistic individuals, followed by several years of successful recruitment of young fish. Habitat use of perch greater than or equal to 2 yr old was density dependent, and these fish used only the inshore region at tow densities. The appearance of young fish followed the die-offs of cannibalistic perch and their subsequent absence from the offshore area, both of which decreased cannibalism on pelagic recruits. Whereas die-offs of larger perch could not be related to competition with young-of-the-year (YOY) perch, evidence for a competitive impact of YOY perch on Age-1 perch was present due to substantial food overlap. A strong depression in pelagic zooplankton was observed during summer in years with strong recruitment, which resulted in reduced consumption of zooplankton, slow growth, and reduced body condition in Age-1 perch and suggested high mortality of Age-1 perch in autumn. Age-1 perch did not appear to profit substantially from cannibalism on YOY perch because of the short time period that they could efficiently prey on YOY perch. The few larger perch that survived the die-offs gained substantial energy from cannibalism in years with strong recruitments, which increased both growth rates and per capita fecundity. Size-dependent intercohort competition may have strong impacts on cannibal-victim interactions when victims share resources with cannibals. Furthermore, habitat heterogeneity, combined with habitat selection, may limit the extent to which cannibals have a stabilizing effect on population dynamics. Finally, the energy gained by cannibals may have important consequences on population dynamics as this energy is allocated into new recruits.

J	Wang, YZ; Ji, XL; Zhou, LZ				Wang, Yongzhi; Ji, Xianglin; Zhou, Lizhi			Functional diversity dynamics of waterbird communities driven by water levels at Shengjin Lake, a small river-connected shallow lake in the middle and lower Yangtze River floodplain	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Gate-controlled activities in lakes can directly or indirectly influence the assembly of waterbird communities. Shengjin Lake, a Ramsar site, is a typical river-connected and gate-controlled shallow lake in the lower and middle Yangtze River floodplain in China, comprising three sub-lakes (upper, middle, and lower) based on topographical features. We surveyed wintering waterbirds at Shengjin Lake from October 2022 to March 2023. We divided the winter water level period into nine phases based on the characteristics of water level changes. By measuring functional diversity, we aimed to provide insights into the differences in waterbird communities among the three sub-lakes under different water level conditions. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between habitat factors and functional diversity. We further explored the relationship between specific functional traits and habitat factors through a combination of the R-mode linked to the Q-mode and the trait-environment correlation matrix (fourth-corner analyses) to explain the mechanism underlying waterbird community assembly. When the water level fluctuated in the range of 10.43-10.74 m (Huanghai elevation), the three sub-lakes had significant habitat differences and high habitat heterogeneity, increasing functional richness and functional dispersion of the upper and lower lakes, both of which significantly differed from those of the middle lake. Habitat heterogeneity and mudflat habitats have positive effects on functional diversity. The difference in functional diversity was primarily determined based on the foraging traits and strata of waterbirds. Habitat filtering of particular traits is a major driving force underlying the assembly of waterbird communities. Overall, we suggest that the minimum water level in the wintering period at Shengjin Lake should be regulated between 10.43 and 10.74 m. These findings provide reasonable suggestions for water level regulation and a theoretical basis for conserving waterbird diversity at Shengjin Lake. The study is based on the perspective of functional diversity to investigate the impact of water level changes on waterbird community diversity. Changes in habitat heterogeneity are the main cause of functional diversity differences. Habitat filtering is identified as the primary driver shaping the waterbird community assembly.image					wang, sanying/HIZ-7552-2022; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021; xianglin, ji/AAI-2277-2019														2045-7758					OCT	2024	14	10							e70222	10.1002/ece3.70222	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.70222								39376473					WOS:001326822100001
J	Gelda, RK; Brooks, CM; Effler, SW; Auer, MT				Gelda, RK; Brooks, CM; Effler, SW; Auer, MT			Interannual variations in nitrification in a hypereutrophic urban lake: Occurrences and implications	WATER RESEARCH												The irregular occurrence of high rates of nitrification (nitrification events) in the upper waters of a nitrogen polluted urban lake, Onondaga Lake. NY, during the fall mixing period is documented. The analysis is supported by eight years (1988-1995) of measurements of total ammonia (T-NH3) and oxidized forms of N (NOx) in the lake and its inflows, and dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature profiles. A tested system-specific mass balance model for N is used to estimate nitrification rates for these years, and a system-specific DO model is applied to demonstrate the impact of a nitrification event on the lake's oxygen resources for a single year. Rates of nitrification for different years ranged from near zero throughout the fall mixing interval (1994) to an average of about 0.18 d(-1) for one month (1995). The nitrification events cause major interannual variations observed in the pools of T-NH3 and NOx in the lake's upper waters in fall, and are probably responsible for the particularly severe lake-wide depletion of DO observed in certain years during this interval. Nitrification was the dominant loss process for T-NH3 and source for NOx in years that the events occurred. The exacerbating effect of the events on the oxygen resources of the lake needs to be accommodated in related remediation efforts. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights reserved.

J	Reheis, C; Sawyer, TL				Reheis, C; Sawyer, TL			Late Cenozoic history and slip rates of the Fish Lake Valley, Emigrant Peak, and Deep Springs fault zones, Nevada and California	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Several well-dated stratigraphic markers permit detailed assessment of the temporal and spatial variation in slip rates along the interconnected faults of the Fish Lake Valley, Emigrant Peak, and Deep Springs Fault zones in west-central Nevada and east-central California. Right-lateral mol:ion on the Fish Lake Valley fault zone apparently began ca. 10 Ma (11.9-8.2 Ma). Associated extensional faulting probably began ca. 5 Ma (6.9-4 Ma) and resulted in the opening of Fish Lake Valley and Deep Springs Valley. The long-term lateral slip rate for the Fish Lake Valley fault zone since about 10 Ma is 5 mm/yr (3-12 mm/yr). Our preferred lateral-slip rate for the central, most active part of the Fish Lake Valley fault zone decreased from about 6 to 3 mm/yr from the late Miocene to the early Pleistocene, increased to about 11 mm/yr during the middle Pleistocene, and decreased to about 3 mm/yr during the late Pleistocene. Extension may account for some of the change in lateral-slip rate during the Pliocene. The large increase in lateral-slip rate during the middle Pleistocene is circumstantially linked to an increase in vertical-slip rates on the Fish Lake Valley and Deep Springs fault zones at about the time of the eruption of the Bishop ash (0.76 Ma). Vertical-slip rates along the three fault zones are also related to fault strike; vertical rates are highest on north-striking faults and approach zero on northwest-striking Faults. The long-lived slip history of the Fish Lake Valley fault zone fits a tectonic model in which the Death Valley-Furnace Creek-Fish Lake Valley fault system is integrated with right-lateral shear on faults of the central Walker Lane and the Eastern California shear zone to accommodate part of the Pacific-North American relative plate motion. Our research demonstrates that the Fish Lake Valley fault zone accounts for about half the rate of 10-12 mm/yr of Pacific-North American plate-boundary shear accommodated within the Basin and Range Province between about lat 37 degrees and 38 degrees N.																			0016-7606					MAR	1997	109	3					280	299																WOS:A1997WN96700003

However, due to the difficulties of dust source identification, there are still great uncertainties in the calculation of dust yield on a global scale. The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau presents some challenges for understanding the region's calculation of the global dust budget. To address these issues, the Hoh Xil Plateau, a typical dust source on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, was selected as the study area for analyzing dust emission processes and associated influencing factors via a robust model. The results showed that dust emissions on the Hoh Xil Plateau occurred mainly in spring and winter. The wide distribution of bare land and sandy land on the Hoh Xil Plateau is the main reason for the high dust emissions. Wind speed is the dominant factor influencing annual dust emission, while precipitation and temperature were negatively correlated with the dust emission. The recession of expansive lakes in the region resulted in an increase in sandy lake-shores, which induced a potential increase in dust emissions. In addition, the effects of human activities on dust emissions were evident. Positive and negative effects on dust emission changes coexisted on the Hoh Xil Plateau and depended on the development of the county-level economy and the implementation of ecological engineering measures. We believe that this study will clarify the dust yield of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and provide valuable information for understanding the driving factors that cause variations in aeolian processes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.					; Du, Heqiang/AAF-5950-2020	du, he qiang/0000-0002-3300-2921; 													2665-9727					DEC	2024	24								100487	10.1016/j.indic.2024.100487	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indic.2024.100487		OCT 2024											WOS:001330843400001

Largemouth Bass Virus in Texas: Distribution and Management Issues	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH												In response to fish kills at prominent fishing sites for largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, Such as Lake Fork and Sam Rayburn Reservoir, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department began a systematic evaluation of state waters for the presence of largemouth bass virus (LMBV). The survey comprised 49 water bodies and 13 river basins, and a total of 2,976 adult bass were collected by electrofishing and angling during the summer and fall of 2000. The virus was initially detected by means of cell Culture and its presence subsequently confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Fourteen reservoirs in eight river basins in eastern and central Texas tested positive for LMBV. Lake Fork was also tested to determine the prevalence of infection following a 1999 LMBV fish kill. The overall prevalence was low in all of the water bodies tested (1.50 +/- 2.82% [mean +/- SD]) as well as those determined to contain LMBV (5.00 +/- 3.02%). Largemouth bass testing positive for LMBV had a significantly higher prevalence of swim bladder anomalies, but this condition was not a good indicator of LMBV infection. No significant relationships were found between LMBV-positive fish and other factors investigated, including the presence or absence of grossly visible injury, hook marks, external parasites, known water quality problems, gender. allozyme-phenotype, method of capture, length. weight. body condition (relative weight), or age. This survey provided a means of gathering scientific information about LMBV, including its distribution in Texas. From the information gained by this survey, prior fish kills, and previous sampling efforts, a total of 19 water bodies within 9 of the 13 major river basins in the state were found to contain the virus. These results were used to guide a statewide fish stocking strategy aimed at preventing the spread of LMBV in Texas and to contribute to a nationwide effort to understand this virus and its effects on largemouth bass fisheries.																			0899-7659					MAR	2009	21	1					36	42		10.1577/H08-027.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/H08-027.1								19485124					WOS:000268505400006
J	FORSYTH, DJ; MARTIN, PA; DESMET, KD; RISKE, ME				FORSYTH, DJ; MARTIN, PA; DESMET, KD; RISKE, ME			ORGANOCHLORINE CONTAMINANTS AND EGGSHELL THINNING IN GREBES FROM PRAIRIE CANADA	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Eggs of five species of grebe were collected from Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta during 1982-1987: red-necked (Podiceps grisegena), horned (P. auritus), eared (P. caspicus), western (Aechmophorus occidentalis) and pied-billed (Podilymbus podiceps). DDE and PCBs were present in all samples analyzed, whereas dieldrin, mirex and oxychlordane were occasionally present at low levels. Mercury was present at low levels in all samples for which it was analyzed Red-necked grebes nesting in Manitoba had the highest contaminant levels and, assuming that contaminant burdens were accumulated principally on the wintering grounds, the mean PCB:DDE ratio (3.1) indicated that these birds and those from sites in central and eastern Saskatchewan probably wintered on the Atlantic coast. Overall low contaminant levels and a low mean PCB:DDE ratio (1.4) in the eggs of red-necked grebes breeding in Alberta and western Saskatchewan suggested that these birds wintered on the Pacific coast. A similar pattern was apparent in horned and eared grebes. Concentrations of DDE and PCB were both significantly correlated with Ratcliffe index (shell thickness), and were strongly correlated with each other. Ratcliffe indices were determined for historical collections of red-necked grebe eggs. Eggshell thickness of grebes nesting in Manitoba declined significantly during the years following the introduction of DDT (post-1947) and has only recovered partially since it was banned in 1972. The Alberta-breeding population did not appear to have undergone any significant decrease in shell thickness.																			0269-7491						1994	85	1					51	58		10.1016/0269-7491(94)90237-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0269-7491(94)90237-2								15091684					WOS:A1994NB34200005
J	Bellinger, BJ; Davis, SL				Bellinger, Brent J.; Davis, Stephen L.			Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) population dynamics and associated water quality impacts along their southern United States colonization front	AQUATIC INVASIONS												Zebra mussels represent one of the most pervasive and expensive non-native species to be introduced into new aquatic ecosystems, negatively impacting human structures and infrastructure and acting as ecosystem engineers. Zebra mussels have demonstrated thermal plasticity, enabling expansion to semi-tropical aquatic systems including Texas ca. 2009. In this study we described spawning and population dynamics and water quality changes after colonization of two central Texas reservoirs, Lake Austin and Lady Bird Lake, ca. 2017. Veliger concentrations peaked in spring and early summer (Julian days 120-170) when water temperatures were between 20-25 degrees C. Adult population densities were initially highest nearest the busiest boat ramps and peaked in 2019-2020. Densities declined thereafter in the lower sections, but generally increased upriver in Lake Austin. However, the decline throughout Lady Bird Lake was three orders of magnitude from the peak. After colonization, chlorophyll a and suspended solid concentrations significantly declined, concomitant with significant changes in water total phosphorus concentrations; changes in different nitrogen-form concentrations were mixed. However, water quality changes were exacerbated by changing discharge volumes. Recent drought conditions and reduced discharges after 2021 have also resulted in elevated water temperatures, notably in Lady Bird Lake, that may have contributed to observed declines in adult zebra mussel densities nearshore. We hypothesize that other southern United States reservoirs should expect similar variations in population dynamics which will impact municipal, recreational, and water quality attributes. Preventing introductions remains essential as the species continues to rapidly spread to new regions.																			1798-6540	1818-5487				NOV	2024	19	4					389	412		10.3391/ai.2024.19.4.141420	http://dx.doi.org/10.3391/ai.2024.19.4.141420													WOS:001410112900003
J	Mischke, U; Nixdorf, B				Mischke, U; Nixdorf, B			Equilibrium phase conditions in shallow German lakes: How Cyanoprokaryota species establish a steady state phase in late summer	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In 2000, a field study in two shallow, polytrophic lakes (Langer See and Melangsee) in eastern Germany revealed an equilibrium state assemblage of Cyanoprokaryota in late summer. During 4 successive weeks in Langer See Planktothrix agardhii (Gom.) Anagn. et Kom., Aphanizomenon gracile (Lemmerm.) Lemmerm. and Pseudanabaena limnetica Lemmerm. were more than 80% of the standing biomass of phytoplankton, and their cumulative biovolume was around 33 mm(3) l(-1) ((+/-3.2 SD). In Melangsee, the very small Limnothrix species L. amphigranulata (Van Goor) Meffert was the most common species, accompanied by Pseudanabaena limnetica and Planktothrix agardhii. For 3 weeks, their cumulative biovolume was about 23 mm(3) l(-1) ((+/-3.4 SD), which represented 75-82% of total biovolume. The dominant species all belong to the functional group S1 defined by Reynolds (1997), except for A. gracile, which we suggest to be included in group S-N. In both lakes mean light intensities ranged between 2.2 and 8.3 E m(-2) d(-1). Overall species spectra were very similar in both lakes, but dominance by Limnothrix and by Planktothrix in the respective lakes is observed repeatedly. The success of these species is discussed in the context of the habitat properties in August/September. Summer mixing events represented no disturbances in the sense of Connell (1978), since they do not interrupt the species dominance. More frequent mixing events and higher concentrations of dissolved nitrogen occurred in Langer See than in the more shallow, but wind protected Melangsee. In Langer See light deficient conditions were intensified by an increasing biomass of P. agardhii, and this species probably benefited from nutrient input by more frequent resuspension. The light deficiency also affected the diversity, expressed as Shannon-Wiener Index (H), which was reduced more in lake Langer See (H=0.51) than in Melangsee (0.74) during steady state periods. Recognizing the important effects of mixing, we suggest an additional variable to describe habitat properties: the number of full mixing days as a proportion of total days of observation should help to discriminate between shallow habitats with intermittent mixing events, and those with more regularly mixing in summer period.

Sources and quantities of Pu released over the facility's 40 years of operation are summarized. Some 160 GBq of Pu-238 and Pu-239 were released in isotopic ratios that allowed researchers to distinguish site emissions from global fallout. The ratios also proved to he a powerful tool useful fur identifying major pathways through which Pu moved in the environment. Two major lines of research are reviewed; one examining Pu transport through agricultural systems typical of the southeastern United States, the other examining Pu dynamics within lake systems. Regardless of the crop studied, Pu contamination of plants was dominated by the retention of Pu-bearing particles on plant surfaces from direct deposition and resuspension, rather than root uptake and translocation of Pu within the plant. Large-scale commercial harvesting of contaminated agricultural crops revealed that mechanized harvesting increased Pu contamination of crops. Differences in Pu concentrations among crops were due largely to external plant morphologies that affected soil loading. Studies on Pu transport in aquatic systems showed that over 99% of the Pu inventory was within lake sediments. Persistent and complex annual cycles still exist for Pu within the lake systems studied, some 20 years after the contamination event. Field studies and modeling helped discern the relative importance of anoxic remobilization from the sediments, hydrologic mixing and sedimentation on the Pu cycle within lakes. Remobilization of Pu in the winter appears to contribute mure to the seasonal cycle than does the more commonly observed mechanism of remobilization in summer anoxic waters due to associated Fe-Mn redux phenomena. Doses to humans from Pu releases were also reviewed and found to he less than those acquired from naturally occurring radionuclides or from Cs-137 releases. Maximum dose equivalents (85 mu Sv) to an individual at the site boundary would have occurred in 1955 and the population dose due to releases that occurred from 1954 to 1989 was 7 person-Sv.

J	Zhao, JM; Zhou, LZ				Zhao, Jin-Ming; Zhou, Li-Zhi			Area, isolation, disturbance and age effects on species richness of summer waterbirds in post-mining subsidence lakes, Anhui, China	AVIAN RESEARCH												Background: The species-area relationship is one of the best documented patterns in community ecology. Factors influencing species-area relationship are still not well understood. Since the proposal of the equilibrium theory of island biogeography, many studies have tested the effects of area and isolation, estimating effects of disturbance and patch age were scarce and should also be important bearing. Methods: We investigated summer waterbird species richness in 38 post-mining subsidence lakes in Huainan and Fuyang, Anhui, China, May 25-June 12, 2016. We examined the effects of lake area, isolation (distance to natural water bodies), aquaculture disturbance, lake age and lake state (still sinking or not sinking) on summer waterbird species richness with multivariable linear regression method and model selection method. Results: Our results from multivariable linear regression and model selection were consistent, which showed that species richness was positively related with lake area and negatively related with isolation. Aquaculture disturbance negatively influenced species richness. Highest species richness were found in lakes under intermediate intensity of aquaculture activities with area less than 100 ha and lakes under low intensity of aquaculture activities with area greater than 100 ha. Lake age and lake state had no significant effects on species richness. Conclusions: Species richness was most related with lake area, aquaculture disturbance, and isolation, with lake area had a positive effect, while aquaculture activities and isolation had a negative effect. What's more, aquaculture activities significantly changed the slope of species-area relationship and might impede us finding a relationship between species richness and lake age.					; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021	zhouZhou, li zhiLizhi/0000-0002-5702-4658; 													2053-7166					MAR 9	2018	9								8	10.1186/s40657-018-0101-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40657-018-0101-1													WOS:000427121500001

The objective was to develop a procedure that would permit short- to medium-term forecasts of potential reliable power generation that would improve utilisation of high lake levels. An operational control procedure has been developed, based on a genetic algorithm, that permits forecasts to be made of potential reliable power output at Owen Falls and any future hydropower stations on the Victoria Nile, at lead times of 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Such forecasts could be of value in planning outage of thermal power plants and in maximising power benefits associated with high lake levels. With regulation, the reliable power output from Lake Victoria and the Victoria Nile can be significantly improved.

Most of the changes observed in the cladoceran assemblages are responses to climate changes. The cladoceran-based temperature reconstructions reflect cold conditions during the Younger Dryas (YD) and allow a division of this period into two phases: an older colder phase, between 12,800 and 12,000 cal yrs BP, and a younger, warmer phase, between ca. 12,000 and 11,500 cal yrs BP. The geomorphological features of the study sites and local environmental forces are also taken into consideration. The cladoceran-in-ferred summer temperature estimates from all of the study sites correspond closely with the available climate reconstruction for the YD in central Europe.

J	Taylor, TN; Krings, M				Taylor, Thomas N.; Krings, Michael			A colony-forming microorganism with probable affinities to the Chroococcales (cyanobacteria) from the Lower Devonian Rhynie chert	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												The Rhynie chert has provided a wealth of information on Early Devonian non-marine aquatic and terrestrial life. However, our understanding of the microbial biodiversity in this hot spring paleoecosystem remains incomplete. In this paper we describe Rhyniosarcina devonica nov. gen. et sp., a microorganism from the Rhynie chert that forms cubical, spheroidal, or irregular colonies of up to several hundred densely packed cells (<2.5-5.5 mu m in diameter). Square groups of four cells and sarcinoid packages of eight cells represent the basic modular units in the construction of the colonies. Cell division is by binary fission in three planes in space; new colonies form by colony dissociation. Rhyniosarcina devonica is interpreted as a cyanobacterium with affinities to the Chroococcales based on morphological similarities to extant colony-forming chroococcalean cyanobacteria, especially members in the genus Cyanosarcina. This discovery expands our knowledge of the diversity of primary producers in the Rhynie chert. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lake water contains thousands of DOM molecules, which largely originate from natural sources and are greatly influenced by external inputs through anthropogenic activities. To elucidate the shaping mechanism of the DOM composition under complex habitat conditions and anthropogenic disturbances, the characteristic molecular fingerprint of DOM was determined based on chemodiversity information obtained via ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry for the Baiyangdian wetland (a typical large macrophytic shallow lake in North China). In the Baiyangdian wetland, the DOM composition exhibited high complexity and spatial heterogeneity, and more recalcitrant DOM molecules were identified in summer than in spring. Although multiple natural factors (nutrient concentration, depth of water and quality of submerged macrophytes) and anthropogenic factors (different land uses and discharge of pollutants) were associated with the relative abundance of various DOM molecules, only the influences from the anthropogenic factors were statistically significant. The alpha diversity index of DOM could reflect variations in both the natural factors (total dissolved phosphorus) and the anthropogenic factors (discharge of nitrogen and phosphorus). Furthermore, the DOM composition in each group were clustered according to the ecological functions (natural reserves, tourism, breeding, and domestic supply functions), and exhibited molecular fingerprint features. This study provides an effective approach to characterize the molecular fingerprint features of DOM and critical information to better understand the shaping mechanism of the DOM composition under complex habitat conditions and anthropogenic disturbances.

Four sympatric types (Cross-band, Dark, Cobalt and Large-Dark (A) types) did not share alleles at between one and six loci out of 12 loci tested. No hybrid specimens were found among these types. The average genetic distances among these four types ranged from 0.13 to 0.72, which fall within the range of values among congeneric species of fishes. The average genetic distances among the other four types, Large-Dark (B), Orange, Shinji-Lake and Boso types, were only 0.01 to 0.03, and fall within the range of values among conspecific populations. These results suggest that the former four types are clearly discrete species and the latter four types may be considered as intraspecific variations of a fifth species.																			0021-5090	1884-7374				JUN 28	1989	36	1					30	41		10.1007/BF02905670	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02905670													WOS:A1989AD70900004

Thirty samples from the Nubian Sandstone Aquifer (NSAS) and karst springs were analyzed using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Canadian Water Quality Index (CCME WQI). SOM clustering revealed three distinct water types: (1) hypersaline springs (TDS >10,000 mg/L) near Siwa Lake, (2) moderately saline springs (4,551-8,885 mg/L), and (3) freshwater NSAS samples (<1,000 mg/L). PCA identified salinity (45.5% variance), carbonate equilibrium (21.3%), and anthropogenic inputs (11.5%) as dominant controls. The CCME WQI classified 28% of samples as "Poor/Marginal," with localized heavy metal (Ba, V) contamination confirmed by MPI and NCI indices. Monte Carlo-based health risk assessment revealed severe non-carcinogenic risks for children (HI >1), primarily from Co (HQ up to 105.5) and V (HQ up to 416.9) via ingestion. Industrial indices (LSI, RSI, CSMR) highlighted scaling potential in freshwater zones (LSI >1.5) and corrosion risks in saline areas (RSI >8). As the first study to: (1) quantify emerging contaminants (V, Co, Mo) in NSAS, (2) apply SOM-PCA-Monte Carlo integration in arid aquifers, and (3) concurrently evaluate health and industrial risks, this work provides a replicable framework for non-renewable aquifer management. Immediate actions targeted remediation, infrastructure protection, and agricultural regulation are recommended in Siwa Oasis. The methodologies and gaps identified including unassessed carcinogenic metals and isotopic tracing set a roadmap for future research in vulnerable aquifer systems.					; Eid, Mohamed Hamdy/HSF-4759-2023; Abukhadra, Mostafa/Q-3804-2018	Eid, Mohamed Hamdy/0000-0002-3383-1826; 													2590-1230					JUN	2025	26								104989	10.1016/j.rineng.2025.104989	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rineng.2025.104989		APR 2025											WOS:001477407000001

Intensification of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in a eutrophic, temperate lake caused by nitrogen, temperature, and CO2	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Warmer temperatures can significantly increase the intensity of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) in eutrophic freshwater ecosystems. However, few studies have examined the effects of CO2 2 enrichment in tandem with elevated temperature and/or nutrients on cyanobacterial taxa in freshwater ecosystems. Here, we observed changes in the biomass of cyanobacteria, nutrients, pH, and carbonate chemistry over a two-year period in a shallow, eutrophic freshwater lake and performed experiments to examine the effects and co-effects of CO2, 2 , temperature, and nutrient enrichment on cyanobacterial and N2 2-fixing (diazotrophic) communities assessed via high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA and nifH genes, respectively. During both years, there were significant CHABs (50-500 mu g cyanobacterial chlorophyll-a L- 1 ) and lake CO2 2 levels were undersaturated (<= 300 mu atm p CO 2 ). NH4+ 4 + significantly increased the net growth rates of cyanobacteria as well as the biomass of the diazotrophic cyanobacterial order Nostocales under elevated and ambient CO2 2 conditions. In a fall experiment, the N2 2 fixation rates of Nostocales were significantly higher when populations were enriched with CO2 2 and P, relative to CO2-enriched 2-enriched populations that were not amended with P. During a summer experiment, N2 2 fixation rates increased significantly under N and CO2 2- enriched conditions relative to N-enriched and ambient CO2 2 conditions. Nostocales dominated the diazotrophic communities of both experiments, achieving the highest relative abundance under CO2-enriched 2-enriched conditions when N was added in the first experiment and when CO2 2 and temperature were elevated in the second experiment, when N2 2 fixation rates also increased significantly. Collectively, this study indicates that N promotes cyanobacterial blooms including those formed by Dolichospermum and that the biomass and N2 2 fixation rates of diazotrophic cyanobacterial taxa may benefit from enhanced CO2 2 levels in eutrophic lakes.

The continuous records confirm that a scarce steppe-like vegetation with Poaceae, Artemisia and Cyperaceae dominated c. 32 000-10 300 C-14 yr BP, while tundra-like vegetation with Oxyria, Ranunculaceae and Caryophyllaceae grew in wetter areas. The coldest interval occurred c. 18 000 yr BP. Lateglacial pollen data show several warming events followed by a climate deterioration c. 10 500 C-14 yr BP, which may correspond with the Younger Dryas. The Late Pleistocene/Holocene transition, c. 10 300-10 000 C-14 yr BP, is characterized by a change from the herb-dominated vegetation to shrubby tundra with Betula sect. Nanae and Salix. Alnus fruticosa arrived locally c. 9000-8500 C-14 yr BP and disappeared c. 4000-3500 C-14 yr BP. Communities of Betula sect. Nanae, broadly distributed at c. 10 000-3500 C-14 yr BP, almost disappeared when vegetation became similar to the modern herb tundra after 3500-3000 C-14 yr BP. Quantitative climate reconstructions show Last Glacial Maximum summer temperature about 4degreesC below the present and Preboreal (c. 10 000 14 C yr BP) temperature 2-4degreesC above the present. Maximum summer temperature occurred between 10 000 and 5500 C-14 yr BP; later summers were similar to present or slightly warmer.

With a unique multisphere environmental system, the Tibetan Plateau provides an important ecological sheltering function for China and other parts of Asia. The Tibetan Plateau is one of the world's most pristine regions, benefiting from a sparse population with negligible local influence on its environment. However, it is surrounded by some of the most polluted areas in the world, such as South Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. With the atmospheric circulation, such pollutants may impact the Tibetan Plateau through long-range transport. Clearly, the scientific research on the transboundary transport of pollutants is not only important for the understanding of multisphere interactions on the earth surface, but also could meet the national strategic needs for ecological and environmental protection. Long-term monitoring combined with short-term intensive observation campaigns, were used to comprehensively summarize the latest research progress regarding the spatial-temporal distribution and transport mechanism of air pollutants, as well as their climate and ecological impacts, which were achieved during the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition. With respect of historical trends reconstructed from environmental archives, e.g., glacial ice cores and lake sediments, the black carbon and heavy metals like mercury show a dramatic increase since 1950s, which reflect the enhanced emission of air pollutants in Asia. On-line observation data and WRF-Chem modeling indicate that upper air circulation and local mountain-valley breeze system are the main drivers of trans Himalaya air pollution from South Asia. A regional climate-chemistry model coupled with an aerosol-snow/ice feedback module was used to reveal the natural and anthropogenic light-absorbing aerosols' radiative effects over the Tibetan Plateau. Results indicated that the mineral dust both in the atmosphere and snow induced 0.1-0.5 degrees C warming over the western Tibetan Plateau and Kunlun Mountains in spring. Meanwhile, dust aerosols caused snow water equivalent to decrease by 5-25 mm over the western TP, Himalayas and Pamir Mountains in winter and spring. The radiative effects of BC-in-snow induced surface temperature increased by 0.1-1.5 degrees C and snow water equivalent decreased by 5-25 mm over the western Tibetan Plateau and Himalayas. According to the observations the black carbon and dust found in the snow and ice on the surfaces of glaciers were responsible for on average 20% of the albedo reduction within the TP region. Those atmospherically transported pollutants also have obvious negative impacts on the ecosystem in Tibetan Plateau. For example, bioaccumulation of DDTs have been found in Tibetan terrestrial and aquatic food chains, and newly emerging compounds such as polyfluoroalkyl substances and hexabromocyclodo-decanes have been widely detected in wild fish species. Therefore, the corresponding ecological risks are of great concern. In the future, it is necessary to quantify the extent of atmospherically transported pollution and model the pollutant fate under the future environmental scenarios as well as establish environmental and health risk.					xiaoping, wang/GRX-3807-2022; 张, 玉兰/B-4778-2015; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018; 丛, 志远/E-5237-2012														0023-074X	2095-9419					2019	64	27					2876	2884		10.1360/TB-2019-0135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/TB-2019-0135													WOS:000496463900013
J	Norrgard, S; Helama, S				Norrgard, Stefan; Helama, Samuli			Historical trends in spring ice breakup for the Aura River in Southwest Finland, AD 1749-2018	HOLOCENE												Ice breakup (IBU) observations have been recorded for Aura River in Turku, southwest Finland, since the mid-18th century. The latest long-term investigation covered the period 1749-1906, but the series contains several biases. In this article, we present a fully revised and extended IBU series (1749-2018) of Aura River for climate research purposes. Instead of typical univariate IBU data (a single time series with one data point per year), this series includes three different types of IBU data. These are the initial observations of the ice starting to break up (IBU1), the river recorded as free from ice within city limits (IBU2) and, finally, the arrival of the ice from behind the Halinen dam, the so-called Halinen ice (IBU3). The IBU1 series shows negative, statistically significant long-term trends since 1749. While the other two phenological events also exhibit negative long-term trends, indicative of earlier and warmer springs towards the present day, their trends are not significant over multi-centurial scales. The IBU2 series is the only series covering the entire period, and it shows a significant negative trend towards earlier breakups (16 days) between 1919 and 2018. Consequently, breakups in March, which were extremely rare before the 1900s, have become common, while breakups in May (previously once per decade) have not occurred since 1881. These results are indicative of sub-seasonal trends in the breakups. Our results also confirm defects in the previous time series, which shows a bias of up to 16 days.

In this study, we performed metagenomics analysis to study the gut microbial communities and ARGs of Anser erythropus wintering at Shengjin (SJ) and Caizi (CZ) Lakes. The results showed that bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea were the dominant gut microbes. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the microbiota compositions significantly differed between the two populations. Diet may be the most crucial driver of the gut microbial communities for A. erythropus. This species fed exclusively on Poaceae spp. at Shengjin Lake and primarily on Carex spp. at Caizi Lake. Tetracycline, macrolide, fluoroquinolone, phenicol, and peptide antibiotics were the dominant resistant types. ARGs had a significantly higher abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the Shengjin Lake samples than in Caizi Lake samples. PCA indicated that most Shengjin Lake samples significantly differed in gut microbiota composition from those obtained at Caizi Lake. This difference in gut microbiota composition between the two lakes' samples is attributed to more extensive aquaculture operations and poultry farms surrounding Shengjin Lake than Caizi Lake. ARGs-microbes associations indicated that 24 bacterial species, commonly used as indicators of antibiotic resistance in surveillance efforts, were abundant in wintering A. erythropus. The results revealed the composition and structural characteristics of the gut microbiota and ARGs of A. erythropus, pointing to their high sensitivities to diet habits at both lakes. This study also provides primary data for risk prevention and control of potential harmful pathogens that could endanger public health and therefore are of major significance to epidemiological and public health.

The ostracod record documents relative changes in water temperature and hydrologic characteristics of the lacustrine system that are the result of warming air temperatures, changes in the relative contributions of input waters (shallow vs. deep groundwater), rainfall patterns and relative sea level rise during the Holocene. The data indicate that LSS was initially supplied by relatively low amounts of direct rainfall and surface runoff as the spring's location was closer to them recharge area and far from, the freshwater/saltwater interface. At about 11,000 yr BP, LSS became groundwater supported, initially by a shallow freshwater aquifer with low delta O-18 composition until similar to 5700 yr BP, and after that time by O-18-enriched and increasingly mineralized groundwater originating from a deeper, carbonate aquifer as the regional water tablerose bringing the saltwater interface closer to the location of LSS which at this time was becoming a groundwater discharge area. The data also shows that the most abrupt and pronounced hydrologic changes occurred during the Late Holocene with an interval of low delta O-18 values (similar to-2.86 parts per thousand) between 2700 and 2000 yr BP, followed by a stepped increase in delta O-18 composition with maximum values (similar to-1.46%o) between 1100 and 900 yr BP. Over these periods to the present time the ostracod assemblage is characterized by brackish species (Cyprideis spp. and Limnocythere floridensis). It is inferred that the interval of decreased isotopic values indicates mixing with saline water during dry climatic conditions, while the interval of more enriched isotopic values suggest saltwater intrusion during a period of, presumably, a sea level highstand. Although some discrepancies exist between other records from the northern Caribbean region and the one from LSS with regards to the exact timing for the Late Holocene drying and subsequent increase in rainfall conditions, the differences between the records may be explained by greater continental influences on ocean-atmosphere interactions on the Florida peninsula, a highly complex groundwater mixing balance in LSS, and by a better constrained age-model in the other records.

However, longterm continuous simulation of catchments and storage modelling, essential for hydrological risk assessment, necessitates monthly or daily time series input data, while palaeoclimate records are typically available at annual or seasonal scales. Additionally, modelling operational water storages used for hydropower is complex, requiring inputs such as water extraction information, which are difficult to replicate due to their inherent variability. Based on Lake Burbury, part of Hydro Tasmania's hydroelectric scheme in southern Australia, we demonstrate a novel method through which seasonal flow reconstructions can be used for daily palaeo water balance modelling, coupled with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to simulate storage extractions. We first developed two seasonal tree-ring based inflow reconstructions, an approximately 1000-year Austral summer and a 400-year Austral winter reconstruction. We then used these as a guide to bootstrap historical daily inflows and the ANN known as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was trained to simulate extractions for hydroelectricity. A Source model of the Lake Burbury hydro-electric water supply system was prepared to simulate the daily surface water balance of Lake Burbury, including inflows, outflows and resultant storage levels over some 1000 years. The simulations were used to 'stress test' the current storage system under a broader range of climatic conditions than the instrumental period. Based on our simulation, a low flow period like that in the 18th century represents the highest risk to hydroelectricity production, while a repeat of 12-13th century conditions would be associated with the highest spill volumes and most reliable electricity production. Importantly, by extending the instrumental record, we can place contemporary trends in water availability in a longer historical context, better assess the likelihood of extreme events, and hence adjust plans to decrease the vulnerability of the hydroelectric sector (among other water users) to drought/shifts in climate. This approach requires collaboration between palaeoclimatologists, the modelling community, hydrologists and managers of natural resources and the built environment.

Climatic and Topographic Control of the Stable Isotope Values of Rivers on the South Island of New Zealand	PALEOCEANOGRAPHY AND PALEOCLIMATOLOGY												We show that climate and topography control the spatial distribution of stable isotope values on the South Island of New Zealand, based on a spatially dense (n = 193) river isotopic survey. Our data show a delta O-18 minimum in isotope values east of the Southern Alps that demonstrates topographically driven continentality associated with the Southern Alps, which intersect the prevailing, moisture-laden westerlies. Our data define a South Island surface water line of delta H-2 = 8.17 (+/- 0.26) x delta O-18 + 10.57 (+/- 2.04), which is identical within 95% confidence intervals to the global and New Zealand meteoric water lines established from monthly precipitation samples. The observed river delta O-18 values are strongly correlated with annual temperature range and winter temperature. Strongest correlations are between delta O-18 and mean minimum winter temperatures (r > 0.7 for June, July, August), with gradients of 0.58-0.66 parts per thousand /degrees C. Based on a multiple regression analysis of delta O-18 against climate data, we present a river delta O-18 model and isoscape that demonstrate the control of continentality and moisture source on New Zealand surface water isotope spatial patterns. Model validation against previously published river samples shows skill in predicting river delta O-18 values (root-mean-square error = 0.83), confirming that the spatial variations in river delta O-18 (and delta H-2) are robust to sampling period and reflect continental, precipitation source and temperature effects. Our data suggest that oxygen or hydrogen isotope paleoclimate proxies derived from rivers or open-system lakes on the South Island should be sensitive to winter temperature.					; Riesselman, Christina/H-5037-2012	Moy, Christopher/0000-0002-2177-5265; Riesselman, Christina/0000-0002-2436-4306; Stephen, Haroon/0000-0003-3116-1416; Lorrey, Andrew/0000-0002-3923-3181; 													2572-4517	2572-4525				MAY	2021	36	5							e2021PA004220	10.1029/2021PA004220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021PA004220													WOS:000654380700008

However, there are still debates on whether or not these reconstructed delta D-p or delta O-18(p) can represent changes of monsoon precipitation. In this study, we report a similar to 5000 year record of leafwax hydrogen isotope (delta D-wax) from a 6.67-m-long sediment core collected in Beilianchi (BLC) Lake in the southwestern Chinese Loess Plateau. Based on analyses of the instrumental precipitation isotopes, precipitation amounts, and moisture sources, we find that delta D-p in the southwestern Chinese Loess Plateau shows distinct negative correlation with amounts of summer (from April to September) monsoon precipitation at inter-annual scales. This is further supported by the observed negative relation between precipitation amounts and regional lake-sediments and speleothems inferred delta D-p (or delta O-18(p)) values at decadal scales over the past 60 years. Therefore, our reconstructed similar to 35-year resolution monsoon precipitation, inferred from delta D-wax, reveals a long-term decrease since the mid-Holocene. Superimposed on this trend, there are several multi-centennial to millennial-scale fluctuations for increased monsoon precipitation at 4500-4000 years BP, 2900-2400 years BP and 1200-700 years BP and decreased precipitation at 3900-3000 years BP, 2200-1300 years BP, and 500-0 years BP. Reanalyses of instrumental data and Kiel Climate Model on regional atmosphere circulations show that moisture of this region is mainly derived from the western Pacific Ocean through the East Asian summer monsoon circulation at inter-annual to inter-decadal, and millennial timescales. We conclude that monsoon rainfall in the southwestern Chinese Loess Plateau is likely connected with changes in sea surface temperatures and migrations of the ITCZ in the western Pacific Ocean.

S.) [Australia]. Springs of clear, colorless water (white water) sometimes occur in close proximity to the black water. Field evidence suggests that black waters move laterally along semipermeable B horizons of humus podzols, whereas white waters are part of a much larger storage system in which the water has been decolorized by contact with the C horizons. Thus black waters apparently are the active eluviating agent and white waters are the residual liquid phase of the podzolization process. Chemical analyses of black and white waters, and the results of a laboratory leaching experiment support this view. Possible mechanisms and some implications for the genesis of podzol B horizons are dicussed.																			0004-9573	1446-568X					1983	21	1					59	66		10.1071/SR9830059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/SR9830059													WOS:A1983QL06900005

However, there are few studies on C-3 and C-4 plants evolution and it is an area of active debate on whether there are C-4 plants existing on the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, the paleoclimate of the Hurleg Lake on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau is reconstructed based on n-alkane-induced indicators, while the C-4 plant evolution history is established by compound-specific isotope of long-chain n-alkanes since 14.1 cal kyr BP. The response of C-4 plant evolution history to climate change on the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau demonstrated that C-3 and C-4 plants were sensitive to local and global climate change. Solar radiation in summer, insolation-affected East Asian monsoon, and seasonal climate (including seasonal variation of the solar radiation, temperature, and precipitation) had significant effects on the long-term growth of C-4. On the other hand, factors such as temperature, precipitation, and other potential factors affected the detailed variation of C-4 plants in a relatively short-term. Our finding maintained the existence of C-4 plants in the high-altitude region and indicated that the abundance of C-4 plants might increase significantly and the ecological pattern of vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau will change distinctly in the coming warmer climate conditions.

Active layer and permafrost thermal regime in a patterned ground soil in Maritime Antarctica, and relationship with climate variability models	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Permafrost and active layer studies are important to understand and predict regional climate changes. The objectives of this work were: i) to characterize the soil thermal regime (active layer thickness and permafrost formation) and its interannual variability and ii) to evaluate the influence of different climate variability modes to the observed soil thermal regime in a patterned ground soil in Maritime Antarctica. The study was carried out at Keller Peninsula, King George Island, Marititne Antarctica. Six soil temperatures probes were installed at different depths (10, 30 and 80 cm) in the polygon center (Tc) and border (Tb) of a patterned ground soil. We applied cross-correlation analysis and standardized series were related to the Antarctic Oscillation Index (MO). The estimated active layer thickness was approximately 0.75 cm in the polygon border and 0.64 cm in the center, indicating the presence of permafrost (within 80 cm). Results indicate that summer and winter temperatures are becoming colder and warmer, respectively. Considering similar active layer thickness, the polygon border presented greater thawing days, resulting in greater vulnerability to warming, cooling faster than the center, due to its lower volumetric heat capacity (Cs). Cross-correlation analysis indicated statistically significant delay of 1 day (at 10 cm depth) in the polygon center, and 5 days (at 80 cm depth) for the thermal response between atmosphere and soil. Air temperature showed a delay of 5 months with the climate variability models. The influence of southern winds from high latitudes, in the south facing slopes, favored freeze in the upper soil layers, and also contributed to keep permafrost closer to the surface. The observed cooling trend is linked to the regional climate variability modes influenced by atmospheric circulation, although longer monitoring period is required to reach a more precise scenario.

Lake Saimaa landlocked salmon (Salmo salar m. sebago) have been dependent on hatchery propagation for over 50 years. The population is therefore at risk of hatchery-induced phenotypes, which can be suboptimal in the wild, thus impacting the long-term viability of the already critically endangered population. To assess the impact of rearing techniques, one-summer-old landlocked salmon morphology and asymmetry (an indicator of stress) was compared between four different hatchery rearing backgrounds, with all fish originating from the same family groups. The first group was maintained under standard hatchery conditions, the second under enriched rearing conditions (varying water level, direction and velocity), the third in semi-natural hatchery conditions (outdoor stream ponds and natural prey) and the fourth group experienced wild conditions (stocked in the River Ala-Koitajoki as alevins in spring and electrofished in September). Fish were photographed from both left and right sides and morphology was compared between rearing types using classical linear measurements as well as geometric morphometrics. Results indicate that natural conditions produce more symmetrical fish that have longer pectoral fins than their hatchery conspecifics, whereas fish reared in semi-natural conditions show increased asymmetry. These results suggest that different rearing types elicit varying levels of stress, and that conservation efforts encouraging early-stage stocking in the wild could be recommended when natural reproduction is not possible.

GEOCHEMICAL ANALYSES OF MARMOT TEETH TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL FOR OVERLAPPING FORAGING RANGES IN TWO SIBERIAN HUMAN CEMETERY POPULATIONS	JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY												Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of human remains from two contemporaneous cemeteries in the Lake Baikal region of Russia indicate similarity in diets among some individuals buried in these two locations. Given that the Middle Holocene cemeteries are only 75 km apart, these dietary data could indicate overlap in foraging ranges between the two human cemetery populations. Incisors from Siberian marmots (Marmota sibirica) are the most abundant type of faunal remains recovered from both cemeteries. Siberian marmots are a steppe species and hibernate over much of the year, being readily accessible to humans only during the summer and early fall. They are a fat-rich and desirable food item today in adjacent portions of Central Asia. To test if the dietary similarity between the two cemetery human groups might be due to overlapping hunting areas for marmots, Barium/Calcium and Strontium/Calcium ratios in a sample of marmot teeth were examined. The results of these analyses indicate very little overlap in the trace element values for the marmot teeth from the two cemeteries, which suggests the two human groups were procuring marmots in different regions. We argue that the dietary similarity seen between the two cemeteries can be best accounted for by shared use of isotopically similar fish moving between Lake Baikal and its tributary, the Angara River. An alternative explanation is that the overlapping isotope values are a result of human migration between the two cemetery regions.

Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) origin, behavior, and habitat residency in Sherbrooke Lake, Nova Scotia, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The southeastern edge of the Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) range extends to Nova Scotia (NS), Canada, including Sherbrooke Lake, Lunenburg County. These Lake Trout may be of native origin; however, the putatively native population was historically supplemented by stocking from nonindigenous strains. To determine genetic origin of this population, 25 Lake Trout from Sherbrooke Lake were used to compare genetic likeness to populations that had been stocked into the lake. Lake Trout of Sherbrooke Lake were determined to be highly genetically distinct from source populations in Ontario, Manitoba, New York, and Vermont, suggesting that the extant population is of native origin. To identify suitable habitat of Lake Trout in Sherbrooke Lake, acoustic telemetry was used to track the depth and temperature residency of 11 Lake Trout in tandem with measuring lake bathymetric and water column temperature and oxygen. During spring and summer, 2022, Lake Trout occupied a hypolimnetic residency, ranging from 11 to 22 m of depth and 8.5 to 10.0 degrees C. Suitable conditions for Lake Trout were available in the south basin. The main basin, containing similar to 80% of the lake's volume, was unstratified and unsuitable for Lake Trout. The effects of Hurricane Fiona caused the hypolimnion in the south basin to shrink via the thermal mixing of the epilimnion, forcing adult Lake Trout to a depth range of 16-18 m for similar to 1 month. During this time, suitable Lake Trout habitat comprised only similar to 0.5% of the total volume of Sherbrooke Lake.

In this study, we present a high-resolution geochemical and mineralogical record retrieved from a 585-cm core in Selin Co covering the last 13 cal kyr BP based on a robust AMS C-14-determined chronology with a reservoir effect calibration. Various proxies, such as the mean grain size, Ti, Ca, Rb/Sr, total inorganic carbon (TIC) and total organic carbon (TOC), showed that the period from 12.9 to 11 cal kyr BP was characterized by stronger runoff, lower salinity and a higher lake level, indicating a cold and wet period. A Younger Dryas event likely occurred during the period 12.8-12.5 cal kyr BP, and all proxies exhibited a sharp change from 11.2 to 10.8 cal kyr BP that showed the termination of the cold/wet period followed by the onset of the Holocene. From 11 to 8 cal kyr BP, a transition from a drier to a relatively wet period occurred. An abrupt decrease in the TOC record in Selin Co at 9.2 cal kyr BP suggested a cold event. During the period 8 to 4 cal kyr BP, a relatively warm and dry climate was observed. At 4 cal kyr BP, all proxies indicated a low lake level and hence a dry event in Selin Co. A stable low lake level after 4 cal kyr BP was observed until an increase beginning at 800 cal yr BP. A significant lake level rise has coincided with the strengthening Westerlies during recent decades. These climatic variabilities in the Selin Co area since the Late Glacial have primarily been driven by temperature-induced evaporation in addition to precipitation via monsoonal circulation and/or westerly jets.

DNA from lake sediments reveals the long-term dynamics and diversity of Synechococcus assemblages	BIOGEOSCIENCES												While picocyanobacteria (PC) are important actors in carbon and nutrient cycles in aquatic systems, factors controlling their interannual dynamics and diversity are poorly known due to the general lack of long-term monitoring surveys. This study intended to fill this gap by applying a DNA-based paleolimnological approach to sediment records from a deep subalpine lake that has experienced dramatic changes in environmental conditions during the last century (eutrophication, re-oligotrophication and large-scale climate changes). In particular, we investigated the long-term (100 yr) diversity and dynamics of Synechococcus, PC that have presumably been affected by both the lake trophic status changes and global warming. The lake's morphological and environmental conditions provided the ideal conditions for DNA preservation in the sediment archives. Generalised additive models applied to quantitative PCR (qPCR; quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) results highlighted that an increase in summer temperature could have a significant positive impact on the relative abundance of Synechococcus (fraction of Synechococcus in total cyanobacteria). The diversity of Synechococcus in Lake Bourget was studied by phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA gene and the following internally transcribed spacer (ITS). Up to 23 different OTUs (based on 16S rRNA), which fell into various cosmopolitan or endemic clusters, were identified in samples from the past 100 yr. Moreover, the study of ITS revealed a higher diversity within the major 16S rRNA-defined OTUs. Changes in PC diversity were related to the lake's trophic status. Overall, qPCR and sequencing results showed that environmental changes (in temperature and phosphorus concentration) affected Synechococcus community dynamics and structure, translating into changes in genotype composition. These results also helped to re-evaluate the geographical distribution of some Synechococcus clusters. Providing such novel insights into the long-term history of an important group of primary producers, this study illustrates the promising approach that consists in coupling molecular tools and paleolimnology to reconstruct a lake's biodiversity history.					alric, benjamin/F-5068-2019; Pignol, cecile/AAC-2872-2020; Pignol, Cecile/K-1348-2014; Domaizon, Isabelle/A-2517-2011; Arnaud, Fabien/F-7003-2012	Perga, Marie-Elodie/0000-0002-9003-0769; Pignol, Cecile/0000-0003-4411-8898; Domaizon, Isabelle/0000-0001-9785-3082; Arnaud, Fabien/0000-0002-8706-9902													1726-4170	1726-4189					2013	10	6					3817	3838		10.5194/bg-10-3817-2013	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-10-3817-2013													WOS:000321122700025

The rainfall regime is driven by the yearly oscillation of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, which determines a wet summer and a dry and windy winter. The presence of Lake Malawi to the south, and high ranges to the north result in a higher annual precipitation than that observed at a regional scale. Air masses overloaded with humidity bypassing Lake Malawi are submitted to ascending currents, producing rainfall up to 2400 mm yr(-1) in the Lake Massoko area. Important exchanges between the lake and groundwater reservoirs have been demonstrated from hydrological and isotopic balances of Lake Massoko on a regional scale. These exchanges are superimposed on groundwater circulation. The hydrological setting of Lake Massoko is also influenced by the tectonics of the region dominated by the northwest/southeast tilt of tectonic blocks. The sedimentary sequences of Lake Massoko cored in 1995 and 1996 under the EEC-Project RUKWA [RUKWA Project - Final Report, 19971 likely register the palaeoenvironmental changes on the catchment. The sediment record is nearly continuous due to the near-constant high water level of the lake. In contrast with many other lacustrine sequences, in which reduced deposition rates, discrepancies and/or gaps characterise and periods such as the Last Glacial Maximum and the Younger Dryas event, all the AMS-C-14 dates on authigenic organic samples fit with the stratigraphy, and the palaoenvironmental record of Lake Massoko exhibits a constant mean sedimentation rate of 0.628 mm, yr(-1) for the last ca. 40 cal ka BP.

The Food Web of Boiling Springs Lake Appears Dominated by the Heterolobosean Tetramitus thermacidophilus Strain BSL	JOURNAL OF EUKARYOTIC MICROBIOLOGY												We studied the protist grazers of Boiling Springs Lake (BSL), an acid geothermal feature in Lassen Volcanic National Park, using a combination of culture and genetic approaches. The major predator in BSL is a vahlkampfiid ameba closely related (95% 18S+ITS rRNA identity) to Tetramitus thermacidophilus, a heterolobose ameboflagellate recently isolated from volcanic geothermal acidic sites in Europe and Russia, as well as an uncultured heterolobosean from the nearby Iron Mountain acid mine drainage site. Tetramitus thermacidophilus strain BSL is capable of surviving the physical extremes of BSL, with optimal growth at 38-50 degrees C and pH 2-5. This bacterivore also ingested conidiospores of the ascomycete Phialophora sp., but ultrastructural observations reveal the latter may not be readily digested, and conidia were not separable from the ameoboflagellate culture, suggesting a possible symbiosis. DGGE fingerprint transects studies showed the organism is restricted to near-lake environs, and we detected an average of similar to 500 viable cysts/cm(3) sediment on the shoreline. Other grazing protists were isolated from lakeshore environments, including the lobose amebae Acanthamoeba sp. and Hartmannella sp., and the kinetoplastid flagellate Bodo sp., but none could tolerate both low pH and high temperature. These appear to be restricted to cooler near lake geothermal features, which also contain other potential grazer morphotypes observed but not successfully cultured, including ciliates, euglenids, testate amebae, and possible cercozoans. We compare the food web of BSL with other acidic or geothermal sites, and discuss the impact of protists in this unique environment.

DOC concentrations ranged from 163 mu M to 248 mu M in Lake Hongfeng and from 143 mu M to 308 mu M in Lake Baihua, respectively, during the study period. DON concentrations ranged from 7 mu M to 26 mu M in Lake Hongfeng and from 14 mu M to 47 mu M in Lake Baihua. DOC showed vertical heterogeneity with higher concentrations in the epilimnion than in the hypolimnion during the stratification period. The DON concentration profiles appeared to be more variable than the DOC profiles. Apparent DON maxima occurred in the upper layer of water. In Lake Hongfeng, DOC concentration in the surface water was highest at the end of spring and early summer. DON concentration was 2-5 mu M higher in May 2003 and in June 2004 than in adjacent months. DOC and chlorophyll-a concentrations were significantly correlated (r=0.79, P < 0.05). The period of highest concentrations of DOC in Lake Hongfeng was also the season of concentrated rainfall. Algae activity and allochthonous input might result in an increase of DOC and DON concentrations together. In Lake Baihua, the maximum concentrations of DOC and DON in the surface water occurred simultaneously in May 2003 and February 2004. DOC concentrations were significantly correlated with DON (r=0.90, P < 0.01), indicating the common sources. Allochthonous input, biological processes, stratification and mixing were the most important factors controlling the distributions and cycling of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and inorganic nitrogen in these two lakes. Inference from the corresponding vertical distributions of DOM and inorganic nitrogen indicated that DOM played potential roles in the internal loading of nitrogen and metabolism in the water body in these small lakes. The carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio showed a potential significance for tracing the source and biogeochemical processes of DOM in the lakes. These results are of significance in the further understanding of biogeochemical cycling and environmental effects of DOM and nitrogen in lake ecosystems.					jianyang, guo/N-9506-2019; Li, Wenchao/S-5567-2016; Fu, Pingqing/G-4863-2013; Liu, Cong-qiang/G-6714-2012	Fu, Pingqing/0000-0001-6249-2280; 													1439-8621					AUG	2008	9	2					163	171		10.1007/s10201-008-0241-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-008-0241-9													WOS:000257726800010

However, it remains unclear about the gut microbiota in long-distance migratory Anseriformes herbivores, which could be functionally important for these wetland-dependent animals. We collected faeces of the greater white-fronted goose (GWFG), bean goose (BG) and swan goose (SG) from Shengjin Lake (SJL) and Poyang Lake (PYL) in the Yangtze River Floodplain, China. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA V4 region was employed to depict the composition and structure of geese gut microbiota during wintering period. The dominant bacterial phyla across all samples were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, but significant variations were detected among different goose species and sampling sites, in terms of a diversity, community structures and microbial interactions. We found a significant correlation between diet and the microbial community structure in GWFG-SJL samples. These results demonstrated that host species and diet are potential drivers of goose gut microbiota assemblies. Despite these variations, functions of geese gut microbiota were similar, with great abundances of potential genes involved in nutrient metabolism. This preliminary study would be valuable for future, exhaustive investigations of geese gut microbiota and their interactions with host.					杨, 预展/J-3027-2012; Deng, Ye/X-4358-2019	?, ?/0000-0002-7584-0632; Cao, Lei/0000-0002-1157-0303													2045-2322					SEP 7	2016	6								32655	10.1038/srep32655	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep32655								27600170					WOS:000382605900001

This analysis provides insight into the dynamics of strong, local precipitation events and has the potential to improve projections of precipitation from coarse-grid numerical simulations. Precipitation observations between 1960 and 1999 are taken from 13 rain gauges located in the Poyang lake catchment, which is a sub-catchment of the Yangtze River. The analysis shows that the observations are linked to daily patterns of relative vorticity at 850 hPa (Vo850) and vertical velocity at 500 hPa (W500) taken from the ERA-40 re-analysis data set. The patterns are derived by two approaches: (a) empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and (b) rotated EOF analysis. Vo850 and W500 refer to geostrophic and ageostrophic processes, respectively. A logistic regression connects the large-scale dynamics to the local observations, whereby a forward regression selects the patterns best suited as predictors for the probability of exceeding thresholds of 24 h accumulated rainfall at the gauges. The regression model is verified by cross-validation. The spatial structure of the detected patterns can be interpreted in terms of well-known meso-a-scale disturbances called Southwest vortices. Overall, the proposed EOF and rotated EOF patterns are both related to physical processes and have the potential to work as predictors for exceedance rates of local precipitation in the Poyang catchment.

With these questions in mind, a survey of 89 full-time farmers was conducted in spring 1996 and subsequently supplemented by the results of a study involving 131 full-time farmers made in summer 1995, which were also taken into consideration. Both surveys took place in different regions of Baden-Wurttemberg and were based on personal interviews and a standardised questionnaire. The results are given in the following summary: Re a) Of the farmers interviewed, 24% cultivated renewable raw materials (rape only) on their total set-aside land and 13% on part of it. Only 28% of the farmers gave profitability as their reason for cultivating renewable raw materials, whereas 76% declared ii was in the interests of crop rotation. The farmers who had turned their set-aside land over to grass had done so from a conviction that it would not be profitable to grow renewable raw materials on it. Re b) The majority of the farmers who had planted grass on their set-aside land had ploughed the resultant savings in resources (machine-hours, economies in expenditure from working capital) back into their farms. However, due mainly to their uncertainty regarding the further development of the set-aside scheme, these capacities had not been harnessed to increase income.																			0005-9080					DEC	1996	74	4					514	526																WOS:A1996WE71400002

Patterns of hydrogen peroxide among lakes of the Mackenzie Delta, western Canadian Arctic	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in Mackenzie Delta lakes varies in composition and concentration, ranging from low concentrations and high colour in frequently flooded lakes to high concentrations in clear lakes that are infrequently flooded. DOC is a precursor to the photochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) in lake waters. Here we assessed the patterns of H(2)O(2) using three approaches: (i) H(2)O(2) levels were tracked in 40 lakes during the open water season from the Arctic summer solstice (24 h sunlight) to late summer; (ii) diurnal dynamics of in situ H(2)O(2) were tracked in a pair of lakes with contrasting DOC regimes (coloured vs. noncoloured DOC); and (iii) buildup of H(2)O(2) was tracked in experimental microcosms of lake water exposed to manipulated UV levels. H(2)O(2) levels were highest at the solstice and in intermittently flooded lakes. During 24 h daylight, lakes with contrasting DOC regimes showed cumulative build up of H(2)O(2) during multiple cloudless days. Cumulatively, H(2)O(2) was highest in the Delta lake with a higher DOC concentration and low in colour. H(2)O(2) buildup in lake water shielded from UVB exposure was not significantly lower from microcosms under full sunlight. UVA was the most important in coloured DOC photobleaching and H(2)O(2) production.

J	Summers, RW; Underhill, LG				Summers, RW; Underhill, LG			The dispersion of Arctic breeding birds according to snow-free patch dimensions during the spring thaw in the north eastern Taimyr Peninsula, Russia	POLAR BIOLOGY												The dispersion of passerines, ptarmigan Lagopus mutus and waders in relation to available snow-free patches is described after spring arrival but prior to the main thaw at Pronchishcheva Lake, north-eastern Taimyr, in June 1991. The numbers of ptarmigan and passerines were proportional to patch perimeter but disproportionately more birds occurred on smaller patches. In contrast, wader numbers were proportional to patch area but disproportionately more occurred along the perimeters of large patches. These patterns are discussed in relation to risk of predation and food availability. We speculate that the predation risk is higher in small patches for uniformly coloured birds but may be lower for white and pied species. The availability of overwintering plants, fresh plant growth and insects is thought to be highest at the perimeters of snow-free patches.

J	Kellett, DK; Alisauskas, RT				Kellett, Dana K.; Alisauskas, Ray T.			Ornithogenic alteration of a tundra ecosystem from decades of intense herbivory and dense nesting	ECOSPHERE												Migratory animals can serve as ecological links between geographically distant ecosystems. Moreover, when seasonally linked ecosystems differ in carrying capacity of migrant species, those with high capacity may support population growth with consequences to shared ecosystems with lower capacity through trophic cascades. Agricultural production has increased carrying capacity of lesser snow (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) and Ross's geese (Anser rossii, collectively, "light geese") in southern agricultural landscapes where these species winter and stage during migration to and from northern breeding areas, resulting in population increase. In subarctic and arctic ecosystems where carrying capacity for geese is lower, high abundance and densities of light geese have caused trophic cascades during summer breeding. This has raised concern for resilience of northern ecosystems to withstand cumulative and intense pressures of above- and belowground herbivory and nest construction. We investigated the empirical relationship between intensity of vegetation disturbance by multidecadal foraging and nest construction by up to similar to 1.3 million geese and shifts in (1) plant community composition and (2) taxon richness of freshwater plant communities near Karrak Lake, in Canada's central arctic. Intense use by nesting light geese caused shifts from lowland communities dominated by grasses and sedges (collectively, graminoids), Sphagnum spp., and willows (Salix spp.) to those comprised of exposed peat, non-Sphagnum mosses, marsh ragwort (Tephroseris palustris), mare's tail (Hippuris vulgaris), and particularly birch (Betula glandulosa). Community change was less apparent in upland regions that were naturally less vegetated even in the absence of avian herbivores, but fruticose lichens, crowberry (Empetrum nigrum), and white heather (Cassiope tetragona) dominated undisturbed plant communities, whereas crustose lichens and bearberry (Arctostaphylos spp.) comprised disturbed communities. We did not find evidence for dominance by a limited number of species with long-term occupancy by light geese, as taxon richness was equivocal between disturbed and undisturbed plant communities. Cessation of foraging and nesting pressure increased taxon richness and reestablishment of locally eradicated plant species. Overall, herbivory and nesting effects were not uniform across this widespread nesting colony and, together with underlying influence from abiotic gradients, increased heterogeneity in the mosaic of vegetation communities.																			2150-8925					FEB	2025	16	2							e70169	10.1002/ecs2.70169	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.70169													WOS:001427542900001

Effects of nitrogen and phosphorus load reduction on benthic phosphorus release in a riverine lake	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The Lower Havel in Berlin is a polymictic riverine lake, thermally stratified for some days or weeks in summer. It is characterized by a relatively high mean total phosphorus concentration (145 A mu g l(-1)) and frequent cyanobacteria mass development in summer. We quantified the potentially mobile P pool in sediments, determined P fluxes based on conventional dialysis sampler-, gel probe- and benthic chamber measurements, and combined this with column experiments and P budget calculations to evaluate whether a) a reduction of P loading would be counterbalanced by P release from sediment, and b) release of redox sensitive P would even increase with reduction of nitrogen loading. The potentially mobile P pool was relatively small (228 t) compared to mean annual external load (190 t a(-1)) and gross P release (1.2-36 mg m(-2) day(-1)), and was thus of little relevance for long-term P availability. Despite 38 % of P in the sediment being redox sensitive, the seasonal course of P gross release was mainly driven by redox independent organic matter mineralization of diagenetically young surface sediment. Under anoxic conditions, P release was higher than under oxic conditions and to some extent controlled by nitrate under laboratory conditions. However, ambient nitrate availability was too low to affect P release which was more dependent on mineralization and Fe availability than on redox. Therefore, the Lower Havel would benefit from P load reduction but internal P loading would be largely unaffected from further N load reduction.					; Dadi, Tallent/AAR-1073-2021	Dadi, Tallent/0000-0002-0605-3707; 													0168-2563	1573-515X				MAR	2015	123	1-2					185	202		10.1007/s10533-014-0062-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-014-0062-3													WOS:000350675300012

Lake morphometry controls the remobilization and long-term geochemical imprint of distal tephra deposition	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Deposition of distal tephra-fall deposits in lake systems with low watershed sediment fluxes can represent large geochemical anomalies in sediment elemental composition. We examine the persistence of compositional effects of fallout from the 7.63 kyr BP Mt. Mazama caldera-forming event and other tephra deposits in the micro-laminated abyssal sediments of Pettit Lake, central Idaho, which received 50 kg m(-2) of Mazama tephra-fall material. Persistent post-depositional dominance of the Mazama material is reflected in elemental composition and grain size distribution and is related to lake hypsometry and the presence of a large in-lake sediment reservoir subject to remobilization. Decoupling of recycled clastic mineral material with Mazama compositional affinity from both biogenic matter and from clastic material derived from within the watershed is shown by coherence between dated primary tephras and a radiocarbon chronology.

J	Scharf, W				Scharf, W			Restoration of the highly eutrophic lingese reservoir	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Restoration of the highly eutrophic softwater Lingese Reservoir was less successful than expected because of the failure to reduce P-recycling from the sediments and to improve food web interactions. After sewage diversion reduced the external TP-load, lake TP concentrations responded promptly because of the high flushing rate. However, despite artificial mixing, summer anaerobic sediment surface conditions could not be prevented and, consequently, phosphorus released from the sediments supported summer algal growth. In the pre-diversion period, the utilisation of nutrients by the summer phytoplankton, expressed as chlorophyll concentrations per unit TP, was very high not only because there was little grazing on the algae, but also because of intense nutrient regeneration and redistribution of the available P-pool. Evidence is provided that the zooplankton (rotifers, Bosmina, Cyclops) enhanced algal growth. In spite of the presence of a rich food resource ( Cryptomonas), large daphnids (> 1.25 mm) never occurred, due to severe predation by a huge cyprinid fish stock. These fish were not reduced by manipulation of their trophic conditions or by the stocking of piscivores ('gentle biomanipulation'). Due to a lack of benthic habitat, food resources were scarce for adult cyprinids and most of the energy was channeled through the 'detritus via Bosmina' food chain, which acted as an energy sink, as indicated by dwarfism of the planktivorous fish. Nutrient removal resulted in a sudden decrease of phyto- and zooplankton biomass ('bottom-up') but without any change in seasonality and composition of the phytoplankton. The zooplankton started to recover slowly but the food chain never switched to 'grazing via Daphnia'. In the presence of an unchanged fish stock, only small daphnids (< 1.25 mm), at low density reappeared, presumably due to improved hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations now providing a refuge. Although herbivory remained low, the Chl/TP-ratio decreased after nutrient removal. Sediment treatment and implementation of an appropriate fishery management, supported by 'gentle artificial mixing' are required for successful restoration of Lingese Reservoir. This would provide oxygenated deep water as a refuge for Daphnia, improve the benthic food resource for the fish and favour the growth of edible algae (i.e. cryptomonads).																			0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	1999	416						85	96		10.1023/A:1003851102095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003851102095													WOS:000085130100008
J	ELY, CR; RAVELING, DG				ELY, CR; RAVELING, DG			BREEDING BIOLOGY OF PACIFIC WHITE-FRONTED GEESE	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Nesting ecology of Pacific white-fronted geese (A. a. frontalis) was studied on a 9.9 km2 area on the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta, Alaska, [USA], during 1977-1979. Availability of nesting habitat varied considerably among years because of differences in the time of snow and icemelt. Mean clutch size was 3.7 eggs in the late spring thaw year and 5.2 and 5.7 eggs in early snowmelt years. Peak (and duration) of nest initiation was 1-2 June (16 days) in the late spring and 15-18 May (20-21 days) during early spring. When nest sites were available early, the time interval between arrival and date of nest initiation closely approximated the time required for rapid yolk development. Whitefronts may be physiologically prevented from nesting earlier in such years. The duration of nest initiation was comparable to that of other goose species nesting on the Y-K Delta, but longer than for goose populations of several species nesting farther north or in the midcontinent. Overall, 68% of whitefront nests were in lowland habitat, 23% in intermediate habitat and 10% in upland habitat, but habitat use varied significantly between early and late years. Whitefronts most commonly nested on slough banks (55%), lake shores (23%) and grass-sedge meadows (11%). A quantitative description of vegetation associated with nest sites is given. Major causes of nest destruction were flooding (28%) and predation (9%). Nesting success over the 3-yr period averaged 62%.

Both areas have multiple uses, including drinking water supply, fisheries, and recreation. The first area, Meiliang Bay, is much closer to central lake and subjected to wind-driven sediment resuspension, while the second, at Wuli Lake, is less affected by wave action but is considered more nutrient-rich due to its proximity to human inhabitation. By comparing two lake areas, we attempt to advance the understanding and management of different regions of shallow lakes, mainly differing in resuspension levels and eutrophication levels. A comparison of these two lake areas indicated a higher standing crop of phytoplankton in Wuli Lake than in Meiliang Bay. Canonic Correspondence Analysis indicated that nutrient status and sediment resuspension were the principal factors influencing phytoplankton composition in both areas. The dominant algal group in Meiliang Bay comprised immobile R-type strategists (Reynolds in Growth and reproductive strategies of freshwater phytoplankton, 1988), including filamentous diatoms and green algae (Aulacoseira granulate and Planctonema lauterbornii), and recruitment-beneficial RS-type strategists, mainly the colonial cyanobacteria (Microcystis spp.). The community of Wuli Lake was dominated by S-strategists, principally motile flagellates (Cryptomonas spp.) and C-strategists including small nonmotile centric diatoms and chlorococcal green algae.

The same model but with different parameters may lead to diverse simulations of the hydrological phenomena. Hence, the choice of a calibration method may affect the model performance. The present paper is the first study analyzing how the choice of air2water model calibration procedure may influence projections of surface water temperature in lowland lakes under future climatic conditions. To address this issue, projections from 14 atmospheric circulation models, data from 22 lowland Polish lakes located in a temperate climate zone, and 12 different optimization algorithms are employed. The studied lake areas range from 1.5 km2 to 115 km2, and their maximum depths range from 2.5 m to 70 m. Depending on which calibration algorithm is applied, the differences in mean monthly surface water temperatures projected for future climatic conditions may exceed 1.5 degrees C for a small deep lake. On the contrary, the differences observed for shallow and relatively large lakes, due to the optimization procedure used, were lower than 0.6 degrees C each month. The largest differences in projected lake water temperatures were observed for the winter and summer months, which are especially critical for aquatic biota. Among the optimization algorithms resulting in the largest differences were those that fit historical data well, as well as those that do not reproduce historical data appropriately. Therefore, strong performance for historical data does not guarantee reliable projections for future conditions. We have shown that projected lake water temperatures largely depend on the calibration method used for a particular model.

J	Gao, QJ; Zhang, ZQ; Zhu, YS; Chen, SY				Gao, Qingjiu; Zhang, Ziqi; Zhu, Yesheng; Chen, Shuyi			Analysis of Intraseasonal Oscillation Features of Winter Cold Precipitation Events in Southern China	ATMOSPHERE												Based on the daily minimum air temperature (T-min) data and the daily precipitation data from the NCC/CMA combined with the NCEP/DOE reanalysis data, the intraseasonal features and circulations of the winter cold precipitation events (CPEs) in southern China under the influence of strong Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) were explored. The results show that: (1) Winter temperatures in southern China are characterized by intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) of 10-30-d and 30-60-d, with six CPEs under strong MJO all occurring during these two intraseasonal scales in cooling phases. The invasion of cold air coupled with the availability of appropriate moisture conditions in southern China is more conducive to the CPEs. (2) A cyclone and anticyclone lying to the east of the Ural Mountains and the northwest of Lake Baikal at 925-hPa gradually move southeastward. The merging of the low-frequency (LF) blocking highs over the Ural Mountains and the North Pacific Ocean at 500-hPa leads to the contraction and southward movement of the LF cold vortex. The following anomalous northerly winds steer the cold air towards southern China. The cold advection is the dominant term in the cooling process, while the adiabatic cooling accompanied with ascending motion is also beneficial to the cooling process. (3) MJO has some effect on the LF blocking highs and the cold vortex in the mid-high latitudes and induces the CPEs over southern China. The joint effect of mid-high and low latitudes on the 30-60-d intraseasonal oscillation scale can have a significant impact on the cooling and precipitation processes of CPEs.

J	Chandesris, A; Van Looy, K; Diamond, JS; Souchon, Y				Chandesris, Andre; Van Looy, Kris; Diamond, Jacob S.; Souchon, Yves			Small dams alter thermal regimes of downstream water	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												The purpose of this study was to quantify the downstream impacts of different types of small dams on summer water temperature in lowland streams. We examined (1) temperature regimes upstream and downstream of dams with different structural characteristics, (2) relationships between stream temperature anomalies and climatic variables, watershed area, dam height, impoundment length and surface area, and residence time, (3) the most significant variables explaining the different thermal behaviors, and (4) the dam thermal effect considering a biological threshold of 22 degrees C, with a calculation of both the number of days with a temperature above this threshold and the average hourly duration above this threshold. Water temperature loggers were installed upstream and downstream of 11 dams in the Bresse region (France) and monitored at 30 min intervals during summer (June to September) over the 2009-2016 period, resulting in 13 paired water temperature time series (two sites were monitored for two summers, allowing the opportunity to compare cold and hot summers). At 23% of the dams, we observed increased downstream maximum daily temperatures of more than 1 degrees C; at the remaining dams we observed changes in the maximum daily temperature of -1 to 1 degrees C. Across sites, the mean downstream increase of the minimum daily temperature was 1 degrees C, and for 85% of the sites this increase was higher than 0.5 degrees C. We hierarchically clustered the sites based on three temperature anomaly variables: upstream-downstream differences in (1) maximum daily temperature (Delta T-max), (2) minimum daily temperature (Delta T-min), and (3) daily temperature amplitude (Delta T-amp). The cluster analysis identified two main types of dam effects on thermal regime: (1) a downstream increase in T-min associated with T-max either unchanged or slightly reduced for impoundments of low volume (i.e., a residence time shorter than 0.7 d and a surface area less than 35 000 m(2)), and (2) a downstream increase of both T-min and T-max of the same order of magnitude for impoundments of larger volume (i.e., a residence time longer than 0.7 d and a surface area greater than 35 000 m(2)). These downstream temperature increases reached 2.4 degrees C at certain structures with the potential to impair the structure of aquatic communities and the functioning of the aquatic ecosystem. Overall, we show that small dams can meaningfully alter the thermal regimes of flowing waters, and that these that these effects can be explained with sufficient accuracy (R-2 = 0.7) using two simple measurements of small dam physical attributes. This finding may have importance for modelers and managers who desire to understand and restore the fragmented thermalscapes of river networks.

J	Massaferro, J; Corley, J				Massaferro, J; Corley, J			Environmental disturbance and chironomid palaeodiversity: 15 kyr BP of history at Lake Mascardi, Patagonia, Argentina	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. Palaeoecological records may be useful in predicting the ecological outcomes for certain communities exposed to natural and human disturbance. In turn, theoretical work has emphasized the importance of baseline information on diversity to establish precise conservation and restoration policies. 2. Lake sediments provide good evidence of long-term changes in community composition, especially of insects from the family Chironomidae. Midge fauna is highly diverse and their remains are well preserved in sequential order allowing the construction of past assemblages. 3. To assess long-term community trends and stability in an environment virtually free from human impact, fossil midge assemblages were collected from a sediment core at Lake Mascardi (Rio Negro, Argentina). Shannon's diversity index as well as rank-abundance relationships were estimated for core subsamples (10 cm slices), using a 'taxonomic minimalist' approach. 4. Diversity levels are relatively constant along the core. However, sharp reductions in diversity and equitability in midge assemblages are recorded. These reductions appear to be related to natural variability-mainly ash falls (pulse) and climatic (press) disturbing events. During pulse disturbances, both diversity and equitability fall, recovering rapidly after pressure is released. During press events (long-term disturbances) equitability falls whereas diversity remains fairly constant. Subfamily succession between pulse disturbances, follows proposed ecological species rank-abundance models. 5. These findings suggest that at long time-scales, a low level of taxonomic detail may be adequate for the analysis of community responses to environmental change. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A Delayed Incubation Membrane Filter Test for Coliform Bacteria in Water	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE NATIONS HEALTH												A delayed incubation coliform test on membrane filters is described for field application where shipment of refrigerated fluid samples cannot be made or during periods of natural or wartime emergency. This procedure consists of (1) filtration of sample at collection site; (2) placement of membrane on the preservative medium, i.e., benzoated Endo medium; (3) wrapping of individual Petri dishes in squares of "Parafilm"; followed by (4) unrefrigerated shipment to a laboratory for completion of the bacterial examination. This delayed incubation test was studied in parallel with MPN determinations on stored liquid samples and results from both were compared with results from an initial 5 tube, 3 dilution MPN test. The comparison was made on samples from 6 sources, consisting of 3 rivers, 2 farm wells, and a lake. From each source 3 samples were examined in a winter and in a summer series. Storage of liquid samples was at 5[degree]C, room temperature (13-32[degree]C) and at 35[degree]C for periods of 24, 48, and 72 hours. MPN coliform counts made on these liquid samples held at 5[degree]C for periods up to 72 hours were quite-variable but more closely approximated the initial MPN results than did the counts from liquid samples stored at 13-32[degree]C or at 35[degree]C. Estimations of coliform densities in water by use of the delayed incubation MF technique at 13-32[degree]C indicated good agreement with the MPN on stored samples at 5[degree]C but tend to be less than the initial MPN. The MF storage results at room temperature and at 35[degree]C were superior to results of MPN procedures on liquid samples stored more than 24 hours at room temperature or 35[degree]C.

Quantifying Recent Ecological Changes in Remote Lakes of North America and Greenland Using Sediment Diatom Assemblages	PLOS ONE												Background: Although arctic lakes have responded sensitively to 20(th)-century climate change, it remains uncertain how these ecological transformations compare with alpine and montane-boreal counterparts over the same interval. Furthermore, it is unclear to what degree other forcings, including atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen (Nr), have participated in recent regime shifts. Diatom-based paleolimnological syntheses offer an effective tool for retrospective assessments of past and ongoing changes in remote lake ecosystems. Methodology/Principal Findings: We synthesized 52 dated sediment diatom records from lakes in western North America and west Greenland, spanning broad latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, and representing alpine (n = 15), arctic (n = 20), and forested boreal-montane (n = 17) ecosystems. Diatom compositional turnover (beta-diversity) during the 20(th) century was estimated using Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA) for each site and compared, for cores with sufficiently robust chronologies, to both the 19(th) century and the prior similar to 250 years (Little Ice Age). For both arctic and alpine lakes, beta-diversity during the 20(th) century is significantly greater than the previous 350 years, and increases with both latitude and altitude. Because no correlation is apparent between 20(th)-century diatom beta-diversity and any single physical or limnological parameter (including lake and catchment area, maximum depth, pH, conductivity, [NO3-], modeled Nr deposition, ambient summer and winter air temperatures, and modeled temperature trends 1948-2008), we used Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to summarize the amplitude of recent changes in relationship to lake pH, lake: catchment area ratio, modeled Nr deposition, and recent temperature trends. Conclusions/Significance: The ecological responses of remote lakes to post-industrial environmental changes are complex. However, two regions reveal concentrations of sites with elevated 20(th)-century diatom beta-diversity: the Arctic where temperatures are increasing most rapidly, and mid-latitude alpine lakes impacted by high Nr deposition rates. We predict that remote lakes will continue to shift towards new ecological states in the Anthropocene, particularly in regions where these two forcings begin to intersect geographically.

J	PYROVETSI, M; PAPASTERGIADOU, E				PYROVETSI, M; PAPASTERGIADOU, E			BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS OF WATER-LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS IN A WETLAND OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE - LAKE KERKINI, MACEDONIA, GREECE	ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION												Kerkini Lake in Greece, a reservoir maintained principally for agricultural irrigation purposes on the Strymon River, has been classified as a 'Wetland of International Importance' according to the Ramsar Convention. Hydrological conditions favoured the formation of a shallow, very productive lake, rich in species diversity and biotic abundance. The importance of the wetland lay in its complex zonation of various habitats which mainly consisted of: shallow open water with sand-strips, beaches, and mud-flats; shallow-water areas with communities of emergent vegetation; a lowland hardwood riparian forest mainly of Salix and Tamarix species; a shrub-swamp; and extensive wet meadows. The diversity of habitats supported a rich waterbird fauna for breeding, stationing during migration, and wintering. Nevertheless, in 1982 a new high-dam was constructed, higher embankments along the banks of the Lake were established, and other works were carried out (to increase the water capacity of the reservoir), in response to irrigation demands. No consideration was given to the wetland resources. Operation of the new dam resulted in changes in the flooding etc. regime, with severe impact on the biotic resources of the wetland, especially by water-level increases of more than 5 m in less than 4 months during spring - the critical growing- and breeding-season. Wetland heterogeneity and the mosaic structure of water-land-vegetation were thereby lost. Now the riparian forest is diminishing in area and declining in productivity, the reed-swamp with emergent macrophytes has been lost, and wet meadows have also disappeared. Deep flooding and the loss of these habitats is reflected in marked decline in the densities of migratory waterbird populations and, most important, in drastic shrinkage in the populations of breeding species. Similar impact is observed in the dramatic decline of fish species diversity and abundance. In general, nowadays, Kerkini presents an alarming example of loss of biodiversity and accelerating impoverishment of its former biotic resources. In view of the projected plans to increase further the water-storage capacity of the Lake by raising its water-level, measures are urgently needed: (a) for preventing such actions; (b) for restoring and maintaining marsh conditions, and (c) for ecologically sound management and sustainable use of the wetland resources.					; PAPASTERGIADOU, EVA/J-8455-2012	Papastergiadou, Eva/0000-0003-4430-878X; 													0376-8929					FAL	1992	19	3					235	244		10.1017/S0376892900031039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0376892900031039													WOS:A1992KJ80500011

Two methods, Linear Regression (LR) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART), are used to develop empirical models of the interannual variations of maximum ice cover. Thirty-four winter seasons between 1963 and 1998 and nine teleconnection indices were used in the analysis. The ice cover characteristics were different for each Great Lake. The ice cover data lent itself better to CART analysis, because CART does not require a priori assumptions about data distributions characteristics to perform well. The stepwise LR models needed more variables, and in general, did not explain as much of the variance as the CART models. Two variables, the Multivariate ENSO index and Tropical/Northern Hemisphere index, explained much of the interannual variations in ice cover in the CART models. Composite atmospheric circulation patterns for threshold values of these two indices were found to be associated with above-and below-normal ice cover in the Great Lakes. Thus, CART also provided insight into physical mechanisms (atmospheric circulation characteristics) underlying the statistical relationships identified in the models.					; Rodionov, Sergei/KJL-0449-2024	Rodionov, Sergei/0000-0002-5318-9746; 													0380-1330						2001	27	4					486	502		10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70662-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70662-4													WOS:000173010400008

Cenoses of phototrophic algae of ultrasaline lakes in the Kulunda steppe (Altai krai, Russian Federation)	OCEANOLOGY												In 2012, expeditions of the Institute of Microbiology, Russian Academy of Sciences, delivered samples of algo-bacterial mats from Kulunda steppe alkaline lakes (Petukhovskoe alkaline lake, Tanatar VI, and Gorchina III). The filamentous alga Ctenocladus circinnatus (Chlorophyta) acted as an edificator of the mats. The composition of cenoses algocomponents also included chlorophytes Dunaliella viridis and Picocystis salinarum as well as diatoms Anomeoneis sphaerophora, Brachysira brebissonii, B. zellensis, Mastogloia pusilla var. subcapitata, Nitzschia amphibia, N. cf. communis, and Nitzschia sp. 1. The composition and structure of phototrophic algae cenoses (including diatom taxocenes) were described for the investigated lakes for the first time. For the period from 2011 to 2012, the total mineralization significantly increased in lakes. This involved sensible alterations of cenoses. B. zellensis was the most permanent component of diatom taxocenes in both seasons. In the summer of 2011, it was often accompanied by A. sphaerophora and B. brebissonii. In the summer of 2012, A. sphaerophora was found only singularly in Lake Gorchina III, and some biotopes of Lake Tanatar VI were massively inhabited by N. cf. communis, including colonies that had not been previously described for the species. The genetic analysis of three diatoms, which are markedly different from each other in their appearance and were sampled from different lakes but were all determined as Nitzschia cf. communis, showed their complete similarity to each other with the 18S rRNA gene fragment and the highest similarity of all the three diatoms with the species Nitzschia communis.

ESTIMATING VULNERABILITY OF WATER BODY USING SENTINEL-2 IMAGES AND PREDICTIVE EUTROPHICATION MODELS: the STUDY CASE OF BRACCIANO LAKE (Italy)	EARTH OBSERVATION ADVANCEMENTS IN A CHANGING WORLD	AIT Series: Trends in Earth Observation											Due to the concomitance of several factors related to progressive climate changes and to increased water management for anthropogenic usage, drastic fall in level of Bracciano Lake was reported in the summer of 2017. By November 2017, the water level decreased 0,198 meters below the hydrometric zero established at 163.04 meters s.l.m. Such alarming rate has not been detected in the last seventeen years. The consistent change in water level causes modifications in its environment, on the edge of the coasts and specifically, brings about an increase in the rate of eutrophication (trophic enrichment phenomenon). The determination of the volume of water contained in the lake basin was estimated with GIS tools modeling, by analysing the bathymetry of the water body and applying the supervised classification of Sentinel-2 images; this allowed to identify the reservoir and consequently to reconstruct the course of the coastline. Once defined the hydrometric reduction in the water body for the observed period, the Vollenweider model, that calculates the trophic state of a lake, was used to quantify nutrients concentration and relative increase of eutrophication status as a consequence of the anthropic activities practiced in the belonging basin. The quantification of the water level changes of Bracciano Lake, before and after the hydrometric crisis, occurred in 2017, related to the estimate of the level of eutrophication, allows us to define the degree of vulnerability of the lake ecosystem. The proposed methodology represents an efficient monitoring tool for assessing the vulnerability of water bodies influenced by eutrophication.																					978-88-944687-1-7				2019	1						151	155				10.978.88944687/17												WOS:000925225700038

Picocyanobacteria in eutrophic reservoirs of the Middle Volga: Abundance, production, viral infection	ZHURNAL OBSHCHEI BIOLOGII												During the summer season of 2010, abundance and productivity of picocyanobacteria in Gorky and Cheboksary Reservoirs have being examined. It is found out that in the eutrophic reservoirs of the Middle Volga abundance and biomass of picocyanobacteria, averaged over the water column, varied within the range of (34-322) x 103 cells/ml and 38-455 mg/m3 respectively. In more productive Cheboksary Reservoir, the contribution of picocyanobacteria in total biomass and production of phytoplankton (4.7 0.7 and 8.3 1.3% respectively) was lower than in less productive Gorky Reservoir (10.6 2.1 and 19.2 3.0% respectively). In both reservoirs, high level of picocyanobacteria infection by viruses was detected. The frequency of visible infected cells and virus-induced mortality of picocyanobacteria in Cheboksary Reservoir were substantially higher (3.2 0.4% of total abundance and 21.8 2.9% of daily production) than in Gorky Reservoir (1.7 0.2% of total abundance and 11.0 1.7% of daily production). The results obtained indicate that in eutrophic reservoirs during summer bloom of large cyanobacteria their abundance is regulated to a great extent by viruses.

Calibrating water depths of Ordovician communities: lithological and ecological controls on depositional gradients in Upper Ordovician strata of southern Ohio and north-central Kentucky, USA	ESTONIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES					4th Annual Meeting of IGCP Project 591	JUN, 2014	Tartu, ESTONIA					Limestone and shale facies of the Upper Ordovician Grant Lake Formation (Katian: Cincinnatian, Maysvillian) are well exposed in the Cincinnati Arch region of southern Ohio and north-central Kentucky, USA. These rocks record a gradual change in lithofacies and biofacies along a gently northward-sloping ramp. This gradient spans very shallow, olive-gray, platy, laminated dolostones with sparse ostracodes in the south to offshore, nodular, phosphatic, brachiopod-rich limestones and marls in the north. This study uses facies analysis in outcrop to determine paleoenvironmental parameters, particularly those related to water depth (e.g., position of the photic zone and shoreline, relative degree of environmental energy). Within a tightly correlated stratigraphic interval (the Mount Auburn and Straight Creek members of the Grant Lake Formation and the Terrill Member of the Ashlock Formation), we document the occurrence of paleoenvironmental indicators, including desiccation cracks and light-depth indicators, such as red and green algal fossils and oncolites. This permitted recognition of a ramp with an average gradient of 10-20 cm water depth per horizontal kilometer. Thus, shallow subtidal ("lagoonal") deposits in the upramp portion fall within the 1.5-6 m depth range, cross-bedded grainstones representing shoal-type environments fall within the 6-18 m depth range and subtidal, shell-rich deposits in the downramp portion fall within the 20-30 m depth range. These estimates match interpretations of depth independently derived from faunal and sedimentologic evidence that previously suggested a gentle ramp gradient and contribute to ongoing and future high-resolution paleontologic and stratigraphic studies of the Cincinnati Arch region.																			1736-4728	1736-7557				MAR	2015	64	1					19	23		10.3176/earth.2015.04	http://dx.doi.org/10.3176/earth.2015.04													WOS:000351327700005

This Virtual Special Issue (VSI) explores the variability and underlying mechanisms of Asian dust storms on sub-orbital to decadal timescales through the Holocene, and comprises 20 interdisciplinary studies. In this editorial preface, we synthesize the key findings of these studies and contextualize them within broader climatic and environmental frameworks. The main insights are as follows: (1) Contemporary observations indicate a rapid increase in dust storms across the Mongolia-China border, and these phenomena now comprise a dominant component of East Asian dust storm activity. This trend is linked to enhanced Mongolian cyclonic systems, land surface degradation, and synoptic-scale atmospheric features such as cut-off lows. (2) Holocene reconstructions based on loess and lake sediment records reveal contrasting controls across regions. In humid East Asian monsoon zones, dust storms are primarily governed by hydroclimate and vegetation dynamics, whereas in arid regions-including arid Central Asia and the Tibetan Plateau-dust activity is predominantly modulated by wind regimes due to sparse vegetation cover. (3) Dust storm mechanisms vary across timescales; for example, dust activity on the Tibetan Plateau is driven by the westerlies on a millennial timescale, but it shifts to East Asian winter monsoon on the centennial timescale. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of high-resolution archives and integrative approaches for resolving dust-climate interactions in the context of ongoing and future climate change.

Heterogeneous Patterns of Aged Organic Carbon Export Driven by Hydrologic Flow Paths, Soil Texture, Fire, and Thaw in Discontinuous Permafrost Headwaters	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Climate change is thawing and potentially mobilizing vast quantities of organic carbon (OC) previously stored for millennia in permafrost soils of northern circumpolar landscapes. Climate-driven increases in fire and thermokarst may play a key role in OC mobilization by thawing permafrost and promoting transport of OC. Yet, the extent of OC mobilization and mechanisms controlling terrestrial-aquatic transfer are unclear. We demonstrate that hydrologic transport of soil dissolved OC (DOC) from the active layer and thawing permafrost to headwater streams is extremely heterogeneous and regulated by the interactions of soils, seasonal thaw, fire, and thermokarst. Repeated sampling of streams in eight headwater catchments of interior Alaska showed that the mean age of DOC for each stream ranges widely from modern to similar to 2,000 years B.P. Together, an endmember mixing model and nonlinear, generalized additive models demonstrated that Delta C-14-DOC signature (and mean age) increased from spring to fall, and was proportional to hydrologic contributions from a solute-rich water source, related to presumed deeper flow paths found predominantly in silty catchments. This relationship was correlated with and mediated by catchment properties. Mean DOC ages were older in catchments with >50% burned area, indicating that fire is also an important explanatory variable. These observations underscore the high heterogeneity in aged C export and difficulty of extrapolating estimates of permafrost-derived DOC export from watersheds to larger scales. Our results provide the foundation for developing a conceptual model of permafrost DOC export necessary for advancing understanding and prediction of land-water C exchange in changing boreal landscapes. Plain Language Summary In high latitude environments, soils that have been frozen for millennia are thawing, releasing organic carbon (OC). Thawing and export of OC to downstream aquatic ecosystems is a potential biogeochemical feedback that may accelerate climate warming if large amounts of ancient OC are transformed and released to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases. The magnitude and timing of ancient OC thaw and mobilization are not well defined, so predicting these patterns at local to global scales is challenging. Using a suite of diverse headwater catchments in the discontinuous permafrost zone of Alaska, USA, we identify the main controls on the mobilization of ancient OC from thawing landscapes into adjacent streams. Our surveys show that ancient OC export depends on the complex interaction between fire history, soil type and thawing characteristics, and seasonal warming.

Investigations into the transfer and fate of Hg have focused on inhabitants of freshwater aquatic ecosystems, as these are the habitats at greatest risk for methylmercury (MeHg) biomagnification. Deviating from such an approach, we documented MeHg availability in a terrestrial montane ecosystem using a suite of insectivorous passerines. Intensive and extensive sampling of Bicknell's thrush (Catharus bicknelli) indicated significant heterogeneity in MeHg availability across 21 mountaintops in northeastern North America. Southern parts of the breeding range tended to be at greater risk than northern parts. Mean blood Hg concentrations for Bicknell's thrush at 21 distinct breeding sites ranged from 0.08 to 0.38 ug/g (ww) and at seven Greater Antillean wintering sites ranged from 0.03 to 0.42 ug/g (ww). Overall concentrations were significantly greater in wintering than in breeding areas. Mercury exposure profiles for four passerine species on Mt. Mansfield, Vermont indicated greatest MeHg uptake in Bicknell's thrush and yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata) and lowest in blackpoll warbler (Dendroica striata) and white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis). The MeHg and total Hg ratio in blood in these four species was nearly 1:1. There was no correlation between blood and feather Hg concentrations in breeding Bicknell's thrush, in part because of apparent retention of winter Hg body burdens, within-season variation of MeHg availability, and confounding factors such as influences from age. Adult thrushes had significantly higher concentrations of feather Hg than did young-of-the-year. Although individual patterns of inter-year feather Hg concentrations were disordered, some individuals exhibited bioaccumulation of MeHg. Female blood Hg concentrations were significantly lower than males', in part because females have additional depurating mechanisms through eggs. Older male Bicknell's thrushes that breed in New England are therefore likely at greatest risk. Mechanisms for Hg methylation in montane areas without standing water are not yet fully understood. However, recent studies indicate that MeHg is present in forest tree leaves and leaf detritus; saturated soils and other moist microhabitats may also contribute to MeHg availability. Our finding of a correlation between regional litterfall Hg flux patterns and Bicknell's thrush blood Hg concentrations demonstrates on-site availability of MeHg. Further investigations into MeHg availability in montane environments are recommended to assess risk to insectivorous passerines, particularly the Bicknell's thrush.

Mean width of daily increments at distances between 20 and 170 pm from the otolith core were significantly higher in Landvik herring (peak spawning in May) compared with the two other populations, Coastal Skagerrak spring spawners (peak spawning in March-April) and Norwegian spring spawning herring (peak spawning in February-March). These population differences were observed for all studied year classes and years and highly consistent with expected temperature dependent larval growth based on timing of successive spawning events. The observed patterns imply that timing of spawning was population specific with a tendency of adult herring to spawn at the same time and under the same conditions as they hatched themselves. This was also supported by vertebral counts, which are negatively correlated with temperatures during the embryonic stage. Firstly, Landvik herring which experienced higher ambient temperature during the embryonic stage were characterised by significantly lower counts than herring from the two other populations. Secondly, daily otolith growth also tended to decrease with increasing vertebral counts within the populations. The present study signifies the importance of otolith growth history for population discrimination in herring, even within the same spawning season, and further supports the use of vertebral counts in the continuous discussion on herring population structure, assessment and management.

Large-scale, seasonal movements of radiotagged, adult bull trout in the St. Mary River drainage, Montana and Alberta	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												Radio telemetry was used to determine the large-scale, seasonal movements and wintering areas of adult bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) in the St. Mary River drainage, Montana and Alberta, between 1998 and 2003. The fish (n = 42; total length, 434-763 mm) had been radiotagged in their spawning creeks (river tributaries) during August-October. Data from automated, stationary radio receivers operated adjacent to the river showed the post-spawning and subsequent pre-spawning movements of tagged bull trout occurred during October-November and May-July, respectively. Searches conducted from the ground and aircraft during winter (December-April) found tagged fish (n = 22) distributed in the St. Mary River between the mouth of Lee Creek (Alberta) and Lower St. Mary Lake (Montana), and in the tributaries (n = 15 fish). Maximum stream distance between contact locations for individual fish (median, 25.5 km; range, 1-83 km) was not associated with fish length or weight when tagged. Some bull trout passed the St. Mary River diversion dam, although passage timing was not precisely determined and may have occurred when the dam was open. Nevertheless, upstream passage of some bull trout appeared to be impeded by the dam during pre-spawning movements, when the dam was closed for the irrigation season.

Understanding the variability and related dynamic mechanisms of the ISM on orbital-millennial time scale provides insight into the metastable nature of the Earth's system, which offers favorable conditions for disaster prevention and mitigation. Here, we present a multiproxy record spanning the late Marine Isotope Stage 3 (40.2-0.0 cal ka BP), including median grain size, n-alkane distribution pattern, hydrogen isotope of C31 n-alkane (delta DC31), and stable oxygen isotope of endogenic carbonates (delta 18Ocarb) from Lake Xingyun in southwestern China. The results showed that the ISM relatively strong during 40.2-30.0 cal ka BP, weakened during 30.0-16.0 cal ka BP and then it was progressively enhanced during 16.0-11.7 cal ka BP. The strongest ISM occurred during 10.7-6.5 cal ka BP and became weakened during 6.5-0.0 cal ka BP. The ISM precipitation increased overall with rising temperatures on the orbital scale despite of some millennial exceptions. The ISM variations were strongly controlled by changes in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, and influenced by Earth's boundary conditions (i.e., CO2 concentration and ice sheets) during the glacial-interglacial period. Moreover, the Heinrich Events (i.e., H3, H2, and H1) and Younger Dryas (YD) occurred in different climatic states of the Earth system, and thus the ISM responded differently in magnitude to these millennial-scale cold events. As such, the ISM during Heinrich Events (i.e., H3, H2, and H1) was more significantly weakened than that during the YD. These findings highlight the complexity of ISM changes with different warming scenarios, and provide a perspective for understanding the different hydrological responses to abrupt cold events in terms of magnitude.

The lake is situated in an area contaminated by Chernobyl fallout. Sampling was carried out during the spring peak discharge period associated with snowmelt. Transported coarse particulate plant material was collected by traps. Particles and colloids were removed from water samples by hollow fibre ultrafiltration. The results illustrate that run-off during the spring snowmelt is an important pathway for these radionuclides. The cesium isotopes are predominantly transported as colloids, while Sr-90 is present in the form of low molecular weight mobile species. Based on lake budget calculations, more than 50% of the cesium input is retained in the lake, while more than 90% of the Sr-90 is transported through the lake and into lower parts of the drainage system.																			0236-5731					JAN	1992	156	1					7	20		10.1007/BF02037418	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02037418													WOS:A1992HD45500002

The present study aimed to assess the water level rise in Lake Beseka using Landsat images from 1975 to 2023 and dilution trends at the pumping site from 2004 to 2022. In addition, the spatial water quality parameters, including pH, EC, TDS, and water surface temperature, for the years 2007, 2018, 2021, and 2023 were determined. The water level increased dramatically from 3 km2 in the 1960s to 27.5 km2 in 1980 following the construction of the Koka dam and the beginning of irrigation activity (sugarcane plantation) for the Metehara sugar estate factory. The water level reached a maximum (50 km2 in the dry season) in the mid of 1910s and become decreased and fluctuated after 2015. The observed pH, EC, and TDS were higher in the central portion of the lake, grouped under brackish water, and lower in the southwest, south, and northeast shores. The EC and TDS were higher in 2007, decreased in 2018, and fluctuated. The geothermal anomaly of the area varies from 23.1 to 47.9 degrees C with the highest anomaly occurring at the northern side of the lake at a recent volcanic area that interlinked with geological structures. However, the observed and estimated water temperatures of the lake decreased from west to east due to hot spring discharge from the southwest shore of the lake. The series of hot springs in the southwest and west shores of the lake with high discharge rates indicate the presence of structural connectivity that leads to the emission of heat from a deep-seated source and heated groundwater of the area recharged from irrigation activity. Overall, spatiotemporal lake water quality variations were due to anthropogenic and geogenic factors, including hot springs and groundwater discharge to the lake, water level rise and bathymetric depth variation, evaporation, and irrigation activity. This study is significant in continuously estimating water level fluctuations and providing early warnings and preparedness to maintain the region's socioeconomic development.

J	Yong, ZJ; Feng, ZD				Yong, Zijuan; Feng, Zhaodong			Holocene precipitation variations in the northwestern half of the Chinese Loess Plateau: Pollen-based reconstructions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The northwestern half of the Chinese Loess Plateau (i.e., the examined area) is reported to have been sensitive to the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) and might have also been exposed to the influence of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) during the Holocene. This study utilizes the already reported pollen data from four high- resolution fossil pollen sequences to quantitatively reconstruct the Holocene mean annual precipitation (Pann) in the examined area. It also incorporates those quantitative precipitation reconstructions from the same area reported by others to delineate the regional Pann patterns. It finally brings the regional Pann patterns into the perceived forcing contexts to explore the underlying mechanisms. Our delineation shows that the Holocene Pann exhibits different temporal trends between the western part and the northern part of the Chinese Loess Plateau. That is, the "higher-than-average" Pann occurred in the early mid-Holocene from similar to 10.0 to similar to 5.5 cal. kyr BP in the western part and the "higher-than-average" Pann occurred in the late mid-Holocene from similar to 8.0 to similar to 2.5 cal. kyr BP in the northern part. We propose that the Pann differences between the western part and the northern part might have been associated with two mechanisms: (1) differences in the thermal sensitivity to the solar insolation between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, and (2) differences in terms of the relative importance of precipitable water vapor transports either from the ISM or from the EASM between the western part and the northern part.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				NOV 25	2024	953								176249	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176249	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176249		SEP 2024						39276995					WOS:001316675100001

Phototrophic plankton of siderotrophic meromictic Lake Kuznechikha (Republic Mari El, Russia)	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												During summer thermal stratification, a broad transition zone with hypoxic conditions is formed in meromictic ferruginous Lake Kuznechikha between the thermocline and the main gradient of water mineralization. In this zone, the chemical composition of water undergoes an ecologically significant transformation due to overlapping gradients of nutrient concentrations and redox conditions. We present an analysis of a strongly vertically structured community of prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs developing in the lake as a whole and especially in the transition zone. In early summer 2009, a sequence of phototrophic organisms with depth in order Chlorophyceae -> Chromatiales -> Chloroflexales -> Euglenales -> Chlorobiales was observed in the transition zone, while cyanobacteria were almost completely absent. Biomass maximum of anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria was located between the peaks of phototrophic picoplankton and euglenoids. Such a coexistence of oxygenic and anoxygenic phototrophs in a wide range of depths is highly unusual and sharply distinguishes Lake Kuznechikha from waterbodies with sulphide-containing monimolimnion.

The influence of the NAO on the growth of stream insects was examined using long-term empirical data on the sizes of mayfly and stonefly nymphs and oil water temperature data. Models of egg development and nymphal growth in relation to temperature were used to predict the effect of the NAO on phenology. The study was based in two upland streams in mid-Wales UK that varied in the extent of plantation forestry in their catchments. Winter stream temperatures at both sites were positively related to the winter NAO index, being warmer in positive phases and colder in negative phases. The observed mean size and the simulated developmental period of mayfly nymphs were significantly related to the winter NAO index, with nymphs growing faster in positive phases of the NAO, but the growth of stonefly nymphs was not related to the NAO. This may have been due to the semivoltine stonefly lifecycle, but stonefly nymph growth is also generally less dependent on temperature. There were significant differences in growth rates of both species between streams, with nymphs growing more slowly in the forested stream that was consistently cooler than the open stream. Predicted emergence dates for adult mayflies varied by nearly two months between years, depending on the phase of the NAO. Variation in growth and phenology of stream insects associated with the NAO may influence temporal fluctuations in the composition and dynamics of stream communities.

A channel of 1,000 m length and 30 m width was selected to implement pilot-scale experiments both in the static period and the continuous water diversion period. The results showed that the new integrated water remediation technology exhibited the highest removal rate for permanganate index in a static period, which achieved 40.6%. The average removal rates of total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and total phosphorus (TP) in a static period were 23.2, 21.6 and 19.1%, respectively. However, it did not exhibit an excellent removal rate for pollutants in the continuous water diversion period. The average removal rates for all pollutants were below 10%. In winter, the new integrated remediation technology showed efficient effects compared to others. The average removal rate for CODMn, TN, NH3-N and TP were 7, 5.3, 7.6 and 6.5%, respectively.

The unbiased standard deviation of beach days and bath days is 4.62 and 6.4 days, respectively. As regards bath days, the best year was 2023, then the number of bath days was 105. The smallest number of bath days was 57; this occurred in the year 2010. As regards beach days, the best year was 2018 with 114 days, the worst year was 2021 with 72 days.																				2073-4433				MAR 28	2025	16	4							387	10.3390/atmos16040387	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos16040387													WOS:001474790800001

Alfios is the biggest river of the Peloponnese. The climate of the area is typically Mediterranean with rainy winter and very hot summer. Firstly we converted the radiation into Celsius Degrees in order to calculate the surface temperature. Then in order to better distinguish thermal deviations we have classified the temperatures in fifteen classes using the density slicing method. We proceeded to the control of the model accuracy using in situ temperature measurements for the days of the images acquisition. The results showed that the error is less than 0.3 degreesC in the temperature range or about half a tone unit value of TM & ETM band 6 and it is acceptable. We have mapped areas along the river channel that present 6-8 degreesC lower temperature than the rest of area. Even the third or second order branches of Alfios River create long lanes of lower temperature. Also the areas around the big artificial lakes of Pinios and Ladonas present significant lower temperature. Then we have checked the effect of the burnt areas to the temperature. We have noticed that the burnt areas present 6-10degreesC higher temperatures than the neighborhood areas. The general conclusion is that the TM & ETM thermal bands can be used for the creation of temperature profiles across large areas where the construction of climatological stations is difficult.					; Nikolakopoulos, Kostantinos/B-5379-2018	nikolakopoulos, konstantinos/0000-0003-1028-9541; 													0277-786X		0-8194-5115-0				2004	5232						510	520		10.1117/12.510818	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.510818													WOS:000189459600050

LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												The Convention on Biological Diversity () recommends globally protecting >= 17% of ecologically representative freshwaters by 2020 to sustain critical ecosystem services and rapidly declining freshwater biodiversity. We examined whether current conservation efforts meet this target for lakes (>= 1 ha) across the continental U.S. and Environmental Protection Agency ecoregions using the U.S. Protected Areas Database. How one defines lake protection matters: 17.8% of lakes fell within multiuse or strictly protected areas, but only 7.5% of lakes had >= 80% of their catchments in strictly protected areas. Protected lakes occurred disproportionately in the lake-poor western U.S. and most lake-rich regions fell short of the 17% target. Lakes connected to streams and other lakes were disproportionately protected relative to headwater and isolated lakes, which are important for ecosystem services and biodiversity.

Berry			The δ18O and δ2H fingerprint of the Scioto River: A detailed look into seasonal and spatial variations in the context of Ohio rivers	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The global expansion and increased intensity of the human footprint causes modification of natural freshwater systems, particularly in densely populated areas. This poses a challenge for society where the water systems that humans rely on for domestic, industrial, and agricultural water are also the most physically and chemically disturbed. There is an urgent need to study hydrologic processes in surface water systems that flow through human -altered landscapes to better manage freshwater resources. Stable water isotopes (618O and 62H) can be used as natural tracers to study the hydrologic patterns of rivers as they flow through these agricultural and urban landscapes. In this work, we investigate the seasonal and spatial hydrologic patterns of the Scioto River in Ohio, USA by analyzing stable water isotopes. Samples were collected over the course of one year (2021) from five locations that transition from intense agriculture to the metropolitan area of Columbus, Ohio. Results show that the Scioto River isotopic composition reflects a dampened seasonal precipitation pattern, where 618O and 62H are enriched in summer and depleted in winter. Scioto River transect patterns show that there was greater variability in stable isotopic composition in the upstream, agricultural reaches of the river. As the river flowed through the metropolitan Columbus area two "river -like" reservoirs generated isotopic homogenization along the Scioto without inducing isotopic enrichment, which is commonly observed from evaporation in river -reservoir systems. The Scioto River was put in context with other major Ohio river systems, to show the variability across the state. Isotopic composition differences among and within river systems across the state were induced by a combination of different environmental factors, like precipitation and river baseflow contribution. They were further affected by humans through land use modification and the constructions of dams and reservoirs. Overall, this study underlines the influence that urbanization and intensive agriculture have on rivers. In the context of the current hydrologic changes induced by climate change, this work emphasizes the importance of studying urban river hydrology in the context of joint climatic and human influences.

Sinninghe			Tetraether membrane lipid distributions in water-column particulate matter and sediments: a study of 47 European lakes along a north-south transect	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We studied the distribution of glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) in water-column particulate matter and the top 5 cm of sediment from 47 lakes along a transect from southern Italy to the northern part of Scandinavia. Our objective was to investigate the biological sources and potential palaeoenvironmental applications of GDGTs in lacustrine sediments. Both archaea-derived isoprenoid and bacteria-derived branched GDGTs, produced by yet unknown soil bacteria, were identified in all lake sediments. GDGT distributions varied substantially. Crenarchaeotal GDGTs, including the characteristic GDGT crenarchaeol, were found in varying relative concentrations, and were more dominant in lakes from the Alps and some of the lakes from the more southern part of the latitudinal transect. In some lakes, we observed high amounts of the GDGT with no cyclopentane moieties relative to crenarchaeol. As methanogenic Euryarchaeota are known to biosynthesise this GDGT predominantly, these Archaea, rather than Crenarchaeota, may be its dominant biological source. In most of the lakes, high amounts of soil-bacteria-derived, branched GDGTs (> 40% of total GDGTs) indicated a substantial contribution from soil erosion. Branched GDGTs dominated, especially in the northern lakes, possibly related to high soil-erosion rates. In many of the lakes, soil input affects the distribution of isoprenoidal GDGTs and prevents the reliable application of the TEX86 temperature proxy for lake water temperature, which is based on in situ crenarchaeotal GDGTs production. In 9 out of the 47 lakes studied, the TEX86 temperature proxy could be used reliably. When we compared the TEX86 correlation with annual and winter lake-surface temperature, respectively, the relationship between TEX86 and winter temperature was slightly stronger. This may indicate the season in which these GDGT-producing organisms have their peak production.

Based on the results of the geochemical analyses, the lake sediment core covering past 30,000 years was divided into three units: Holocene (0 similar to 6 cm), deglacial (6 similar to 12 cm), and last glacial (12 similar to 118 cm). During the Holocene, there had been no carbonate precipitation in the cnetral part of Lake Hovsgul, suggesting a open lake system during the Holocene. The lake sediments deposited during the last glacial period showed about 33 similar to 40% of carbonate content and their oxygen and carbon isotopes composition varied between -9.8 similar to-8.2 parts per thousand and 0.2 similar to 2.5 parts per thousand, respectively. The moderate correlation between the two isotope values (R-2=0.529) suggests that the lake environment during the glacial period was under a hydrologically closed system. Short-term variability superimposed on long-term change on millennial timescales in the oxygen isotope values was very similar to that observed in the carbon isotope values. These changes in the isotopic values of oxygen and carbon in the lake had been controlled by the freshwater input and evaporation, in other words, hydrological change related to the lake level. This study suggests that the hydrological variability on millennial to centennial scales in the interior of Asian continent during the late Pleistocene was related to the climate change in high-latitude regions and Asian summer/winter monsoon changes.

Pore water concentration profiles obtained by a passive multi-layer sampler from bottom sediments of Lake Kinneret, Israel, depict Cl/Br ratios that vary between 70 and 156 and are similar to ratios in nearby onshore springs - Hamei Tiberias and Fulya, respectively. The Cl/Br ratio of the lake (135) is strongly influenced by the Cl/Br fingerprint of Fulya-type water. However, the discharge of the known Fulya springs can not provide the required Br- mass (about 648 tons/y) to maintain the Cl/Br ratio in the lake. Therefore, diffusive and advective fluxes of port: water are additional important mechanisms by which Br- is added to lake water. Moreover, it is demonstrated that a combination of Fulya and Hamei Tiberias-type waters (90 and 10%, respectively) can explain the Cl/Br ratio of the lake. The areal distribution of the Cl/Br ratio in pore water may be the result of dilution of an ancient evaporated solution (Cl/Br approximate to 70) with fresh water from adjacent aquifers (Cl/Br greater than or equal to 150), followed by mixing with a saline solution having a high Cl/Br ratio (Cl/Br approximate to 300) The results of this work suggest that the Cl/Br ratio is a sensitive tool for the study of other similar environments.

Fish were captured during spawning migration to the tributary, marked and released. The subsequent distribution of marked fish was followed in the reservoir and tributary during three successive periods 1) early summer, 2) late summer and 3) the next spawning season. Species were divided into two groups - obligatory tributary spawners (white bream Blicca bjoerkna, chub Squalius cephalus, bleak Alburnus alburnus and asp Aspius aspius) that did so predominantly in the tributary of the reservoir and generalists (bream Abramis brama, perch Perca fluviatilis and roach Rutilus rutilus) that usually spawned in the tributary as well as at different sites within the reservoir main body. We hypothesized that obligatory tributary spawners would distribute across the reservoir after spawning according to their species-specific preferences for certain feeding grounds. We expected a relatively low or erratic post-spawning dispersal for spawning generalists. The results of the study revealed that the post-spawning dispersal of obligatory tributary spawners is consistent with our hypothesis and they most likely dispersed according to their feeding ground requirements. The post-spawning dispersal of generalists revealed that the assumed low dispersal was relevant for bream and perch while erratic dispersal was observed in roach.

Palaeohydrological studies in the monsoon margin have increased the resolution of research in the long term, transitioning from qualitative to quantitative studies to comprehend climate change processes, patterns, and mechanisms. Testate amoebae (TA) in peat sediments are used as a proxy indicator organism for quantitative reconstruction of palaeohydrology. Thus, their community changes are directly related to precipitation, and widely used to reconstruct the patterns of summer precipitation globally. We investigated TA species and reconstructed palaeohydrological changes in the Greater Khingan Mountains' Hongtu (HT) peatland, located in the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) margin. The result showed that the most abundant TA species were Assulina muscorum (12.4 +/- 5.0%) and Nebela tincta (8.9 +/- 4.9%) in the HT peat core. The increase in dry indicator species (e.g., A. muscorum and Alabasta militaris) indicated a drying pattern in the HT peatland since 150 cal yr BP. Principal component analysis (PCA) explained 47.6% of the variation in the selected TA assemblages. During 400 to 250 cal yr BP, PCA axis 1 scores ranged from 0.2 to -1.3 (reflecting a drier climate), associating with the Little Ice Age. The paleohydrology of the northern part of the Greater Khingan Mountains was mainly controlled by the EASM, which was associated with changes in North Atlantic Sea surface temperature and solar radiative forcing. The apparent drying pattern may be the result of the gradual intensification of anthropogenic activities and the increase in EASM intensity.

In Ireland, regulation has focussed on control of P losses from agriculture and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs): the two main sources of excess P. Hindcast modelling for Lough Leane, south-west Ireland, indicated that, while the only municipal (point) source contributed up to 41% of the annual TP loading until the mid 1980s, over 90% of the TP load was from diffuse sources following upgrading of the WWTP. Field data from 2000-2006 confirmed that most of the TP load came from agriculture, with 73% being exported between September and February, generally the wettest months in the region. However, the WWTP contributed up to 60% of daily loads during summer. Short lake residence times (two to four months) between October and February indicated that external loadings during these months were unlikely to make a significant contribution to summer phytoplankton growth in the lake. In contrast, the potential effects of point sources during low flows were maximised by longer residence times between April and September. The results highlight the importance to aquatic pollution impacts of, and therefore the need for regulatory responses to respect, seasonal variations in loading and residence time.					; Taylor, David/ISS-5752-2023; Jennings, Eleanor/ISU-1018-2023	Jennings, Eleanor/0000-0002-9344-2056; Taylor, David/0000-0002-6098-5636													1323-1650	1448-6059					2013	64	5			SI		413	422		10.1071/MF12166	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF12166													WOS:000318364900005

During spring unstratified conditions (May 1-July 17), chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass were vertically and temporally uniform. Phytoflagellates such as Rhodomonas minuta, Cryptomonas spp. and Ochromonas spp. were dominant at this time. The photosynthetic maximum was associated with the depth receiving 10% of surface irradiance, .apprx. 15-25 m. Once thermal stratification occurred, a SCL developed around 20 m. Although epilimnetic chlorophyll concentrations remained similar to spring mixing levels, concentrations in the SCL increased 3-fold. In situ production was the principal process associated with the development of the SCL. The upper portion of the SCL was dominated by Cyclotella species; C. stelligera, C. comensis, and C. ocellata. The increased abundance of Cyclotella appeared to be related to stable irradiance fields produced during thermal stratification.

J	Bell, CM				Bell, C. M.			Punctuated drainage of an ice-dammed quaternary lake in southern South America	GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												A chain of east-west elongated lakes fringes the eastern flank of the Andes Mountains between 39 and 52 degrees S in southern Chile and Argentina. These deep lakes fill valleys left by the retreat of outlet glaciers of the Patagonian Icefield about 16000 years ago. Two of the lakes, Lago General Carrera/Buenos Aires and Lago Cochrane, represent the shrunken remnants of a much larger lake (called here the predecessor lake) that developed in a moat alongside the icefield. A series of seven stepped lacustrine braid deltas on the southeastern shore of Lago General Carrera/Buenos Aires mark the progressive, punctuated drainage of the predecessor lake. The deltas were formed by the build-out of fans of sand and gravel into the lake. They have the form of Gilbert deltas, with virtually flat subaerial topset beds and steeply inclined subaqueous foreset beds. The exposed delta fronts are marked by a series of small terraces produced by wave erosion during falling lake levels. On either side of the fans are embayments with beaches formed by deposition in the lee of the prograding fans. These embayments are filled with ridges of well-sorted gravel deposited by wave-driven long-shore drift. About 13000 years ago the regional drainage underwent a remarkable change. Rivers flowing eastwards into the Atlantic reversed their direction to flow westwards through the Andes Mountains and into the Pacific Ocean. The watershed moved some 200 km to the east. The cause of this change, and the falling lake levels, was melting of the Patagonian Icefield. As the ice retreated the icefield split into north and south components. This broke the ice dam that impounded the western end of the predecessor lake. The stepped, progressive fall of the lake level suggests that as the ice melted a series of lower overflow sills of hard rock were exposed. Each of the major episodes of sudden drop in lake level was followed by a long period of up to thousands of years when lake level remained constant. Terraces on the delta fronts indicate that each major episode of fall in the lake level was punctuated by up to ten minor episodes possibly representing major storm events or annual cycles of freezing and melting, blocking the overflow sills.																			0435-3676						2008	90A	1					1	17		10.1111/j.1468-0459.2008.00330.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-0459.2008.00330.x													WOS:000253632900001

Evidence that copepod biomass during the larval period regulates recruitment of Lake Erie walleye	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Walleye (Sander vitreus) is an economically and culturally important species in Lake Erie that has experienced large interannual variability in recruitment. We examined the importance of prey biomass during the larval period to walleye recruitment while also considering the importance of temperature. Using nine years of field data over a 22-year period (1994-2016) for larval walleye and zooplankton, we found that strong recruitment events occurred in years when the biomass (dry mg L-1) of copepods (e.g., calanoids, cyclopoids) was greater during the spring larval period. Conversely, the biomass of cladocerans and mean spring water temperatures were poor predictors of walleye recruitment. Our results highlight the need to consider zooplankton availability during the larval period when seeking to understand the recruitment dynamics of freshwater fish populations such as Lake Erie walleye.

Mid Holocene lake level and shoreline behavior during the Nipissing phase of the upper Great Lakes at Alpena, Michigan, USA	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Nipissing phase was the last pre-modern high-water stage of the upper Great Lakes. Represented as either a one- or two-peak highstand, the Nipissing occurred following a long-term lake-level rise. This transgression was primarily an erosional event with only the final stage of the transgression preserved as barriers, spits, and strandplains of beach ridges. South of Alpena, Michigan, mid to late Holocene coastal deposits occur as a strandplain between Devils Lake and Lake Huron. The landward part of this strandplain is a higher elevation platform that formed during the final stage of lake-level rise to the Nipissing peak. The pre-Nipissing shoreline transgressed over Devils Lake lagoonal deposits from 6.4 to 6.1 ka. The first beach ridge formed similar to 6 ka, and then the shoreline advanced toward Lake Huron, producing beach ridges about every 70 years. This depositional regression produced a slightly thickening wedge of sediment during a lake-level rise that formed 20 beach ridges. The rise ended at 4.5 ka at the Nipissing peak. This peak was short-lived, as lake level fell >4 m during the following 500 years. During this lake-level rise and subsequent fall, the shoreline underwent several forms of shoreline behavior, including erosional transgression, aggradation, depositional transgression, depositional regression, and forced regression. Other upper Great Lakes Nipissing platforms indicate that the lake-level change observed at Alpena of a rapid pre-Nipissing lake-level rise followed by a slower rise to the Nipissing peak, and a post-Nipissing rapid lake-level fall is representative of mid Holocene lake level in the upper Great Lakes.

Mineral magnetic and organic geochemical parameters have been measured for an AMS 14C-dated sediment core from the Anshupa Lake, situated in the eastern part of the CMZ, to reconstruct changes in the paleo-monsoonal precipitation on a sub-decadal scale during the past 600 years. Based on the data obtained, two phases may be recognised in the sedimentation history of the lake over the past six centuries: Phase-I (1397 to 1850 CE) comprising sediments deposited during the Little Ice Age (LIA), and Phase-II (1850 CE to the Present) comprising sediments deposited after the LIA. The measured proxies show decadal to sub-decadal scale variations. The relatively low values of mineral magnetic parameters (chi lf ,chi hf, chi fd, SIRM, chi ARM/chi lf, chi ARM/SIRM, chi ARM/chi lf, and chi ARM/SIRM) and more positive 813C values during Phase-I suggest a weak ISMR compared to Phase-II. The variations in mineral magnetic parameters suggest that the ISMR was the lowest during the Spo center dot rer, Maunder and Dalton Minima, but strong during the intervening periods. This inference resonates with the 813C and C/N profiles of the core. Bacterial magnetite is documented during the mid-16th to mid-17th century, suggesting warm and humid conditions in the intervening phase between the Spo center dot rer and Maunder Minima. The magnetic susceptibility (chi lf) data exhibit a number of periodicities similar to those shown by cosmogenic nuclide-derived Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) data, reaffirming a solar influence on the Indian summer monsoon in the core monsoon zone of India.					; DASH, CHINMAY/O-4506-2018; Manjunatha, Busnur/NWH-6113-2025	Shah, Rayees Ahmad/0000-0002-3052-6391; DASH, CHINMAY/0000-0001-5673-8563; Pati, Pitambar/0000-0001-8255-8136; Jose, Jithin/0000-0003-3471-0791													1367-9120	1878-5786				APR	2022	226								105048	10.1016/j.jseaes.2021.105048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jseaes.2021.105048		JAN 2022											WOS:000742694100002
J	Katz, A; Nishri, A				Katz, Amitai; Nishri, Ami			Calcium, magnesium and strontium cycling in stratified, hardwater lakes: Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), Israel	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												In stratified hardwater lakes, calcite crystallization in the epilimnion and partial dissolution in the hypolimnion play important roles in the cycling of Ca2+ in the water column. Mg2+ and Sr2+ coprecipitate with this mineral, to be released together with Ca2+ upon its dissolution. Here, we focus on Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee, Israel), a stratified, warm, hardwater lake, searching for an interpretable, high resolution picture of the processes that drive Ca2+, Mg2+ and Sr2+ cycling in this and similar lakes elsewhere. In total, 1428 water samples were collected from the lake, and another 81 samples were collected from the Jordan River and two small streams discharging into it, covering a full monomictic cycle from December 2001 through March 2003. Particulate material was retrieved from sediment traps in the hypolimnion. The water samples were analyzed for Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Cl-, SO42-, HCO3- and Br-, and the trapped particulates were examined under SEM and analyzed for their Ca, Mg, and Sr content. Individual calcite crystals within the particulate material underwent LA-ICP-MS analysis for Ca, Mg, and Sr. Downward transport of Ca2+ involves crystallization of calcite in the epilimnion, followed by its settling through the water column, followed by its partial dissolution in the hypolimnion. Magnesium and Sr2+ follow Ca2+ by coprecipitation in calcite and are released upon its dissolution in the hypolimnion. Upward cycling of the three solutes occurs through an admixture of the hypolimnetic water into the epilimnion during thermocline deepening, terminated by overturn of the lake. Removal rates of Mg2+ and Sr2+ from the lake, relative to that of Ca2+, and the water-calcite distribution coefficients, D-Mg and D-Sr, were calculated from the analyses using: (1) epilimnion water and 'bulk' particulates; (2) epilimnion water only; and (3) epilimnion water and calcite crystals in the particulates. The D-Sr values obtained were internally consistent (0.194 +/- 5.9%, 0.22-0.28, and 0.204-0.232, respectively); however, the D-Mg value for the 'bulk' particulates (0.0477) was similar to 6 times higher than that corresponding to calcite crystals included therein (0.00841). This difference is attributed to phytoplankton debris in the 'bulk' particulates and should be of concern to geochemists using Mg/Ca ratios in limestone to reconstruct ancient aquatic environments. The cycling of Ca2+, Mg2+ and Sr2+ in the stratified lake is monitored by Mg/Ca vs. Sr/Ca regression diagrams, where each line represents the water column composition on a specific date. The distance of the data points from the initial (mixed lake) coordinates reflects the fractionation of Ca2+, Mg2+ and Sr2+ after the onset of stratification. The regression lines rotate in an orderly anticlockwise direction in response to the high calcite flux from the epilimnion in spring and the higher rate of Mg2+ replenishment than that of Sr2+, compensating for their loss in calcite. The release of Mg2+ and Sr2+ from dissolving calcite in the hypolimnion, at an Mg/Sr ratio (7.5 eq/eq) much lower than that in the surrounding water (similar to 160 eq/eq), lends additional support to the anticlockwise rotation. Reversal of rotation occurs in summer, when calcite crystallization and the freshwater supply slow down, and brackish and saline water sources take control over the Mg/Sr ratio in the lake. Subsequent turnover and mixing of the lake in winter reset the Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios to their original values before the next stratification. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

SynthETC: A Statistical Model for Severe Winter Storm Hazard on Eastern North America	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The authors develop, evaluate, and apply SynthETC, a statistical-stochastic model of winter extratropical cyclones (ETCs) over eastern North America. SynthETC simulates the life cycle of ETCs from formation to termination, and it can be used to estimate the probability of extreme ETC events beyond the historical record. Two modes of climate variability are used as independent covariates: El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Nino-3.4 index and the monthly North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). SynthETC is used to estimate the annual occurrence rate over sites in eastern North America of intense ETC passage in different ENSO and NAO states. Positive NAO is associated with increased rates over the North Atlantic, while negative NAO is associated with decreased rates over the North Atlantic and increased rates over northern Quebec. Positive ENSO is associated with decreased rates over the North Atlantic, Ontario, and the Canadian maritime, while negative ENSO is associated with increased rates over those regions, as well as the Great Lakes region.					; Booth, James/P-7032-2018	Hall, Timothy/0000-0003-1755-4889; Booth, James/0000-0001-8191-4936													0894-8755	1520-0442				JUL	2017	30	14					5329	5343		10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0711.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0711.1								29997420					WOS:000404018600011

However, the spatiotemporal links between the water connectivity and hydrologic fluxes remain poorly understood in terminal basins like the Devils Lake Basin (DLB), and accurately estimating open water evaporation (OWE) in this cold region is challenging due to winter ice cover. In this study, we developed a modified framework for estimating OWE in cold regions and investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of water connectivity and hydrological fluxes. New hydrologic Insights: The modified framework produced an average annual net evaporation of 785 mm (2000-2015), closely matched with the USGS estimation (825 mm). A clear hysteresis loop between OWE and both permanent and summer water areas reflected wetting (1996-2011) and drying (2013-2018) phases, highlighting a nonlinear response to shifting climate conditions. Strong nonlinear correlations were found between water connectivity and streamflow across the DLB (R2 = 0.49-0.79). While Random Forest model captured this nonlinearity in training (NSE = 0.37-0.68), predictive performance declined during testing (NSE = 0.15-0.46), underscoring the region's climatic and geomorphic complexity. Multiple Linear Regression revealed spatial heterogeneity in streamflow drivers: water connectivity in western subbasins, precipitation in the north-central, and temperature in the east. These findings highlight the need to consider nonlinearity and spatial variability in cold-region water modeling under climate change.

The Ramsar Convention and the status of National Park protect 44,612 ha. Other environmental legal figures are present in the area. To date, lagoons communicate with the sea following the lower Myall River onto Port Stephens Bay. A belt of sand dunes separates the lakes from the southern Pacific Ocean. The region has a humid temperate climate with average annual rainfall of 1300mm and mean monthly temperatures ranging from 17 degrees C in winter to 27 degrees C in summer. Changes in substrata and the complex variety of habitats within the sand dune systems favour botanic diversity and an intricate mosaic of vegetal associations, quite dependant on fire history, timber extraction and grazing clearing. Multitemporal remotely sensed imagery is analyzed to comprehend this scenario: aerial photographs (1981), Landsat TM (30.11.1993) and Landsat ETM+ (08.08.2001). Imagery analysis methods included image geocorrection and mosaicing, atmospheric filtering, radiometric enhancement, visual interpretation, vegetation index withdrawal, supervised classification and mapping. Fieldwork and species cataloguing preceded imagery analysis and classification; results showed direct relationship between plant associations and landforms. Spectral differences and NDVI values account for the following vegetation. communities: (i) Fore dune associations of mat sand-binding species and woody bushes. (ii) Dry eucalypt forest over stabilized sand dunes, dune flats and high ridge lands, conformed by Blackbutt-Red Gum (Eucaliptus pilularis, Angophora costata) or Bloodwood-Red Gum (Eucaliptus gumifera, Angophora costata). (iv) Humid eucalypt forest, locally known as tree swamp. (v) Dry shrubby formations (vi) Humid shrubby formations and mangroves on swamps and bogs. (vii) Littoral rain forest sheltered in apt pockets and (viii) grazed areas.					Garcia, Pilar/AAP-3768-2020																90-5966-042-0				2006							355	+																WOS:000243257200043
J	Konecky, B; Russell, J; Bijaksana, S				Konecky, Bronwen; Russell, James; Bijaksana, Satria			Glacial aridity in central Indonesia coeval with intensified monsoon circulation	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												The Last Glacial Maximum was cool and dry over the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP), a key region driving global oceanic-atmospheric circulation. Both low- and high-latitude teleconnections with insolation, ice sheets, and sea level have been suggested to explain the pervasive aridity observed in paleoecological and geomorphic data. However, proxies tracking the H- and O-isotopic composition of rainfall (e.g., speleothems, sedimentary biomarkers) suggest muted aridity or even wetter conditions than the present, complicating interpretations of glacial IPWP climate. Here we use multiproxy reconstructions from lake sediments and modern rainfall isotopic measurements from central Indonesia to show that, contrary to the classical "amount effect," intensified Australian-Indonesian monsoon circulation drove lighter Hand O-isotopic composition of IPWP rainfall during the LGM, while at the same time, dry conditions prevailed. Precipitation isotopes are particularly sensitive to the apparent increase in monsoon circulation and perhaps also decreased moisture residence time implied by our data, explaining contrasts among proxy records while illuminating glacial IPWP atmospheric circulation, a key target for climate models.

Bacteria were isolated from the ovarian fluid of 15 out of 19 spawning females. A number of bacteria, including known and potentially pathogenic species, were identified: Acinetobacter spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas veronii, Arthrobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp. (including P. putida), Moraxella spp., and Microbacterium spp. With the exception of Aeromonas hydrophila, none of these bacteria had previously been isolated from Chinook salmon ovarian fluid. There was no observable association between the aeromonads or pseudomonads and egg survival. However, there was a weak but significant positive correlation between bacterial density (colony-forming units/mL of ovarian fluid) and egg survival; the significance of this correlation is uncertain.																			1522-2055	1548-8454				OCT	2010	72	4					314	320		10.1577/A09-070.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/A09-070.1													WOS:000284142300006
J	Calderaro, F; Vione, D				Calderaro, Federico; Vione, Davide			Possible Effect of Climate Change on Surface-Water Photochemistry: A Model Assessment of the Impact of Browning on the Photodegradation of Pollutants in Lakes during Summer Stratification. Epilimnion vs. Whole-Lake Phototransformation	MOLECULES												Water browning in lakes (progressive increase of the content of chromophoric dissolved organic matter, CDOM) has the potential to deeply alter the photodegradation kinetics of pollutants during summer stratification. Browning, which takes place as a consequence of climate change in several Nordic environments, causes the thermocline to be shallower, because higher CDOM decreases the penetration of sunlight inside the water column. Using a model approach, it is shown in this paper that pollutants occurring in the epilimnion would be affected differently depending on their main photodegradation pathway(s): almost no change for the direct photolysis, slight decrease in the degradation kinetics by the hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot, but the resulting degradation would be too slow for the process to be effective during summer stratification), considerable decrease for the carbonate radicals (CO3 center dot-), increase for the excited triplet states of CDOM ((CDOM)-C-3*) and singlet oxygen (O-1(2)). Because it is difficult to find compounds that are highly reactive with CO(3)(center dot-)and poorly reactive with(3)CDOM*, the degradation rate constant of many phenols and anilines would show a minimum with increasing dissolved organic carbon (DOC), because of the combination of decreasing CO(3)(center dot-)and increasing(3)CDOM* photodegradation. In contrast, overall photodegradation would always be inhibited by browning when the whole water column (epilimnion + hypolimnion) is considered, either because of slower degradation kinetics in the whole water volume, or even at unchanged overall kinetics, because of unbalanced distribution of photoreactivity within the water column.

J	Engle, D; Melack, JM				Engle, D; Melack, JM			Methane emissions from an Amazon floodplain lake: Enhanced release during episodic mixing and during falling water	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Methane fluxes to the troposphere were measured in Lake Calado, a dendritic floodplain lake located in the central Amazon Basin. Methane concentrations in the surface water of the lake were less than 0.5 mu M during a period of high and rising water in April and May, except when episodic, deep mixing occurred and surficial concentrations reached as high as 4.8 mu M. Diffusive fluxes ranged from ca. 2-20 mg CH4 m(-2)d(-1) (mean: 6.6 mg CH4 m(-2)d(-1)) normally, but increased up to 220 mg CH4 m(-2)d(-1) during the passage of a rare cold front. During six weeks of rising water, the volume-weighted methane content of the lake increased during periods of stable thermal stratification (accumulation rates ranging from 16-1411 mg CH4 m(-2)d(-1)) and decreased during episodes of partial mixing (rates of decrease ranging from 63-1792 mg CH4 m(-2)d(-1)). Surface water methane concentrations during low and falling water in September varied by more than an order of magnitude (range, 0.3-9 mu M), and diffusive fluxes ranged from 3-158 mg CH4 m(-2)d(-1) (mean, 54 mg CH4 m(-2)d(-1)). During falling water in September, total methane flux from the lake to the troposphere measured with a floating chamber ranged from 53-328 mg CH4 m(-2)d(-1) (mean, 163 mg CH4 m(-2)d(-1)). Ebullitive flux averaged 69% of total flux. Total methane flux was highest when thermal stratification was lost due to decreasing lake depth.																			0168-2563					OCT	2000	51	1					71	90		10.1023/A:1006389124823	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1006389124823													WOS:000088074800003

The inhabitants of Shanghai have very high aquatic product consumption rates. A risk-benefit assessment of the co-ingestion of fish nutrients and contaminants has not previously been performed for Shanghai residents. Samples of five farmed fish species (marine and freshwater) with different feeding habits were collected from Shanghai markets in winter and summer. Fatty acids, protein, mercury, cadmium, lead, copper, polychlorinated biphenyls, hexachlorocyclohexanes, and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes were measured in liver, abdominal fat, and dorsal, abdominal, and tail muscles from fish. Tolerable daily intakes and benefit-risk quotients were calculated to allow the benefits and risks of co-ingesting n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and contaminants to be assessed according to the cancer slope factors and reference doses of selected pollutants. All of the contaminant concentrations in the muscle tissues were much lower than the national maximum limits, but the livers generally contained high Hg concentrations, exceeding the regulatory limit. The organic pollutant and n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations correlated with the lipid contents of the fish tissues, and were higher in carnivorous marine fish than in omnivorous and herbivorous freshwater fish. The tolerable daily intakes, risk-benefit quotients, and current daily aquatic product intakes for residents of large Chinese cities indicated that the muscle tissues of most of the fish analyzed can be consumed regularly without significant contaminant-related risks to health. However, attention should be paid to the potential risks posed by dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane in large yellow croaker and Hg in tilapia. Based on the results of this study, we encourage people to consume equal portions of marine and freshwater fish. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Zhu, JA; Folino-Rorem, NC				Zhu, Jonathan A.; Folino-Rorem, Nadine C.			Effectiveness of Sampling Techniques in Collecting the Polyp Stage of the Invasive Freshwater Hydrozoan Craspedacusta sowerbii	BIOLOGY-BASEL												Current sampling methods for detecting the presence of the invasive freshwater hydrozoan Craspedacusta sowerbii rely mainly on visual confirmation of the medusa stage. Confirming the presence of the polyp stage is equally important for observing medusae since typical late summer/early fall occurrences or observations of medusae are sporadic though are becoming more frequent. The polyp stage is important as it is the organism's primary stage and is present throughout the year depending on water temperatures. Therefore, sampling methods for the polyp stage are, commonly, the collection of substrates such as rocks, plants, or pieces of wood in a given body of water, and these can be cumbersome to examine. Polyps are also small, transparent, and difficult to see on natural substrates. Based on a preliminary culturing of the polyp stage on glass and plastic microscope slides in the laboratory, we designed a sampling methodology based on submerging four substrate types (glass and plastic microscope slides, Hester-Dendy discs, and small glass Petri dishes) to confirm the presence of C. sowerbii polyps in the field. We tested this method in three lakes in the Illinois-Indiana region (USA). Two of the lakes have recorded sightings of medusae but the third has no record of polyps or medusae. The sampling method we designed was effective in that C. sowerbii polyps were found on both plastic and glass slides. While this method can be sufficient for detection of the polyp stage, it also shows potential for improvement; we highlight abiotic and biotic ecological parameters as significant factors influencing the collection of C. sowerbii polyps to be considered for future methodologies.

Mercury concentrations and potential methylation rates in Lake Erie	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Little is known about external and internal loading and cycling of bioaccumulative methylmercury in Lake Erie, despite the lake having a world-renowned sport fishery. During the summer/early fall of 2018 to 2021, concentrations and fluxes of total mercury and methylmercury in the water column were examined near the Detroit and Maumee River discharges into western Lake Erie, as well as the junction between Sandusky Bay and central Lake Erie. Average unfiltered total mercury concentrations were similar near the Detroit River (5.4 +/- 0.8 pM) and Sandusky Bay inputs (5.3 +/- 0.9 pM), which were less than half of those near the Maumee River mouth (11.6 +/- 2.8 pM). Similarly, unfiltered methylmercury concentrations near the Detroit River (0.29 +/- 0.09 pM) and Sandusky Bay inputs (0.24 +/- 0.06 pM) were less than half of those near the Maumee River mouth (0.63 +/- 0.21 pM). Potential specific mercury methylation rates measured in central Lake Erie were 0.062 +/- 0.027 day(-1), 0.045 +/- 0.012 day(-1) near the Sandusky Bay input, and 0.031 +/- 0.006 day(-1) at the Detroit River input (Maumee Bay was below detection; rates were not different; Tukey, p >0.87). Compared to previous work, total mercury concentrations in the western basin observed in this study indicate a decrease of about 3.3% yr(-1), which may reflect positive impacts of state, provincial, and national legislation (U.S. National Clean Water Act 1990, Ohio Clean Air and Water Act 2004, Ontario Clean Water Act 2006). However, methylmercury concentrations have increased in western Lake Erie from 2010 to 2019, which may reflect the impact of legacy mercury pollution.

J	Wang, MZ; Zhang, JT				Wang, Minzhong; Zhang, Jiantao			The relationship among summer atmospheric boundary layer height over the Taklimakan Desert, its land surface parameters and Eurasian circulation	ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS												To investigate the relationship among summer atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) over the Taklimakan Desert (TD), its land surface parameters and large scale meteorological field, the Urumqi Institute of Desert Meteorology of China Meteorological Administration conducted a comprehensive observation of boundary layer in Tazhong, the hinterland of TD from July 1 to 31, 2016. The correlations between the ABL height and surface sensible heat, latent heat, air temperature, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and buoyancy term are analyzed by using the observed GPS sounding data, the surface layer micro meteorological data in the hinterland of the TD and ERA5 reanalysis data so as to study the correlation of the ABL height and Eurasian circulation field. The research results indicate: (1) The height of summer ABL over the TD does not fully correspond with the variation tendency of surface sensible heat flux. In addition to surface sensible heat, large scale advection and residual mixed layer (RML) are also crucial factor influencing ABL. (2) The surface TKE over the TD is consistent with ABL height variation, with the correlation coefficient of 0.62. Hence the equation of ABL height and TKE is expressed as: Y = 1609.2X(4) - 12,828X(3) + 35,617X(2) -39,514X + 15,858. (3) When the ABL height over the TD is quite high, 500 hPa altitude in Xinjiang is mostly controlled by anticyclone circulation, and the easterly low level jet (LLJ) tends to be formed at 850 hPa the next night. (4) The high correlation areas of summer ABL height over the TD and Eurasian temperature field are Xinjiang and Balkash Lake region. Significant positive correlation is identified between the ABL height and the temperature field at 850, 700, and 500 hPa of the above regions. The maximum correlation coefficient reaches 0.7. The study deepens the understanding of the relationship among the ABL process over the TD, land surface parameters and Eurasian circulation.					; Zhang, Jiantao/I-5116-2014	Wang, Minzhong/0000-0002-1895-4174; 													1530-261X					NOV	2022	23	11							e1122	10.1002/asl.1122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asl.1122		JUL 2022											WOS:000830283300001

However, they also represent ecosystems that can contribute notably to urban biodiversity. To better understand contribution to biodiversity of urban ecosystems, the variation in zooplankton community composition in 19 waterbodies across the Island of Montreal (Quebec, Canada) was monitored across three summer months. Communities were dissimilar between and within waterbodies with species richness differences and replacement patterns playing equal parts in shaping the observed variation. Within each waterbody, notable differences were detected between months, which can affect biodiversity estimation or community composition assessment. Zooplankton species richness was especially well explained by macrophyte cover, which had a positive effect. Compositional differences were also explained by macrophyte cover and by waterbody emptying. Partitioning the beta diversity revealed that only richness difference patterns were explained by macrophyte cover, as species replacement patterns were not explained by any of the measured environmental variables.

J	Gulseth, OA; Nilssen, KJ				Gulseth, OA; Nilssen, KJ			The brief period of spring migration, short marine residence, and high return rate of a northern Svalbard population of Arctic char	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Arctic char Salvelinus alpinus, in the high-Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, entered the Dieset River (79 degrees 10'N) immediately after ice breakup in late June (1991-1993), and within 48 h almost half the migrating population had left the lakes where they spent the winter. The majority of the anadromous char descended into the sea within 3 weeks of the melt. The temporal pattern of emigration was independent of body size. The average residence time at sea of the char was 33.6 d, and the maximum was 56 d. The duration of the seawater sojourn was independent of body size. However, the combined time of downstream migration and marine residence was inversely related to body length in early migrating char. fish that migrated to the sea early tended to stay there longer. The overall return rate ranged from 33.3% for the smallest (15.1-20 cm) to 75.0% for the largest (45.1-50 cm) char, averaging 51.5%. The average return rate for fish shorter than 25.1 cm (first-time migrants) was 42.5%. The upstream run started in mid-July, peaked in August, and was completed by the beginning of September. In contrast to the seaward migration, there was a structured size-precedence in the upstream run, with the large char entering the river first, followed by char of intermediate size and then the smallest anadromous char. The results indicate insignificant immigration to this high Arctic watercourse. The marked local adaptation to the extreme physical conditions restricted these char to a narrow migrational window. Because this is the first comprehensive study on migratory behavior in anadromous Svalbard char, the results are a valuable contribution to fishery science and management of individual populations in the most northern Eurasian area.																			0002-8487					MAY	2000	129	3					782	796		10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<0782:TBPOSM>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<0782:TBPOSM>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000089076500011

Remote sensing with high spatial resolution is often associated with a large repeat period of data, or with a significant dependence of the quality of data on weather conditions. In this regard, the use of Jason-2 satellite equipped with dual-frequency (13.6 GHz and 5 GHz) radar altimeters and passive three-frequency (18, 21 and 37 GHz) microwave radiometers is of interest, because the footprint diameter of their altimeters in Ku-band is about 10 km and the repeat period of observations is ten days, that make it suitable for observations of large and medium-sized inland waters. In this work we use the data of Jason-2 satellite to determine the water level variations and ice-cover regime of 6 lakes in Russia, water areas of which are intersected by the tracks of this satellite. Variations in water level is calculated on the base of retracking method taking into account the fact that the waveforms of altimetry pulses of satellites Jason-2 are distorted due to the influence of land. Satellite data are compared with available in situ observations and the correlation coefficient with in situ observations is calculated. The ice regime of lakes is determined using a new method based on the analysis of the difference between the brightness temperatures of land and water in summer and winter periods. For validation of this method the visual images of the lakes from Aqua and Landsat satellites and in situ data are used.

Based on eddy covariance measurements over Lake Vanajavesi in southern Finland, characteristics of energy fluxes and cold frontal effects on energy exchange were investigated. The lake acted as a heat sink in spring and summer and a heat source in winter. The latent heat flux reached its minimum value in the morning and peaked in the afternoon. The diurnal variation of sensible heat flux was opposite to that of latent heat flux. Impact factors for the sensible heat flux were mainly the lake-air temperature difference and the product of lake-air temperature difference and wind speed. The latent heat flux was mainly affected by the vapor pressure deficit and the product of vapor pressure deficit and wind speed. The annual mean values of bulk transfer coefficients for momentum, heat, and water vapor were 1.98 x 10-3, 1.62 x 10-3, and 1.31 x 10-3, respectively. Bulk transfer coefficients for heat and water vapor were not equal, indicating that the parameterization of energy exchange in numerical models, where the assumption that the heat coefficient equals the water vapor coefficient needs improvement. During the ice-free season, cold fronts resulted in 28 sensible heat pulses and 17 latent heat pulses, contributing to 50.59% and 34.89% of sensible and latent heat exchange in Lake Vanajavesi. These results indicate that cold fronts significantly impact the surface energy budget and evaporation over lakes.

J	Jutzeler, M; Varley, N; Roach, M				Jutzeler, Martin; Varley, Nick; Roach, Michael			Geophysical characterization of hydrothermal systems and intrusive bodies, El Chichon volcano (Mexico)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												The 1982 explosive eruptions of El Chichon volcano (Chiapas, Mexico) destroyed the inner dome and created a 1-km-wide and 180-m-deep crater within the somma crater. A shallow hydrothermal system was exposed to the surface of the new crater floor and is characterized by an acid crater lake, a geyser-like Cl-rich spring (soap pool), and numerous fumarole fields. Multiple geophysical surveys were performed to define the internal structure of the volcanic edifice and its hydrothermal system. We carried out a high-resolution ground-based geomagnetic survey in the 1982 crater and its surroundings and 38 very low frequency (VLF) transects around the crater lake. A 3-D inversion of the ground-based magnetic data set highlighted three high-susceptibility isosurfaces, interpreted as highly magnetized bodies beneath the 1982 crater floor. Inversion of a digitized regional aeromagnetic map highlighted four major deeply rooted cryptodomes, corresponding to major topographic highs and massive lava dome outcrops outside and on the somma rim. The intracrater magnetic bodies correspond closely to the active hydrothermal vents and their modeled maximum basal depth matches the elevation of the springs on the flanks of the volcano. Position, dip, and vertical extent of active and extinct hydrothermal vents identified by VLF-EM surveys match the magnetic data set. We interpret the shallow lake spring hydrothermal system to be mostly associated with buried remnants of the 550 BP dome, but the Cl-rich soap pool may be connected to a small intrusion emplaced at shallow depth during the 1982 eruption.					; Jutzeler, Martin/D-2090-2012; Varley, Nick/A-5591-2013	Roach, Michael/0000-0001-8085-7693; Jutzeler, Martin/0000-0002-3720-6315; Varley, Nick/0000-0001-9626-4024													2169-9313	2169-9356				APR 15	2011	116								B04104	10.1029/2010JB007992	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JB007992													WOS:000289647700001

Here, the Heike (HK) aeolian sand section in the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB) was dated using high-resolution optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, revealing a continuous HK aeolian sand-palaeosol sequence spaning millennial timescales since the Last Deglaciation (similar to 13.5 ka). Climatic variations since the Last Deglaciation (similar to 13.5 ka) were reconstructed using OSL dating, radiocarbon dating, elemental geochemical characteristics, grain size, total organic carbon and magnetic susceptibility. During the Last Deglaciation (13.5-11.7 ka), the climate appeared cold and dry, dominated by strong aeolian activity. During the Early to the beginning of the mid-Holocene (11.7-7 ka), the climate experienced frequent oscillations between cold-dry and warm-humid conditions, two remarkable cold events occurring around 8.9 and 8.2 ka. During the Holocene Climatic Optimum (7-4 ka), the climate was warm and humid. During the Late Holocene (4-0 ka), the climate began a gradual shift toward colder and drier conditions between 4 and 2 ka, but it was still overall warmer and more humid than the Early Holocene baseline. Since similar to 2 ka, the cold-dry trend further strengthened, accompanied by a resurgence of aeolian activity in the QLB. Climate changes along the East Asian monsoon margin in the QLB were controlled by the interplay between the East Asian summer monsoon and the East Asian winter monsoon.

In this study, we applied GPS/GSM transmitters to track the journeys of individuals (n = 32) that bred at the Qinghai Lake in Qinghai province, China. The results showed that the Brown-Headed Gulls (n = 15 bird-years) from the same breeding population employed different flyways during southbound migration: western (n = 4 bird-years), central (n = 4 bird-years), and eastern (n = 7 bird-years), which indicates rather weak migratory connectivity for the breeding population (the mean distance between two individuals during winter was 1040 +/- 548 km (range = 81-2002 km), spanning 35 % of the maximum width of the QTP). Before the southbound migration, western migrants arrived at lakes (454 +/- 319 km) farther from their breeding ground compared to central and eastern migrants to engage in nearly three months of post-breeding movement. Western migrants employed more detours and migrated longer distances crossing mountains with higher elevations (4535 +/- 105 m) during southbound migration. In contrast, central and eastern migrants employed more direct routes and migrated shorter distances crossing relatively lower-altitude mountains during their southbound migration. The western and central migrants undertook a distinct counterclockwise loop migration pattern shifting from the central QTP route in southbound migration to the eastern QTP route in northbound migration. They performed similar behaviors of duration and distance during the southbound and northbound migration. Our study can be considered as a baseline for the migratory patterns of potentially infected waterfowl on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and it offers valuable insights into the migration movements of gulls in the region.					wei, 17513158160/LWK-3746-2024; Jia, Chenxi/K-8837-2012															2351-9894				DEC	2024	56								e03340	10.1016/j.gecco.2024.e03340	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2024.e03340													WOS:001382247100001
J	Liu, K; Zeng, Y; Qiu, XF; Zhong, YH				Liu, Kai; Zeng, Yan; Qiu, Xinfa; Zhong, Yuheng			Analysis of Local Water Humidity Effect Characteristics Based on Meteorological Data: A Case Study of Nanjing	ATMOSPHERE												In order to explore the variation law and causes of the humidity effect of local water bodies, this paper selects the data of encrypted automatic weather stations (encrypted stations) and national conventional meteorological stations (conventional stations) in Nanjing from 2014 to 2020, and systematically studies the humidity effects and influencing factors of urban water bodies by constructing the humidity effect intensity (E) based on the conventional stations. The results show that the humidity effect of urban water has significant diurnal and monthly variation characteristics, and is extremely sensitive to temperature change, and compared to nighttime, the daytime period is generally more humid. The humidity effect is mostly normal in winter, while the humidification and humidity reduction effects in summer are particularly significant. There are also significant differences in the humidity effect between different typical water stations, which are mainly influenced by the background environment of urban and suburban areas, macro wind field, and local wind field configuration around the water body due to the dense building density in the main urban area, which is characterized by dry humidification, while the suburbs are characterized by humidity. When the water body is located on the side of a large water body (river or lake), the influence of local water-land wind field and macro wind field on the humidity effect is particularly significant, and the water wind will significantly enhance the humidity effect, while the land breeze will weaken the humidity effect. The research results can provide a reference for the urban planning and the design of the surrounding environment of water bodies in Nanjing.																				2073-4433				MAR 31	2025	16	4							407	10.3390/atmos16040407	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos16040407													WOS:001474621900001

Morphological traits for rapid and simple separation of native and introduced common reed (Phragmites australis)	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Effective management of the introduced invasive grass common reed [Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.] requires the ability to differentiate between the introduced and native subspecies found in North America. While genetic tools are useful for discriminating between the subspecies, morphological identification is a useful complementary approach that is low to zero cost and does not require specialized equipment or technical expertise. The objective of our study was to identify the best morphological traits for rapid and simple identification of native and introduced P. australis. A suite of 22 morphological traits were measured in 21 introduced and 27 native P. australis populations identified by genetic barcoding across southern Ontario, Canada. Traits were compared between the subspecies to identify measurements that offered reliable, diagnostic separation. Overall, 21 of the 22 traits differed between the subspecies, with four offering complete separation: the retention of leaf sheaths on dead stems; a categorical assessment of stem color; the base height of the ligule, excluding the hairy fringe; and a combined measurement of leaf length and lower glume length. Additionally, round fungal spots on the stem occurred only on the native subspecies and never on the sampled introduced populations. The high degree of variation observed in traits within and between the subspecies cautions against a "common wisdom" approach to identification or automatic interpretation of intermediate traits as indicative of aberrant populations or hybridization. As an alternative, we have compiled the five best traits into a checklist of simple and reliable measurements to identify native and introduced P. australis. This guide will be most applicable for samples collected in the late summer and fall in the Great Lakes region but can also inform best practices for morphological identification in other regions as well.					; Smith, Tyler/ITU-0015-2023	McTavish, Michael/0000-0002-3343-8709; Smith, Tyler William/0000-0001-7683-2653; 													1939-7291	1939-747X				JUN	2023	16	2					110	118	PII S1939729123000159	10.1017/inp.2023.15	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/inp.2023.15		JUN 2023											WOS:001022753800001

Space Use and Movements of Southeastern Breeding Double-Crested Cormorants (Nannopterum auritum) in the United States	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Seasonal movements of Double-crested Cormorants (Nannopterum auritum) have been studied at breeding and wintering sites in the southeastern United States, but little information exists on the movements of these birds within and from their southern breeding sites in lacustrine systems. Since 2001, cormorants have established nesting colonies on islands in Guntersville Reservoir in Alabama, USA. Following the movements of tagged cormorants using satellite telemetry, we found that the mean home range during the 2017 breeding season (May-August) was 41.76 km(2), with a core use area of 6.36 km(2). The mean home range used by these birds was largest during the period coinciding with incubation: 9-30 May: (98.86 +/- 80.64 km(2)) compared with the chick-rearing 31 May-4 July: 18.30 +/- 22.56 km(2)), and the post-fledge periods (5 July-15 August: 42.04 +/- 30.95 km(2)). There was no significant difference in the metrics of movement and space use between male and female cormorants assessed in this study. Differences in space used by cormorants breeding in Alabama relative to their northern breeding grounds may be explained by landscape characteristics and availability of prey.

The total phosphorus (TP) models investigated underestimated mean summer algal biomass and inedible biomass: the models overestimated mean summer edible algae biomass and annual primary production in the euphotic zone. Differences between predicted and actual biomass values are attributed to intense zooplankton grazing on the edible algal community and to the gradual accumulation of slow-growing, inedible algae. The TP model investigated provided an accurate prediction of zooplankton biomass. The algal biomass model overestimated zooplankton biomass, possibly because edible algae accounted for a very small fraction of algal biomass in Humboldt Lake during the ice-free season. The chlorophyll model investigated underestimated zooplankton biomass, apparently because Humboldt Lake algae have a relatively low chlorophyll content. The use of a 0.01 conversion factor to estimate algal biomass on the basis of chlorophyll appears to be inadequate and requires further study. There was no evidence that hyposaline Humboldt Lake has a relatively high zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio when compared with freshwater lakes.

In this paper we extend a vertical mixing model of Lake Erie with an oxygen budget model. The model was tested against data gathered in the summers of 1979 and 1980 with good results, showing that it is capable of simulating vertical distributions of temperature and dissolved oxygen over relatively short time periods. 2. The results underline the importance of turbulent mixing in distributing oxygen throughout the water column in the Central Basin of the lake. In addition, the results indicate that production and respiration processes dominate the budget under the influence of low wind speeds, while surface fluxes dominate during periods of high wind. 3.

The plinian fallout associated with Quilotoa's 800 yr BP eruption, Ecuadorian Andes	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH					4th Cities on Volcanoes Conference 2006	JAN, 2006	Quito, ECUADOR	Inst Geofis Escuela Politecn Natl				Large volcanic eruptions at dacitic or rhyolitic volcanoes often generate exceptional volumes of fine ash that mantles an area up to a million km(2). These eruptions are characterized by extreme fragmentation of the magma and hence extraordinary dispersal of ash and are categorized as plinian, ultraplinian, or phreatoplinian events. Large-volume co-ignimbrites or co-plinian ashes are often produced by such eruptions. High fragmentation indices of >90% are attributed to the violent eruption of silicic magma, especially if augmented by fuel-coolant reactions produced when abundant external water interacts with the magma. The present study documents a case where the fine ash (<= 1 mm diameter) fall deposit related to the plinian phase of the eruption comprises the overwhelming bulk - about 87 wt.% of the eruptive products. This is another example demonstrating the predominance of a widespread, fine-grained, co-plinian ash which follows the initial coarser lapilli fall. Historical eruptions at two other Andean volcanoes Quizapu, (Chile) and Huaynaputina, (Peru), and at Santa Maria, (Guatemala) and Novarupta, (Alaska) produced similar ash fall sequences. Quilotoa's 800 yr BP eruption, in the Ecuadorian Andes, is an example of a powerful plinian eruption at a small dacitic volcano. It produced a crystal-rich, fine-grained ash layer which mantled an extrapolated similar to 810,000 km(2) with >= 1 mm thickness and has a bulk magma volume of about 18.3 km(3). Stratigraphic and petrographic studies, as well as granulometric and density analyses were employed to investigate these eruptive products, particularly the distal co-plinian fall deposits. The eruptive cycle consisted of a phreatomagmatic triggering, the establishment of a powerful sustained plinian column and subsequently partial column collapses, leading to widespread surge and ash flow activity. Quilotoa's 800 yr BP eruption has a (VEI) Volcano Explosivity Index = 6, and generated a maximum column height of about 35 km and a mass discharge rate of similar to 2 x 10(8) kg/s. In comparison, Pinatubo's 1991 eruption had similar column heights and discharge rates but smaller erupted volumes. Factors that possibly contributed to the extreme explosiveness and resulting fine-grained ash production include inferred volatile overpressures in the crystal-dominated dacite magma, a rapid eruption onset, a forceful and sustained plinian column, possibly through a crater lake, thus promoting extreme fragmentation of the magma, but without leaving evidence of wet, phreatoplinian-type deposits.

J	Sardar, S; Mukhopadhyay, PP; Gandhi, N; Mukhopadhyay, P				Sardar, Smruti; Mukhopadhyay, Protyusha P.; Gandhi, Naveen; Mukhopadhyay, Parthasarathi			Possible linkage between climatic conditions and invasions on the Indian subcontinent during the period 6th century BCE to 16th century CE	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Monsoon is crucial for human sustenance and economic stability. This study explores the correlation between long-term climatic conditions and major invasions on the Indian subcontinent. The study utilizes paleoclimate records of 2500 years for different locations across South and Central Asia. The findings reveal that invasions often occurred during periods of favourable Indian Summer Monsoon. The study highlights how these favourable conditions made the region an attractive target for external forces seeking wealth and control. The presence of trade routes further facilitated invasions by providing access to valuable resources. Understanding this complex relationship between climate and invasions deepens our understanding of the historical dynamics of the region and highlights the role of climate in shaping the socio-political landscape. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of considering climatic factors when analysing historical events and provides insights into the motivations behind invasions in the Indian subcontinent. The correlation between good monsoon seasons, agricultural prosperity, and external interest in the region indicates the influence of climatic conditions on the course of history.						gandhi, naveen/0000-0003-0266-0398													2347-4327	0973-774X				APR 4	2024	133	2							74	10.1007/s12040-024-02279-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-024-02279-2													WOS:001197561500008

Hence, climatic and environmental changes in the source region of the Yangtze River (SRYR) are of major significance for understanding changes in the status of its freshwater resources. However, due to the contradictory results shown by the available paleoclimatic records from the SRYR and neighboring regions, it remains unclear how the regional climate and hydrology have evolved since the middle Holocene. Here, we present records of hydrological variations based on multiple proxies (grain size, scanned micro-scale X-ray fluorescence (XRF) element composition, and loss on ignition (LOI)) of the sediments of alpine lake Saiyong Co, with the aim of reconstructing hydrological changes in the SRYR since 5.8 ka. The first principal component (PC1) of the XRF scanned element record is dominated by Ti, Fe and K, representing terrigenous inputs from the catchment. The LOI profile shows an inverse pattern of variation to that of PC1, suggesting that the sedimentary organic matter is primarily derived from aquatic plants. Since 5.8 ka the overall decrease in sample scores on PC1 and the increasing LOI, together with the grain-size based lake-level record, indicate an overall drying trend in SRYR. Furthermore, several major droughts are recorded, at similar to 4.0 ka, similar to 2.8 ka and similar to 1.8 ka. The hydrological variations at Saiyong Co are supported by multiple records from the SRYR, suggesting that millennial-scale environmental variations were regionally synchronous and were influenced by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation and movement of the intertropical convergence zone.

There are significant differences regarding the interpretation of climate history for this area during the Holocene due to a lack of high-resolution paleoclimate records. To better understand this scientific issue, here we provide a new record of Holocene climate change from the western part of Taihu Lake region, East China. A 4-m-depth profile from Gaochun has provided a 13,200-year record of climate change. Holocene climate change was reconstructed for the western part of Taihu Lake area based on various proxy records including pollen, charcoal, degree of humification (DOH), and loss on ignition (LOI) from the Gaochun site. The results indicate that climate during the late Pleistocene (13,200-10,700 cal yr B.P.) and early Holocene (10,700-8000 cal yr B.P.) was warm and humid, alternated with several cold and dry intervals. The late Pleistocene and early Holocene was a transitional period from cold-dry to warm-wet climates. The middle Holocene (8000-4400 cal yr B.P.) was still warm and humid, with a relatively stable climate. The period between 8000 and 5300 cal yr B.P. was the Holocene climate optimum (HCO). During the late Holocene (4400-0 cal yr B.P.), the climate was cool but still humid. In addition, climate change at the western part of Taihu Lake during the late Pleistocene and Holocene was unstable, containing several short-term climate events such as Younger Dryas (YD), 8.2 ka, and 4.2 ka events. These abruptly occurred climate events were indicated by various paleoclimatic proxy indicators, and can be compared with related records from other regions. Our findings suggest that the EASM strength was strongest during the middle Holocene between 8000 and 5300 cal yr B.P. which can be depicted as the period of HCO.					; Chen, Gang/G-4214-2011	Li, Jianyong/0000-0003-1921-5880; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				NOV 1	2017	485						963	973		10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.08.022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2017.08.022													WOS:000419747400072

Field evidence for a parasite spillback caused by exotic mollusc Dreissena polymorpha in an invaded lake	PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH												This study provides field evidence in support of the "parasite spillback hypothesis" that predicts a positive numerical response of native parasites to the presence of an exotic host that is competing for these parasites with native hosts. We examined the role that the exotic mollusc Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel) plays as the second intermediate host of the echinostomatid trematode Echinoparyphium recurvatum in Lake Naroch, Belarus. We found that due likely to the disproportionately high abundance of its novel exotic host, the metacercarial stage of this parasite has become substantially more abundant than that of other echinostomatid trematodes recorded in native molluscs. This finding suggests an increased load (the "spillback") of E. recurvatum on native waterfowl that serve as its final hosts. The risk of aquatic birds becoming infected with this trematode via feeding on D. polymorpha was found to vary both spatially and seasonally. This risk was particularly high in the autumn at a depth of 2 m and at sites of bird gatherings.

In-situ measurements of surface water temperature and water depth, as well as meteorological data, were used in the analysis. Images of the Landsat 8 TIRS (Thermal Infrared (IR) Sensors) at IR channels were taken from the data archives of United State Geological Survey (USGS), and were validated with surface in-situ measurements. Specific Electrical conductivity (SEC) measurements done at the bottom of the lake were also used for a better understanding of the water thermal stratification and types (cold/hot) that impact on the underwater physical properties of the lake. In-situ measurements at the water surface were interpolated using a new method known as 'Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK)'. The 2D and 3D (dimensional) temperature maps were generated using the Delaunay triangulation technique which utilizes nearest neighbor interpolation method. The results show that the correlation coefficient (R-2) between water surface temperatures (WST) from in-situ measurements and IR channels is found to be greater than 0.86. The analysis of 2D and 3D temperature mapping of the lake water revealed evidences for subaqueous cold spring occurrence in the northern part and subaqueous hot springs in the south-western part of Koycegiz Lake. It is concluded that correlating in-situ water temperature measurements to Landsat 8 TIRS images is an efficient method for temporal and spatial evaluation of lake water characteristics.

On the basis of the dominant macroscopic algae, the community was divided into three depth zones: the Ulothrix zone, the Nostoc zone and the Cladophora zone. Total chlorophyll-a was measured to study vertical distribution and the summer variation of standing crop in 1977, 1978 and 1982. In 1982 pure chlorophyll-a and b were also separated quantitatively by a paperchromatographic technique. In 1977 the average standing crop during the summer was estimated to range between 198 (at 0.4 m depth) and 875 (at 4m depth) mg total chlorophyll-a m-2. The standing crop in 1978 and 1982 had the same depth pattern, but the values were much lower than in 1977.																			0003-9136					FEB	1987	108	4					531	547																WOS:A1987G419700006
J	Nof, D; McKeague, I; Paldor, N				Nof, Doron; McKeague, Ian; Paldor, Nathan			Was there ice along the shore of the Sea of Galilee during the last 12,000? - Reply to a comment by Prange et al. (2007) and a comment by Friedman (2007)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Prange et al. (2007) question our reconstruction of the Sea of Galilee (Lake Kinneret) paleoclimate and argue that a "careful" analysis of the paleoclimatic analysis leads to much smaller cooling events than we have considered. By and large, their "careful" analysis is based on correlating the paleotemperatures of the Lake with those of the northern Red-Sea that (geographically) is much closer to the Lake than the two Mediterranean cores that we used. Ironically, their argument contradicts Friedman's (2007) statements (the second comment on our original paper), which are based on still-closer cores and support our larger cooling choices. This issue alone would be enough to dismiss the uniqueness of PAL argument but there is another issue with their work that we wish to comment on. In support of their own small cooling argument, PAL present winter correlation maps that indeed show a stronger correlation of the northern Red-Sea SST to the lake SST than the correlation of Mediterranean SST with the lake SST. This seemingly correct correlation argument of PAL is totally false (for both daily and millennial time scales) because it has no climatological basis. On the daily time scale, all the storms that reach the Lake originate in the Mediterranean Sea (to the west of the lake), not the Red-Sea (which lies 700 km south of the lake). Also, although the lake and the Red-Sea are only 700 kilometers apart, their climates are very different because they are subject to two totally different air masses. While the climate of the Red-Sea region is desert-like, the climate of the region surrounding the lake is a typical wet Mediterranean climate. Seasonal correlation maps (and even monthly maps) such as those presented by the authors filter out the storms that control the winter climate in the lake region because these storms occur on a daily scale. With this filtering, all that one is left with is the low frequency first baroclinic mode, which merely reflects the Rossby radius scale (measured from the lake). On the millennial time scale, cold events in the lake regions (from an earlier period) have been attributed to Bond cycles and Heinrich events both of which are global and not local processes. As such, they are probably forced by variability in the solar radiation rather than a local process implied by PAL. Overall, all that the PAL correlation shows for both daily and millennial time scales is that changes in the temperature in the Red-Sea occur at the same time as they do in the Lake. But this does not say anything about the dynamics in question and does not imply that it is better to use records from the Red-Sea (which does not lie within the path of the zonal winds reaching the Lake). Neglecting this issue (as proposed by PAL) distorts the physics and reminds us of the classical statistical example for the limitations involved in the interpretation of correlation-the incidence of lung cancer is strongly correlated with the incidence of carrying matches in ones pocket even though the matches do not cause the cancer and the cancer does not force one to carry matches.					paldor, nathan/AAE-3186-2020														0921-2728	1573-0417				NOV	2007	38	4					597	600		10.1007/s10933-007-9137-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-007-9137-7													WOS:000250238600011
J	Tarkowska-Kukuryk, M				Tarkowska-Kukuryk, Monika			EFFECT OF PHOSPHOROUS LOADINGS ON MACROPHYTES STRUCTURE AND TROPHIC STATE OF DAM RESERVOIR ON A SMALL LOWLAND RIVER (EASTERN POLAND)	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION												The main objective of the study was to evaluate if macrophytes structure and trophic status of dam reservoir Kranik on a small lowland river Wyinica are determined by phosphorous loadings. Studies were conducted seasonally in May, July and October during the years 2008-2009. Samples were taken at four sites: Site 1 inflow of the Wytnica River to pre-dam, Site 2 pre-dam, Site 3 dam reservoir and Site 4 outflow of the Wy2nica River from dam reservoir. Physical and chemical parameters (temperature, Secchi disc depth, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, total suspension, chlorophyll-a, TP and P-PO4) were measured in water samples. Together with water parameters there were estimated biomass of phytoplankton and species composition and biomass of emergent, floating-leaved and submerged macrophytes. Concentrations of TP, chlorophyll-a and Secchi disc depth were used to calculate trophic state index of Carlsson for dam reservoir and its pre-dam. Based on mean water current, mean residence time of water in dam reservoir and concentrations of TP and P-PO, loadings (g m(-2)) flowing into dam reservoir with the Wy2nica River were calculated. The results showed visible negative effect of phosphorous loadings on both macrophytes composition and trophic state of the reservoir. The marked changes concerned soft vegetation. High P loadings (7.74 g m(-2) of TP and 6.03 g m(-2) P-PO4) during the spring of 2008 caused the disappearance of characeans meadows. In 2009, the presence of rigid homwort (Ceratophyllum demersum L.), the species typical for eutrophic lakes was noted. This unrooted submerged plant uptakes dissolved orthophosphates directly from the water column. Values of Carlsson index (51.4 < TSI < 68.2) indicate the eutrophic state of dam reservoir Kranik. During summer season in dam reservoir there were observed algal blooms (biomass of phytoplankton exceed 10 mg WW dm(-3)) and low water transparency (Secchi disc depth ranged from 0.4 to 0:65 m). During the two-year studies in dam reservoir Kragnik a high reduction of P loadings, mostly dissolved orthophosphates was observed. Dependently on season, reduction of P-PO, loadings ranged from 52% (July 2008) up to 91% (May 2009). The reduction of TP was lower and reached values from 15% (May 2008) to 48% (July 2009).					; Tarkowska-Kukuryk, Monika/T-7469-2018	Tarkowska-Kukuryk, Monika/0000-0001-5328-6944; 													2083-4772	2083-4810					2013	39	3					33	46		10.2478/aep-2013-0029	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/aep-2013-0029													WOS:000325781300003
J	ENGEL, S				ENGEL, S			THE ROLE AND INTERACTIONS OF SUBMERSED MACROPHYTES IN A SHALLOW WISCONSIN LAKE	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Growth and community organization of submersed macrophytes were studied in a southern Wisconsin impoundment in relation to macroinvertebrates, fishes, and phytoplankton. Macrophytes covered 50 to 70% of the lake bed in summer, growing to a water depth of 3.5 m. Total biomass peaked in late July at 130 to 200 g dry wt/m2. Undisturbed macrophyte beds were stratified into canopy, midwater, and basal layers. Narrow-leaved pondweeds (Potamogeton spp.) dominated among 13 vascular plant species. But mechanical harvesting, in the fourth and fifth years of the study, disrupted vertical statification and exposed the lake bed to monotypic growths of water stargrass (Heteranthera dubia (Jacquin) MacMillin). Three-fourths of macroinvertebrate species were found on or beneath macrophytes during summer. Few species comprised more than 5% of individuals in plant or bottom samples. Most macroinvertebrates consumed algae and detritus derived from macrophyte decay. Fishes under 120 mm total length were sheltered by plant beds denser than 200 g dry wt/m2. Larger bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus Raf.) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede)) penetrated looser foliage or remained offshore. Macrophyte decay and plant harvesting created channels used by bass as cruising lanes. Plant-dwelling fishes grazed mainly aquatic insect larvae or microcrustaceans. Bass shifted to fry, while bluegills turned to macrophyte tissue, as summer progressed. Blue-green algal blooms developed in July when curly-leaf pondweed (P. crispus L.) decayed or other plants were mechanically harvested. Secchi disk visibility concomitantly dropped from over 3.5 to 0.6 m.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	1988	4	3					329	341		10.1080/02705060.1988.9665182	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1988.9665182													WOS:A1988N559000008

Expanding the Swiss-Norwegian chironomid training set with Polish data	BOREAS												The Swiss-Norwegian training model established in 2011 has been used across Europe to infer past mean July air temperatures using Chironomidae subfossils. It combines reference sites from Norway and the Swiss Alps but lacks representative localities from the central European plains belt. This gap complicates reconstructions from temperate European latitudes, and thus, a Polish training set (TS) was developed. Data from 102 lakes, mainly from Pomerania and the Masurian Lakelands, as well as the Polish Plain, the Sudetes, and the Carpathian Mountains were included. After selecting and merging suitable chironomid taxa, the Swiss-Norwegian-Polish TS includes 357 lakes and 134 chironomid morphotypes, and it has a mean July air temperature range of 3.5 to 20.0 degrees C. The weighted averaging-partial least squares (WA-PLS) and artificial neural network (ANN) transfer function based on the extended TS performs well: R-jack (2)= 0.91/0.95 and root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) = 1.39 degrees C/1.34 degrees C, respectively. The transfer function applied to the Zabieniec Lake sequence (central Poland) reveals higher summer temperatures (2.5-4.0 degrees C) for the Lateglacial and for the Holocene (1.0 degrees C) compared to the Swiss-Norwegian model. The reconstruction based on the Swiss-Norwegian TS shows an increasing trend from the Bolling-Allerod Interstadial to the Meghalayan period, whereas the new model reconstruction shows no increasing trend when using WA-PLS and a slightly decreasing trend when using ANN. Summer temperatures in the Lateglacial in Zabieniec inferred using the Swiss-Norwegian TS are consistent with other temperature reconstructions for 50-55 degrees N in Europe, while those based on the Swiss-Norwegian-Polish TS (SNP TS) show closer affinity to more western sites than the eastern European ones. Despite being uncommon, the application of ANN can be a good equivalent of the WA-PLS technique especially in situations where the available database is limited to fewer than a few hundred variables.

We recognized a general pattern of increasing authigenic mineral delta O-18 values with decreasing age since the middle Miocene throughout the region. We suggest this pattern results from regional elevation decrease and associated changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. An anomalous pattern of decreasing delta O-18 values with decreasing age is observed in the Miocene Horse Spring Formation exposed in the Lake Mead Basin, which is contemporaneous with local magmatic activity. We suggest this pattern results from surficial uplift of local highlands feeding water into file Horse Spring depositional system. The topographic histories suggested here provide insight into the response or the land surface to crustal processes. Neogene extensional deformation in the central Basin and Range Province resulted in a net regional elevation decrease.

Here, we aim to characterize and compare total Hg (THg) concentrations and methylmercury (MeHg) production in sediments in waterscapes across the megacity of Shanghai, China, and evaluate the impacts of organic matter and Hg inputs on changes in sediment MeHg production during reduction and reoxidation.Materials and methodsSurface sediments were collected in summer and winter from 15 lakes in parks and 17 rivers located in central urban or suburban areas, and THg, MeHg and environmental parameters were measured. In addition, two different incubation series were conducted under different redox conditions over a short period (21 or 56 days).Results and discussionConcentrations of THg and MeHg generally increased in sediments from rural to urban areas, with abnormally high levels at several urban sites. The historical point-source anthropogenic Hg releases could be important contributors to the increases, as reflected by the marked deviations from the regression line between Hg and loss on ignition. Furthermore, both litterfall organic matter and Hg inputs strongly promoted net MeHg production in sediments over a short period, resulting in potential MeHg bioaccumulation in waterscapes.ConclusionsOur study suggested that urbanization in the Shanghai area resulted in Hg loading in central urban areas. However, the low %MeHg but abnormally elevated Hg levels observed at some sites in the field indicated that the potential ecological risks of Hg could be limited, even with new Hg inputs.

Results reveal the complex three-dimensional shape of the landslide mass, how onset of sliding relates to cumulative rainfall, how surface velocity during sliding varies with location on the topographically complex landslide surface, and how the ground surface subsides slightly in weeks prior to downslope sliding.

The lakes are fed by outwash from the Palisade Glacier, the largest (similar to 1.3 km(2)) and presumably longest-lived glacier in the range, and capture essentially all of the rock flour it produces. Distinct late-Holocene (Matthes) and late-Pleistocene (Recess Peak) moraines lie between the modern glacier and the lakes. The lakes have therefore received continuous sedimentation from the basin since the retreat of the Tioga glacier (Last Glacial Maximum) and capture rock flour related to all post-LGM advances. A total of eight long cores (up to 5.5 m sediment depth) and one short surface sediment short core preserve a coherent record of fluctuating rock flour flux to the lakes through the Holocene. Age constraints on rock flour spikes in First and Second lakes based on 31 14C-dated macrofossils indicate Holocene glaciation began similar to 3200 cal yr B P. followed by a possible glacier maximum at similar to 2800 cal yr B P and four distinct glacier maxima at similar to 2200, similar to 1600, similar to 700 and similar to 250-170 cal yr. B.P., the most recent maximum being the largest. Reconstruction of the equilibrium-line altitudes (ELA) associated with each distinct advance recorded in the moraines (Recess Peak, Matthes, and modern) indicates ELA depressions (relative to modern) of similar to 250 m and 90 m for Recess Peak and Matthes advances, respectively. These differences represent decreases in summer temperatures of 1.7-2.8 degrees C (Recess Peak) and 0.2-2 degrees (Matthes), and increases in winter precipitation of 22-34 cm snow water equivalent (s.w.e.) (Recess Peak) and 3-26 cm s.w.e. (Matthes) compared to modern conditions. Although small, these changes are significant and similar to those noted in the Cascade Range to the north, and represent a significant departure from historical climate trends in the region.

It has been shown that this pattern occurred during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). However, there are questions about whether this dipolar pattern also occurred during the entire Holocene, and the mechanism responsible. Addressing these questions is of fundamental importance for understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of precipitation in East Asian summer monsoon region. Numerous studies of north China have demonstrated that the mid-Holocene was humid, and the early and late Holocene were dry. However, there are relatively few equivalent studies in the YRV. To this end, we conducted detailed geochemical analysis of an AMS C-14-dated sediment core from Lake Nanyi in the YRV. Our results indicate humid periods at Lake Nanyi occurred during 11.5-8.0 ka and from 2.0 ka to the present, while dry conditions occurred during similar to 8.0-2.0 ka. These results, together with published records from Dajiuhu peatland and Heshang Cave, collectively indicate in the YRV, the mid-Holocene (similar to 8.0-3.0 ka) was dry, while the early and late Holocene were humid, which is the inverse of the pattern in north China. Thus, we conclude there was an asynchronous evolution of hydroclimatic changes between north China and the YRV during the Holocene. We interpret this dipolar pattern as the result of ENSO variations: in a La Nina-like state, the Western Pacific Subtropical High retreated northeastward, which would enable the rainfall belt to move northward and result in increased (decreased) precipitation in north China (the YRV). Sea surface temperature records from the Pacific Ocean and model simulations support this mechanism: a La Nina-like state in the mid-Holocene resulted in more (less) precipitation in north China (the YRV).

Breeding habitats were divided into three categories: peatlands, oligotrophic lakes and eutrophic lakes. Cygnets reared in peatlands and oligotrophic lakes were significantly lighter (35% and 20% respectively) and had shorter skull lengths (12% and 6% respectively) than cygnets from cutrophic lakes, when measurements were adjusted for differences due to age. The estimated age at fledging for cygnets from peatlands and oligotrophic lakes were, on average, 18 days and 10 days later respectively than for cygnets from eutrophic lakes. It is suggested that differences in growth rates and age at fledging can be explained by differences in the availability and nutritional quality of food in the three types of habitat. Survival differed significantly between habitats; 52% of cygnets from peatlands were recorded on the wintering grounds, compared with 77% and 76% from oligotrophic and eutrophic lakes. Cygnets resighted on the wintering grounds were, on average, 640 g heavier when banded in August than cygnets not resighted. This suggests that differences in the survival of cygnets from the three habitat categories were attributable to territory quality influencing the cygnets' growth, which in turn may affect their survival into the first winter.																			1524-4695	1938-5390					2002	25			1			211	220																WOS:000180160100029

Calcrete uranium deposits in the Southern High Plains, USA	ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS												The Southern High Plains (SHP) is a new and emerging U.S. uranium province. Here, uranyl vanadates form deposits in Pliocene to Pleistocene sandstone, dolomite, and limestone. Fifteen calcrete uranium occurrences are identified; two of these, the Buzzard Draw and Sulfur Springs Draw deposits, have combined in-place resources estimated at about 4 million pounds of U3O8. Ore minerals carnotite and finchite are hosted in dolomite at the Sulfur Springs Draw deposit, with accessory fluorite, celestine, smectite/illite, autunite, and strontium carbonate. Host carbonate at the Sulfur Springs Draw deposit is similar to 190 ka and mineralization mobilized as recently as 3.8 ka. Ash collected near the deposit is 631 ka and erupted from the Yellowstone caldera complex. The Triassic Dockum Group that contains sandstone-hosted uranium deposits throughout the region and underlies the SHP is a potential source for uranium and vanadium. Regional uplift and dissection reintroduced oxygenated groundwater into the Dockum Group, mobilizing uranium. Additional uranium may have been contributed to groundwater by weathering of volcanic ash in Pliocene and Pleistocene host rocks. The locations of the uranium occurrences are mostly in modern drainage systems in the southeast portion of the SHP. Modelling of modern groundwater in the SHP carried out in a parallel study shows that a single fluid could form camotite through evaporation, and that fluids of the requisite composition are more prevalent in the southern portion of the SHP. The southeastern portion of the SHP hosts more uranium occurrences due to a variety of factors including (1) upward transport of groundwater and connectivity between source and host rock, (2) higher uranium and vanadium content of groundwater, (3) higher rates of groundwater recharge in this region to drive the mineralizing system, and (4) shallower groundwater facilitating surface evaporation. Ongoing erosion of host rocks challenges preservation of deposits and may limit their size.

Droughts could trigger large changes in physico-chemical conditions and phytoplankton community in waterbodies, resulting in a shift in the phytoplankton community. Spring diatom blooms in reservoirs have been increasingly observed in the past decade in the Taihu Lake basin. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the impacts of droughts on aquatic environment and to determine the driving factors for the succession of the phytoplankton functional groups based on the analysis of data collected during spring from 2009 to 2020 in the Daxi Reservoir. The unimodal relationship between 1-month aggregated precipitation index and phytoplankton species richness indicated the competitive exclusion occurred in extremely drought period. The structural equation modeling indicated that drought-related low water level conditions intensified sediment resuspension, and increased the phosphorus-enriched nonalgal turbidity in the Daxi Reservoir. Concurrently, a steady shift in the Reynolds phytoplankton functional groups from L0, TD, J, X2, and A (phytoplankton taxa preferring low turbidity and nutrient conditions) to TB (pennate diatoms being adapt to turbid and nutrient-rich conditions) was observed. The increased TP and non-algal turbidity in addition to the lowered disturbance contribute to the prevalence of Group TB. Considering the difficulties in nutrient control, timely water replenishment is often a feasible method of controlling the dominance of harmful algae for reservoir management. Finally, alternative water sources are in high demand for ensuring ecological safety and water availability when dealing with drought.

Sediment proxies of paleoclimate trends in these areas are of great significance for the interpretation of the regional climatic impact of the episodic uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We examined the macro-sedimentary characteristics, clay mineralogy and geochemistry of sediments from the fan delta and lake deposits and the two river terraces of early and middle Quaternary age in the Yichang area and from the planation surfaces and the five main river terraces of early to late Quaternary age in the Three Gorges areas. The early and middle Quaternary had a generally warm-wet paleoclimate from 1260 to 300 ka. The regional climate changed to generally drycold conditions during late Quaternary (110-10 ka), that can be correlated to glacial cycles in the Tibetan Plateau. During the late Quaternary, especially after its Gonghe Movement (150 ka) uplift, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau had a significant impact on regional climate. Comparing the formation age and source direction of the Wushan loess in the Three Gorge with loess in the western Sichuan (the Ganzi loess), in the Loess Plateau and distributing in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (the Xiashu loess), it can be found that coupling of the Kun-Huang Movement of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau occurred at 1100-600 ka and Mid-Pleistocene Transition and global cooling resulted in the sharp increase of East Asian winter monsoon and plateau monsoon, forming the western Sichuan loess and Xiashu loess. The Gonghe movement (150 ka) of the Plateau once again enhanced the plateau monsoon and blocked the Indian summer monsoon moving north-eastward. As a result, the cold-dry climate appeared in the Sichuan Basin and the Three Gorges area, resulting in the deposition of loess from the Zoige Basin to Wushan area. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis in a microbial mat from an anoxic and sulfidic spring	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis were studied with microsensors in microbial mats found at 9-10 m depth in anoxic and sulfidic water in Little Salt Spring (Florida, USA). The lake sediments were covered with a 1-2 mm thick red mat dominated by filamentous Cyanobacteria, below which Green Sulfur Bacteria (GSB, Chlorobiaceae) were highly abundant. Within 4 mm inside the mats, the incident radiation was attenuated to undetectable levels. In situ microsensor data showed both oxygenic photosynthesis in the red surface layer and light-induced sulfide dynamics up to 1 cm depth. Anoxygenic photosynthesis occurred during all daylight hours, with complete sulfide depletion around midday. Oxygenic photosynthesis was limited to 4 h per day, due to sulfide inhibition in the early morning and late afternoon. Laboratory measurements on retrieved samples showed that oxygenic photosynthesis was fully but reversibly inhibited by sulfide. In patches Fe(III) alleviated the inhibition of oxygenic photosynthesis by sulfide. GSB were resistant to oxygen and showed a low affinity to sulfide. Their light response showed saturation at very low intensities.					; Chennu, Arjun/AAV-8003-2021; de Beer, Dirk/L-4840-2013; Macalady, Jennifer/AAC-5154-2021	Hamilton, Trinity/0000-0002-2282-4655; de Beer, Dirk/0000-0001-5274-1781; Klatt, Judith M/0000-0002-0195-6333; Chennu, Arjun/0000-0002-0389-5589; 													1462-2912	1462-2920				MAR	2017	19	3					1251	1265		10.1111/1462-2920.13654	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.13654								28035767					WOS:000397525100033
J	Nielsen, PR; Dahl, SO; Jansen, HL				Nielsen, Pal Ringkjob; Dahl, Svein Olaf; Jansen, Henrik Loseth			Mid- to late Holocene aeolian activity recorded in a coastal dunefield and lacustrine sediments on Andoya, northern Norway	HOLOCENE												In an effort to reconstruct past aeolian activity, a foredune stratigraphy and a continuous lake sediment record from the largest dunefield on Andoya, northern Norway, have been investigated. The dunefield extends landwards in a north-eastward direction and consists of several parabolic dunes, foredunes and blowouts. The sediment record (169 cm) from the nearby lake Latjonna and the foredune stratigraphy (10 m) covers the last 6200 and 3700 cal. yr BP, respectively. Both sites possess sediments deposited after the Tapes transgression maximum (similar to 6800 cal. yr BP), which reached a level of similar to 7-8 m a.s.l. at the study site. The lake sediment record consists of several units dominated by sand grains interspersed by more organic-rich beds. The core has been examined by x-ray fluorescence (XRF), magnetic susceptibility (MS) and loss-on-ignition (LOI). Mineral grains were detected by wet sieving of the ignition residue (IR), and the influx of sand grains to Latjonna was calculated based on the weight of sand grains >250 mu m/cm divided by the accumulation rate determined from a radiocarbon (C-14)-based age-depth model. Phases with high influx of sand to Latjonna are recorded around 4800, 4250, 3000-2000, 1850-1750, 1600-600, 450, 300 and 150 cal. yr BP, which coincides with periods of increased storminess recorded in other studies around the North-Eastern Atlantic region. The two study sites show, however, quite contrasting results; high sedimentation rates in the lake record associated with greater aeolian influx correspond to stability in the foredune stratigraphy reflected by the presence of several palaeosols. Because of this out-of-phase behaviour, it is suggested that the foredune is mainly influenced by summer climate and relative sea level (RSL) change, whereas the lake record is more influenced by niveo-aeolian processes transporting sand grains farther inland during winter.

Considering the complexity of land cover changes within the flooded areas and the different characteristics of the multi-source remote sensing dataset, we proposed a new coarse-to-fine framework for detecting floods at a large scale. Firstly, the coarse results of the water body were generated by the binary segmentation of GF-3 SAR, the water indexes of GF-1/6 multispectral, and Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral images. Secondly, the fine results were achieved by the deep neural networks with noisy-label learning. More specifically, the Unet with the T-revision is adopted as the noisy label learning method. The results demonstrated the reliability and accuracy of water mapping retrieved by the noisy learning method. Finally, the differences in flooding patterns in different regions were also revealed. We presented examples of Poyang Lake to show the results of our framework. The rapid and robust flood monitoring method proposed is of great practical significance to the dynamic monitoring of flood situations and the quantitative assessment of flood disasters based on multiple Chinese satellite datasets.

We show that South African summer rainfall covaried with changes in southern hemisphere summer insolation resulting from orbital precession. As predicted by orbital precession geometry (Berger, 1978), this South African record is out of phase with North African palaeomonsoon indices (Street and Grove, 1979; Rossignol-Strick, 1983; McIntyre el al., 1989); the amplitude of the rainfall response to insolation forcing agrees with climate model estimates (Prell and Kutzbach, 1987). These results document the importance of direct orbital insolation forcing on both subtropical North and South African climate as well as the predicted antiphase sensitivity to precessional insolation forcing.

Although some of the world's longest ring width and density-based climate reconstructions have been developed in northern Fennoscandia, it is still unclear if differences in micro-site ecology matter, and if so, whether they have been considered sufficiently in previous studies. We developed a Fennoscandia-wide network of 44 Scots pine ring width chronologies from 22 locations between 59 degrees-70 degrees N and 16 degrees-31 degrees E, to assess the effects of moist lakeshores and dry inland micro-sites on tree growth. Our network reveals a strong dependency of pine growth on July temperature, which is also reflected in latitude. Differences in forest productivity between moist and dry micro-sites are likely caused by associated effects on soil temperature. While trees at moist micro-sites at western locations exhibit higher growth rates, this pattern is reversed in the continental eastern part of the network, where increased ring widths are found at drier sites. In addition to the latitudinal increase in growth sensitivity to July temperature, pines at moist sites exhibit an increased dependency of summer warmth. The highest temperature sensitivity and growth coherency, and thus greatest suitability for summer temperature reconstructions, is found in those regions where July mean temperatures range between 11.5 and 13.5 degrees C, and May precipitation totals do not exceed 100 mm. Our study not only provides guidance for the selection of sampling sites for tree ring-based climate reconstructions, but also reveals the effect of micro-site ecology on Fennoscandian forest growth. The manifestation of micro-site effects varies substantially over the Fennoscandian boreal forest and is predominately triggered by the geographical setting of the stand as expressed by differing abiotic site factors.					buentgen, ulf/J-6952-2013; Tejedor, Ernesto/AAX-8547-2020; Esper, Jan/O-3127-2018; Hartl, Claudia/Q-5382-2018	Esper, Jan/0000-0003-3919-014X; 													1125-7865	1612-0051				FEB	2021	65								125787	10.1016/j.dendro.2020.125787	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dendro.2020.125787													WOS:000612307400005
J	Vadstrup, M; Madsen, TV				Vadstrup, M; Madsen, TV			Growth limitation of submerged aquatic macrophytes by inorganic carbon	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. This study determined the effects of CO2 and HCO3- enrichment on in situ growth of two submerged macrophytes, Elodea canadensis and Callitriche cophocarpa, in two Danish lakes: Lake Hampen and Lake Vaeng. Lake Hampen is an oligotrophic low-alkaline lake (0.4 meg 1(-1)) and Lake Vaeng is mesotrophic with an alkalinity of 1.1 meg 1(-1). In Lake Hampen experiments were carried out throughout the growth season, whereas experiments in Lake Vaeng were restricted to late summer. The CO2 and HCO3- enrichment procedures used increased the concentration of free-CO2 by 500-1000 mu M and the concentration of HCO3- by about 80 CIM. 2. The concentration of free-CO2 in Lake Hampen was about five times atmospheric equilibrium concentration (55 mu M) in early summer declining to virtually zero at the end of summer. 3. Under ambient conditions Callitriche, which is restricted to CO2 use, was unable to grow and survive in both lakes. In contrast, Elodea, which has the potential to use HCO3- in photosynthesis, grew at rates varying from 0.046 to 0.080 day(-1) over the season. 4. Under CO2 enrichment the growth rate of Callitriche varied from 0.089 to 0.124 day-l and for Elodea from 0.076 to 0.117 day(-1) over the season. Enrichment with HCO3- affected Elodea only and only to a limited extent. This may be a result of insufficient increase in [HCO3-] upon enrichment or to a limited capacity of the plants to take up HCO3-. 5. The substantial stimulation of in situ growth of Elodea and Callitriche by enhanced concentrations of free-CO2 shows that inorganic carbon is an important determinant of growth of submerged macrophytes and that inorganic carbon limitation of in situ growth may be a common phenomenon in nature, even in lakes with an alkalinity as high a 1 meg 1(-1). Inorganic carbon, however, is only one of many parameters important for growth, and the growth rates of Elodea at both ambient and high free-CO2 were closely coupled to day length and photon irradiance, indicating that light had an ultimate control on growth.																			0046-5070					DEC	1995	34	3					411	419		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00899.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1995.tb00899.x													WOS:A1995TP03400001

Because the decrease in P concentrations derives most probably either directly or indirectly from fish, which are the main target of biomanipulation, this study examined the P release of 0+, 1+ and 2+ roach [Rutilus rutilus (L.)] and changes in the P release during summer in a shallow eutrophic lake in Finland. 2. The P release was separated into P derived from benthic and littoral food items and into recycled P derived from feeding on zooplankton, to estimate the contribution of net P additions to the water column by the fish to the increase in P concentrations of the lake water (75-110 mg P m(-3)) in summer 1991-96. . Individual P release of roach by both egestion and excretion was estimated with a bioenergetics model. The size of the roach population was estimated with a depletion method and the proportions of different age groups from catch samples, using a programme separating mixtures of normal distributions. The sensitivity of the release estimates to variation in the growth data was estimated with the jackknife technique. 4. The biomass-specific P release by 0+ roach (0.36-0.54 mg P g(-1) day(-1)) was higher than that by older roach (0.07-0.16 mg P g(-1) day(-1)) throughout the summer. The P release by the whole roach population deriving from benthic and littoral food items (0.7-2.7 mg m(-3) during July to August, representing a net addition to the water column) was 5-19 times lower in 1991-96 than the recycled P release deriving from zooplankton (8.9-25.7 mg m(-3)), and too low to explain the increase in the P concentration of the lake water during the summer. Because the biomass-specific P release and roach diet composition vary with fish age, it is important to consider the age structure of fish populations to obtain correct estimates of P release and net additions to the water column. 5. The removal of roach by fishing diminished the roach stock greatly, but the fish-mediated P release to the water column changed little. This effect was because of the high compensation capacity of the roach population, leading to high recruitment of young fish with higher biomass-specific P release rates. 6. External loading is very low during summer months and therefore it cannot explain the increase in the P concentration of water during that time. Internal loading from the sediment might be as high as 10.2 mg P m(-2) day(-1), i.e. 50 times higher than the maximum net P addition by the total roach population.

J	JAMES, WF; BARKO, JW				JAMES, WF; BARKO, JW			LITTORAL-PELAGIC PHOSPHORUS DYNAMICS DURING NIGHTTIME CONVECTIVE CIRCULATION	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Littoral phosphorus dynamics and P exchanges between littoral and pelagic zones, driven by nighttime convective circulation, were examined in Eau Galle Reservoir, Wisconsin, during summer 1989. Rates of P release from littoral sediments, measured in laboratory incubation systems, increased linearly with pH under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Estimated rates of P release from littoral sediments, based on field measurements of pH and oxygen, averaged 3.6 mg m-2 d-1 under aerobic conditions and were in close agreement with independently determined diffusional fluxes across the littoral-sediment interface. Marked vertical gradients in P developed during summer in bottom waters of the littoral zone. The littoral zone cooled more rapidly at night than the pelagic zone on 72% of midsummer days (June-August), promoting nighttime convective circulation. On the basis of patterns of dye dispersion during these periods of circulation, cooler littoral bottom water moved into the pelagic zone as an interflow confined to the base of the epilimnion, while warmer pelagic water moved into the littoral zone as a surface flow. Hourly volumetric flow rates were linearly related to mean negative horizontal temperature gradients that developed at night. Net total P flux from the littoral to the pelagic zone ranged from 0. 12 to 0.43 Mg m-2 h-1 (avg. 0.22) for the summer. Nighttime convective circulation seems to be an important mechanism for movement of littoral P to the pelagic zone in this reservoir.																			0024-3590					JUL	1991	36	5					949	960		10.4319/lo.1991.36.5.0949	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1991.36.5.0949													WOS:A1991GP59400010

Stopovers of Swans (Cygnus cygnus and C. bewickii) (Anatidae, Aves) in the Agricultural Landscape of Southern Karelia during the Spring Migration	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Spring migrations of the Whooper swan and Bewick's swan were studied on farmland near the town of Olonets during the years 1997-2017. Usually the majority of swans crosses the territory of the agricultural landscape in transit, and only a small portion of the birds stayed in it for feeding for 1-2 days. In 2017, swans formed a mass migration stopover in the fields, 340 to 1328 individuals per day were counted on it for 11 days, the majority of which (about 90%) were Bewick's swans. It was established that such a high concentration of swans in the fields was a result of an unfavorable ecological situation in the region at the beginning of their mass migration. The places of traditional migration stopovers in shallow waters of Lake Ladoga were closed by floating ice, and unusually cold weather in the second half of April and ice-covered water bodies in the northern part of the migratory route hindered the migration of birds to their breeding grounds. In the current situation, the swans were forced to look for new places of feeding and concentrated in the most favorable (for this purpose) grounds of the agricultural landscape.

Mt Skrubben (848 m a.s.l.), in Dividalen, was deglaciated down to below 280 m a.s.l. during 10 800-10 300 cal. yr BP. Betula pubescens established 10100 cal. yr BP at 280 m a.s.l. and expanded up to near the summit during the next 700 years. Birch woodland prevailed on the mountain plateau until 3300 cal. yr BP. Local Pinus sylvestris stands are recorded up to 400 m a.s.l. at 8450 cal. yr BP and >548 m a.s.l. about 8160 cal. yr BP. Alnus incana expanded from 400 to nearly 790 m a.s.l. during the period 7900-7600 cal. yr BP. The maximum forest distribution lasted until ca. 6000 cal. yr BP. Marked climatic deteriorations caused lowering of the forest-lines around 4600 and 3000 cal. yr BP. Reconstruction of the Summer temperature indicated mean July temperatures at 400 m a.s.l. of 1.5-3 degrees C above the present during the period of maximum forest expansion, whereas >3 degrees C above the present temperature at 548 m a.s.l.

The fish were hatchery-raised or captured from lakes in the southern Okanagan Valley, and the experiments were carried out in the Summerland Trout Hatchery, Summerland, B. C. Following forced exercise for 15 minutes in water at 11.5[degree]C the hemo-glooin level increased significantly in only one species and the lactic acid increased significantly in all species. There appears to be a correlation between the average value of lactic acid following exercise and the activity of the fish, and also with the position of the species with respect to summer water temperature.																									1955	12	6					917	924		10.1139/f55-048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f55-048													WOS:A1955WZ51600004

In this study we report short-term trends in organochlorine (OC) levels in fish from Lake Winnipeg in the months and years following the 1997 100-year flood of the Red River ecosystem. Our goal was to understand the effects of an episodic event on OC levels in benthic and pelagic invertebrates and in fish. Despite elevated loading of OCs into the south basin of Lake Winnipeg during the flood there were no differences in OC levels of surface sediments or emergent mayflies. After adjusting for differences in lipid content and length among sample times, we did find significant increases in total DDT (SigmaDDT) and total polychlorinated biphenyl (SigmaPCB) post-flood (March 1999) in top predators including walleye and burbot. Significant increases were also observed in OC concentrations of zooplankton and yellow perch (>2 fold in SigmaPCB, SigmaDDT, total chlordane (SigmaCHL), total chlorobenzenes (SigmaCBZ)) and walleye (1.4 fold SigmaPCB) over a 2-month period in the summer following the flood. Analysis of specific congener patterns over time suggest that the major changes in fish OC levels pre- and post-flood did not appear to be linked to transport of new compounds into the Lake during the flood, but to species shifts within the plankton community. Our results indicate that short-term variation (similar to2 months) in OC distributions within biota may be equal to or greater than those resulting from episodic events such as spring floods.					; Kidd, Karen/ABG-3237-2020; Kidd, Karen A/ABG-3237-2020; Muir, Derek/F-6183-2011	Muir, Derek/0000-0001-6631-9776; Stewart, Robin/0000-0003-2918-546X; Stern, Gary/0000-0003-2160-0841; Kidd, Karen A/0000-0002-5619-1358; 													0380-1330						2003	29	2					332	354																WOS:000183819000012

Modern oxygen and hydrogen isotope water data are used as a means of comparing present-day isotope composition of the lake water to the past oxygen isotope composition of the lake water as calculated from (18)O/(16)O ratios in calcite precipitated in the summer months. Despite the lake system being chemically dilute, the modern isotope data clearly establish that the lake water is evaporated in relation to its spring input, suggesting that the palaeo data can be interpreted primarily in terms of changing precipitation/evaporation ratios. delta(18)Oand delta(13)C values from authigenic calcite through the Holocene show predominantly negative values indicating climatic conditions wetter than today. Particularly notable are low (depleted) isotope values during the earliest Holocene (ca. 10 600-8800 cal. yr. BP), a period for which pollen data imply drier conditions than at present. This divergence between pollen-inferred and stable isotope palaeoclimate data is found in other east Mediterranean lake sediment records, and suggests that vegetation may have taken several millennia to reach climatic equilibrium at the start of the Holocene. Isotopic fluctuations during the early-to-mid Holocene (8800-5100 cal. yr. BP) suggest oscillations between aridity and humidity. Higher delta(18)O and delta(13)C values for the second half of the Holocene indicate generally drier conditions than during the period before ca.5100 cal. yr BP although there is some evidence for increased humidity coinciding with pollen evidence for increasing human impact and intensification of agriculture, notably during the so-called Beysehir Occupation Phase (Classical and early Byzantine periods). The modern trend towards aridity started about 1300 yr ago. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Information on the factors initiating biogenic meromixis in Hall Lake, Washington, was sought using an analysis of the recent sediment in conjunction with known historical events. X-rays of six 50-cm cores showed cryptic laminations that proved to be varves resulting from winter rains, which concentrated silt and clay input in that season. Precise estimation of annual sedimentation rates over the past 350 yr permitted calculations of fluxes of total mineral matter, organic matter, Fe, Ca, Na, K, Pb, Si, Al, Mg, Ti, S, P, chlorophyll degradation products and cladoceran microfossils. Relative abundance diagrams also were constructed for pollen and major diatom taxa. The sedimentary record left during the known period of meromixis (1950-1962) was characterized by mesotrophy, stable mineral flux rates, moderate algal production, stable organic fluxes and relatively low sedimentation rates, implying insignificant influx of silt-laden waters during winter when meromictic stability is minimal. The absence of sapropel in the sediments during the meromictic era suggests that sapropel is more characteristic of anoxia and adequate Fe and S than of incomplete winter circulation. A change from Daphnia rosea to D. pulex associated with the destruction of meromixis in 1963 was documented, but this shift cannot be explained. Major changes in the flux of D. rosea and Bosmina longirostris microfossils to the sediments in the lower portion of the core also are as yet unexplained. An attempt to study the population dynamics of D. rosea based on frequency distributions and using a computer model demonstrated that there is a systematic underrepresentation of the smaller instars preserved in the sediments, making such studies impossible. The lake has been eutrophic most of the time since 1900 and perhaps at various times in the preceding 230 yr, including the period since European settlers arrived in 1856. The lake has experienced major changes in productivity in the past 350 yr due to disturbance in the watershed from lumbering, road construction and probably utilizations by beaver colonies. There is no unequivocal evidence of meromixis at times prior to 1915 when the sawmill left the lake.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1981	62	3					848	863		10.2307/1937750	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1937750													WOS:A1981LW72000037
J	Beets, CJ; Beets, DJ				Beets, CJ; Beets, DJ			A high resolution stable isotope record of the penultimate deglaciation in lake sediments below the city of Amsterdam, The Netherlands	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												A detailed record of the deglaciation history of the penultimate glacial to interglacial transition is given, mainly based on the stable isotopes of calcium carbonate-containing lake sediments in a glacially excavated depression below the city of Amsterdam. Initially, this depression, the Amsterdam Basin, formed part of a lake covering the western and central part of the Netherlands and extending for an unknown distance into the present North Sea. Annual layer counting shows that the lake drained after about a millennium, leaving shallow pools in the remaining depressions. The latter changed again into larger and deeper lakes including the Holland Lake during the rise of sea level in the early Eemian. Oxygen isotope values of the early lake sediments indicate an interglacial summer climate, but the nearness of dead-ice fields caused severe winters. The isotope record is furthermore characterized by the influx of large amounts of isotopically light water supplied by the river Rhine. A change to much colder conditions occurred simultaneously with the draining of the Holland Lake, as appears from oxygen isotope values and the sudden increase in non-arboreal pollen. This interval is correlated with the Kattegat Stadial and the sea-level standstill of Aladdins Cave on the Huon Peninsula of New Guinea. A short climate wiggle occurs at the end of this interval. The onset of the Eemian is marked by a rapid warming of similar to 5degreesC which extends into local pollen-zone E3. Provided that our correlation of this cold interval with the sea-level standstill of Aladdins Cave is correct, the time interval between the earliest lake sediments in the Amsterdam Basin and the Eemian highstand took about 5-6 millennia.

MINE-DERIVED MERCURY: EFFECTS ON LOWER TROPHIC SPECIES IN CLEAR LAKE, CALIFORNIA	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Considerable ecological research on mercury (Hg) has focused on higher trophic level species (e. g.,fishes and birds), but less on lower trophic species. Clear Lake, site of the abandoned Sulphur Bank Mercury Mine, provides a unique opportunity to study a system influenced by mine-derived Hg. An exponentially decreasing gradient of total Hg (TotHg) away from the mine allowed us to evaluate Hg bioaccumulation in planktonic and benthic invertebrates and evaluate population- and community-level parameters that might be influenced by Hg. Studies from 1992-1998 demonstrated that TotHg in lower trophic species typically decreased exponentially away from the mine, similar to trends observed in water and sediments. However, a significant amount of invertebrate TotHg (similar to 60% for sediment-dwelling chironomid insect larvae) likely derives from Hg-laden particles in their guts. Spatially, whole-body methylmercury (MeHg) did not typically exhibit a significant decrease with increasing distance from the mine. Temporally, TotHg concentrations in plankton and chironomids did not exhibit any short-term (seasonal or annual) or long-term (multiyear) trends. Methylmercury, however, was elevated during late summer/fall in both plankton and chironomids, but it exhibited no long-term increase or decrease during this study. Although data from a 50-yr monitoring program for benthic chaoborid and chironomid larvae documented significant population fluctuations, they did not demonstrate population- level trends with respect to Hg concentrations. Littoral invertebrates also exhibited no detectable population- or community-level trends associated with the steep Hg gradient. Although sediment TotHg concentrations (1-1200 mg/kg dry mass) exceed sediment quality guidelines by up to 7000 times, it is notable that no population- or community-level effects were detected for benthic and planktonic taxa. In comparison with other sites worldwide, Clear Lake's lower trophic species typically have significantly higher TotHg concentrations, but comparable or lower MeHg concentrations, which may be responsible for the discrepancy between highly elevated TotHg concentrations and the general lack of observed population- or community-level effects. These data suggest that MeHg, as well as TotHg, should be used when establishing sediment quality guidelines. In addition, site-specific criteria should be established using the observed relationship between MeHg and observed ecological responses.					; Eagles-Smith, Collin/T-8580-2019	Eagles-Smith, Collin/0000-0003-1329-5285; 													1051-0761					DEC	2008	18	8					A158	A176		10.1890/06-1485.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-1485.1								19475923					WOS:000262606500010

We employ measurements throughout an entire winter from different elevations to examine the chemical and dynamical processes driving these episodes. Whereas primary pollutants such as NOx and CO were enhanced twofold during PCAPs, O-3 concentrations were approximately threefold lower. Atmospheric composition varies strongly with altitude within a PCAP at night with lower NOx and higher oxidants (O-3) and oxidized reactive nitrogen (N2O5) aloft. We present observations of N2O5 during PCAPs that provide evidence for its role in cold-pool nitrate formation. Our observations suggest that nighttime and early morning chemistry in the upper levels of a PCAP plays an important role in aerosol nitrate formation. Subsequent daytime mixing enhances surface PM2.5 by dispersing the aerosol throughout the PCAP. As pollutants accumulate and deplete oxidants, nitrate chemistry becomes less active during the later stages of the pollution episodes. This leads to distinct stages of PM2.5 pollution episodes, starting with a period of PM2.5 buildup and followed by a period with plateauing concentrations. We discuss the implications of these findings for mitigation strategies.

Simulation of operations and water quality performance of reservoir multilevel intake configurations	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE												A predictive framework is developed and applied to evaluate benefits of multilevel intake configurations in managing temperature (T-w) and turbidity (C-T,C-W) in water withdrawn from a water supply reservoir, Schoharie Reservoir, New York, that presently, has a single level intake. High values of T-w occur in late summer for the reservoir in major drawdown years, and high C-T,C-W levels occur irregularly following runoff events. The framework, composed of a tested two-dimensional water quality model for temperature and turbidity linked to a heuristic optimization algorithm, supports automated selection of intake levels to meet user-specified operational goals. Multilevel intake configurations are demonstrated to avoid exceedences of a State discharge standard (21.1 degrees C) for T-W for the conditions of a critical historic year, through a strategy of withdrawal of warmer upper layers through early summer and subsequent blending with cooler lower layers as necessary, at both the existing intake site and a deeper down-reservoir location. The adequacy of the existing intake site is challenged for this critical year if a conservative lower Tw standard is set to accommodate the effects of model uncertainty. Amelioration of high C-T,C-W values is demonstrated for multilevel intake configurations. The operation of a multilevel intake facility in the reservoir would result in a shallower epilimnion and metalimnion in many years, and summer surface temperatures would be lower in major drawdown years. The modeling approaches used in this analysis are generally applicable to support evaluations of multilevel intake configurations for other water supply lakes and reservoirs.

Clear differences in carbon and energy exchange were found among these ecosystems, in both the instantaneous fluxes and the related longer-term balances. The available solar energy and its partitioning into sensible and latent heat fluxes differed markedly among the sites. The characteristics of the CO2 exchange at individual sites varied in terms of the maximum uptake and emission capacity and the associated responses to environmental drivers. The highest instantaneous fluxes were observed over wetland and forest. The mean annual balance showed a considerable net uptake at the wetland, while the balances of the fell top and the forest were both close to zero. The lake, on the other hand, was estimated to be a relatively large source of carbon dioxide. An upscaling exercise based on the actual land-use map of the surroundings demonstrated the importance of including all the major ecosystems in the landscape CO2 balance.

Microbial Community in Hyperalkaline Steel Slag-Fill Emulates Serpentinizing Springs	DIVERSITY-BASEL												To date, a majority of studies of microbial life in hyperalkaline settings focus on environments that are also highly saline (haloalkaline). Haloalkaline conditions o ff er microbes abundant workarounds to maintain pH homeostasis, as salt ions can be exchanged for protons by dedicated antiporter proteins.

In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequences and metagenomic sequence libraries were collected to assess the taxonomic composition and functional potential of microbes present in these slag-polluted waterways. Relative 16S rRNA gene abundances in Calumet sediment and water samples describe community compositions not significantly divergent from those in nearby circumneutral conditions. Major di ff erences in composition are mainly driven by Proteobacteria, primarily one sequence cluster closely related to Hydrogenophaga, which comprises up to 85% of 16S rRNA gene abundance in hyperalkaline surface sediments. Sequence identity indicates this novel species belongs to the recently established genus Serpentinomonas, a bacterial lineage associated with natural freshwater hyperalkaline serpentinizing springs.

Accordingly, the use of labels such as 'natural foods' and 'organic ingredients' has become more widespread, and greater emphasis is being placed on improving quality of life. Water is an essential element for human life, and water quality has a significant impact on human health. However, technology that can precisely determine the substances present in water is still lacking. This study was conducted to establish a complete mass spectrometry process, from pretreatment to analysis, to measure and characterize natural organic matter (NOM) in Korean spring water samples. Salts and other matrices were removed from the samples using solid-phase extraction (SPE) with two different columns (PPL and C18). After establishing an accurate analysis method, the experimental results were evaluated based on Van Krevelen diagrams and analysis of molar O/C and H/C ratios. The method for characterizing NOM introduced herein should facilitate evaluation of water quality.

Data obtained were statistically analysed to reveal relationships between the elements within the cells and in the lake water. The results confirmed that algal biomass production was mainly controlled by availability of Si. The depletion of ambient Si coincided with changes in the intracellular elemental composition, particularly a considerable reduction of intracellular Si whose depletion was also reflected in changes of intracellular elemental correlations and ratios. A simple structural model of elemental relationships in S. rotula cells is proposed to explain the pattern of intracellular elemental associations. This model can be used as a reference for species response to changes in environmental parameters. S. rotula provided a significant contribution to overall biogeochemical cycling due to the removal of nutrients from the water column and transporting them to bottom sediments following the culmination of the bloom. The role of S. rotula was particularly prominent in the biogeochemical cycle of silicon, as the diatom's spring growth may account for more than 20% of its total annual loss to bottom sediments.

Imaging of the ice-water interface showed the development of ice algae in 0.3-0.4 mm wide brine channels between laminar ice crystals in the lower 4-6 mm of the ice, with a several-fold spatial variation in inferred biomass on cm scales. The maximum quantum yield of photosynthesis, F (v) /F (m), was initially low (similar to 0.1), though this increased rapidly to similar to 0.5 by day 6. Day 6 also saw the onset of biomass increase, the cessation of ice growth and the time at which brine had reached < 50 psu and >-2 A degrees C. We interpret this as indicating that the establishment of stable brine channels at close to ambient salinity was required to trigger photosynthetically active populations. Maximum relative electron transport rate (rETR(max)), saturation irradiance (E (k)) and photosynthetic efficiency (alpha) had also stabilised by day 6 at 5-6 relative units, similar to 30 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) and 0.4-0.5 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1), respectively. E (k) was consistent with under-ice irradiance, which peaked at a similar value, confirming that daytime irradiance was adequate to facilitate photosynthetic activity throughout the study period. Photosynthetic parameters showed no substantial differences with depth within the ice, nor variation between cores or brine channels suggesting that during this early phase of ice algal growth cells were unaffected by gradients of environmental conditions within the ice. Variable chlorophyll fluorescence imaging offers a tool to determine how this situation may change over time and as brine channels and algal populations evolve.

Moreover, the determination of model parameters heavily relies on laboratory tests, along with the inevitable errors due to sampling disturbance. To address these limitations, this study introduces an enhanced elastic beam-spring model that incorporates non-limit state earth pressure and soil stiffness hardening. A novel CPTU-based analytical approach is then proposed to estimate wall deflections in deep excavations by correlating in-situ piezocone penetration test (CPTU) parameters with the model inputs. The validity and accuracy of the proposed approach are confirmed through comparison with previous centrifuge test data. The proposed approach is further applied to a deep excavation project in the soft soil deposits of Taihu Lake, where the CPTU-based predictions show good agreement with field measurements. In contrast, solutions derived from laboratory tests overestimate the wall deflections, likely due to underestimated soil stiffness caused by sampling disturbance. This discrepancy underscores the practical advantages of the proposed CPTU-based approach. Finally, the influence of excavation depth, Young's modulus of soil, stiffness of retaining structures, and strut stiffness on maximum wall deflections is explored through the proposed approach.					zhang, xiangyu/JHU-5578-2023; Lai, Fengwen/AGF-5336-2022; li, hongjiang/JBU-1599-2023														1000-7598					AUG	2025	46	8					2650	2660		10.16285/j.rsm.2025.0130	http://dx.doi.org/10.16285/j.rsm.2025.0130													WOS:001553680500027

The mean size of pelagic heterotrophic bacteria was small (0.04-0.05 mum3) for most of the summer, with short rods and cocci dominating. During the peak of small cyanobacteria which followed a Dinobryon bloom, however, large and elongated bacteria appeared and mean bacterial cell volume increased to 0.19 mum3. This phase lasted several days, then the size structure reverted to the previous condition with small and spherical cells predominating. Bacterial numbers peaked shortly after the decline of the algal bloom, and HNF reached their highest density approximately 1 week after the biomass maximum of bacteria. Diel changes of bacterial biomass, however, were of the same order of magnitude as seasonal ones. We hypothesize that small, flagellated predators, but also Dinobryon, were able to control the abundance of pelagic bacterial populations (top down) for almost the whole summer. Bacterial size, on the other hand, was significantly correlated with the abundance of phytoplankton, suggesting that bacterial cell volumes depend primarily on nutrient supply (bottom up). Consequently, the importance of both control modes to the bacterial biomass can change rapidly.

J	Ayer, CG; Katahira, H; Fukui, S; Koizumi, I				Ayer, Christopher G.; Katahira, Hirotaka; Fukui, Sho; Koizumi, Itsuro			Seasonal patterns of downstream movement in partially migratory stream-dwelling Dolly Varden	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Migration is a common behaviour among salmonids, but not all individuals within a population migrate, instead becoming residents and remaining in their natal streams. This phenomenon, known as "partial migration," is well studied among sea-run and lake-run populations; however, the lower migratory benefits and costs for mainstem-run individuals question whether the same mechanisms can be applied for stream-dwelling salmonids. In this study, we investigated main stem-run timing and body condition of partially migratory stream-dwelling Dolly Varden charr (Salvelinus malma) in the Shiisorapuchi River in central Hokkaido, Japan. Based on commonly observed patterns in sea-run and lake-run salmonids, we predicted that migration would occur during spring and consist predominantly of age 1 + females with some small subordinate males. Traps were placed at the mouths of two small tributaries along the Shiisorapuchi River periodically from May to December 2015. Adipose fin samples were taken for DNA to sex the individuals. Consistent to initial predictions, downstream movement occurs only once in the spring, dominated by age-1 + females. Trapped fishes (presumed migrants) were slightly longer but slimmer compared to the fish caught in the tributaries (presumed resident), which may be equivalent to smolts in anadromous populations. Regardless of migratory habitat, mechanisms driving partial migration in salmonids may be the same as long as production between natal stream and feeding habitats is significantly different.

Wave-Induced Mass Transport Affects Daily Escherichia coli Fluctuations in Nearshore Water	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Characterization of diel variability of fecal indicator bacteria concentration in nearshore waters is of particular importance for development of water sampling standards and protection of public health. Significant nighttime increase in Escherichia coli (E. coli) concentration in beach water, previously observed at marine sites, has also been identified in summer 2000 from fixed locations in waist- and knee-deep waters at Chicago 63rd Street Beach, an embayed, tideless, freshwater beach with low currents at night (approximately 0.015 m s(-1)). A theoretical model using wave-induced mass transport velocity for advection was developed to assess the contribution of surface waves to the observed nighttime E. coli replenishment in the nearshore water. Using average wave conditions for the summer season of year 2000, the model predicted an amount of E. coli transported from water of intermediate depth, where sediment resuspension occurred intermittently, that would be sufficient to have elevated E. coli concentration in the surf and swash zones as observed. The nighttime replenishment of E. coli in the surf and swash zones revealed here is an important phase in the cycle of diel variations of E. coli concentration in nearshore water. According to previous findings in Ge et al. (Environ. Sci. Technol. 2010, 44, 6731-6737), enhanced current circulation in the embayment during the day tends to displace and deposit material offshore, which partially sets up the system by the early evening for a new period of nighttime onshore movement. This wave-induced mass transport effect, although facilitating a significant base supply of material shoreward, can be perturbed or significantly influenced by high currents (orders of magnitude larger than a typical wave-induced mass transport velocity), current-induced turbulence, and tidal forcing.					; Phanikumar, Mantha/A-2523-2008	Nevers, Meredith/0000-0001-6963-6734; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB 21	2012	46	4					2204	2211		10.1021/es203847n	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es203847n								22257076					WOS:000300465900032

The impact of long thermal stratification events on some key properties in a polymictic lake was studied by determining the mixing regime of Muggelsee, Germany, using water temperature profiles taken hourly over 4 years. The period included two exceptional summer heatwaves. 2. Long thermal stratification events lasted from about 1 week to 2 months, and exhibited a high variability in thermocline depth and stratification intensity within and between events. 3. During stratification events, hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations strongly decreased while hypolimnetic SRP accumulation increased, depending on the duration and intensity of stratification and on hypolimnetic water temperature. 4. The impact of stratification on the functional phytoplankton composition increased with increasing stratification duration, but was rather different for the heatwaves. 5. Stratification events were followed by strong nutrient pulses into the euphotic zone and intense phytoplankton growth, particularly after the heatwaves. Hence, the influence of the climate extremes counteracted effects of reduced external nutrient loading.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2008	53	2					226	237		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01887.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01887.x													WOS:000252393800002

An understanding of climate change and the interactions between climate variables can help predict future climate variations. Here, we reconstruct a stack EM record for Southwest China over the past 90 kyr using environmental magnetism in lake sediment. The EM in Southwest China at the orbital scale was closely linked to precession-induced change in North Hemisphere solar insolation, as well as the ISM variability. However, at the glacial-interglacial scale, it was decoupled with ISM intensity, being wetter during glacial periods (weakened ISM) and drier during interglacial periods (enhanced ISM). Combined with modern meteorological observations, we suggest that the topographical barrier effect and temperature induced dryness are responsible for the decoupling between ISM intensity and EM. The terrestrial topography and temperature strongly influence EM distribution by altering the dynamics of onshore airflow and evapotranspiration.					; Toney, Jaime/I-5083-2012; Zhang, Tingwei/AAK-7302-2020	Xie, Yixuan/0000-0002-6031-3426; Zhang, Tingwei/0000-0002-9839-4559; Toney, Jaime/0000-0003-3182-6887; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				MAY 28	2023	50	10							e2023GL103297	10.1029/2023GL103297	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023GL103297													WOS:000999810400001

Maps at 1: 50 000 scale of changes of the glacier's elevation and extent for the periods 1938-1961, 1961-1990, 1990-2010, and 1938-2010 are analyzed in comparison with results of the authors' field work in the summer seasons 1983, 1984, 2000, 2005 and 2008. During all the 20th century, the progressive recession of the glacier revealed in a dramatic decrease in the thickness of its lower part, with a small reduction of its area and length. However, further shrinkage produced significant shortening and reduction in area which resulted in final decline of the Gaesvatnet glacial dammed lake in 2002. Hence, the lowest (and very thick, up to 150-160 m) part of the former glacier tongue and dammed lake were transformed into a new terraced river valley south of the glacier and a typical marginal zone with glacial landforms north of the glacier. Since 1961, the equilibrium line altitude of the Gasbreen glacier has risen from ca 350 to ca 500 m a.s.l. and now is located below the very steep rocky walls of the Mehesten mountain ridge, 1378 m a.s.l. Hence, the glacier is being fed by snow avalanches from these rocky walls and much more snow melts during the warmer summer seasons, stimulating a quicker recession of the lowest part of the glacier. This recession may be stopped only by significant climate cooling or increase in snow.					; Ostafin, Krzysztof/L-9471-2017; Dudek, Justyna/AAW-3351-2020	Ziaja, Wieslaw/0000-0003-1087-736X; Ostafin, Krzysztof/0000-0002-4426-3211; Dudek, Justyna/0000-0001-6233-5381													0138-0338	2081-8262				JUN	2016	37	2					155	172		10.1515/popore-2016-0010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/popore-2016-0010													WOS:000379153800001

BIOSYNTHESIS OF GOLD NANOPARTICLES BY BACTERIA FROM HYPERALKALINE SPRING AND EVALUATION OF THEIR INHIBITORY ACTIVITY AGAINST PYOCYANIN PRODUCTION	JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY BIOTECHNOLOGY AND FOOD SCIENCES												Nanoparticles are used in wide range of applications given their unique optical, chemical and electronic properties. Microbial biosynthesis of nanoparticles has offered a milder and eco-friendly alternative to physical and chemical methods of synthesis. One potential use of nanoparticles is for the inhibition of quorum sensing-mediated processes by microorganisms during pathogenic colonization and infection. In this study, bacteria from hyperalkaline spring (pH 11) were isolated using various enrichment media. The isolates, phylogenetically related to Lysinibacillus sp. and Pseudomonas stutzeri, were investigated for their ability to biosynthesize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) via reduction of chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) at pH 9. Extracellular synthesis of gold nanoparticles was confirmed by UV-Vis absorption analysis which showed a peak at 500-600 nm wavelength range corresponding to the surface plasmon resonance of AuNPs. The AuNPs synthesized were of spherical and irregular shapes as revealed by SEM analysis. The presence of elemental gold was further confirmed by EDX analysis. FTIR results showed that various functional groups are possibly involved in the reduction of HAuCl4 and stabilization of synthesized gold nanoparticles. The inhibitory effect of biosynthesized AuNPs was tested on the growth and pyocyanin production of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 during a 72-hour incubation period. Although the biosynthesized AuNPs showed no toxicity to the test organism, an increasing inhibition level of pyocyanin production was observed with increasing volumes of nanoparticles used. The levels of pyocyanin in setups treated with biosynthesized gold nanoparticles at 10, 30 and 50 mu L were significantly lower compared to the untreated setups (P <= 0.05). Our findings demonstrate that bacteria adapted to alkaline conditions can be used for efficient biosynthesis of AuNPs, which exhibited potential biomedical application in inhibiting pyocyanin production.																			1338-5178					OCT-NOV	2018	8	2					781	787		10.15414/jmbfs.2018.8.2.781-787	http://dx.doi.org/10.15414/jmbfs.2018.8.2.781-787													WOS:000455220000006

Hydrologic reconstructions from arid North Africa show an abrupt onset and termination of the African Humid Period. These abrupt transitions have been invoked in arguments that the African monsoon responds rapidly to gradual forcing as a result of nonlinear land surface feedbacks. Here we present a reconstruction of precipitation in humid tropical West Africa for the past 20,000 years using the hydrogen isotope composition of leaf waxes preserved in sediments from Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana. We show that over much of tropical and subtropical Africa the monsoon responded synchronously and predictably to glacial reorganizations of overturning circulation in the Atlantic Ocean, but the response to the relatively weaker radiative forcing during the African Humid Period was more spatially and temporally complex. A synthesis of hydrologic reconstructions from across Africa shows that the termination of the African Humid Period was locally abrupt, but occurred progressively later at lower latitudes. We propose that this time-transgressive termination of the African Humid Period reflects declining rainfall intensity induced directly by decreasing summer insolation as well as the gradual southward migration of the tropical rainbelt that occurred during this interval.					; Shanahan, Timothy/B-1298-2012; Otto-Bliesner, Bette/AAY-7691-2020; McKay, Nicholas/JYQ-5440-2024	McKay, Nicholas/0000-0003-3598-5113; Shanahan, Timothy/0000-0002-3831-3198; 													1752-0894	1752-0908				FEB	2015	8	2					140	144		10.1038/NGEO2329	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NGEO2329													WOS:000349354200019

However, the dynamic attribution behind this decadal increment remains unclear. Here, analysis of observations, large ensemble simulations, and pacemaker experiments indicates that this decadal increase was mainly attributed to the synergistic effects of the external forcing (anthropogenic greenhouse and aerosol emissions) and the Pacific internal variability, while the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean play a secondary role. Observations and simulations show that thermodynamic and dynamic effects work collaboratively to this increase. Remarkably, the upper-level dynamic convergence over the ITP would be enhanced through teleconnection and atmospheric dynamic feedback when involving the Pacific internal variability, resulting in more precipitation occurrence. Further analyses show that the enhanced stationary Rossby wave propagation over Eurasia and strengthened transient eddy activity over North Pacific could contribute to the anomalous cyclone over the ITP and weakened East Asian westerly jet, which built a pathway for the external forcing and Pacific internal variability collaboratively impacting the decadal increase in precipitation in the ITP. These results can improve our understanding of ITP summer precipitation attribution and can be applied to emergent constraints on future decadal precipitation prediction.

CSPcolor concentrations (CSP concentration determined spectrophotometrically) were 73.7-685.3 mu g BSA eq L-1 [mu g Bovine serum albumin (BSA) equivalent liter(-1)] in August 2016 and 100.6-396.4 mu g BSA eq L-1 in January 2017, respectively. CSP concentrations were high in low-salinity waters (<5), and declined from the river to the middle estuary by 80% in the wet season and 55.6% in the dry season, respectively, then increased again in the lower estuary due to high primary production. CSP concentrations were mainly associated with chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration except for the turbid mixing zone, suggesting that autochthonous phytoplankton production served as the primary source of CSP in the PRE. The concentrations of nitrogen (N) as CSP in the PRE were comparable to the nitrogen content of particulate hydrolysable amino acids (PHAA). Pictures of CSP taken by microscopy and the correlation between composition of PHAA and the ratio of Chl a/CSPcolor showed that CSP were relatively degraded due to delivery of old terrestrial protein to river section and extensive microbial degradation during mixing at the upper and middle parts of the estuary, whereas CSP in lower estuary appeared to be more labile due to higher fresh algal production. The contribution of CSP nitrogen (CSP-N) to the particulate nitrogen (PN) pool was 34.98% in summer and 30.8% in winter. The conservative estimate of CSP-N input flux in the Pearl River Delta was about 6 x 10(6) mol N d(-1). These results suggested that CSP was a significant pool of organic nitrogen in the PRE. The study of CSP composition in terms of nitrogen provides new insight into the roles of CSP on nitrogen biogeochemical processes in the turbid and productive estuarine system.

Molybdenum dynamics in sediments of a seasonally-hypoxic coastal marine basin	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Molybdenum (Mo) enrichments in marine sediments are a common indicator of the presence of sulphide near the sediment-water interface and can thereby record historic bottom-water oxygen depletion. Here, we assess the impact of temporal changes in manganese (Mn) cycling and bottom-water oxygen on sedimentary Mo dynamics in a seasonally-hypoxic coastal marine basin (Lake Grevelingen, the Netherlands). High resolution line scans obtained with LA-ICP-MS and discrete sample analyses reveal distinct oscillations in Mo with depth in the sediment. These oscillations and high sediment Mo concentrations (up to similar to 130 ppm) are attributed to deposition of Mo-bearing Mn-oxide-rich particles from the overlying water, the release of molybdate (MoO42-) to the pore water upon reduction of these Mn-oxides, and subsequent sequestration of Mo. The latter process only occurs in summer when sulphide concentrations near the sediment-water interface are elevated. Gravitational focussing of Mn oxides explains the observed increased input of Mo with increasing water depth. Diffusion of MoO42- from the overlying water contributes only a small amount to the sediment Mo enrichments. Cable bacteria may indirectly impact sediment Mo dynamics by dissolving Mn-carbonates and thereby enhancing the pool of Mn-oxides in the system, and by contributing to remobilisation of sediment Mo during oxic periods. A sediment record that spans the past similar to 45 years indicates that sediment Mo concentrations have increased over the past decades, despite less frequent occurrences of anoxia in the bottom waters based on oxygen measurements from water column monitoring. We suggest that the elevated Mo in recent sediments reflects both enhanced rates of sulphate reduction and sulphide production in the surface sediment as a result of increased input of organic matter into the basin from the adjacent North Sea since 1999, and an associated enhanced "Mn refluxing" in the marine lake in summer.

Field investigations and statistical analyses were carried out to study the water quality of a large, agriculture-stressed lakes (e.g., Chagan Lake) in Northeast China. The hydro-chemical properties of the Chagan Lake are HCO3<bold>CO</bold>3-Na. Nutrient (N and P) and non-nutrient (pH and F-) were found to be the major factors that threaten water quality safety of the lake. The concentration of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) was found to vary seasonally and at different locations. The overall lake water had mean TN and TP values of 2.19 mg/L and 0.49 mg/L, respectively, in summer. TN was the major factor for water quality deterioration in the western region of the lake, while TP was the principal factor in the other regions, as determined by a principal component analysis (PCA). Fluoride (F-) concentration in the lake water were related to the values of total dissolved solid (TDS), pH, and electrical conductivity (EC). In addition, eutrophication is a fundamental index that has been affecting the ecological evaluation of water quality. The results showed that trophic level index (TLI), trophic state index (TSI), and eutrophication index (EI) were evaluated to quantify the risk of eutrophication. However, TLI and TSI can better describe the purification effect of the wetland. These indices showed that the lake water was hyper-eutrophic in summer, with TLI, TSI, and EI values of 60.1, 63.0, and 66.6, respectively. Disparities in water quality were observed among whole areas of the lake. Overall, this study revealed that controlling agriculture drainage is crucial for lake water quality management. The study generated critical data for making water quality management plans to control the risk.

Lake Prossa is a macrophyte-dominated lake with an area of 33 ha and a mean depth of 2.2 m. Most of the bottom in this lake is covered by a thick mat of charophytes all the year round. Lake Kaiavere located at a distance of 10 kin from the former is a much larger (250 ha, mean depth 2.8 m) plankton-dominated lake. Despite the different area and the Chara meadows in Lake Prossa, the nutrient dynamics were very similar in both lakes. The first vernal phytoplankton peak was expressed in reduced Secchi depth in both lakes. After that peak, the water became clear in L. Prossa but remained turbid in Lake Kaiavere. In the Chara-lake the mean individual weight of zooplankton reached its maximum in both years in June. In the year 2000 it coincided with the peak of the zooplankton/phytoplankton ratio and with the minimum of soluble reactive phosphorus both contributing to the initiation of the clear-water period. Towards autumn, the individual mean weight of zooplankton decreased in the Chara-lake and remained smaller than in the plankton-dominated lake. Hence, zooplankton grazing could initiate the clear-water phase in the Chara-lake but other factors were needed for its maintenance. Another parameter that showed a clear difference between these two takes was the carbonate alkalinity. It was rather stable or even increasing during spring in the plankton-dominated lake, while it decreased by nearly 50% between April and July in the Chara-lake. The calculated saturation level of calcite remained still lower in the Chara-lake showing that the co-precipitation of algae with autochthonous calcite could not explain the observed increase in water transparency above Chara meadows. The reduced sediment resuspension and the possible allelopathic influence of charophytes on phytoplankton remain the main explanations for the maitenance of the extensive clear-water period in the Chara-lake.					; Tuvikene, Lea/H-8799-2016; Tõnno, Ilmar/G-5043-2016; Noges, Tiina/AAL-5373-2020; Nõges, Peeter/AAL-5343-2020; Agasild, Helen/AGG-7498-2022; Tonno, Ilmar/G-5043-2016	Tuvikene, Lea/0000-0001-6041-5900; Agasild, Helen/0000-0002-4926-9807; Tonno, Ilmar/0000-0002-8864-0402													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					567	573		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008625.36438.75	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008625.36438.75													WOS:000188455600075
J	CYWINSKA, A; DAVIES, RW				CYWINSKA, A; DAVIES, RW			PREDATION ON THE ERPOBDELLID LEECH NEPHELOPSIS-OBSCURA IN THE LABORATORY	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Six size classes of N. obscura ranging from cocoons through hatchlings (2-4 mg) to mature individuals (150 mg) were exposed to a range of potential predators and also tested for cannibalism. Neither cannibalism nor interspecific leech predation was found, but nine species of Coleoptera, Amphipoda, Hemiptera, and Zygoptera consumed one or more size classes of N. obscura. In general, predation rates were highest on individuals < 10 mg and declined with increasing size of N. obscura. Larger predators (intra- and inter-specifically) usually had higher consumption rates than smaller ones. Because of the high abundance of the nine sepcies of predators in prairie pothole lakes during the summer, it is speculated that predation on N. obscura hatchlings and cocoons is directly related to the recorded reductions in these size classes in the macrophyte zones during the summer.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				NOV	1989	67	11					2689	2693		10.1139/z89-380	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z89-380													WOS:A1989CA60000011

GB1023	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												We studied the carbon dioxide and methane fluxes from early June to mid-September 2001 in the Russian tundra of northeast Europe. Gas fluxes were measured with chamber techniques to determine the seasonal (100 days) carbon gas balance for terrestrial ecosystems representing various vegetation types. Also, the gas balance for aquatic ecosystems in the region was measured. The 2001 fluxes were compared to colder and wetter season fluxes from 1999. The Sphagnum sp. dominated peat plateau fen and Carex sp. and Sphagnum sp. dominated intermediate flarks were carbon sinks of 106 and 110 g C m(-2), respectively. In addition, methane emissions were highest from these sites. Other terrestrial surfaces lost carbon to the atmosphere (28-118 g C m(-2)). The thermokarst lake and the river had seasonal carbon losses of 15 and 34 g C m(-2), respectively. For areal integration, the distributions of the various functional surfaces were classified based on Landsat TM satellite image and on-site validation. This data was used to integrate the carbon fluxes for the entire Lek Vorkuta catchment. The upscaling indicated that the catchment (114 km(2)) lost 4 (+/-3.5) Gg C to the atmosphere in summer 2001. The results suggest that predicted warming in the tundra region would induce a substantial loss of carbon. In the warm summer of 2001, the carbon gas released from the whole northeast European tundra ( area 205,000 km 2) was 8 Tg C when calculated from the Lek Vorkuta data.					; Elsakov, Vladimir/P-9630-2015	Virtanen, Tarmo/0000-0001-8660-2464; Elsakov, Vladimir/0000-0001-7111-5161													0886-6236	1944-9224				FEB 6	2004	18	1							GB1023	10.1029/2003GB002054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2003GB002054													WOS:000189044000001

Despite their importance, the characteristics of P cycling under changing nutrient conditions in shallow lakes were poorly investigated. In this study, in situ incubation experiments were conducted in a natural riparian zone in the main diversion channel used for water transfer into Lake Taihu (Wangyu River). Variations in microbial biomass, dissolved P fractions (organic and inorganic), and alkaline phosphatase activity (bulk APA and specific APA) were determined after incubation with and without the addition of P and nitrogen (N) (4 total water treatments: +P, +N, +NP, and control). Experiments were conducted during two seasons (late spring and early fall) to account for natural differences in nutrient levels that may occur in situ. Our results demonstrated that low levels of DRP may not necessarily indicate P limitation. Phytoplankton exhibited serial N limitation with P stress in May, such that chlorophyll a (Chl a) increased significantly with N addition, while the limiting nutrient shifted to P in October and phytoplankton biomass increased with P addition. Phytoplankton contributed greatly to APA production and was significantly influenced by P bioavailability, yet high levels of bulk APA were also not necessarily indicative of P limitation. In contrast to phytoplankton, bacteria were less P stressed. As a consequence of enhanced utilization of dissolved reactive P (DRP) and dissolved organic P (DOP), +N treatment elevated APA significantly. By contrast, APA could be repressed to low values and phytoplankton converted a large portion of DRP to DOP with P addition. But this was not consistent with bacteria APA (bact-APA) in the absence or presence of abundant phytoplankton biomass. The correlation between bulk APA and DRP was good at separate sites and discrepant for the whole data set. Regulation of APA was demonstrated by an inverse hyperbolic relationship between bulk APA, specific APA, and DRP, with a transition from high to low activity occurring between 20 and 50 mu g L-1. This study provides a better understanding of how APA and P cycling change with nutrient perturbations in Lake Taihu system. The obtained results can help understanding the process of P cycling in water and providing a reference for nutrient control in the water transfer project.

An interannual comparison of the environmental variables and the planktonic biomass size-spectra was performed between 1988 and 1997. While nitrate concentration was low in 1988, the values in 1997 increased considerably. Since 1995, two alloctonous jellyfish species (Rhyzostoma pulmo and Cotylorhiza tuberculata) occurred in large numbers in summer time and reached peak abundance in summer of 1997. The size-spectra analysis comparison revealed that, in spite of changes in nutrient input that stimulated the growth of larger phytoplankton cells, there were no significant differences in the spectra slope which followed a similar seasonal trend in both years. However, the plankton biovolume considered under the size range compared (between 2 and 1000 mum diameter) was, paradoxically, always lower in 1997. Given that there were higher nutrient levels in 1997, this finding suggest a strong top-down control mechanism of size structure. Gut contents of jellyfishes showed their preference for large diatoms, tintinnids, veliger larvae and copepods, corroborating that size structure in these assemblages can be subject to top-down control. The implication of these results is that the feeding activities of large gelatinous zooplankton (jellyfishes) may play an important role controlling the consequences of eutrophication within the Mar Menor coastal lagoon.

Five mounds that represent a chronosequence are analysed with particular reference to initiation, aggradation and degradation phases. It is inferred that geoecological factors control initial mound formation beneath areas of thin (<20 cm) moss-peat, which provide summer insulation for developing permafrost. Low summer temperatures and low summer precipitation appear to allow the survival of permafrost, the existence of stable mounds, and limited height growth, after the gradual successional replacement of moss-peat by fellfield vegetation growing directly on the mineral substrate. Degradation occurs owing to thermokarstic processes, which result in the formation of rim-ridge ramparts. 'Exogenous' processes associated with lateral thermal erosion by lake and river water are important at the site. Regeneration and the possible effects of climatic change are also discussed. Palsas with only a thin peat cover in the initial stage of formation but no peat cover during subsequent development and degradation are considered to be near one extreme of a morphological and genetic continuum of pure peat palsas to mineral permafrost mounds. The rim-ridge ramparts characteristic of the degraded palsas of Leirpullan appear to provide appropriate modern analogues for relict Pleistocene forms in Wales and elsewhere in Europe formerly interpreted as pingo scars.

The effects of emergent macrophytes on water turbidity and sediment resuspension in the shallow Kirkkojarvi basin of Lake Hiidenvesi were studied with sediment traps, and concomitant sediment and water samples. The study was conducted during May-August in three different zones of a stand of the emergent Typha angustifolia. 2. Within the stand (5 m from the edge), both the concentration of suspended solids and the rate of sediment resuspension were significantly lower than at the edge and outside the stand (5 m from the edge). The differences between the zones increased towards the end of summer together with the growing stem density. During the study period (82 days), 2210 g dw m(-2) of sediment was resuspended in the outer zone. At the edge and in the inner zone, the corresponding numbers were 1414 and 858 g dw m-(2), respectively. 3. With the resuspended sediment, 39.4 mg P m(-2) day(-1) was brought to the water column outside the stand, 22.4 mg P m(-2) day(-1) at the edge and 13.4 mg P m(-2) day(-1) within the stand. 4. In early summer, the concentration of suspended solids had a highly significant positive effect on soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration in the water, whereas in late summer no effect was found. During the study period, phosphorus retention by emergent macrophyte stands corresponded to 3-5% of the present annual external phosphorus loading of the Kirkkojarvi basin.																			0046-5070					NOV	2001	46	11					1447	1455		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00765.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2001.00765.x													WOS:000172341400002

The lake has been allowed to recover without manipulation since autumn 1990. By the third year of recovery, similar to 40% of the change necessary to return to pre-acidification values of pH, acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), sulfate (SO42-) and calcium (Ca2+) had occurred. During recovery years 1-2, ANC was closely predicted by models based on acidification phase observations, but recovery during years 3-4 was slower than predicted. A possible explanation for the slowed recovery is acidification of the upper 0-5 cm of sediment, which acts as a sink for the ANC generated via SO42- reduction, the primary recovery mechanism. Trends for zooplankton did nor follow pH recovery very closely. Species diminished by acidification (e.g. Keratella cochlearis, Daphnia dubia) have not recovered, but species that dominated the community at pH 4.7 (e.g. K. taurocephala. D. catawba) have not maintained high populations. The time required for the zooplankton community to recover to pre-manipulation conditions is uncertain. Delays also have been observed for the mayfly species Caenis, which had disappeared at pH 4.7. In contrast, reproductive success of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmonides) mirrored that observed during acidification; egg hatch and survival of young-of-the-year to autumn recurred when pH exceeded response levels documented during acidification. Overall, recovery has not closely followed the pattern predicted by acidification responses.

Differences in the structure of the plankton community and the bacterioplankton-to-phytoplankton production ratio were found between riverine and lacustrine parts of the reservoir. Autotrophic (in the riverine part) and heterotrophic (in the lower lacustrine part) stages of the plankton community development were observed simultaneously in different parts of the reservoir.

J	Romare, P; Bergman, E; Hansson, LA				Romare, P; Bergman, E; Hansson, LA			The impact of larval and juvenile fish on zooplankton and algal dynamics	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The impact of young-of-the-year (YOY) fish predation on zooplankton dynamics and cascading effects down to phytoplankton were studied in lake enclosures using different densities of larval and juvenile European perch (Perca fluviatilis). Two experiments, one in June and one in August, were performed in Lake Dagstorpssjon, a slightly eutrophic lake in Scania, southern Sweden. In our experiments, we found that in August, there was a negative relation between YOY perch density and cladoceran biomass and between YOY perch density and cladoceran size. Moreover, in August, both rotifer and algal abundance increased with increasing YOY density, and species composition of algae was affected. At high YOY densities, there was also a negative effect on water transparency. In June, when growth of larval perch was slow and daphnid abundance low, larval perch was not the major structuring force on either zooplankton or algal communities. In early summer, the likelihood of YOY perch having an impact on cladoceran biomass is dependent on the timing of many factors. One factor is the timing between larval occurrence and the increase in large cladoceran biomass that will enhance larval growth. In late summer, however, a high enough predation pressure of juvenile fish will prevent recovery of large herbivores after the midsummer decline in zooplankton abundance and will drive the algal community toward a late summer species composition of small algal cells and blue-green algae.

GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												High resolution reconstructions of the India Summer Monsoon (ISM) are essential to identify regionally different patterns of climate change and refine predictive models. We find opposing trends of hydrological proxies between northern (Sahiya cave stalagmite) and central India (Lonar Lake) between 100 and 1300 CE with the strongest anti-correlation between 810 and 1300 CE. The apparently contradictory data raise the question if these are related to widely different regional precipitation patterns or reflect human influence in/around the Lonar Lake. By comparing multiproxy data with historical records, we demonstrate that only the organic proxies in the Lonar Lake show evidence of anthropogenic impact. However, evaporite data (mineralogy and delta O-18) are indicative of precipitation/evaporation (P/E) into the Lonar Lake. Back-trajectories of air-mass circulation over northern and central India show that the relative contribution of the Bay of Bengal (BoB) branch of the ISM is crucial for determining the delta O-18 of carbonate proxies only in north India, whereas central India is affected significantly by the Arabian Sea (AS) branch of the ISM. We conclude that the delta O-18 of evaporative carbonates in the Lonar Lake reflects P/E and, in the interval under consideration, is not influenced by source water changes. The opposing trend between central and northern India can be explained by (i) persistent multidecadal droughts over central India between 810 and 1300 CE that provided an effective mechanism for strengthening sub-tropical westerly winds resulting in enhancement of wintertime (non-monsoonal) rainfall over northern parts of the Indian subcontinent, and/or (ii) increased moisture influx to northern India from the depleted BoB source waters.

The aim of this study was to determine water quality and environmental factors associated with cyanobacteria dominance and microcystin production in Qingshan Lake, a subtropical lake located in the headwater of the Taihu watershed, China. Water samples collected monthly from 10 study sites in Qingshan Lake were analyzed for the species distributions of freshwater algae and physico-chemical parameters including total nitrogen (TN), ammonia (NH4 (+)-N), nitrate (NO3 (-)-N), total phosphorus (TP), and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) from June, 2008 to May, 2009. Qingshan Lake was found to be eutrophic, based on the calculated trophic state index (TSI). The average TN of 4.33 mg/L during the study period exceeded the Surface Water Quality Standards of China. TP was significantly correlated with relative abundance of cyanobacteria and Microcystis biovolume, indicating its important role in regulating cyanobacteria. Microcystis, Anabaena, and Oscillatoria were dominant cyanobacteria in Qingshan Lake from June to November, 2008. Cyanobacteria dominance was regulated by water temperature and TP. Principal component analysis further indicated that microcystin production was most affected by water temperature, TP, and cyanobacteria biomass. Results suggest that the control of TP in summer can mitigate cyanobacteria dominance and microcystin production in Qingshan Lake, and close monitoring should be undertaken in summer.

This study has investigated these extreme flood events and their nexus with climate i.e. precipitation and temperature. The available daily and hourly hydro-meteorological data were analyzed. The regional flow during both flood events were estimated using 1-D hydraulic HEC-HMS model and the correlation among rainfall -runoff, temperature with snow water equivalent were examined. Result show that the Melamchi region found an average annual rainfall of 2610 mm during 1992-2021. Specifically, the middle section i.e. Shermathang and Tarkeghang has observed the highest daily average rainfall of 26.8 mm and 39.2 mm during the first and 61.4 mm and 66.6 mm during the second flood event, respectively. The discharge found at the Melamchi town segment was at 2893 m3/s and 1105 m3/s in the first and second events respectively in which regional contribution into discharge were found significant. The Bhemathang, which is landslide damming area where The daily average discharge observed 357 m3/s and 76 m3/s on both events, respectively. At the Nakote, the rainfall and runoff are poorly correlated while snow water equivalent and temperature showed positive correlation during summer. The snowmelt contribution to discharge was found 9.68 m3/s in the Melamchi River during the Summer season. The regional contribution to discharge and spatial variations of precipitation during flooding events showed that precipitation is the main climatic driver while temporary damming and increasing temperature also contributes to the magnitude of the of the Melamchi flood.

Understanding the role of temperature in impacting freshwater biodiversity is therefore of paramount importance. Previous research suggested that temperature has a limited influence on freshwater diversity across the Holocene. However, this is mostly based on data resolved at centennial to millennial scales, and it is therefore unknown whether freshwater diversity responds similarly over shorter (decadal/multi-decadal) timescales. We present aquatic insect (Chironomidae) summer temperature reconstructions and key diversity metrics (alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and network skewness) from three annually laminated lacustrine records from Europe (Diss Mere, UK; Nautaj & auml;rvi, Finland; and Meerfelder Maar, Germany) across the Holocene, including multi-decadal resolutions within the Holocene Thermal Maximum (HTM) to test this. Our results reveal three major findings with both spatial and temporal elements: (1) At regional (European) scales, using all available data, there is a significant decline in all three diversity metrics with increased summer temperature; (2) at local multi-decadal scales across the HTM, in the absence of additional major land-use and eutrophication drivers, summer temperature has only a minor control on aquatic insect diversity (with the exception of a proposed cooling between 6.2 and 5.9 ka BP); and (3) at local low-frequency timescales, we find a similar relationship, albeit with warm temperatures appearing to promote assemblage stability. As such, temperature and diversity relationships are complex and non-linear through time and space. We argue that understanding variability in aquatic insect diversity across different temporal and spatial scales is important to consider when assessing the potential for future biodiversity changes under warming climatic regimes in the coming decades.					; Langdon, Peter/B-4682-2013	Lincoln, Paul/0000-0003-0566-2970; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				AUG 5	2025	31	8							e70366	10.1111/gcb.70366	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.70366								40762390					WOS:001543961300001

Red pine has been widely used in tree-ring studies of fire and climate variability across its range. Earlier studies have relied primarily on total annual ring width. Here we develop annual and subannual (i.e., earlywood, latewood, and adjusted latewood) chronologies from Itasca State Park to refine our understanding of red pine climate response. Our chronologies extend to the early 18th century and display common growth and cross-dating characteristics indicative of a significant common controlling mechanism. We found that total ring width contains dampened attributes reflective of both the temperature-limited earlywood and moisture-dependent latewood chronologies. The strongest relationship between climate and radial growth is between the adjusted latewood chronology and 3-month summer precipitation, suggesting that overall summer wetness rather than any single summer month primarily limits growth. The ability to disaggregate and improve upon the mixed climate signal of red pine highlights the potential of using intra-annual chronologies to strengthen future climate reconstructions. We hope the methodologies demonstrated here serve as a potential guide for future red pine chronology development in the region.					; Griffin, Daniel/AAE-8381-2021	Griffin, Daniel/0000-0002-1547-3615; 													0045-5067	1208-6037				MAY	2022	52	5					870	881		10.1139/cjfr-2021-0210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfr-2021-0210		FEB 2022											WOS:000793798900001
J	Nishihiro, J; Washitani, I				Nishihiro, Jun; Washitani, Izumi			Quantitative evaluation of water-level effects on "regeneration safe-sites" for lakeshore plants in Lake Kasumigaura, Japan	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												We evaluated the effects of water-level regime on the area of "regeneration safe-sites" for seed germination and initial establishment of seedlings of helophytes occurring in the emergent vegetation zone of Lake Kasumigaura, Japan. Based on the results of previous studies and an original experiment, potential regeneration safe-sites (PRS) for helophytes were defined as sites in which the ground surface was inundated for less than 3 consecutive days from 1 April to 15 May. We estimated and compared the areas of PRS both before and after the implementation of an artificial water-level regime in the mid-1970s. Comparisons were made using data on daily water levels during 1960-1969 and 1996-2005, topographic profiles of the lakeshore in 1967 and 2005, and areas of the emergent vegetation in 1972 and 1997. We estimated that the current area of PRS in the lake has been reduced to 24% of past levels. This reduction was accompanied by both a complete loss of a spring drawdown and a decrease in the area of emergent vegetation. The areas of PRS under various water management regimes indicated that a relatively slight lowering of the spring water level could cause a marked increase in the area of PRS ( e. g., a 10-cm decrease in the managed target water level could result in a doubling of the area of PRS). Our results suggest a water-level management policy that includes a spring drawdown can be effective in the restoration of helophyte species diversity through the recovery of PRS.

Under influence of sea level rise, the basin progressed from a wetland to a shallow lake between 8000 and 2500 cal yr BP and it slowly changed back into a wetland after sea level reached its highest position at around 2500 cal yr BP. The groundwater level in the basin was strongly affected by sea level rise and precipitation-forced runoff through the porous volcanic bedrock. Millennial-scale precipitation changes in the Mauritian lowlands were derived from the pollen records of semi-dry forest and palm woodland. Salinity and environmental reconstructions based on diatoms, ostracods, stable isotopes and sediment composition showed numerous decadal and centennial droughts and wet events. Mauritius experienced wet conditions between similar to 8000 and similar to 6800 cal yr BP, followed by decreasing humidity from 6800 to 6000 cal yr BP. Dry conditions persisted until similar to 1200 cal yr BP, after which wetter conditions have prevailed as recorded from Mauritian lowland and upland records. Climate dynamics reflects northern hemisphere monsoon activity and suggest that Mauritian rainfall and the Indian and Asian summer monsoons are linked, as both receive moisture from the southern equatorial Indian Ocean. The anti-phased relationship of climate dynamics between the Mauritian lowlands and western tropical Australia during the middle Holocene is interpreted as a prolonged configuration of a negative mode of the Indian Ocean Dipole OM. A negative IOD-like state is supported by decreased Asian summer monsoon rainfall, higher Austral-Indonesian summer monsoon rainfall and lower temperatures in the Kilimanjaro record. Conversely, repeated decadal-scale wet events in the Mauritian lowlands occurring every similar to 350 years reflect short positive IOD-like events. The onset of ENSO climate variability followed an anomalously strong negative 100-like event and shifted teleconnections from the tropical Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. A shift in ENSO activity around similar to 2600 cal yr BP signifies the decoupling of ENSO from the Atlantic ITCZ. Subsequently, the influence of ENSO on climate in the western Indian Ocean is indicated by increased storm frequency and drought events after 2660 cal yr BP in Mauritius and reduced monsoon activity in the western and eastern Indian Ocean.

Short-term dynamics of submerged aquatic vegetation diversity and abundance in deep lakes	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												QuestionWhat are the short-term trends of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in deep lakes? Is it possible to measure significant changes in SAV distribution in deep lakes characterized by different trophic states and stable water physico-chemical conditions using standard procedures over a 3-yr period (2010-2013), as defined by the Water Framework Directive? LocationWe collected data from four deep lakes belonging to the Italian volcanic lake system (central Italy), which is one of the most important reserves of freshwater in Mediterranean Italy as well as one of the main hotspots of stonewort diversity in the Mediterranean area. MethodsMacrophytes were sampled along five transects in each lake in 2010 and 2013. Data on aquatic plant diversity, composition and abundance were collected from each 1-m depth intervals down to the maximum colonization depth. Simultaneously, the water quality and climate were assessed by standard procedures. Data were analysed with PCA, ANOVA, PROTEST and rank abundance curves. ResultsThe sampling revealed a significant rearrangement of SAV. Increased species diversity in the first meters of depth (0-5m) was due to the migration of mid-depth species to lower depths. A reduction in the maximum growing depth of macrophytes was observed within the deepest stonewort communities (below 5m). No significant changes emerged in water quality or climate. ConclusionsOver 3yr, SAV displayed significant changes that appear to be independent of summer nutrient conditions and climate drivers. In particular, vascular and stonewort species underwent a distinct spatial rearrangement according to specific behaviours. The present data point to the need for more rigorous analyses of the intra-annual dynamics of macrophytes in deep lakes. An influence of the significant increase in spring precipitation (which is in keeping with local climate variability) recorded in central Italy in the last decade cannot be ruled out a priori, nor can the possibility of stochastic fluctuations be excluded. All these considerations further highlight the critical role of aquatic plants as bioindicators.

The bloom remained for approximately 1 month in the summer of 2004. The Arcos reservoir had moderate conductivity, up to 1756 mu Scm(-1), and relatively high nutrient concentrations. Planktonic biomass collected during the bloom period was found to be toxic by the Artemia salina bioassay. Analytical procedures based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated the absence of microcystins and anatoxin-a but clearly demonstrated the presence of cylindrospermopsin (CYN), suggesting that CYN from Aphanizomenon ovalisporum was the compound responsible for the toxicity in the bioassay. Measurements indicate that up to 9.4 mu g CYN-1 were present in the sestonic fraction. This is the first report of high concentrations of this cyanotoxin in European waters and the first known instance of a massive bloom of the cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon ovalisporum in Spain.

The significance of modern diatoms as paleoenvironmental indicators along an altitudinal gradient in the Andean piedmont of central Argentina	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The objectives of this study were to (a) analyze the distribution pattern of diatom assemblages in freshwater systems from central-western Argentina, (b) investigate the key climatic and limnological factors affecting the species distributions, and (c) evaluate the extent and limitations of diatoms as Quaternary paleoenvironmental indicators in the area. Diatoms were sampled and physical and chemical variables were quantified in a total of 45 lotic and lentic sites. Altitude, annual precipitation, and summer (January) temperature data were obtained from a world climate database. Previously published data from an adjacent region was incorporated into the modern dataset. Environmental variables significantly influencing diatom assemblage composition were identified through partial canonical correspondence analyses (CCAs). In order to assess the degree of analogy between modern and fossil assemblages, the modern analog technique (MAT) was applied. Diatom taxa showed distinct abundance patterns in relation to altitude, with a shift from communities dominated by periphitic and benthic taxa in lower sites to communities dominated by small benthic-tychoplanktonic taxa in high elevated waterbodies. The pH was the strongest variable explaining the variance within the diatom dataset, followed by log-conductivity and summer air temperature. The comparison of modern diatom assemblages with fossil sequences allowed reconstruction of the evolution of shallow, lentic and vegetated habitats. A good analogy between modern and Pleistocene diatom assemblages was found. The strong relationship between diatoms and climate-driven environmental variables, such as pH, conductivity and summer temperature, enhances the importance of the diatom floras as paleoclimatic indicators in the area and encourages future development of quantitative inference models for the region.

J	Atteia, O; Kozel, R				Atteia, O; Kozel, R			Particle size distributions in waters from a karstic aquifer: from particles to colloids	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Waters from the surface hydrologic network and the spring of a karstic aquifer in Switzerland were sampled to analyse their colloidal content. The measurements were done weekly with a single particle counter and were verified by other techniques. The particle size distribution (PSD) was modelled in two portions, below and above 5 mu m, using two types of equation: a power law (Pareto distribution) and an exponential law. The model results matched well with the entire PSD data set by varying the parameter values. The parameters obtained from fitting the measured PSD curves were then interpreted in relation to environmental factors. It appears that the two parts of the curves vary independently. The first part of the PSD curve, relating to the smallest particles, is dependent on the pH value of the spring or the temperature of the surface brook. In contrast, the second part of the curve depends mostly on the spring discharge volume. During high flow events, the major effect of the discharge on particle size occurs during the rising limb of the hydrograph, interpreted as clays deposited in the aquifer and resuspended due to high water velocity. The contrasted behaviour of the two parts of the PSD curves suggested that the break point in the curves represents the limit between colloidal and particulate behaviour. Knowing these dependencies, and the characteristics of the particulate matter, allowed the estimation of the role of the colloids in contaminant transport. Large fluxes of suspended matter, specific to karstic aquifers, demonstrate the critical role of colloids in contaminant transport, which is markedly different from what typically occurs in porous media.

J	RORSLETT, B				RORSLETT, B			AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO HYDROPOWER IMPACT ASSESSMENT .1. ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES OF SOME NORWEGIAN HYDROELECTRIC LAKES	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This paper launches concepts instrumental to environmental impact assessment (EIA) studies on hydropower schemes and lake regulations. Norwegian hydro-electric lakes (hydrolakes) and their environmental features are described, and evaluated against non-manipulated waters. A tentative classification of hydrolakes vs. natural waters is proposed. The need for a multiple approach to habitat classification is emphasized. Recommendations for future biological impact assessment approaches are suggested. Hydrolakes differ broadly from natural lakes by combining physical features not ordinarily co-occurring in non-manipulated water bodies. Storage type hydrolakes (reservoirs) feature winter draw-downs and enhancement of yearly level fluctuations; whereas other types of hydro-electric lakes have elevated water levels throughout winter. Hydrochemistry and optics of the studied hydrolakes exhibited no clear differences to non-impacted Norwegian inland waters. All lakes had signs of sublacustrine erosional activity related to internal waves and thermocline movements.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL 8	1988	164	1					39	66		10.1007/BF00014349	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00014349													WOS:A1988P512900005

This paper presents phosphorus mass changes in water body in Lake Biwa from April 1995 to January 2000 and discusses the main factors of the change, Phosphorus mass ranged from 190 to 350 t, with an average of 260 t. DP mass in 1995, '97 and '98 showed seasonal change patterns, while non-periodical phenomena seemed to control the PP mass. Phosphorus mass was increased about 15 t in epilimnion from April to July while nitrogen showed a 50 t decrease. This disagreement suggests that some processes selectively accumulated phosphorus in epilimnion during this period. However, such an increase in phosphorus was not observed in 1996 and '99. Air temperature was lower and much snowfall was recorded in 1996 and '99, suggesting that coldness in winter season weakened the phosphorus accumulation process to depress the mass in epilimnion in summertime. Water temperature increase seemed to be delayed in proportion to total snowfall, but thermocline was formed independently of coldness. Hence, the idea was abandoned that the delay of thermocline formation encouraged the sedimentation process, and biological activities were considered to be the main factor controlling phosphorus mass in the epilimnion in Lake Biwa.					; NAGARE, Hideaki/B-1838-2011	Nagare, Hideaki/0000-0003-2067-9869; 													1606-9749		1-900222-61-2				2001	1	2					49	56		10.2166/ws.2001.0020	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2001.0020													WOS:000175400600006
J	Ogren, SA; Huckins, CJ				Ogren, Stephanie A.; Huckins, Casey J.			Evaluation of suitability and comparability of stream assessment indices using macroinvertebrate data sets from the Northern Lakes and Forests Ecoregion	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Researchers and managers within the Upper Midwest currently use a variety of sampling methodologies and biological indices to assess ecological condition of stream systems. With multiple entities collecting bioassessment data it is important that we determine the comparability of data and the indices derived from these data for effective assessment of natural systems. In this study we assessed the similarity of data collected by different agencies and we focused on data from one watershed to examine the outputs of different indices for stream assessment, and the temporal variation of index score within sites. We compared duplicate macroinvertebrate community data collected by the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians and the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality for overall community composition and index scores derived from these data. Duplicate samples were similar in composition index scores. Taxonomic resolution was addressed and indicated that genus level resolution gives a more favorable score when using indices. We also evaluated the utility of currently available macroinvertebrate indices of biotic integrity to assess data from the Big Manistee River watershed. The indices evaluated were the Hilsenhoff biotic index, the benthic community index for the Northern Lakes and Forests (NLFBCI), the Great Lakes Environmental Assessment Survey (GLEAS) procedure 51 for macroinvertebrates and a biological condition gradient model for the Upper Midwest. Outputs from the indices were moderately correlated (Spearman rank order correlation, r=0.35-0.698) though they indicated different assessments of overall site integrity. Compared with larger scale regional indices, locally calibrated indices generally classified sites as having better biological condition. Replicate samples collected within sites indicated the GLEAS had higher levels of variability (0-265%CV) within sites than the other indices (<10%CV). Data from long-term (I 0 year) monitoring stations were used to evaluate seasonal and long-term index performance. There were differences in index score classifications from spring and fall samples indicating that standardization of sampling time is necessary for comparative analysis. Temporal trends over 10 years reveal natural variation and set the baseline for evaluating the influence of anthropogenic effects. Overall, results indicate that choice of index can alter assessment of site condition. For bioassessment in the Big Manistee River watershed the NLFBCI performs well and accurately reflects site condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Bioaccumulation of heavy metals and their histopathological impact on Mugil cephalus from the North Eastern Region of Manzala Lake, Egypt	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												There is a constant need for baseline information on the mugil fish health present in the North-Eastern region of Manzala lake. This study deals with the determination of the limit of heavy metals in Manzala lake as a representation of the northeastern area of Egypt and studied its impact on mugil health. Assessment of the mugil health achieved by studying the tissue heavy metal accumulation and histopathological examination of the different organs of fish. The result indicated the physical, chemical, and heavy metals properties of water and sediments of the mugil fish are above the maximum permissible limits for human consumption and that affects the mugil fish health. The histopathological damage in the gill, muscle and liver were severe in the autumn season. It is concluded that the environmental pollution of this area affected the mugil's health. Therefore, monitoring this pollution is necessary to improve mugil fish health. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Yet few long-term (i.e. >60 years) quantitative observational time series exist, particularly for ecosystems that have a long history of human intervention. Here, we combine three major environmental pressures (land use, nutrients and erosion) with quantitative summer and winter climate reconstructions and climate model simulations to explore the system dynamics, resilience and the role of disturbance regimes in varved eutrophic Lake abiskie (NE Poland) since AD 1000. The comparison between these independent sources of information allows us to establish the coherence and points of disagreements between such data sets. We find that climate reconstructions capture noticeably natural forced climate variability, while internal variability is the dominant source of variability during most parts of the last millennium at the regional scale, precisely at which climate models seem to underestimate forced variability. Using different multivariate analyses and change point detection techniques, we identify ecosystem changes through time and shifts between rather stable states and highly variable ones. Prior to AD 1600, the lake ecosystem was characterised by high stability and resilience against observed natural climate variability. During this period, the anthropogenic fingerprint was small; the lake ecosystem was buffered against the combined human and natural disturbance. In contrast, lake-ecosystem conditions started to fluctuate across a broad range of states after AD 1600. The period AD 1745-1886 represents the phase with the strongest human disturbance of the catchment-lake ecosystem. During that time, the range of natural climate variability did not increase. Analyses of the frequency of change points in the multi-proxy data set suggest that the last 400 years were highly variable and increased vulnerability of the ecosystem to the anthropogenic disturbances. This led to significant rapid ecosystem transformations.					; ALMEIDA, IVAN/G-3134-2015; Gómez-Navarro, Juan/L-3962-2014; HERNANDEZ-ALMEIDA, IVAN/G-3134-2015; Enters, Dirk/AAF-1669-2021; Przybylak, Rajmund/H-7961-2014; Piotrowska, Natalia/S-4528-2018; Tylmann, Wojciech/AAL-3504-2021; Gomez-Navarro, Juan Jose/L-3962-2014; Wacnik, Agnieszka/HSG-9078-2023; Przybylak, Rajmund/AAP-5388-2020; Bonk, Alicja/AAM-5328-2021	Wacnik, Agnieszka/0000-0003-1104-0705; Ustrzycka, Alicja/0000-0002-4084-9231; Enters, Dirk/0000-0002-0484-541X; HERNANDEZ-ALMEIDA, IVAN/0000-0002-9329-8357; Przybylak, Rajmund/0000-0003-4101-6116; Piotrowska, Natalia/0000-0002-8194-6767; Tylmann, Wojciech/0000-0003-1749-5882; Gomez-Navarro, Juan Jose/0000-0001-5488-775X; Witak, Malgorzata/0000-0002-7747-0516; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				FEB	2017	27	2					258	270		10.1177/0959683616658529	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683616658529													WOS:000394955300005

Outfalls from combined sewer systems are assumed to be the major source of bacteria to streams in many of these urban areas, including the Rouge River of southeastern Michigan. Current remediation strategies largely disregard other potential sources, including water entering the river from its headwaters region, rural runoff and contaminated groundwater. These other potential sources of bacterial pollution to the Rouge River were assessed and compared with bacteria contributed from combined sewer outfalls (CSOs). Fecal coliform (FC) and fecal streptococci (FS) densities were determined at 28 locations in the Rouge River Watershed during the spring and summer of 1997 1998, and 1999. The mean levels of both indicator groups vary considerably along each branch of the river and show no correlation to CSO locations. The magnitude of both FC and FS levels are, in fact, frequently greater at sites upstream of the part of the river influenced by discharges from CSOs. The highest FC levels coincided with rainfall events, but FC levels at various sites along each branch of the Rouge River violated acceptable water quality standards (200 colonies/100 mL) at nearly 50% of the sites even during dry, weather. Total suspended solids were moderately correlated with FC (r = 0.79) throughout the watershed, suggesting that solids may play a role in transporting bacteria into the Rouge River. The data depict a strong influence of upstream water and rural runoff on the water quality of the Rouge River. FC to FS ratios (FC/FS) suggest the primary source of bacteria throughout the watershed is from domesticated animals and wildlife and not from sewage derived from CSOs.																			0380-1330						2001	27	2					220	229		10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70635-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70635-1													WOS:000169535900010

J	Zic, V; Caric, M; Ciglenecki, I				Zic, Vesna; Caric, Marina; Ciglenecki, Irena			The impact of natural water column mixing on iodine and nutrient speciation in a eutrophic anchialine pond (Rogoznica Lake, Croatia)	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The effect of natural water column mixing on the inorganic iodine and nutrient speciation in an intensely eutrophicated anchialine pond has been studied in late seasons of 2003 and 2004. As a result of an extremely warm and very dry European summer of 2003 this system attained isohaline and isothermal conditions in late-summer. Vertical mixing between highly reducing deep water with that in the upper layers produced intermediate redox conditions and homogeneous nutrient distribution within the water column. Nitrogen speciation additionally suggests a pronounced activity of nitrifying bacteria and/or archaea arising from an influx of the ammonium nitrogen. Meanwhile, in 2004 the water column attained nearly isohaline conditions late in November. Partial mixing of the water column resulted in downward transport of dissolved oxygen and moderate upward fluxes of nutrients into the surface layers, whereby the flux of ammonium was sufficiently high to promote nitrification. A response of the inorganic iodine to mixing of the water column was in accord with those of major constituents and nutrients. The results demonstrate that, in spite of marked changes in speciation, total inorganic iodine remained preserved within the system over each survey. Oxic to hypoxic redox conditions formed immediately after the overturn in September 2003 favoured iodate reduction, while slow mixing in November 2004 promoted iodide oxidation. In this system dominated by the sedimentary influence a degree of oxygenation of deep water seems to control the inorganic iodine inventory for the pond. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We found two major recruitment patterns among the 11 species. One group (yellow perch, walleye, logperch and tessellated darter) decreased in abundance after the mid-1980s. These species are spring or early summer spawners with benthic juveniles. In the second group, most species increased during the early to mid 1980s (smallmouth bass, trout-perch, white bass, gizzard shad and freshwater drum), while two recruited episodically (white perch and pumpkinseed). These species spawned later than the first group and juvenile habitat use was variable. We investigated three specific mechanisms which could explain these patterns (1) competition with young-of-year (YOY) yellow perch, the dominant fish species in the lake, (2) buffering of predation by walleye by YOY yellow perch, and (3) correlation with water temperature and productivity (indexed through total phosphorus levels, TP). Buffering from predation by walleye was likely important for the species in the first group, as indicated by positive correlations between inter-annual abundance patterns of the four species. Even though species in the second group tended to increase as YOY yellow perch declined, we found little support for the competition hypothesis. Growth and abundance of these species were not significantly correlated with abundance of YOY yellow perch. Temperature was positively correlated with growth of 10 of the 11 species. Decreasing TP levels and associated changes in the lake could be causing a shift in the fish community, but the mechanism is not decreased food production. Pelagic zooplankton abundance, a direct link from nutrients to YOY fish production, has not declined since 1975.																			0018-8158						1999	408						101	113		10.1023/A:1017062022447	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017062022447													WOS:000084892400011

The living and dead parts attained their highest phytomass during autumn. The dead parts accumulated higher amounts of copper, manganese and zinc than the living parts. On the other hand, the living parts had higher amounts of carbohydrates, ether extract, crude fibers and total protein. Due to its higher nutritive value, the living parts were considered excellent forage. Furthermore, the plant in the drains accumulates more nutrients and heavy metals than that in the canals. Some constituents (calcium, iron, digestible crude protein and crude fibers) had significant positive correlation with phytomass. The ability of the dead parts of P. salicifolia to accumulate higher values of nutrients renders this plant as a powerful phytoremediator for removal of pollutants from the aquatic ecosystems.					; Galal, Tarek/AAF-7604-2019	Shaltout, Kamal/0000-0002-8588-2991; Galal, Tarek/0000-0001-9847-1051; 													2037-4631	1720-0776				JUN	2014	25	2					167	179		10.1007/s12210-013-0269-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12210-013-0269-6													WOS:000336394400004

Long-term monitoring of wet-only precipitation (NADP/NTN, 1983-2001) and dry deposition (AIRMoN, 1990-2001) at sites adjacent to the watershed showed that concentrations of SO42- in precipitation, SO42- in particles,and SO2 vapor all declined substantially (P<0.005) in contrast to no marked temporal changes observed for most N constituents (NH4+ in precipitation, HNO3 vapor, and particulate NO3-), except for NO3- in precipitation, which showed a small decrease in the late 1990s. From 1983 to 2001, concentrations of SO42- in the lake outlet significantly decreased (-2.1 mueq L-1 yr(-1), P<0.0001), whereas NO3- and dissolved organic N (DON) concentrations showed no consistent temporal trends. With the inclusion of dry deposition and DON fluxes into the mass balance, the retained portion of atmospheric N inputs within the main subcatchment increased from 37% to 60%. Sulfur outputs greatly exceeded inputs even with the inclusion of dry S deposition, while organic S flux represented another source of S output, implying substantial internal S sources. A significant relationship between the annual mean concentrations of SO42- in lake discharge and wet deposition over the last two decades (r=0.64, P<0.01) suggested a considerable influence of declining S deposition on surface water SO42- concentrations, despite substantial internal S sources. By contrast, interannual variations in both NO3- concentrations and fluxes in lake discharge were significantly related to year-to-year changes in air temperature and runoff. Snowmelt responses to winter temperature fluctuations were crucial in explaining large portions of interannual variations in watershed NO3- export during the months preceding spring snowmelt (especially, January-March). Distinctive response patterns of monthly mean concentrations of NO3- and DON in the major lake inlet to seasonal changes in air temperature also suggested climatic regulation of seasonal patterns in watershed release of both N forms. The sensitive response of N drainage losses to climatic variability might explain the synchronous patterns of decadal variations in watershed NO3- export across the northeastern USA.

J	CROSSMAN, EJ				CROSSMAN, EJ			REPRODUCTIVE HOMING IN MUSKELLUNGE, ESOX-MASQUINONGY	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The number and nature of muskellunge moving to and from spawning grounds are extensively documented. Individual spawning muskellunge in Stony Lake, Ontario Canada are considered to home annually to specific spawning grounds and to specific areas (spawning sites) within spawning grounds. Some individuals were caught in the same location, or a nearby location, in as many as 7 yr. There is some evidence for discrete populations with apparent reproductive isolation and no interchange in summer. Dispersal from spawning grounds to summer home ranges seems to be limited in regard to direction and area of the lake. Recapture of fish on spawning ground suggests an obligatory return to a limited number of "traditional" spawning grounds and may extend our knowledge of the groups of fishes exhibiting this type of directed movement. The results also have serious implications for muskellunge in regard to management, shoreline development, and genetic contamination by fish culture activities.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				SEP	1990	47	9					1803	1812		10.1139/f90-205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f90-205													WOS:A1990DX55200018

Builders, tenants, and squatters: the origins of genetic material in modern stromatolites	GEOBIOLOGY												Micro-organisms have long been implicated in the construction of stromatolites. Yet, establishing a microbial role in modern stromatolite growth via molecular analysis is not always straightforward because DNA in stromatolites can have multiple origins. For example, the genomic material could represent the microbes responsible for the construction of the stromatolite (i.e., "builders"), microbes that inhabited the structure after it was built (i.e., "tenants"), or microbes/organic matter that were passively incorporated after construction from the water column or later diagenetic fluids (i.e., "squatters"). Disentangling the role of micro-organisms in stromatolite construction, already difficult in modern systems, becomes more difficult as organic signatures degrade, and their context is obscured. To evaluate our ability to accurately decipher the role of micro-organisms in stromatolite formation in geologically recent settings, 16/18S SSU rRNA gene sequences were analyzed from three systems where the context of growth was well understood: (a) an actively growing stromatolite from a silicic hot spring in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, where the construction of the structure is controlled by cyanobacteria; (b) a mixed carbonate and silica precipitate from Little Hot Creek, a hot spring in the Long Valley Caldera of California that has both abiogenic and biogenic components to accretion; and (c) a near-modern lacustrine carbonate stromatolite from Walker Lake, Nevada that is likely abiogenic. In all cases, the largest percentage of recovered DNA sequences, especially when focused on the deeper portions of the structures, belonged to either the tenant or squatter communities, not the actual builders. Once removed from their environmental context, correct interpretation of biology's role in stromatolite morphogenesis was difficult. Because high-throughput genomic analysis may easily lead to incorrect assumptions even in these modern and near-modern structures, caution must be exercised when interpreting micro-organismal involvement in the construction of accretionary structures throughout the rock record.					; Spear, John/ABI-5873-2020; Stamps, Blake/H-9781-2019; Stevenson, Bradley/A-2786-2011	Spear, John/0000-0002-4664-7438; Junkins, Emily/0000-0002-7574-1239; Stevenson, Bradley/0000-0001-9432-9744; Petryshyn, Victoria/0000-0001-7439-3351; Stamps, Blake/0000-0001-9713-9014													1472-4677	1472-4669				MAY	2021	19	3					261	277		10.1111/gbi.12429	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gbi.12429		FEB 2021						33524239					WOS:000613450700001
J	Lanés, S; Salani, FM				Lanés, S; Salani, FM			The petrography, origin and sedimentary paleoenvironment of Remoredo Formation pyroclastic rocks (Lower Jurassic), 35°30′S-70°15′W, Argentina.	REVISTA GEOLOGICA DE CHILE												Facies analysis of pyroclastic outcrops of the Remoredo Formation, wh ich surround a phenoandesitic intrusive (Cerro Negro Andesite), allowed the authors to recognize two facies associations: 1- Tuff-Breccia Association and 2- Tuff Association. They were interpreted as 1- proximal co-ignimbrite lag breccia and 2- associated ignimbrites and co-ignimbrite air-fall tuffs, respectively, ail of them derived from flows that were originated by gravitational column collapses. Paleocurrents, internal structures and provenance of the lithics point to the Cerro Negro Andesite intrusion as one of the source Vents although not excluding others located further west of the study area. Tuffs of the middle section of Remoredo Formation were deposited into an ephemeral lake, while the rest were deposited under subaerial conditions.																			0716-0208					DEC	1998	25	2					141	152																WOS:000078520100002
J	Wu, XY; Ding, YH; Ye, CZ				Wu Xian-yun; Ding Yi-hui; Ye Cheng-zhi			DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSIS OF PERSISTENT DROUGHT/FLOOD EVENTS IN SUMMER OVER THE TWO-LAKE REGION OF CHINA	JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY												Based on the daily regional mean rainfall, the Z-index method is used to identify persistent flood and drought events lasting for at least 10 days over a region where Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake sit (referred to as the "two-lake region" hereafter). The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data are then utilized to perform a preliminary diagnostic analysis on these events. The results indicate that the composite standardized geopotential height at 500 hPa presents two different meridional wave trains from north to south over the East Asian-Pacific region, i.e., a "- + -" pattern for the droughts and a "+ - +" pattern for the floods, respectively. The developing, maintaining and decaying phases in the drought and flood events are closely related to the intensity and location of a subtropical high and an extra-tropical blocking high. It is shown that the East Asian summer monsoon is strong (weak) with the occurrence of persistent drought (flood) events. Droughts (floods) are accompanied by a weak (strong) tropical convergent system and a strong (weak) subtropical convergent system. Furthermore, the persistent drought (flood) events are associated with a divergence (convergence) of vertically integrated water vapor flux. In the vertical profile of water vapor flux, divergence (convergence) in the mid- and lower-levels and convergence (divergence) in the higher levels are evident in the droughts (floods). Both the divergence in the droughts and the convergence in floods are strongest at 850 hPa.																			1006-8775					SEP	2013	19	3					264	275																WOS:000324567900007
J	Zhu, CW; Wang, B; Qian, WH				Zhu, Congwen; Wang, Bin; Qian, Weihong			Why do dust storms decrease in northern China concurrently with the recent global warming?	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Recent studies have shown that the spring dust storm frequency (DSF) in northern China exhibits an obvious downward trend over the past 50 years concurrently with the recent global warming. We found that the decline of DSF is significantly correlated with the increase of the surface air temperature (SAT) in the region of 70 degrees E -130 degrees E, 45 degrees N -65 degrees N around Lake Baikal, where anthropogenic forcing induces prominent warming in the recent decades. Corresponding to the SAT rise in this region, an anomalous dipole circulation pattern is found in the troposphere that consists of a warm anti-cyclone centered at 55 degrees N and a cold cyclone centered around 30 degrees N. The DSF is positively correlated to the activity of Mongolian cyclones. The warming trend around Lake Baikal possibly induces a weakening of the westerly jet stream and the atmospheric baroclinicity in northern China and Mongolian regions, which suppress the frequency of occurrence and the intensity of the Mongolian cyclones and result in the decreasing DSF in North China. This mechanism will likely further reduce the spring DSF in the future global warming scenario.

The record spans the period from c. 14 700 to 6800 cal. years BP. During the Lateglacial, Vasby Mose was a lake where minerogenic sandy and clayey sediments accumulated. In the early Lateglacial, from c. 14 700 to 13 200 cal. years BP, a tundralike open, treeless vegetation with Betula nana and Dryas octopetala was found in the region. During the Younger Dryas, a rich flora of aquatic plants was found in the lake. In the Early to Mid-Holocene, Vasby Mose was a spring-fed calcareous fen, with deposition of peat and tufa. The flora included the sedges Carex rostrata and Carex paniculata, the aquatic plant Menyathes trifoliata, the calciphilous reed plant Cladium mariscus and the today nationally extinct bryophyte Meesia triquetra. The fauna included aquatic mollusc taxa such as Pisidium sp., Valvata spp. And Bithynia tentaculata and terrestrial or semi-terrestrial species such as Galba truncatula, Euconolus cf. alderi, Succinea/Oxyloma, Zonitoides nitidus and Vallonia pulchella. The Preboreal oscillation and other Early Holocene climate events are seen as short-lived, wet intervals.																			2245-7070						2023	72						123	133		10.37570/bgsd-2023-72-04	http://dx.doi.org/10.37570/bgsd-2023-72-04													WOS:001019379100001

The description of Gyraulus takhteevi sp. n. includes morphological characters and gene sequences (COI of mtDNA) for the species separation from sister taxon Gyraulus acronicus (A. Ferussac, 1807) collected from the small Krestovka River in-flowing into the south-western part of the Lake. The new species differs from G. acronicus in small shell size of adults, having smaller number of prostate folds (maximal up to 26 in G. takhteevi n. sp. vs. 40 in G. acronicus), a short preputium (approximately twice shorter than the phallotheca), and an elongated bursa copulatrix. The population of Gyraulus takhteevi sp. n. consists of two co-existent morphs: one of them has a narrow shell spire and the second is characterized by wide spire similar to the shell of G. acronicus. One of the two revealed haplotypes of the new species includes both morphs, while the second consists of snails with wide spired shells.

Phosphorus dynamics in vegetated buffer strips in cold climates: a review	ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS												The movement of excess phosphorus (P) into streams, rivers, and lakes poses a significant threat to water quality and the health of aquatic ecosystems and thus, P has been targeted for reduction. In landscapes dominated by agriculture, P is primarily transported through non-point sources, which a number of best management practices aim to target. One such practice is vegetated buffer strips (VBS), which are designed to use dense vegetation above the surface and extensive root systems below the surface to reduce runoff velocity, trap sediments, increase infiltration, and increase plant uptake of nutrients. The effectiveness of VBS in reducing P concentrations has been studied and reviewed, but most studies have been undertaken in warm or temperate climates, where runoff is primarily driven through summer rainfall events and when vegetation is actively growing. In cold climates, the majority of runoff occurs during the snowmelt period, when soils are frozen and vegetation has been flattened by snow and ice over the winter period and is not actively taking up nutrients. These conditions hinder the ability of VBS to work as designed. Additionally, frozen vegetation can release P after undergoing freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs). Thus, this review aimed to (i) summarize research designed to determine the effectiveness of VBS in reducing P transport in cold climates, (ii) collate research on the potential for vegetation to release P after undergoing FTCs, and (iii) identify research gaps to be addressed in determining VBS effectiveness in cold climates. Cold-climate VBS implemented in Canada, the northern United States, and northern Europe have shown P removal efficiencies ranging from -36% to + 89%, a range that identifies the uncertainty surrounding the use of VBS in these landscapes. However, there is consensus among researchers globally that vegetation does release P after undergoing FTCs, though P concentrations from different species vary across studies. The design and management of VBS in cold climates requires careful consideration, and VBS may not always be the best management strategy to reduce P transport. Future research should be undertaken at a larger scale in natural systems and focus on VBS design and management strategies.

Our analyses show that surface water warming rates are dependent on combinations of climate and local characteristics, rather than just lake location, leading to the counterintuitive result that regional consistency in lake warming is the exception, rather than the rule. The most rapidly warming lakes are widely geographically distributed, and their warming is associated with interactions among different climatic factorsfrom seasonally ice-covered lakes in areas where temperature and solar radiation are increasing while cloud cover is diminishing (0.72 degrees C decade(-1)) to ice-free lakes experiencing increases in air temperature and solar radiation (0.53 degrees C decade(-1)). The pervasive and rapid warming observed here signals the urgent need to incorporate climate impacts into vulnerability assessments and adaptation efforts for lakes.

However, existing analyses of the impact of trace metals in lake sediments on aquatic organisms often neglect the spatiotemporal variability of trace metal release. This oversight can result in ecological risk assessments that lack specificity. To address this gap, we collected 32 core sediment samples from Lake Chaohu to systematically investigate the ecological toxicological risks posed by the release of eight trace metal indicators into the overlying water column under four hydrological scenarios throughout the year. Results indicated that only Cu, Pb, and Zn exhibit persistent toxicological risks. The comprehensive ecological toxicological risk of sediment trace metals showed spatial differences, increasing from the western region to the eastern region, i.e., western region < central region < eastern region. Seasonally, the risk levels are ordered as follows: May < September < November to April of the following year < June to August. The eastern region in summer (June to August) was identified as the high-risk area and period for trace metal pollution in sediments. Based on these conclusions, it is recommended to implement pollution control and environmental monitoring measures in the eastern region during the summer to effectively control the pollution and ecological risks of trace metals.

The lake comprises two basins and six sub-circularly shaped sub-basins fed by subaquatic springs. Periods of intense groundwater inflow in the deepest sub-basins lead to the fluidization and re-suspension of previously deposited sediments and subsequent settling forming homogenite deposits on the southern basin intermediate platforms. The multiproxy analysis of sediment cores combined with high resolution seismic stratigraphy (3.5 kHz pinger and multi-frequency Chirp surveys) allows a precise reconstruction of depositional environments and related hydrological variability and groundwater inflow during the last ca. 7.6 cal kyr BP. According to the age model based on (CS)-C-137, Pb-210 and AMS C-14 dating, homogenite deposition occurred between 7.2 and 5.5 cal kyr BP, stopped during the middle Holocene (5.5-2.8 cal kyr BP) and greatly increased during the last two millennia with a total of 17 homogenite layers individually up to 75 cm-thick. The onset of this unique sedimentation mode at ca. 3 cal kyr BP coincides with an increase in lake level, evidenced by the onlapping of fine-grained, distal sediments over coarser massive, carbonate-rich, littoral deposits. A detailed, multidisciplinary study of the homogenites (sedimentology, physical properties, high-resolution elemental geochemistry, mineral composition, grain-size, organic matter content and SEM) combined with seismic stratigraphy demonstrates that the fluidization events triggering the formation of the homogenites were caused by higher and more intense local groundwater inflow, related to increased rainfall during the Late Holocene and likely intensified by land use changes during the last millennium.

The morphological characteristics of the two morphotypes observed in Lake Oubeira (Algeria) conformed to those of natural populations of C. raciborskii species described in the literature. The two morphotypes produced only straight trichomes. During the study (February 2000-September 2001), this species occurred as a codominant with Microcystis spp., and a peak was observed during the autumn (November 2000) with a remarkable density estimated to be 43 X 10(5) trichomes/L. However, difficulty in isolating and culturing these two morphotypes limited the evaluation of their toxic potential. (C) 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, many of these studies have been limited and are mostly unpublished. It is, therefore, important to share the available datasets with scientists and water managers to support further studies and guide decision-making. Eleven datasets were compiled in a unique database for continued advancement and application. This dataset now contains 248 delta O-18 and delta H-2 results from water samples collected at 190 locations throughout the country. delta O-18 and delta H-2 values range, respectively, from -3.8 to -8.95 parts per thousand and -67.4 to -16.8 parts per thousand for precipitation (n = 5), 0.9 to 2.76 parts per thousand and 8.8 to 18.4 parts per thousand for lakes (n = 4), -2.61 to 4.98 parts per thousand and -26.63 to 28.2 parts per thousand for rivers (n = 11), -5.11 to -2.6 parts per thousand and -29.8 to -6.9 parts per thousand for springs (n = 82) excluding hot springs, and -5.1 to -1.37 parts per thousand and -29.4 to -2.9 parts per thousand for boreholes (n = 142). The overall presentation of the available data is complemented with an overview of the studies in which stable isotope data acquisition was performed. The global dataset is presented under three primary contexts: (1) elaboration of a local isotope meteoric water line of equation delta H-2 = 7.2 delta O-18 + 8.8 supported with data predominately from the Ouest jurisdictional department, (2) spatial variability analysis of the dataset, and (3) definition of the altitude gradient (per 100 m) using freshwater springs of the Plaine du Cul-de-Sac/Massif de la Selle area of -6.67 parts per thousand for delta H-2 and -0.09 parts per thousand for delta O-18.					; Gourcy, Laurence/AAJ-6717-2020	Gourcy, Laurence/0000-0003-3897-4479; Vitvar, Tomas/0000-0002-7504-2374; Adamson, James/0000-0002-6676-3778; 													1431-2174	1435-0157				AUG	2022	30	5					1387	1397		10.1007/s10040-022-02498-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-022-02498-1		MAY 2022											WOS:000801976300001
J	vanLuijn, F; Boers, PCM; Lijklema, L				vanLuijn, F; Boers, PCM; Lijklema, L			Comparison of denitrification rates in lake sediments obtained by the N-2 flux method, the N-15 isotope pairing technique and the mass balance approach	WATER RESEARCH												Coupled nitrification-denitrification rates in sediments of the shallow lake Nuldernauw, The Netherlands, were measured using the N-2 flux method and the N-15 isotope pairing technique. It was clarified by different checks that the coupled nitrification-denitrification can be measured with the N? flux method after a pre-incubation time of about 10 days. These checks included tests on contamination by atmospheric nitrogen, the incubation of irradiated sediments with and without addition of HgCl2 and addition of nitrate. The results of the two methods were different. In general the coupled nitrification-denitrification rates measured with the N-15 isotope pairing technique were lower than measured with the N-2 flux method. With the N-15 isotope pairing technique the denitrification rates of muddy sediments seemed to depend on the sampling date: spring sediments gave much higher denitrification rates than sediments collected in winter. In comparison with the denitrification calculated from a mass balance of the lake the N-15 method appears to underestimate the denitrification, whereas results of the N-2 flux method were in agreement with mass balance data. The following explanation for this difference was suggested. The N-15 isotope pairing technique is based on the idea that the different nitrate species ((NO3-)-N-14 and (NO3-)-N-15) are uniformly mixed and that the sediment is divided in aerobic and anaerobic layers. When however micro sites exist, probably uniform mixing of the nitrate species can not be assumed because of the very tight coupling between nitrification and denitrification in these sites. The coupled nitrification-denitrification will be underestimated.																			0043-1354					APR	1996	30	4					893	900		10.1016/0043-1354(95)00250-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(95)00250-2													WOS:A1996UC02200015

In a stepwise multiple regression model the variables explaining most of the variance in the light effect on phosphate uptake were, in decreasing order of importance, the light history as estimated by hours of sunshine in previous 3 d, phosphate turnover time, phytoplankton biovolume, and time of day. Stimulation was most common in spring at inshore stations, while inhibition occurred mainly in spring at offshore stations. We suggest that light-limited but phosphorus-sufficient phytoplankton show the former, but extremely low light adapted populations, the latter response. We discovered an apparent diurnal pattern in the response, with maximal stimulation by light during daylight hours and inhibition predominating at sunrise and sunset.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	1986	43	2					329	335		10.1139/f86-042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f86-042													WOS:A1986A159800011
J	NURNBERG, GK				NURNBERG, GK			QUANTIFYING ANOXIA IN LAKES	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												AF represents the number of days that a sediment area, equal to the whole-lake surface area, is overlain by anoxic water. Average AF for 56 central Ontario lakes, 19 additional eastern North American lakes, including the Laurentian Great Lakes and several acidified lakes, ranged from 0 to 83 d per summer. Of this variation, 65% (54%) is accounted for by average phosphorus (nitrogen) concentration and an indicator of lake shape, ($) over bar z/A(0)(0.5) (where ($) over bar z is mean depth). Only 17% on average was explained by annual dissolved organic C (DOG) concentration. Annual variation within lakes was large and partly ascribed to variable annual loading of DOG. AF was not correlated with areal hypolimnetic oxygen depletion, because of the opposing dependency on lake shape, but was correlated with Reckhow's probability of anoxia in eutrophic lakes. BF was also correlated with the redox potential of anoxic water at the end of summer stratification, especially after inclusion of an estimate of iron concentration in the sediment.					; Nurnberg, Gertrud/AFM-9725-2022	Nurnberg, Gertrud/0000-0003-1752-6562; 													0024-3590					SEP	1995	40	6					1100	1111																WOS:A1995RY89500010

The effluent was discharged into the River Rothay, the main inflow of a nearby small lake (Grasmere). This paper describes some of the effects on the lake. The mean areal hypolimnetic O2 deficient increased from 274-434 mg O2 m-2 day-1 with an accompanying marked increase in the degree of deoxygenation in the hypolimnion. Plate counts of bacteria in the surface water increased for 2 yr but this increase was not sustained. The mean summer soluble reactive P concentration increased significantly (P = 0.05), but the same was not true of nitrate levels. Analyses of the main inflow showed that 50-98% of the ammonia and 10-40% of the nitrate entering in this river was derived from the sewage effluent. The concentrations in the main body of the lake were usually lower, possibly due to assimilation and denitrification in the shallower reaches of the lake. Seasonal changes in the inorganic N species in the hypolimnion showed 3 distinct phases of activity, ammonification, nitrification and denitrification. Nitrification accounted for approximately a quarter of the O2 uptake in the hypolimnion.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1978	8	2					165	175		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01438.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01438.x													WOS:A1978EW18100006

Temporal and spatial distributions of nutrients and trace elements (Ba, Cs, Cr, Fe, Mn, Mo, U, V and Re) in Mississippi coastal waters: Influence of hypoxia, submarine groundwater discharge, and episodic events	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												A multi-year (2007-2011) chemical time series of eight stations in the western Mississippi Sound and northwestern Mississippi Bight was undertaken to examine the factors affecting chemical distributions in this dynamic region. Parameters measured include nutrients and selected dissolved trace elements (Ba, Cr, Cs, Fe, Mn, Mo, Re, U, and V). Key findings include the frequent development of bottom water hypoxia in this part of the Bight during late spring and summer, the likely contribution of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) to the material flows (i.e., Ba, V and nutrients), and the effects of episodic events (i.e., tropical storms, cold fronts, the opening of the Bonnet Carre Spillway) on trace element distributions. In hypoxic bottom waters, enriched nutrients, Mn, and Ba as well as depleted V and Cr were commonly observed. Although dissolved Mn was often enriched to micromolar levels in hypoxic bottom waters, Fe (both dissolved and colloidal) was rarely over 100 nM, likely due to its rapid oxidation and removal. Similar to previous observations in Louisiana Shelf waters, the signal of bottom depletion of V and Cr during hypoxia is at times mixed upwards into surface waters. Consideration of the mass balances of dissolved Ba and V, in particular, supports the conclusion that SGD can be a significant contributor to the chemical mass balance in this region, not just for certain trace elements, but for nutrients, too. Interestingly, a seasonal change in the direction of the V flux from the sediments suggests that the chemical conditions (i.e., pH, EH, and/or DOC) of the groundwater are changing. During the study period, the Bonnet Cane Spillway was opened in April 2008 and May 2011. The spillway discharges Mississippi River to Lake Pontchartrain and ultimately to our study area, which is supported by the observation of an extended freshwater signal and low Cs across the Mississippi Sound and Bight during these two spillway openings. It is plausible that Mississippi Bight hypoxia was more severe due to increased nutrients and intense stratification induced by Mississippi River input following the opening of Bonnet Carre Spillway. Other episodic events included tropical storms, which can push Mississippi River water northward and make this material source potentially more important at those times. Important remaining questions from this study include the extent to which SGD and/or Mississippi River water are necessary for establishment and maintenance of hypoxia in the Mississippi Bight and the reasons for the seasonal change in the direction of the sedimentary V flux.

In this work, total measurements of 59 water samples were used (52 from different reaches of main Rivers and tributaries, 4 from springs, and 3 from boreholes) for( 222)Rn analysis in dry and wet seasons, along with recent 8-20 years of daily stream flow records from 11-gauge stations. For sub-surface inference, regional geological structures and lineament density zones were determined using Kriging interpolation techniques. 222Rn values for the river and streams show 2.7-468 Bq/m(3) during the rainy season and 17.1-1467 Bq/m(3) for the non-rainy season. The credible justification related to moderate to high seasonal Rn-222 values (100-400 Bq/m(3)) in the upstream parts of the two Basins, including areas falling along the surface water divide between the two adjacent Basins, shows a link between groundwater and surface water systems. In the same area, a very high mean annual baseflow index (BFI >0.5) is dominantly associated with high lineament density (0.9 < LD < 3.0), regional faults, and geologic units of highly permeable scoriaceous basalt, rift basalt, and fractured ignimbrite units. Relatively, low Rn-222 (<100 Bq/m(3)) in both seasons and low baseflow index (BFI <0.35) values mainly in the central part of the Upper Awash basin are attributed to existing impervious superficial deposits (alluvial, tuff and ash). This, in turn, shows the poor connection between the groundwater and surface water systems in the central plain part of the Upper Awash Basin and, as also evidenced by the storage of floodwater for an extended time after the end of the rainy season, prove poor connectivity between groundwater and surface water systems. The very high Rn-222 (400-1467 Bq/ m(3)) with varied mean annual baseflow index (0.35 < BFI <0.5) at different stations in the extreme southern and southeastern parts of the Upper Awash Basin show Awash River is gaining from the aquifer system through highly fractured basalt and fractured ignimbrite geologic units. Evidence from analysis of measured electrical conductivity and stable isotopes (d(18)O, d(2)H) generally agree with the observed Rn-222 value and baseflow analysis.

The chronological sequence of this core was established using 10 AMS 14C dates and 10 conventional 14C dates and gives the bottom age of c. 48 800 cal. yr BP. Based on comparisons with multiproxy records, such as lithological variation, organic carbon isotope ratio, organic matter content and dry bulk density, we infer that the HDcab record is sensitive to local hydrological variations that are closely related to the East Asian (EA) summer monsoon precipitation. Higher HDcab values would indicate relatively drier conditions, suggesting a weakening of the EA summer monsoon and vice versa. Based on the HDcab, as well as other multiproxies, the climatic history in the last c. 49 000 years in the swamp area shows agreement with the Chinese stalagmite record and with the 25 degrees N summer solar insolation, implying that orbitally induced insolation may have played a role in the last glacial period (LGP) climate in South China. Several millennial-scale dry phases during the LGP show similarities with the stadials revealed by the ice core record in Greenland and from the Chinese cave stalagmites. Our study demonstrates that the HDcab of lacustrine sediments is a useful proxy of past climatic changes in South China.					; Xue, Jibin/KTI-2699-2024	Xue, Jibin/0000-0003-1319-3377; 													0300-9483	1502-3885					2010	39	2					286	295		10.1111/j.1502-3885.2009.00119.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.2009.00119.x													WOS:000274953600009

Lake Burragorang is a temperate water supply reservoir (ca. 75 km(2), 2.1 km(3) at full supply) that serves 70% of Sydney's drinking water needs. Spatial variability of the wind and an unstable air-water interface were commonly measured characteristics of meteorological forcing. During dry years such as 1996-1997 the lake is warm monomictic (Tmin = 12-13 degrees C), but wet winters result in cool and slightly saline underflows that cause stratification to persist through the winter. Boundary mixing at the dam, selective withdrawl, and sediment oxygen demand were three 'inlake' mechanisms that were postulated to cause the persistent horizontal gradients of hypolimnetic DO. Boundary mixing along the dam likely resulted in the injection of mixed-layer water into the hypolimnion, hence the higher profundal concentrations of DO near the dam relative to the remainder of the reservoir. Selective withdrawl resulted in the development of a second oxygen minimum below the pycnocline that persisted throughout seasonal stratification. In the reservoir arms, a greater depletion of hypolimnetic oxygen likely resulted from the lower ratio of the hypolimnetic volume to the sediment area in the up-lake reaches versus the near dam region.																					85-87418-02-5				1999							211	226																WOS:000086563300010
J	Rice, SD; Holland, L; Moles, A				Rice, Stanley D.; Holland, Larry; Moles, Adam			Seasonal increases in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons related to two-stroke engine use in a small Alaskan lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												To determine if hydrocarbon levels in salmon-rearing lakes are affected by seasonal increases in the number of two-stroke powered watercraft, passive hydrocarbon sampling devices were deployed in Auke Lake in southeast Alaska for five successive summers (1999-2003). Estimates of the number of two-stroke powered water craft were made by daily census in 2003. Passive samplers mimic the bioconcentration of trace waterborne lipophilic contaminants by living organisms and are used worldwide for in situ monitoring of organic contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Monthly increases in PAHs coincided with monthly increases in the number of two-stroke powered watercraft (jet skis and powerboats) on the lake during the summer. This increase in PAHs varied in magnitude from year to year. PAHs were detected in the surface waters (1 m), particularly in high use areas, and were not detected at 9 m depth. These localized seasonal inputs appeared to come primarily from recreational watercraft rather than from runoff. Alaska's recreational boating season is very compressed and coincides with migrations of anadromous fish. Increased use of two-stroke engines may transfer enough hydrocarbons to the lake to affect fish populations.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2008	24	1					10	17		10.1080/07438140809354046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140809354046													WOS:000269665800002

In this study, we examined the spatial-temporal distribution of monthly and annual dust events of varying intensity (dust in suspension, blowing dust, dust storms) in the vicinity of the desiccated Urmia Lake in northwestern (NW) Iran, based on horizontal visibility data during 2009-2022. Dust in suspension, blowing dust and dust storm events exhibited different monthly patterns, with higher frequencies between March and October, especially in the southern and eastern parts of the Urmia Basin. Furthermore, the intra-annual variations in aerosol optical depth at 500 nm (AOD(550)) and & Aring;ngstr & ouml;m exponent at 412/470 nm (AE) were investigated using Terra/Aqua MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data over the Urmia Lake Basin (36-39 degrees N, 44-47 degrees E). Monthly distributions of potential coarse aerosol (AE < 1) sources affecting the lower troposphere over the Urmia Basin were reconstructed, synergizing Terra/Aqua MODIS AOD(550) for AE < 1 values and HYSPLIT_4 backward trajectories. The reconstructed monthly patterns of the potential sources were compared with the monthly spatial distribution of Terra MODIS AOD(550) in the Middle East and Central Asia (20-70 degrees E, 20-50 degrees N). The results showed that deserts in the Middle East and the Aral-Caspian arid region (ACAR) mostly contribute to dust aerosol load over the Urmia Lake region, exhibiting higher frequency in spring and early summer. Local dust sources from dried lake beds further contribute to the dust AOD, especially in the western part of the Urmia Basin during March and April. The modeling (DREAM8-NMME-MACC) results revealed high concentrations of near-surface dust concentrations, which may have health effects on the local population, while distant sources from the Middle East are the main controlling factors to aerosol loading over the Urmia Basin.

Effects of Dam Removal on Tule Fall Chinook salmon Spawning Habitat in the White Salmon River, Washington	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Condit Dam is one of the largest hydroelectric dams ever removed in the USA. Breached in a single explosive event in October 2011, hundreds-of-thousands of cubic metres of sediment washed down the White Salmon River onto spawning grounds of a threatened species, Columbia River tule fall Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. We investigated over a 3-year period (2010-2012) how dam breaching affected channel morphology, river hydraulics, sediment composition and tule fall Chinook salmon (hereafter tule salmon') spawning habitat in the lower 1.7km of the White Salmon River (project area). As expected, dam breaching dramatically affected channel morphology and spawning habitat due to a large load of sediment released from Northwestern Lake. Forty-two per cent of the project area that was previously covered in water was converted into islands or new shoreline, while a large pool near the mouth filled with sediments and a delta formed at the mouth. A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model revealed that pool area decreased 68.7% in the project area, while glides and riffles increased 659% and 530%, respectively. A spatially explicit habitat model found the mean probability of spawning habitat increased 46.2% after dam breaching due to an increase in glides and riffles. Shifting channels and bank instability continue to negatively affect some spawning habitat as sediments continue to wash downstream from former Northwestern Lake, but 300m of new spawning habitat (river kilometre 0.6 to 0.9) that formed immediately post-breach has persisted into 2015. Less than 10% of tule salmon have spawned upstream of the former dam site to date, but the run sizes appear healthy and stable. Published 2015.

Here, we explore the temporal behavior of the dextral-slip Warm Springs Valley fault system, which is part of a network of closely spaced (10-20 km) faults in the northern Walker Lane (California-Nevada border). We develop a late Quaternary slip record for the fault using Quaternary mapping and high-resolution topographic data from airborne Light Distance and Ranging (LiDAR). The faulted Fort Sage alluvial fan (40.06 degrees N, 119.99 degrees W) is dextrally displaced 98(-43)(+42) m, and we estimate the age of the alluvial fan to be 41.4(-4.8)(+10.0) ka to 55.7 +/- 9.2 ka, based on a terrestrial cosmogenic Be-10 depth profile and Cl-36 analyses on basalt boulders, respectively. The displacement and age constraints for the fan yield a slip rate of 1.8(-0.8)(+/- 0.8) mm/yr to 2.4(-1.1)(+1.2) mm/yr (2 sigma) along the northern Warm Springs Valley fault system for the past 41.4-55.7 ka. In contrast to this longer-term slip rate, shorelines associated with the Sehoo highstand of Lake Lahontan (similar to 15.8 ka) adjacent to the Fort Sage fan are dextrally faulted at most 3 m, which limits a maximum post-15.8 ka slip rate to 0.2 mm/yr. These relations indicate that the post-Lahontan slip rate on the fault is only about one-tenth the longer-term (41-56 ka) average slip rate. This apparent slip-rate variation may be related to co-dependent interaction with the nearby Honey Lake fault system, which shows evidence of an accelerated period of mid-Holocene earthquakes.					; Gosse, John/B-4934-2012; Gold, Ryan/I-3287-2012; Briggs, Richard/A-1348-2013	Gold, Ryan/0000-0002-4464-6394; Gosse, John/0000-0002-0814-8574; Briggs, Richard/0000-0001-8108-0046													0037-1106	1943-3573				FEB	2013	103	1					542	558		10.1785/0120120020	http://dx.doi.org/10.1785/0120120020													WOS:000314575700038

The present work investigates the melting of a thin non-uniform ice cover subject to varying water and air temperatures under turbulent flow conditions. A two-dimensional depth averaged turbulence model coupled with a heat transfer model is used to simulate laboratory conditions of ice cover melting. Computational results were compared with experimental investigations. The average melting of the ice cover was found to be in close agreement with the experimental measurements with the exception of the leading edge region.																			0961-5539	1758-6585				SEP	1995	5	7					647	663		10.1108/EUM0000000004082	http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/EUM0000000004082													WOS:A1995RU12700006
J	Johansson, MP; Laurila, A				Johansson, Magnus P.; Laurila, Anssi			Maximum thermal tolerance trades off with chronic tolerance of high temperature in contrasting thermal populations of Radix balthica	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Thermal adaptation theory predicts that thermal specialists evolve in environments with low temporal and high spatial thermal variation, whereas thermal generalists are favored in environments with high temporal and low spatial variation. The thermal environment of many organisms is predicted to change with globally increasing temperatures and thermal specialists are presumably at higher risk than thermal generalists. Here we investigated critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and preferred temperature (T-p) in populations of the common pond snail (Radix balthica) originating from a small-scale system of geothermal springs in northern Iceland, where stable cold (ca. 7 degrees C) and warm (ca. 23 degrees C) habitats are connected with habitats following the seasonal thermal variation. Irrespective of thermal origin, we found a common T-p for all populations, corresponding to the common temperature optimum (T-opt) for fitness-related traits in these populations. Warm-origin snails had lowest CTmax. As our previous studies have found higher chronic temperature tolerance in the warm populations, we suggest that there is a trade-off between high temperature tolerance and performance in other fitness components, including tolerance to chronic thermal stress. T-p and CTmax were positively correlated in warm-origin snails, suggesting a need to maintain a minimum "warming tolerance" (difference in CTmax and habitat temperature) in warm environments. Our results highlight the importance of high mean temperature in shaping thermal performance curves.

J	Zhang, M; Yang, Z; Yu, Y; Shi, XL				Zhang, Min; Yang, Zhen; Yu, Yang; Shi, Xiaoli			Interannual and Seasonal Shift between Microcystis and Dolichospermum: A 7-Year Investigation in Lake Chaohu, China	WATER												The shifts among bloom-forming cyanobacteria have attracted increasing attention due to the reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus during the eutrophication mitigation process. However, knowledge is limited regarding the pattern and drivers of the shifts among these cyanobacterial genera. In this study, we performed a 7-year long, monthly investigation in Lake Chaohu, to analyze the interannual and seasonal shifts between Microcystis and Dolichospermum. Our results showed that Microcystis was the dominant cyanobacterium in the western lake region in summer, whereas Dolichospermum was dominant in the other regions and seasons. The Microcystis biomass and ratio were driven primarily by total phosphorus and temperature. The sensitivity of Dolichospermum to nutrients and temperature was relatively weak compared to that of Microcystis. The shifts between Microcystis and Dolichospermum might be led by Microcystis. If the temperature and phosphorus level were relatively high, then Microcystis grew rapidly, and competitively excluded Dolichospermum. If the nutrient level, especially the phosphorus level, was low, then the exclusive power of Microcystis was weak, and Dolichospermum maintained its dominance, even in summer. The key temperature (similar to 17 degrees C) determined the dominance of the two cyanobacteria. Microcystis never dominated, while Dolichospermum was always dominant below the key temperature. Microcystis and Dolichospermum had different means of responding to the interaction of temperature, nitrogen and phosphorus. The Dolichospermum biomass was sensitive to the variation in nitrogen level, and the sensitivity depended on temperature. While the Microcystis biomass was sensitive to the variation in phosphorus level, and the sensitivity depended on temperature and total nitrogen. The different ways might contribute to the succession of the two cyanobacteria. Our findings will be helpful for improving the understanding of the shift process between Microcystis and Dolichospermum.					yu, yang/HIZ-9682-2022															2073-4441				JUL	2020	12	7							1978	10.3390/w12071978	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12071978													WOS:000557446900001

The usual explanation for this phenomenon has been long-range transport of sulphates emanating from industrial areas of eastern and central Europe, However, another possible source of the anomaly is marine biogenic production of sulphate from the oxidation of dimethylsulphide. Aerosols and gases were sampled on land, sea and air in central and northern Israel and analysed to determine inorganic ions, dimethylsulphide (DMS) and methanesulphonic acid (MSA). The results show that there is a definite, biogenic generation of sulphate from the Mediterranean sea and that this contributes to the sulphate content of the aerosol over Israel during the summer season. Using MSA as a tracer for DMS-derived sulphate, an attempt is made to assess the amount of this contribution. Based on MSA determinations and various reasonable assumptions about the behaviour of DMS, the biogenic contribution to the atmosphere is calculated to be between 6 and 22% (mean = 11%) of the non-sea salt sulphate. These figures are supported by alternative calculations based on DMS data from independent sources. Lake Kinneret is possibly an additional minor source of atmospheric DMS in the region.

In April 2023, approximately ten thousand 1-yr-old pond-reared pikeperch fry were marked and stocked into the small, eutrophic Hubenov Reservoir in the Czech Republic. Later that year, in August, the abundance of the stocked pond-reared pikeperch in the reservoir was estimated through beach seining, electrofishing, and gillnetting. Gillnet results showed that pikeperch avoided pelagic and deeper benthic habitats. Consequently, the most quantitative results were obtained by night beach seining. Our captures indicated that approximately 688 stocked pikeperch individuals were present in the entire reservoir in August, representing 6.5% of the stocked fish. These pikeperch displayed good growth and condition, primarily feeding on European perch fry, the most abundant 0+ fish in the reservoir. Our findings elucidate a relatively high mortality of 1-yr-old pond-reared pikeperch in the reservoir after spring stocking. Despite this mortality, the stocked pikeperch represented 85% of all 1-yr-old pikeperch in the reservoir. This highlights the effectiveness of spring stocking as a valuable tool for supporting the pikeperch population in reservoirs, emphasizing the stocking of an adequate quantity of pond-reared fish to compensate for the observed mortality.

In this study, wetlands were mapped in an area southwest of Halifax, Nova Scotia by classifying a combination of multi date and multi-beam RADARSAT-2 C-band polarimetric SAR (poISAR) images with spring Lidar, and fall QuickBird optical data using the Random Forests (RF) classifier. The resulting map has five wetland classes (open-water/marsh complex, open bog, open fen, shrub/treed fen/bog, swamp), plus lakes and various upland classes. Its accuracy was assessed using data from 156 GPS wetland sites collected in 2012 and compared to the one obtained with the current wetland map of Nova Scotia. The best overall classification was obtained using a combination of Lidar, RADARSAT-2 HH, HV, VH, VV intensity with polarimetric variables, and QuickBird multispectral (89.2%). The classified image was compared to GPS validation sites to assess the mapping accuracy of the wetlands. It was first done considering a group consisting of all wetland classes including lakes. This showed that only 69.9% of the wetland sites were correctly identified when only the QuickBird classified image was used in the classification. With the addition of variables derived from lidar, the number of correctly identified wetlands increased to 88.5%. The accuracy remained the same with the addition of RADARSAT-2 (88.5%). When we tested the accuracy for identifying wetland classes (e.g. marsh complex vs. open bog) instead of grouped wetlands, the resulting wetland map performed best with either QuickBird and Lidar, or QuickBird, Lidar, and RADARSAT-2 (66%). The Province of Nova Scotia's current wetland inventory and its associated wetland classes (aerial-photo interpreted) were also assessed against the GPS wetland sites. This provincial inventory correctly identified 62.2% of the grouped wetlands and only 18.6% of the wetland classes. The current inventory's poor performance demonstrates the value of incorporating a combination of new data sources into the provincial wetland mapping.					; larocque, armand/T-9524-2019	LaRocque, Armand/0000-0002-2509-0167; 													1569-8432	1872-826X				JUN	2018	68						139	156		10.1016/j.jag.2018.01.012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2018.01.012													WOS:000429398500013

In spite of a high circulation flow rate in the lake, strong thermal stratification is formed every summer. This phenomenon is caused by a huge water inflow from upper Lake Hibara, and this flux influences the water temperature quality of the epilimnion. Hence, in this study, the water balance in the lake is investigated from the viewpoint of heat balance. An increase in the acid nitrogen at the bottom of the lake is caused by high rainfall in summer. The variability of acid nitrogen due to rainfall is modeled. As a result, a denitrification rate can be estimated at the bottom of the lake.																					981-238-090-6				2002							1009	1014																WOS:000180463100186

The Dongting Lake wetland, an important wintering habitat for waterbirds, has suffered considerable degradation due to climate change and human disturbance during the last two decades; however, wetland restoration projects have now been implemented to improve waterbird diversity in the Dongting Lake. Based on annual waterbird and habitat survey data (2012/2013-2019/2020), we aimed to compare the differences in habitat variables (e.g., sedge [Carex spp.] meadow area, mudflat area, water area, and the normalized difference vegetation index of the sedge [Carex spp.] meadow) between the restored and unrestored wetlands to confirm whether wetland restorations could improve habitat quality. We also evaluated whether wetland restoration could effectively improve waterbird diversity by comparing the differences in waterbird populations at the community, foraging guild, feeding habitat guild, and species levels in the restored and unrestored wetlands. The results indicated that the restored wetland could provide more diverse and suitable habitats than the unrestored ones, particularly in terms of a sufficient variety of water habitats of different depths for waterbirds. The restored wetland was able to support substantial and diverse waterbird populations during the winter season. Specifically, compared to the unrestored wetlands, the restored wetland generally had higher species richness, individual density, and Shannon-Wiener diversity index at the community level; higher densities or proportions of different foraging guilds (tuber feeders, herbivores, fish eaters, insectivores, and omnivores, except herbivores geese), and of different feeding habitat guilds (G [0-10 cm], G (20-50 cm), G (20-70 cm), and G (>70 cm) guilds); and higher densities or proportions of the target species (except the lesser white-fronted goose and bean goose) at the species level.

Developing a new, passive diffusion sampler suite to detect helium anomalies associated with volcanic unrest	BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY												Helium (He) concentration and He-3/He-4 anomalies in soil gas and spring water are potentially powerful tools for investigating hydrothermal circulation associated with volcanism and could perhaps serve as part of a hazards warning system. However, in operational practice, He and other gases are often sampled only after volcanic unrest is detected by other means. A new passive diffusion sampler suite, intended to be collected after the onset of unrest, has been developed and tested as a relatively low-cost method of determining Heisotope composition pre- and post-unrest. The samplers, each with a distinct equilibration time, passively record He concentration and isotope ratio in springs and soil gas. Once collected and analyzed, the He concentrations in the samplers are used to deconvolve the time history of the He concentration and the He-3/He-4 ratio at the collection site. The current suite consisting of three samplers is sufficient to deconvolve both the magnitude and the timing of a step change in in situ concentration if the suite is collected within 100 h of the change. The effects of temperature and prolonged deployment on the suite's capability of recording He anomalies have also been evaluated. The suite has captured a significant He-3/He-4 soil gas anomaly at Horseshoe Lake near Mammoth Lakes, California. The passive diffusion sampler suite appears to be an accurate and affordable alternative for determining He anomalies associated with volcanic unrest.

Sediment phosphorus composition controls hot spots and hot moments of internal loading in a temperate reservoir	ECOSPHERE												Phosphorus (P) flux across the sediment-water interface in lakes and reservoirs responds to external perturbations within the context of sediment characteristics. Lentic ecosystems experience profound spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the mechanisms that control sediment P fluxes, likely producing hot spots and hot moments of internal loading. However, spatiotemporal variation in P fluxes remains poorly quantified, particularly in the context of sediment chemistry as a controlling variable. We measured P flux rates and mobile sediment P forms along the longitudinal gradient of a temperate reservoir every 2 months from February to October 2020. Both aerobic and anaerobic processes mobilized sediment P throughout the year. High flux rates at littoral sampling sites (8.4 and 9.7 mg P m(-2) day(-1)) occurred in late summer under oxic conditions in the overlying water and mobilized labile organic P. High fluxes at the profundal site coincided with hypolimnetic anoxia under ice cover and in mid-summer (11.2 and 17.2 mg P m(-2) day(-1), respectively) and released redox-sensitive P. Several high fluxes substantially skewed the flux rate distribution, providing evidence of hot spots and hot moments of internal loading. We further scaled the measured sediment P flux rates to representative areas of the lakebed to estimate internal P loads at an ecosystem scale. We found that P release from littoral sites under oxic conditions in the overlying water had an outsized impact on total loads. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering spatial and seasonal variation in sediment P pools and fluxes in order to more accurately estimate internal loads and identify the dominant biogeochemical mechanisms involved.					; Wilkinson, Grace/AAD-3202-2020; Albright, Ellen/HTM-7898-2023	Albright, Ellen/0000-0002-6226-9158; 													2150-8925					AUG	2022	13	8							e4201	10.1002/ecs2.4201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4201													WOS:000837456700001
J	Monkam, D				Monkam, D			Convective available potential energy (CAPE) in northern Africa and tropical Atlantic and study of its connections with rainfall in Central and West Africa during Summer 1985	ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH												In this paper, we study the distribution of the convective available potential energy (CAPE) in northern Africa and tropical Atlantic in summer. The pattern of this parameter is quite steady and presents three main zones. The first one is located between the equator and 15degreesN-20degreesN, with positive values of CAPE. In the second and the third zones located north of the band of latitudes 15degreesN-20degreesN and south of the equator, respectively, CAPE has negative values. We examined, in some details, the main tendencies of the CAPE pattern inside the first zone (CAPE > 0, in general) and we compared them to the rainfall pattern. We noted that the CAPE pattern in this zone presents three regions of maximum values: west, center, and east of the zone. The maximum at east and the maximum in the center seem to be connected to the orography effects. Between 15degreesN and 20degreesN, the CAPE distribution is characterised by its iso-line zero. This iso-line zero seems to define the north limit of the inter tropical convergence zone (ITCZ). In fact, the position of the iso-line zero on the CAPE distribution fluctuates during summer as the position of the ITCZ so that this parameter can also be used as a parameter or an index to define the ITCZ position in northern Africa and tropical Atlantic in the summer. The patterns of the rainfall and CAPE in this zone (5degreesN-20degreesN) have a very good similarity. When the rainfall is very weak (< 2 mm day(-1)) towards 12.5degreesN-15degreesN, the CAPE tends to become zero. The rainfall pattern presents, in general, high values towards Guinea and around Lake Chad. These regions are not very far from the maximum values of CAPE observed in different figures. The fields of correlation coefficients between the two parameters show that the rainfall and the CAPE are very well correlated around the ITCZ and towards some mountains. So, the strong values of the correlation coefficients seem to indicate that each of these two parameters is influenced by the ITCZ effects and by the orography effects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Statistical Analysis of Physico-chemical Properties of the Estuaries of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In general, estuaries may be classified variously according to inlet dynamics, geomorphology or whether they are tide or river dominated or, on a combination of all three factors. En KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, the four recognised estuary types are temporary opened-closed estuaries (TOCEs), permanently opened estuaries, estuarine lakes and river mouths. Since physico-chemical parameters are important in defining the estuarine environment, multiple Pearson correlations were performed between summer datasets of five of these parameters: temperature (degrees C), salinity (ppt), pH and turbidity (Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU)) according to clustered estuary types for all estuaries of KZN. It was found that very few significant relationships exist in all estuary types. These results are partly reflective of the sampling dataset. During summer, open mouth conditions commonly prevail for several estuaries following seasonal hinterland rainfall. Mixing of waters due to tidal influences and fluvial input from the upper catchment in KZN's shallow estuaries is known to inhibit stratification resulting in fewer pycnoclines and greater turbidity fluctuations. pH changes are closely linked to density changes (temperature and salinity) in water hence statistical relationships may not always be observable. It is clear that physico-chemical interactions are complex and long term sampling with seasonality and mouth state dynamics need to be taken into consideration. There is a need to develop a more holistic understanding of estuarine ecosystem functioning in this region.					; Pillay, Kirthee/ABF-7158-2020	Pillay, Kamleshan/0009-0000-0045-000X; 													1735-6865					WIN	2013	7	1					11	16																WOS:000313133700002
J	Yang, HQ; Fan, K				Yang, Hongqing; Fan, Ke			The Causes of Intraseasonal Alternating Warm and Cold Variations over China in Winter 2021/22	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												The subseasonal variability of winter air temperature in China during 2021/22 underwent significant changes, showing warm, warm, and cold anomalies during 2-23 December 2021 (P1), 1-27 January 2022 (P2), and 28 January-24 February 2022 (P3). The strong (weak) zonal circulation over East Asia led to positive (negative) surface air temperature anomalies (SATAs) during P1 and P2 (P3). The position of the Siberian high affected the distribution of the warmest center of SATA over northeastern and northwestern China in P1 and P2, respectively. Further investigations indicated that intraseasonal components (10-90 days) primarily drove the warm-to-cold transition in China during P2 and P3, contributing to 79.5% of the variance in SATA in winter 2021/22. Strong (weak) East Asian intraseasonal zonal circulations and positive (negative) meridional wind anomalies over China-Lake Baikal led to warm (cold) anomalies over China during P2 (P3). East Asian circulation alternations from P2 to P3 were associated with a shift in intraseasonal geopotential height anomalies over the North Atlantic region from positive to negative in the mid- to high troposphere through the propagation of north and south branch wave trains. The reversal of the North Atlantic geopotential height anomalies between P2 and P3 was modulated by intraseasonal higher-latitude SST anomalies over the North Atlantic and the location of intraseasonal stratospheric polar vortex. Furthermore, the intensified south branch wave train from the Indian Peninsula to China in the mid- to high troposphere was associated with active convection over the tropical western Indian Ocean during P3. These processes could be verified by using the linear baroclinic model.

Although some important progress has been made in quantitative paleoclimate reconstructions based on terrestrial records in the Indian summer monsoon region, high-resolution quantitative studies spanning the last similar to 20 ka are still relatively sparse with differing results. This study presents high-resolution quantitative variations in mean temperature of the coldest month (MTCM, the first controlling factor of the regional vegetation), mean annual temperature (MAT, the second controlling factor), and mean annual precipitation (MAP) from Lake Tengchongqinghai in southwestern China, based on an updated modern pollen dataset and the fossil pollen record spanning the last 18.5 ka. The results show that temperature and precipitation increased gradually from 18.5 ka, and peaked from 7.2 to 4.5 ka when MAT was on average 1.0 degrees C higher than the modern observational value (14.5 degrees C), corresponding to the mid-Holocene thermal maximum (HTM), and then decreased gradually. The total reconstructed ranges are between-2.2 and 9.2 degrees C for MTCM, 7.7 and 17.2 degrees C for MAT, and 840 and 1300 mm for MAP. On top of this overall climate trend, seven abrupt cold and dry events were detected during the periods of 16.2-14.8 ka, 12.8-11.5 ka, similar to 11.1 ka, 9.1-8.4 ka, similar to 7.7 ka, 4.3-3.7 ka, and 0.68-0.009 ka (1270-1950 CE). The results of this quantitative reconstruction were validated by both statistical and ecological evaluations. We conclude that the trend of climatic change since 18.5 ka in this study area was primarily driven by June, July, August, and September solar insolation and changes in radiative forcing and greenhouse gas concentrations. The abrupt changes may be caused by changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, solar activity, the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and volcanic activity.

Development of probability distributions for regional climate change from uncertain global mean warming and an uncertain scaling relationship	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												To produce probability distributions for regional climate change in surface temperature and precipitation, a probability distribution for global mean temperature increase has been combined with the probability distributions for the appropriate scaling variables, i.e. the changes in regional temperature/precipitation per degree global mean warming. Each scaling variable is assumed to be normally distributed. The uncertainty of the scaling relationship arises from systematic differences between the regional changes from global and regional climate model simulations and from natural variability. The contributions of these sources of uncertainty to the total variance of the scaling variable are estimated from simulated temperature and precipitation data in a suite of regional climate model experiments conducted within the framework of the EU-funded project PRUDENCE, using an Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA). For the area covered in the 2001-2004 EU-funded project SWURVE, five case study regions (CSRs) are considered: NW England, the Rhine basin, Iberia, Jura lakes (Switzerland) and Mauvoisin dam (Switzerland). The resulting regional climate changes for 2070-2099 vary quite significantly between CSRs, between seasons and between meteorological variables. For all CSRs, the expected warming in summer is higher than that expected for the other seasons. This summer warming is accompanied by a large decrease in precipitation. The uncertainty of the scaling ratios for temperature and precipitation is relatively large in summer because of the differences between regional climate models. Differences between the spatial climate-change patterns of global climate model simulations make significant contributions to the uncertainty of the scaling ratio for temperature. However, no meaningful contribution could sometimes be found for the scaling ratio for precipitation due to the small number of global climate models in the PRUDENCE project and natural variability, which is often the largest source of uncertainty. In contrast, for temperature, the contribution of natural variability to the total variance of the scaling ratio is small, in particular for the annual mean values. Simulation from the probability distributions of global mean warming and the scaling ratio results in a wider range of regional temperature change than that in the regional climate model experiments. For the regional change in precipitation, however, a large proportion of the simulations (about 90%) is within the range of the regional climate model simulations.																			1027-5606	1607-7938					2007	11	3					1097	1114		10.5194/hess-11-1097-2007	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-11-1097-2007													WOS:000246812100004

Thus, at the lake, compound specific hydrogen isotopic data for mid-and long chain n-alkanes (delta Dn-alkanes) are indicators of the variation in lake water delta D (delta D-LW). Genggahai dDLW is determined by the local meteoric water dD (delta D-MW) and by lake surface evaporation, as evidenced by modern observational data and the broad correlation between Genggahai dDLW and average lake water depth during the past 15 ka, with more negative dDLW values corresponding to greater average water depth. As demonstrated by the mid-and long chain dDn-alkanes data, the most negative interval of Genggahai delta D-LW was during the early Holocene. An overall trend towards more positive values from the early to the late Holocene clearly indicates the long term evolutionary history of local dDMW, which could be related to the intensity of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) via the "rainfall amount effect". Therefore, the record of dDLW at Genggahai during the past 15 ka, which resembles that of stalagmite delta O-18 records from the core ISM region, apparently reflects the long term evolution of ISM intensity. Furthermore, several short-term positive excursions in Genggahai dDLW values during the late Holocene reflect enhanced lake surface evaporation via an "isotopic enrichment" mechanism that apparently resulted from periods of weakened ISM intensity. Our results highlight the fact that unambiguous source determination of n-alkanes is vital for determining the paleoclimatic significance of lacustrine dDn-alkanes data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Conditions in Lake Ichkeul, Tunisia, are lethal for the fish in summer; this explains their seasonal migrations into Oued Sejnane and the other tributaries. Tolerance increased between 1984 and 1985 from LC50 = 15.6 to LC50 = 17.2 in a population from Oued Mejerdah; this may be connected with the dissolution of rock salt in the new Sidi Salem reservoir.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 30	1988	166	3					263	267		10.1007/BF00008135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008135													WOS:A1988Q062100007
J	CAMBRAY, JA; BRUTON, MN				CAMBRAY, JA; BRUTON, MN			AGE AND GROWTH OF A COLONIZING MINNOW, BARBUS-ANOPLUS, IN A MAN-MADE LAKE IN SOUTH-AFRICA	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Aspects of the life history of B. anoplus were studied in Lake le Roux, a turbid man-made lake on the Orange River, South Africa. This minnow underwent a population explosion and successfully colonized the shoreline of the newly-formed lake during the early phases of reservoir filling. Male and female B. anoplus reach sexual maturity in 1 yr at about 40 mm fork length. They have a multiple spawning habit with the first spawning in Nov.-Jan. and the 2nd in Feb.-March. The growth of the 2 resulting cohorts is discussed. The 2nd spawning not only acts as a ''back-up'' but prolongs the life of that year-class into an additional reproductive season. Most of the minnows die after their 2nd summer, but more offspring from the 2nd spawning. especially females, live into a third summer. Females attain a larger maximum size (73 mm FL) and age (3-4 yr) than males (60 mm FL.2-3 yr). B. anoplus is small and short-lived with a high seasonal reproductive potential, which is in contrast to the larger Barbus species in the Orange River system. These life-history traits enable the species to colonize and successfully inhabit unstable environments and probably account for its widespread distribution.																			0378-1909	1573-5133					1985	12	2					131	141		10.1007/BF00002765	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00002765													WOS:A1985ADN2100005

During a dry summer (three to six samplings per site), the meadow site and two marsh sites in the temporarily flooded eulittoral zone and the Phragmites australis-dominated site in the continuously flooded infralittoral zone had mean daytime N2O-N emissions from 11 +/- 7 to 22 +/- 7 mug m(-2) h(-1), whereas the Nuphar lutea-dominated site in the infralittoral zone had a mean N2O flux close to zero. During a wet summer (13-14 samplings per site), the mean daytime N2O-N fluxes ranged from 4 +/- 1 to 15 +/- 5 mg m(-2) h(-1) at the three eulittoral sites and were negligible at the two infralittoral sites. The littoral zone occupied 26% of the lake area but was estimated to account for most of the N2O emissions from the lake. The studied eulittoral zone, which did not have adjacent nitrogen fertilization, exhibited higher N2O emissions during the summer than seen in northern natural ecosystems in general, including peatlands, forests, and the pelagic regions of lakes. Thus in lake-rich landscapes the littoral zone and other lake-associated wetlands must be considered as potential sources of atmospheric N2O. An assessment of their atmospheric importance requires further data on the N2O fluxes and their regulation in different littoral areas and on the total littoral coverage, neither of which is yet available.
