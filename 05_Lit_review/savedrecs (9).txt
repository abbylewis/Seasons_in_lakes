J	Zhao, BY; Huang, XY; Hu, JF; Shu, JW; Wang, WM; Peng, PA				Zhao, Bingyan; Huang, Xianyu; Hu, Jianfang; Shu, Junwu; Wang, Weiming; Peng, Ping'an			Hydroclimate variation during the Mystery Interval in the East Asian Summer Monsoon area	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The inconsistency of paleoclimate records between the mid-low and high latitudes during the Mystery Interval (MI, 17.5-14.5 ka BP) is not well resolved. To provide a mechanism analysis, this study conducts spatial comparisons of hydroclimate changes in the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM) region during the MI by reconstructing the paleohydrology of the south of East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) region using the molecular distributions and carbon isotope ratio of n-alkanes, as well as elemental and isotopic composition of bulk organic matter, in a sedimentary core retrieved from Dingnan (DN) wetland. The multiple indices of the DN core confirmed the occurrence of dry-wet and wet-dry transitions at ca. 17.5 ka BP and 16.0 ka BP, respectively. Synchronous with the dry-wet transition in the DN records, the Indochina Peninsula at a slightly lower latitude became wetter. In contrast, the middle Yangtze region at a more northern latitude became slightly drier, and North China did not show a hydrological variation. Moreover, the wet-dry transition at the mid-MI was strong in the Indochina Peninsula (10-20 degrees N, at about 16.5 ka BP) and the southern EASM region (23-27 degrees N, at about 16.0 ka BP) but was nearly absent in the middle Yangtze region (28-32 degrees N) and North China (35-40 degrees N). The first hydrological transition possibly connects with the synchronous southward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the westerly jet caused by the cooling of the Northern Hemisphere. The absence of the second hydrological transition is interpreted as a result of the decoupling of the ITCZ and the westerly jet caused by the delayed formation of the ITCZ due to the warming of the Southern Hemisphere. This study reveals spatial differences in the hydroclimate variations during the MI and highlights the potential influence of coupling between the westerly jet and the ITCZ on rainfall in the ASM region.

In this study, based on extensive field data and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) imagery, a random forest regression (RFR) Secchi depth (Z(sd)) model suitable for turbid and eutrophic waters was established. With this model, the Zsd of 86 large (> 30 km(2)) lakes in Eastern China was obtained from May 2016 to April 2018. Additionally, the potential for applying OLCI-derived Z(sd) data in the SDG 6.3.2 evaluation was assessed. Of six common atmospheric correction (AC) processors (i.e., BAC, C2RCC, POLYMER, BP, MUMM, and 6SV), 6SV often exhibited the best performance except for at 754 nm (root mean square error (RMSE) <= 0.0094 sr(-1), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) <= 36.27%, and mean normalized bias (MNB) <= 15.89%). The RFR model had higher accuracy (R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.13 m, MAPE = 33.43%, and MNB = 14.55%) and was more suitable for eutrophic and turbid inland lakes across Eastern China than the other available Z(sd) algorithms. The average OLCI-derived Z(sd) of the lakes in Eastern China was 0.44 +/- 0.13 m, suggesting that these lakes are extremely turbid. The average Zsd of lakes in the Eastern Plain Lake (EPL) zone (0.45 +/- 0.12 m) was higher than that of the lakes in the Northeastern Plain and Mountain Lake (NPML) zone (0.40 +/- 0.17 m). The majority of lakes showed higher Z(sd) values in summer (rainy season) than in fall and winter (dry season). A simple SDG 6.3.2 evaluation scheme was developed based on the Zsd product, and only 54.65% of the lakes (N = 47) reached the "good" level during the monitoring period as a result of the eutrophication of the lakes in Eastern China. This study provides water clarity information for large lakes in Eastern China and facilitates the understanding of ambient water quality under the 2030 UN SDG framework as well as data and technical support for future SDG 6.3.2 evaluations.

It is important to recognize any contemporary hydrothermal contribution in paleoenvirommental reconstruction of lake basins because recharge from thermal waters can potentially confuse paleoclimatic signals preserved in the lacustrine sedimentary record. Hot spring deposits (travertine, sinter) provide the most tangible evidence for thermal recharge to lakes. Although subaerial spring deposits have been widely studied, lacustrine thermal spring deposits, especially sublacustrine siliceous sinters, remain poorly known. Detailed field, petrographic and scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies have been made of fossil sublacusuine sinter exposed at Soro hot springs along the northeastern shoreline of O1 Kokwe, a volcanic island in Lake Baringo, Kenya, Modem hot springs at Soro, which discharge Na-HCO3-Cl waters from a deep reservoir ( similar to 180degreesC), have thin (1 - 10 mm), friable microbial silica crusts around their subaerial vents, but thicker ( >1 cm) sinter deposits are not forming. The fossil sinter, which is present as intergranular cements and crusts in littoral conglomerates and sandstones, is composed mainly of opaline silica (opal-A). Three types of fossil sinter are recognized: (1) massive structureless silica, A which fills intergranular pores and forms crusts up to 5 cm thick (2) pore-lining silica, some of which is isopachous, and (3) laminated silica crusts, which formed mainly on the upper surfaces of detrital particles, All three types contain well-preserved diatoms including lacustrine planktonic forms. Microbial remains, mainly filamentous and coccoid bacteria (including cyanobacteria) and extracellular polymeric gels, are locally abundant in the opaline silica, together with detrital clays and thin laminae composed of authigenic chlorite (?), Most of the hydrothermal silica precipitated when the thermal springs were submerged by fresh lake water, Silica precipitated upon rapid cooling of thermal ( similar to 90 degreesC) waters at and just below their interface with the overlying cooler ( similar to 25 degreesC) lake waters. Microbial mats locally acted as a filter that limited mixing and rapid dilution of the thermal fluids, Some of the silica originally may have been soft and partly gelatinous. Planktonic diatoms and detrital clay rained down, then became incorporated in the amorphous silica. Following a fall in lake level, the opal-A lithified and partly altered to cristobalite (opal-C) and chalcedony, The lowest fossil sinters were later encrusted by calcite stromatolites, A with calcite and quartz forming late pore-filling cements. The age of the sublacustrine sinters is unknown, but some of the deposits could date back to the late Pleistocene. Similar conglomerates cemented by hydrothermal silica are present along fault lines at neighbouring Lake Bogoria. Such rocks may provide evidence for deep, hot fluid recharge to lakes when encountered in the geological record. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

Assessment and monitoring of the health status of these ecosystems is extremely important. This study reports the case study of "Capo Peloro" lakes (southern Italy), where ecotoxicological biomarkers in the key fish species Atherina boyeri have been used to reveal potential contamination in a transitional water ecosystem. The goal was to detect changes that occurred after the summer season, when the surrounding human population significantly increases, with the consequent enhancement of anthropic pressures. Lake Trasimeno, a reference protected site, was also selected. This study is the follow-up of a previous one carried out in the same environment reporting biomarkers employed on the copepod species Paracartia latisetosa, on which Atherina boyeri feeds. The main aim of the present study was to test the responses given by the same type of contamination in a planktivorous fish species, which occupies a higher trophic level. Several biochemical and genotoxic biomarkers were evaluated: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Benzo(a) pyrene-monooxygenase (BPMO), Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) metabolites in bile, Erythrocytic Nuclear Abnormalities (ENA) assay. This study confirms the contamination already shown in P. latisetosa from pesticides and carbamates, and/or polycyclic and polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, surfactants in both "Capo Peloro" lakes. A higher concentration of contaminants was demonstrated in early autumn with respect to the summer season, due to enhanced anthropogenic activities around and on the lakes. This study highlights that, although "Capo Peloro" lakes and Lake Trasimeno are protected areas, they are affected by environmental degradation. This study also confirms the benefits gained with a biomarker approach in monitoring transitional water ecosystems. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lee, HW; Kim, EJ; Park, SS; Choi, JH				Lee, Hye Won; Kim, Eun Jung; Park, Seok Soon; Choi, Jung Hyun			Effects of climate change on the thermal structure of lakes in the Asian Monsoon Area	CLIMATIC CHANGE												This research investigates the effect of climate change on the thermal structure of lakes in response to watershed hydrology. We applied a hydrodynamic water quality model coupled to a hydrological model with a future climate scenario projected by a GCM A2 emission scenario to the Yongdam Reservoir, South Korea. In the climate change scenario, the temperature will increase by 2.1A degrees C and 4.2A degrees C and the precipitation will increase by 178.4 mm and 464.4 mm by the 2050 and 2090, respectively, based on 2010. The pattern changes of precipitation and temperature increase due to climate change modify the hydrology of the watershed. The hydrological model results indicate that they increase both surface runoff itself and temperature. The reservoir model simulation with the hydrological model results showed that increasing air temperature is related to higher surface water temperature. Surface water temperature is expected to increase by about 1.2A degrees C and 2.2A degrees C from the 2050 and 2090, respectively, based on the 2010 results. The simulation results of the effects of climate warming on the thermal structure of the Asian Monsoon Area Lake showed consistent results with those of previous studies in terms of greater temperature increases in the epilimnion than in the hypolimnion, increased thermal stratification, and decreasing thermocline depths during the summer and fall. From this study, it was concluded that the hydrodynamic water quality model coupled to the hydrological model could successfully simulate the variability of the epilimnetic temperature, changed depth and magnitude of the thermocline and the changed duration of summer stratification.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				JUN	2012	112	3-4					859	880		10.1007/s10584-011-0233-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-011-0233-3													WOS:000304105600016

Therefore, numerous restoration activities (chemical precipitation, aeration) are being taken based on bottom-up control, which consists of limiting the nutrient pool available to lower trophic levels. The present study provides an efficiency analysis of pulverising aeration of waters in two stratified and five unstratified lakes located in Poland. The assessment was based on monitoring data (dissolved oxygen concentration (DO), % oxygen saturation (DO%), visibility of the Secchi disc (ZSD), the concentrations of: chlorophyll a (CHL), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN)) obtained before and after installation of the aerator on the lakes. The study was conducted during the spring and the summer seasons. Throughout the study period, the stratified lakes exhibited oxygen saturation <0.1%. Having completed the restoration activities, TN: TP ratio was found to gradually increase in all analysed lakes, which indicates that aeration may decrease phosphate content in the water column. In three lakes, the ratio was >17, so phosphorus became the most growth-limiting nutrient. The restoration activities on four unstratified lakes had no significant effect on the changes of the Carlson trophic state indices (TSI). Either individual values of the TSI(TP), TSI(CHL) and TSI(ZSD) were comparable, or the value of TSI(TP) was higher than one or both of the remaining indices for all of the lakes.					; Siwek, Hanna/AID-2502-2022	Wlodarczyk, Malgorzata/0000-0002-7137-614X; Siwek, Hanna/0000-0003-2720-7047; czerniawski, robert/0000-0001-7785-087X; 													2073-4441					FEB	2018	10	2							219	10.3390/w10020219	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10020219													WOS:000426775500129

However, an insolation-driven early-Holocene EASM maximum has not been convincingly validated, because a mid-Holocene summer monsoon precipitation maximum is widely accepted and the timing of a warm-season temperature maximum, which drove the strongest summer monsoon, is still unknown. Here we show that a pronounced shift in diatom life strategy, registered in high-resolution lake sediment records from northern China, tracked a clear change in lake thermal regime triggered by higher midHolocene warm-season temperatures. Combined with robust pollen-inferred precipitation data from northern China, we present independent lines of evidence that the East Asian thermal and summer monsoon maxima occurred synchronously during the mid-Holocene, demonstrating that a high- and low-latitude interplay is the most probable mechanism for the EASM throughout the Holocene. This hypothesis may explain both the midHolocene maximum of summer monsoon precipitation and the mid-Holocene flourishing of the Neolithic Chinese Yangshao culture in northern China.

The highly rugged topography and inaccessible remote areas makes satellite images as the most appropriate source of information retrie-val. We performed remote sensing based glacier change study for Samudra Tapu glacier, located in the Chandra basin of North-West Himalaya. In the present study, the capabilities of both optical and microwave remote sensing data was analysed in glacier change study in terms of its coverage, shift in equilibrium line altitude (ELA) and surface velocity over a period from 2000 to 2021. Multi Sensor (RISAT-1, Sentinel-1) time series of C-band SAR data along with a object oriented classification technique were used to identify different glacier facies such as percolation facies, icefalls, bare ice facies, refreeze snow and supraglacial debris. These classified maps were also used to detect the snow line and firn line along with ELA, aided with elevation information from digital elevation model (DEM). It was identified that more than 50 % of the total glacier area still lies into accumulation region. Further, we estimated the glacier surface velocity using Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) technique using European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1/2) tandem data of 1996. High value of coherence was observed from the SAR return signal for one-day temporal difference. A mean velocity of 17-24 cm/day was found for the months of March and May 1996, highest flow rates were seen in the high accumu-lation area located in the Eastern and Southern Aspect of glacier. Spatial analysis of velocity patterns with respect to slope and aspect show that high rates of flow was found in southern slopes and movement rates generally increase with increase in slope. Feature tracking approach was used to estimate the glacier flow for long term and seasonal basis using optical and SAR datasets (IRS-1C, 1D PAN, Landsat-7, 8 PAN, and TANDEM-x) during 1999-2020 period. The results suggest that glacier flow varies with season, i.e., high velocity during spring-summer season, as compared to late summer or winter and, the rate of ice flow changes over the years. The mean glacier velocity reduced to 49.5 m/year during 2013-2020 time, as compared to 67.67 m/year during 1999-2003 time. These results of reducing glacier velocity and changing snow line altitude indicates enhanced glacier's melt rate and overall negative mass balance for Smudra tapu glacier.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

J	ROBERGE, J; JONES, HG				ROBERGE, J; JONES, HG			SUBICE LAYERING AND ORIGIN OF ACIDIC WATERS IN A SMALL BOREAL LAKE DURING THE SPRING RUNOFF	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												In a small boreal forest lake, the subice circulation of waters from five distinct origins (lake premelt water, lakeshore snowpack meltwater, ice cover meltwater, groundwater and hillslope through-flow water) was studied during the spring melt period. A network of collared access holes was used to monitor the temperature, conductivity and pH profiles of the water column beneath the ice cover. The study also included the tracing of snowbank meltwaters and through-flow waters with rhodamine. Conductivity and pH appeared to be efficient parameters for discriminating most of the water types considered. During the spring melt three distinct low-pH episodes were recorded at the lake outflow. The first episode (pH 5) occurred in the early melt period; snow and ice meltwaters layered beneath the ice forming a stratum almost-equal-to 20 cm thick. It moved toward the outlet under laminar flow conditions (observed average velocity, 1m/h). Two subsequent pH episodes of pH 5.3 and 5.1 were observed during the massive melt period. These episodes were due to peak flows of hillslope through flow which entered the lake and formed a layer 20-40 cm thick in the water column (observed average velocity, greater than 20 m/h). The ice cover thus not only modified the nearshore water quality by inducing thermal layering but also strongly influenced the quality of the outflow waters due to the segregation and rapid evacuation of the through flow and surface meltwaters.																			0043-1397					APR	1991	27	4					479	492		10.1029/90WR02761	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/90WR02761													WOS:A1991FF71400004

The River Murray's anthropogenic sediment history can be divided into four periods with varying source areas, sediment loads, and seasonal patterns. The Aboriginal period (before 1840) was characterized by clear water at summer low-flows in the River Murray and its southern tributaries, with more sediment coming from the northern catchment than the southern, and the Darling River being turbid at all flows. There is little evidence that Aboriginal burning resulted in any measurable increase in SS. SS loads peaked in the 1870s and 1880s (the gold and gully period, 1850-1930) as valley floors were incised by gullies (mostly in northern tributaries), and gold sluicing flushed huge amounts of sludge into southern tributaries. Sedimentation in wetlands and on floodplains increased by 2-10 times in this period, and the biota in wetlands switched from clear water to turbid water communities. In the hiatus period (1930-1960) sediment supply from gullies and gold mining waned and low flow SS concentrations returned to low levels. Dam construction through the 1960s and 1970s (the regulation period, 1960 on) disconnected the River Murray from catchment derived sediment. Despite this, SS levels increased again: now largely derived from instream sources including bank erosion from long duration summer irrigation flows, the spread of bottom-feeding carp (Cyprinus carpio), and wave erosion from boats. Erosion switched from winter to summer dominated. Significant investment in securing water for the environment in the Murray-Darling Basin could be complemented by addressing in-channel sediment sources in the River Murray itself to reduce turbidity. Overall, European era SS concentrations remain relatively low with small sediment delivery to the ocean (0.1 Mt per annum), despite high catchment erosion rates. This is due to poor sediment delivery efficiency through the low-gradient landscape.					; Davies, Peter/KLZ-9236-2024; Thoms, Martin/D-5049-2011	Rutherfurd, Ian/0000-0001-6229-7223; Thoms, Martin/0000-0002-8074-0476													1535-1459	1535-1467				MAY	2020	36	4			SI		522	541		10.1002/rra.3566	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.3566		FEB 2020											WOS:000511002100001

In contrast, most juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta Linnaeus) remained in the tributaries for 1-2 years before migrating down stream to the lake. Juvenile salmonids (<350 mm) were more abundant in the shallow littoral(<10 m), especially near tributaries, than in the deep littoral (10-40 m), or the surface layers (0-16 m) of the limnetic zone which were populated by yearling (>150 mm) and adult salmon and rainbow trout (>210 mm). The abundance of 0+ rainbow trout in the littoral zone declined rapidly from February to August and stocks were supplemented by a migration of yearling fish from the tributaries in spring. The shallow littoral zone and tributaries are both important for juvenile trout rearing in this lake.																			0028-8330					JUN	1999	33	2					205	219		10.1080/00288330.1999.9516871	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1999.9516871													WOS:000083585800007

Delminichthys ghetaldii (Steindachner, 1882) is an endemic fish species which can be found in springs and streams in fields Ljubomir, Dabar and Fatnica in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Bacina lakes in Croatia. Most of the year minnows dwell in underground water habitats of karst region in eastern Herzegovina. During the autumn and spring flooding of the surrounding fields, Popovo minnows emerge from the underground waters in estavele and spawn in newly formed temporary lakes. In order to obtain protein profiles from fish muscle, we used several extraction protocols and buffers. Sarcoplasmic proteins were extracted from muscle tissue using Tris/EDTA and Tris/ CaCl2 buffers. The results showed that the most abundant sarcoplasmatic proteins had molecular weight of 40 and 34 kDa while high MW band appeared only in samples extracted by Tris/ EDTA. Re-extraction with 1% SDS resolved the presence of myofibrillar proteins and showed to be qualitatively and quantitatively more efficient than the extraction by nonionic detergent Tween. Our results also indicate that protein extraction with commercial SDS buffer from a biopsy muscle tissue gives good screening results and is applicable for field work. The results are discussed in terms of the efficiency of different buffers in protein extraction from Popovo minnow muscle tissue.					; Dekić, Radoslav/HSD-8235-2023; Kukavica, Biljana/AAD-8370-2019	Dekic, Radoslav/0000-0001-5209-8431; 													1303-2712	2149-181X				SEP	2016	16	3					637	642		10.4194/1303-2712-v16_3_17	http://dx.doi.org/10.4194/1303-2712-v16_3_17													WOS:000388308900017

Nihan; Erdogan, Seyda; Levi, Eti E.; Yozgatligil, Ceylan; Jeppesen, Erik; Beklioglu, Meryem			Impact of alternating wet and dry periods on long-term seasonal phosphorus and nitrogen budgets of two shallow Mediterranean lakes	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The water balance, with large seasonal and annual water level fluctuations, has a critical influence on the nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics of shallow lakes in the semi-arid climate zone. We constructed seasonal water and nutrient budgets for two connected shallow lakes, Lakes Mogan and Eymir, located in Central Anatolia, Turkey. The study period covered 20 years with alternations between dry and wet years as well as restoration efforts including sewage effluent diversion and biomanipulations in Lake Eymir. Both lakes experienced a 1-2 m water level drop during a drought period and a subsequent increase during the wet period, with seasonal water level fluctuations of 0.60 to 0.70 m. During wet years with high water levels, small seasonal differences were observed with a nutrient peak in spring caused by external loading and nutrient loss via retention during summer. During years with low water levels, nutrient concentrations increased due to internal and external loading, exacerbated by evaporative water loss. In Lake Eymir, a shift to eutrophic conditions with turbid water occurred under low water level conditions and consequent internal loading of P from the sediment, causing high nutrient concentrations in summer. Our results indicate a threat of lakes drying out in the semi-arid climate zone if evaporation increases and precipitation decreases as anticipated from the global climate change predictions. In addition, our results show the influence of the water balance on the eutrophication of shallow lakes in the Mediterranean climate zone and highlight the ultimate consequences for lake management.

Morphometry was studied in relation to temperature, food resources, cladoceran competitors and invertebrate predators. Three different morphs were recorded. We observed lack of allometric growth of the posterior spine. Absence of allometric growth could be related with the low density of a predaceous water mite and the small size of the cladocerans present in the lake. Fluctuations in lorica length and width were negatively correlated with temperature and algal biovolume. We discuss the benefits of this morphological response of Keratella in relation to environmental conditions.

J	Garvey, JE; Herra, TP; Leggett, WC				Garvey, JE; Herra, TP; Leggett, WC			Protracted reproduction in sunfish: The temporal dimension in fish recruitment revisited	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Understanding how life histories influence reproductive success under uncertain conditions is necessary to predict population dynamics. For many organisms, protracted reproduction may increase expected offspring recruitment in variable environments, requiring that temporal patterns of reproduction be considered when developing management or conservation strategies. We explored the interrelationships among birth date, production of embryos on nests, survival of larvae to the open-water stage, and survival of juveniles through the first fall and winter of life for bluegill and pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus and L. gibbosus) in Lake Opinicon, Ontario, during May 1998 through May 1999. Age-0 sunfish were sampled with nesting surveys for embryos, surface tows for free-swimming larvae, and seining/trawling for juveniles. Age of juveniles (days post swim-up) was quantified using otoliths. The abundance of embryos on nests and the density of open-water larvae were unrelated across all dates and sites. Although 40% of larvae had appeared in the open water by 12 June, most juveniles sampled in the fall were produced after that time, suggesting that high mortality of early produced larvae occurred. Larval survival to the juvenile stage was generally unrelated to the abundance of edible zooplankton taxa during swim-up from nests. Larval survival was often highest at temperatures >23.5degreesC. Fall length of age-0 sunfish increased with increasing age. Both age-specific length and mean lengths shifted positively between October 1998 and May 1999, suggesting that growth of all individuals and perhaps selective mortality of small juveniles occurred. Although early reproduction may increase sizes reached by fall and thereby improve overwinter survival, early hatched larvae are subject to variable environmental factors that may reduce survival. Late-hatched larvae may reach relatively smaller sizes by fall, but have higher survival probabilities during this life stage. Protracted reproduction appears to be a response to variable environmental factors influencing growth and survival across multiple life stages. As such, all reproducing adults, rather than those perceived to produce offspring during typically favorable times, must be protected from exploitation or other human-induced perturbations.

Interplay of community dynamics, temperature, and productivity on the hydrogen isotope signatures of lipid biomarkers	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The hydrogen isotopic composition (delta H-2) of lipid biomarkers has diverse applications in the fields of paleo-climatology, biogeochemistry, and microbial community dynamics. Large changes in hydrogen isotope fractionation have been observed among microbes with differing core metabolisms, while environmental factors including temperature and nutrient availability can affect isotope fractionation by photoautotrophs. Much effort has gone into studying these effects under laboratory conditions with single species cultures. Moving beyond controlled environments and quantifying the natural extent of these changes in freshwater lacustrine settings and identifying their causes is essential for robust application of delta H-2 values of common short-chain fatty acids as a proxy of net community metabolism and of phytoplankton-specific biomarkers as a paleohydrologic proxy. This work targets the effect of community dynamics, temperature, and productivity on H-2/H-1 fractionation in lipid biomarkers through a comparative time series in two central Swiss lakes: eutrophic Lake Greifen and oligotrophic Lake Lucerne. Particulate organic matter was collected from surface waters at six time points throughout the spring and summer of 2015, and delta H-2 values of short-chain fatty acids, as well as chlorophyll-derived phytol and the diatom biomarker brassicasterol, were measured. We paired these measurements with in situ incubations conducted with (NaHCO3)-C-13, which were used to calculate the production rates of individual lipids in lake surface water. As algal productivity in-creased from April to June, net discrimination against H-2 in Lake Greifen increased by as much as 148% for individual fatty acids. During the same time period in Lake Lucerne, net discrimination against H-2 increased by as much as 58% for individual fatty acids. A large portion of this signal is likely due to a greater proportion of heterotrophically derived fatty acids in the winter and early spring, which are displaced by more H-2-depleted fatty acids as phytoplankton productivity increases. Smaller increases in H-2 discrimination for phytol and brassicasterol suggest that a portion of the signal is due to changes in net photoautotrophic H-2 fractionation, which may be caused by increasing temperatures, a shift from maintenance to high growth, or changes in the community assemblage. The fractionation factors for brassicasterol were significantly different between the two lakes, suggesting that its hydrogen isotope composition may be more sensitive to nutrient regime than is the case for fatty acids or phytol.

J	Mueller, RP; Brown, RS; Hop, H; Moulton, L				Mueller, Robert P.; Brown, Richard S.; Hop, Haakon; Moulton, Larry			Video and acoustic camera techniques for studying fish under ice: a review and comparison	REVIEWS IN FISH BIOLOGY AND FISHERIES												Researchers attempting to study the presence, abundance, size, and behavior of fish species in northern and arctic climates during winter face many challenges, including the presence of thick ice cover, snow cover, and, sometimes, extremely low temperatures. This paper describes and compares the use of video and acoustic cameras for determining fish presence and behavior in lakes, rivers, and streams with ice cover. Methods are provided for determining fish density and size, identifying species, and measuring swimming speed and successful applications of previous surveys of fish under the ice are described. These include drilling ice holes, selecting batteries and generators, deploying pan and tilt cameras, and using paired colored lasers to determine fish size and habitat associations. We also discuss use of infrared and white light to enhance image-capturing capabilities, deployment of digital recording systems and time-lapse techniques, and the use of imaging software. Data are presented from initial surveys with video and acoustic cameras in the Sagavanirktok River Delta, Alaska, during late winter 2004. These surveys represent the first known successful application of a dual-frequency identification sonar (DIDSONTM) acoustic camera under the ice that achieved fish detection and sizing at camera ranges up to 16 m. Feasibility tests of video and acoustic cameras for determining fish size and density at various turbidity levels are also presented. Comparisons are made of the different techniques in terms of suitability for achieving various fisheries research objectives. This information is intended to assist researchers in choosing the equipment that best meets their study needs.																			0960-3166	1573-5184				MAY	2006	16	2					213	226		10.1007/s11160-006-9011-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-006-9011-0													WOS:000240536600006

Societal demands on surface water for drinking, irrigation and recreation are also highest in summer, especially during dry and warm conditions. Here, we analyzed trends in online searches to investigate how public awareness of cyanobacterial blooms is impacted by temperature in nine different countries over almost twenty years. Our findings reveal large seasonal and interannual variation, with more online searches for harmful cyanobacteria in temperate regions during hot summers. Online searches and media attention increased even more steeply with temperature than the incidence of cyanobacterial blooms, presumably because lakes attract more people during warm weather. Overall, our study indicates that warmer summers not only increase cyanobacterial bloom incidence, but also lead to a pronounced increase of the public awareness of toxic cyanobacterial blooms.

Dynamics of Secondary Metabolites and Free Amino Acids in the Heart of the Fish Amur Sleeper Perccottus glenii (Odontobutidae) during Winter Hypobiosis	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The freshwater fish Perccottus glenii is of interest owing to its tolerance to a wide range of environmental temperatures; however, the details of the mechanisms of its low-temperature adaptation have been insufficiently studied. Our previous work has shown the involvement of secondary metabolites and amino acids in the compensatory responses to near-zero temperatures of skeletal muscles, brain, blood plasma, and liver of P. glenii. In the current study we report their compensatory responses in the heart. It has been shown that, at the beginning of hypobiosis (December), at a water temperature of 1 degrees C, the level of taurine almost halves in comparison with summer concentration (9.70 +/- 0.55 mu mol/g wet weight), and it decreases further to 3.80 +/- 0.25 mu mol/g by the end of winter hypobiosis (beginning of April). Phosphoethanolamine was not detected in summer, but it appears in December (0.81 +/- 0.07 mu mol/g) and increases until the end of hibernation. Cysteic acid was also found only in December but its concentration decreased before the end of hypobiosis. The ratio of glutamate and alanine pools, the indicator of the metabolic contribution of aerobic and anaerobic energy, showed a slight decrease of glutamate during hypobiosis and increase of alanine. Amino acid responses suggest that oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle are actively involved in the energy supply of the heart of P. glenii even at the end of hypobiosis.

Catch rates of young-of-year (YOY) were positively associated with inflows into the reservoir during the spawning season (April-May), whereas juvenile catch rates were positively related to reservoir releases during the post-spawning period (Jun-Nov). Abundance of juvenile fish in fall electrofishing samples increased from 1997 through 1999. No evidence of over-winter mortality was detected. Estimated swim-up dates for young-of-year largemouth bass were later each year from 1997 to 1999. Growth of YOY largemouth bass was not correlated with any of the measured environmental variables. Our results show that increased water levels during the spawning period and distribution of nutrients throughout the reservoir via water releases during the post-spawning period enhanced largemouth bass production in Skiatook Lake.

On seasonal variations of radiocesium speciation in the surface sediments of Lake Juodis, Lithuania	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												Data on radiocesium speciation measured seasonally in black silt surface sediments in the shallow terrace and in the deepest southern part of Lake Juodis (Lithuania) in 2004-2005 are presented. It is shown that seasonal variations of radiocesium exchangeable fractions in the sediments in the shallow terrace are mainly related to its redistribution due to the vital cycle of green algae covering bottom surfaces - processes of their growth and decomposition. A seasonal course of those fractions in surface sediments of the deepest bottom areas of the lake follows a distinct pattern and is annually recycling. It is maximum in winter and declines due to stagnant bottom water zone disruption in summer. It is shown that surface sediments in the deepest bottom areas of the lake are not a radiocesium source during the formation of the anaerobic zone in bottom water in winter, and act in that case as its acceptor. The radiocesium remobilization to the bottom water is seasonal and site-specific. It is suggested to be due to three main processes: its diffusion from deeper and more active sediments, its redistribution during decomposition of organics freshly accumulated in surface sediments and a radiocesium flux induced by the mechanism of the seasonal anaerobic zone formation in near-bottom water.

Usable habitat can be increased in these reservoirs using oxygen diffusers to increase DO concentrations in the cooler, deeper waters. Several oxygen diffuser systems are currently in operation. Some of the systems were originally designed to increase DO in hydropower reservoir releases, but have also created fish habitat as a result of the diffuser system's efficient oxygen transfer capabilities in the reservoir. Several other systems are operated to improve water quality in the reservoir for water supply, and two systems have specific fish habitat maintenance goals. Improvements in DO for fish have been obtained at Calaveras Reservoir, California by the San Francisco Public Utility Commission, and fish studies at this reservoir are currently underway. In North Twin Lake, Washington, the Colville Confederated Tribes and Washington State University have documented improved trout habitat and reduced sulfide concentrations. Oxygenation of cool, deep water is now a proven technology that can alleviate summertime thermal and oxygen stress on striped bass and hybrid striped bass and can minimize habitat-related mortalities. The technology is being implemented specifically for striped bass with a large installation in J. Strom Thurmond Reservoir, South Carolina, for the Savannah District of the U. S.

J	Agersborg, HPK				Agersborg, HPK			The influence of temperature on fish	ECOLOGY												Gizzard-shad, carp, crappies, bluegill, sunfish, chub, steel-colored minnow, shiner, and bullhead catfish that enter a tributary contaminated with warm starch-waste water in early fall before the lake receiving the tributary is cooled, become accustomed during winter to a temp. of 28-30[degree] C, dissolved O between 5 and 6 p. p. m.; while the temp, of the lake is around 0[degree] C, the dissolved O is 12.8 p. p. m., saturation 90%. They live in the warm starch-waste water for some time, feeding on the sludge of fission fungi and slime algae. Some die from the effects of the high temp. and the toxicity of the water. Such dead fish have the bronchial apparatus partially coagulated and some blood vessels ruptured, and may remain in a warm room for several days without any indication of decay. In winter, when fish which live in such semi-polluted starch-waste water are suddenly brought into contact with stream or lake water having the season''s temp. they manifest O hunger by surface swimming and by gulping air. Continuous exposure in cold, pure water is fatal. Fish recover if they are returned to the warm semi-polluted water. Death in the cold pure water seems to be due to lack of gill-function, although the cold water actually contains more than twice as much dissolved O as the warm water.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1930	11						136	144		10.2307/1930786	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1930786													WOS:000200209700009

Aquaculture impacts on the algal and bacterial communities in a small boreal forest lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												A whole-lake experiment to examine the impacts of aquaculture on a freshwater ecosystem was conducted at the Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada. From 2003 to 2006, a 10 tonne fish capacity aquaculture cage stocked with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was operated in Lake 375 and the impact of excess nutrients on the algal and bacteria communities was examined. The experiment was designed as a nutrient loading experiment with fish food and fish excretion the source of nutrients. Total N and P concentrations increased over the 4 years (15x and 4x, respectively). Phytoplankton biomass increased 4x annually following the start of aquaculture operation in 2003. The most dramatic responses occurred during spring and fall mixing, with blooms of chrysophytes and dinoflagellates increasing biomass by up to 12x. Bacteria biomass and densities were unaffected except for increases in late fall. Periphyton biomass was relatively unaffected except for an increase in biomass in the fourth year. The combination of a long water residence time in the lake coupled with an extremely hi-fi fish stocking density in Lake 375 resulted in an immediate impact on water quality. The results suggest that the impacts of aquaculture are accumulative and continual stocking will further impact water quality.																			0706-652X					NOV	2009	66	11					1936	1948		10.1139/F09-121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F09-121													WOS:000272933500010

The Zoige wetland, situated to the east of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, is the largest highland wetland in China and highly sensitive to environmental changes. While several paleoenvironmental reconstructions have been conducted in this region, comprehensive investigations into grain size are still limited. In this study, we conducted a systematic investigation of grain size in ash from the sediments of the Hongyuan peat HY2014 profile in this area. The ash composition in this profile was primarily clay and silt particles, with a very low sand content. The grain size frequency curves generally exhibited a bimodal modality, except for the sediments in the bottom layers which displayed a single-peak pattern. By employing the end-member (EM) model and considering previous research findings, we reconstructed the atmospheric circulation since the last deglaciation. Three distinct EMs were identified. EM1 indicated long-distance suspended materials primarily transported by WWs. EM2 was associated with low-altitude circulation and linked to a decrease in the Asian summer monsoon (ASM). EM3 represented materials transported into the wetland via the Asian winter monsoon (AWM). Our results suggested that during the late deglacial period, characterized by strong AWM intensity, the Zoige wetland experienced cold and arid conditions. Moreover, the WWs and ASM exerted dominant influences, while the AWM gradually weakened during the Holocene, with variations in their intensities across different time intervals. The results also revealed a positive correlation between WWs and ASM, as well as a negative correlation between WWs and AWM.

Preferential sequestration of terrestrial organic matter in boreal lake sediments	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												The molecular composition and origin has recently been demonstrated to play a critical role in the persistence of organic matter in lake water, but it is unclear to what degree chemical attributes and sources may also control settling and burial of organic matter in lake sediments. Here we compared the annual contribution of allochthonous and autochthonous sources to the organic matter settling in the water column and present in the sediments of 12 boreal lakes. We used the fluorescence properties and elemental composition of the organic matter to trace its origin and found a consistent pattern of increasing contribution of terrestrial compounds in the sediments as compared to the settling matter, with an annual average allochthony of similar to 87% and similar to 57%, respectively. Seasonal data revealed a predominance of in-lake-produced compounds sinking in the water column in summer. Yet only a slight concurrent decrease in the contribution of terrestrial C to lake sediments was observed during the same period, and sediment allochthony increased again to high levels in autumn. Our results reveal a preferential preservation of allochthonous matter in the sediments and highlight the role of lakes as sequesters of organic carbon primarily originating from the surrounding landscape.

The TRAX Light-Rail Train Air Quality Observation Project	URBAN SCIENCE												Observing air quality from sensors onboard light rail cars in Salt Lake County, Utah began as a pilot study in 2014 and has now evolved into a five-year, state-funded program. This metropolitan region suffers from both elevated ozone levels during summer and high PM2.5 events during winter. Pollution episodes result predominantly from local anthropogenic emissions but are also impacted by regional transport of dust, chemical precursors to ozone, and wildfire smoke, as well as being exacerbated by the topographical features surrounding the city. Two electric light-rail train cars from the Utah Transit Authority light-rail Transit Express ("TRAX") system were outfitted with PM2.5 and ozone sensors to measure air quality at high spatial and temporal resolutions in this region. Pollutant concentration data underwent quality control procedures to determine whether the train motion affected the readings and how the sensors compared against regulatory sensors. Quality assurance results from data obtained over the past year show that TRAX Observation Project sensors are reliable, which corroborates earlier preliminary validation work. Three case studies from summer 2019 are presented to illustrate the strength of the finely-resolved air quality observations: (1) an elevated ozone event, (2) elevated particulate pollution resulting from 4th of July fireworks, and (3) elevated particle pollution during a winter time inversion event. The mobile observations were able to capture spatial gradients, as well as pollutant hotspots, during both of these episodes. Sensors have been recently added to a third light rail train car, which travels on a north-south oriented rail line, where air quality was unable to be monitored previously. The TRAX Observation Project is currently being used to provide reliable pollutant data for health studies and inform urban planning efforts. Links to real-time data displays and updated information on the quality-controlled data from this study are available on the webpage for the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Utah.					; Mitchell, Logan/A-5481-2011	Crosman, Erik/0000-0002-0047-384X; Jacques, Alexander/0009-0004-3729-2702; Mitchell, Logan/0000-0002-8749-954X; Fasoli, Benjamin/0000-0001-7372-2176; Mendoza, Daniel/0000-0002-7884-7362; Horel, John/0000-0002-2328-5008; Lin, John/0000-0003-2794-184X														2413-8851				DEC	2019	3	4							108	10.3390/urbansci3040108	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/urbansci3040108													WOS:000621639500008

Integrated use of biomarkers to assess the impact of heavy metal pollution on Solea aegyptiaca fish in Lake Qarun	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE												Background: Biomarkers have become a valuable tool in environmental assessment, since they contribute to predicting contaminants in monitoring programmes. This study aimed to investigate the toxicity of heavy metal pollution in Lake Qarun using a multibiomarker approach (morphological, oxidative stress, genotoxicity, stress proteins) in Solea aegyptiaca fish. During the winter and summer seasons, water and fish samples were collected from different locations along Lake Qarun; western and northern sectors were away from any source of pollution, while southern and eastern sectors were exposed to effluents discharged from El-Wadi and El-Bats drains, respectively. The environmental quality, as well as the accumulation of metals (Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Ni) in fish gills, liver, and muscles were assessed. Data were integrated using the integrated biomarker response index (IBRv2) for biomarker response interpretation. Results: Water quality and bioaccumulation of heavy metals revealed a highly significant difference between samples collected from polluted sectors and those collected far from drainage water, and, seasonal differences were detected. Growth indices revealed a significant difference between sites and seasons. Fish from the western sector had the highest total antioxidant capacity in their gills, liver, and muscles, with no seasonal differences detected. However, the maximum value of malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl, 8-hydroxy-2 ' deoxyguanosine, metallothionein, heat shock protein 70, and DNA strand breaks in gills, liver, and muscles was detected in the polluting sectors. It revealed a significant difference between seasons, with the highest value during the winter season. According to IBRv2 results, the most effective biomarkers in this study were malondialdehyde and 8-hydroxy-2 ' deoxyguanosine in gills, protein carbonyl and metallothionein in the liver, heat shock protein 70 in gills and liver, and DNA strand break in gills, liver, and muscles. Conclusions: This multibiomarker approach contributes to distinguishing between locations with varying levels of anthropogenic pollution, identifying the drainage water-exposed sectors as the most stressed and the winter season as the most critical time for Solea aegyptiaca owing to spawning. The biomarkers chosen are effective indicators in Solea aegyptiaca under stress, indicating the potential for environmental monitoring.					ahmed, ekrami/S-4061-2017; Hassan, Ekrami/S-4061-2017; gaber, Hanan/K-2816-2019; Hamdy, Soha/MFZ-7773-2025	ahmed, ekrami/0000-0001-5535-1797; hamdy, soha/0000-0002-0289-8358; gaber, hanan/0000-0003-1994-8021													2190-4707	2190-4715				DEC	2022	34	1							74	10.1186/s12302-022-00656-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-022-00656-6													WOS:000842037800001

Chlorophyll a concentrations and gross primary productivity generally reached maxima during the summer and were most depressed in winter months, regardless of color or trophic classification. Primary productivity was more strongly correlated with chlorophyll a, nutrient concentrations and water clarity in clearwater (< 75 Pt units) than in colored (> 75 Pt units) systems. Amplitudes in algal biomass were considerably smaller than temperate lakes. Variability in primary production in Florida lakes was intermediate to patterns in the temperate zone and tropics, but was more closely aligned to northern latitudes. Within the Florida peninsula, variability of primary productivity decreased from north to south and corresponded to latitudinal gradients in climatic regimes.

FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. We measured the abundance and biomass of filter-feeding microcrustacean zooplankton and calculated their grazing impact on phytoplankton biomass during summer in five shallow, mesotrophic to eutrophic lakes. For three of the lakes data exist both from years with dense submerged vegetation and low turbidity (the clearwater state), as well as from years characterised by sparse vegetation and high turbidity (the turbid state). In the other two lakes data are available only for clearwater conditions. 2. In all lakes conditions of dense vegetation and clear water coincided with a low abundance of crustacean plankton during summer. In the three lakes that shifted, the calculated biovolume ingested by crustacean plankton (filtering rate) was 3-11 times lower during clearwater conditions compared with turbid conditions. Because phytoplankton biomass was lower during clearwater conditions, however, daily grazing pressure from microcrustacea (expressed as percentage of phytoplankton biomass) did not differ between states. In three of the five lakes, grazers were estimated to take less than 10% of the phytoplankton biomass per day, indicating filtration by zooplankton was not the most important mechanism to maintain clearwater conditions. 3. High densities of Cladocera were found in three of the lakes within dense stands of Charophyta. However, these samples were dominated by plant-associated taxa that even during the night were rarely found outside the vegetation. This indicates that plant-associated zooplankton has no major influence on the maintenance of water clarity outside the vegetation. 4. Spring peak abundance of Cladocera was observed in three of the lakes. In two of these, where seasonal development was studied in both the clearwater and the turbid state, spring peaks were lower during the clearwater state. 5. Predation, low food availability or a combination of both may explain the low zooplankton densities. Phytoplankton may be limited by low phosphorus availability in the lakes dominated by Charophyta. Our results indicate that the importance of zooplankton grazing may have minor importance for the maintenance of the clearwater state in lakes with dense, well-established submerged vegetation.																			0046-5070					JUN	2000	44	2					185	197		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00552.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00552.x													WOS:000087864300001

The calculated values (mean +/- SE) of the exponent b ranged from 2.117 +/- 0.116 to 3.550 +/- 0.104 (global mean +/- SE: 3.044 +/- 0.066), with 87% of the observed b values of the species / lake combinations lying within the expected range of 2.5-3.5. For five out of the 17 species examined, the L-W parameters are given for the first time. The comparison of the b values for the common species among lakes revealed significant differences (p < 0.05) for Carassius gibelio and Perca fluviatilis. Moreover, significant differences (p < 0.05) were extracted after comparing the b values among different seasons for the most abundant species, and especially between spring and summer, indicating differences related with the beginning of the spawning period.

Analysis of magnetic susceptibility (MS), total organic carbon, carbonate content, grain size and geochemical parameters indicate that the region was dominated by an extremely dry climate during similar to 17.0-15.82ka, accompanying large-scale desert expansion in the last glacial maximum (LGM). Subsequently, the climate became generally dry during 15.82-14.6ka, an interval in which loess rapidly accumulated. Enhanced humidity occurred at 14.6ka, probably associated with increased strength of the East Asian summer monsoon. The region experienced slightly decreased moisture at around 6.5 and 5.8ka. After 2.7ka, the climate became wetter. This interpretation correlates with climatic records from lacustrine and aeolian deposits in the NETP during the LGM, the last deglaciation and the early-middle Holocene. High climatic moisture in the Late Holocene facilitated the formation of a well-developed palaeosol in the NETP. The effective moisture change in the Gonghe Basin is not simply ascribed to the influences of Asian summer monsoons; instead, it was possibly influenced by the interaction of evaporation and monsoonal precipitation forced by solar insolation variation. The balance between these variables was very influential on the effective moisture change in the closed inland basin of the NETP. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

During this period, bears segregate by age and sex classes into different habitats. We investigated habitat selection using the locations of 1,131 captures made from 1966 to 1994. Adult males, the most dominant bears, were found most often in coastal areas, especially on beach ridges. This enables them to keep cool during summer and move little while fasting until freeze-up, thereby conserving stored energy reserves. Lone adult females and females accompanied by dependent young moved inland during the ice-free period and selected riparian, lakeshore, and lichen tundra habitats. We conclude that avoiding adult males, thermoregulation, and suitable denning habitat are the most important factors causing adult females to move to the inland areas and to select habitats once there. Subadult females were distributed through all habitat types while subadult male distribution paralleled adult males. Production of berries, as a potential food source, probably does not influence inland distribution.																					0-944740-07-3				1998	10						243	250																WOS:000080892300031
J	Jin, LY; Chen, FH; Morrill, C; Otto-Bliesner, BL; Rosenbloom, N				Jin, Liya; Chen, Fahu; Morrill, Carrie; Otto-Bliesner, Bette L.; Rosenbloom, Nan			Causes of early Holocene desertification in arid central Asia	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												Paleoclimate records of effective moisture (precipitation minus evaporation, or P-E) show a dry (low effective moisture) period in mid-latitude arid/semi-arid central Asia during the early Holocene (11,000-8,000 years ago) relative to the middle and late Holocene, in contrast to evidence for greater-than-present precipitation at the same time in the south and east Asian monsoonal areas. To investigate the spatial differences in climate response over mid-latitude central Asia and monsoonal Asia we conducted a series of simulations with the Community Climate System Model version 3 coupled climate model for the early, middle and late Holocene. The simulations test the climatic impact of all important forcings for the early Holocene, including changes in orbital parameters, the presence of the remnant Laurentide ice sheet and deglacial freshening of the North Atlantic. Model results clearly show the early Holocene patterns indicated by proxy records, including both the decreased effective moisture in arid central Asia, which occurs in the model primarily during the winter months, and the increase in summer monsoon precipitation in south and east Asia. The model results suggest that dry conditions in the early Holocene in central Asia are closely related to decreased water vapor advection due to reduced westerly wind speed and less evaporation upstream from the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas in boreal winter. As an extra forcing to the early Holocene climate system, the Laurentide ice sheet and meltwater fluxes have a substantial cooling effect over high latitudes, especially just over and downstream of the ice sheets, but contribute only to a small degree to the early Holocene aridity in central Asia. Instead, most of the effective moisture signal can be explained by orbital forcing decreasing the early Holocene latitudinal temperature gradient and wintertime surface temperature. We find little evidence for regional subsidence related to a stronger summer Asian monsoon in forcing early Holocene aridity in central Asia, as has been previously hypothesized.

On many fans base level is stable, but where base-level change occurs it may itself be a response to tectonics or climatic change. Tectonically induced base-level change will be temporally independent of climatic change, and will show spatial variability depending on the rate of propagation of tectonically induced regional dissection. This is illustrated by the Tabemas fans, southeast Spain. The timing of climatically induced base-level change follows the timing of climatic change itself, and will show more consistency of spatial relationships within groups of fans affected. Alluvial fans which toe out in coastal zones or at lake shorelines may be influenced by climatically controlled base-level changes. Conventionally, a fall in base level would be expected to cause dissection of the distal fan zone. However, the reverse may occur, with fan progradation taking place in response to a base-level fall, and dissection occurring in response to a base-level rise. Two contrasted case studies are considered, based in part on previously published work, from dry-region alluvial fan zones, the coastal Cabo de Gata fans in southeast Spain and the Stillwater and Cold Springs fans in Nevada, USA. In these areas, base-level changes occurred in response to late Quaternary eustatic changes of sea level, and changes in the levels of pluvial lakes, respectively. Within both areas there are fans not affected by base-level change (Cabo de Gata, west-coast and inland fans; Cold Springs fans), and others where base-level change has been important in fan evolution (Cabo de Gata, east-coast fans; Stillwater fans). The differences in geomorphic regime between those fans influenced by base-level changes and those not are expressed in morphometric contrasts and different fan profile and plan characteristics. Within those fans influenced by base-level changes, the different mechanisms have influenced the location and elevation of the zone of incision. The differences can be attributed in part to the temporal interactions of base-level change with climatically induced changes in sediment supply, and in part to differences in gradients of the foreshore exposed by the falling sea or lake base levels.

Here, we investigate the N cycling processes in the water column of a seasonal stratified lake influenced by benthic processes in Southern Germany (Fohnsee) during the development of the vertical redox stratification between April and September. Concentration profiles and stable isotope compositions of NO3- and NH4+ together with numerical modeling and quantification of the hydrazine synthase gene (hzsB) and nitrite reductase (nirK and nirS) genes were used to identify the predominant nitrogen-transformation processes at lake Fohnsee throughout the spring and summer periods. Water chemistry data, quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis and increases of delta N-15 and delta O-18 values of nitrate from 7.0 parts per thousand to 41.0 parts per thousand and 2.0 parts per thousand to 28.0 parts per thousand, respectively, showed that nitrate reduction to nitrite and NO occurs in an upward moving zone of the water column from June to September following the displacement of the oxycline caused by thermal stratification. We also observed an increase in delta N-15 of ammonium from 15 parts per thousand to 28 parts per thousand in the anoxic water column. Modeling results suggest that this shift in delta N-15-NH4+ is predominantly controlled by mixing between ammonium stemming from the oxic water column with delta N-15 values of 25 parts per thousand and ammonium that is likely formed in the lake sediments by oxidation of organic matter with delta N-15 values of 11 parts per thousand. Observed gene abundances (hzsB, nirK, and nirS) in lake water samples collected in June and July indicated the co-occurrence of nitrate reduction and low rates of anammox, while the presence of sulfide in August and September may have inhibited the activity of anammox bacteria near the sulfate-reduction zone at the lake bottom. This study revealed temporal and spatial (e.g., depth dependent) variations in the dominant N-transformation processes in the investigated lake.

J	BERGER, GW				BERGER, GW			THE USE OF GLASS FOR DATING VOLCANIC ASH BY THERMOLUMINESCENCE	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												The development of a new physical dating method for late Pleistocene tephrochronometry is described here. Tests of laboratory procedures applied to glass from independently dated samples show that the thermoluminescence (TL), additive-dose dating method can yield accurate ages for both proximal and distal tephra from a few hundred years to at least 400 ka. The technique involves purification of 4- to 11-mu-m glass by heavy liquid centrifugation, pre-TL readout heating at 50-degrees-75-degrees-C for 8 days, and careful regression analysis of TL growth curves. Several unknown-age tephra are dated directly by this method for the first time.

The tripton collected was analyzed for 3 major components: carbonate, siliceous matter and organic matter. The allochthonous flux of particulate matter to the lake was estimated on the basis of measurements of suspended matter and discharge of the Aare River, the major inflowing stream. Literature values for primary production were used to estimate autochthonous organic matter production. Formation of biogenic carbonate was estimated from data for lake water chemistry. Tripton sedimentation shows 3 annual maxima. A spring peak corresponds to alpine snowmelt floods and high particulate matter input by the Aare River. A midsummer peak is apparently related to phytoplankton production of organic matter, diatom frustules and biogenic carbonate. A late-fall peak occurs during the breakdown of the thermocline which apparently allows particulate matter trapped at the thermocline to settle out. The trapping of particulates is a phenomenon related to the inflow-induced circulation that predominates in the lake. Resuspension and transport of sediment during the winter months are suggested, at least at 1 station (Neuenstadt). Carbonate production appears to be controlled mainly by phytoplankton activity. Stable O and C isotope data for lake water, detrital and tripton carbonate suggest that about 50% of the tripton carbonate is of detrital origin. Sedimentation rates calculated from the sediment trap data give a rate of about 3.1 cm fresh sediment per yr. This value is about twice that obtained from radiometric dating of core samples.

P.), particularly vegetation zones, temperatures, precipitation and sea-level fluctuations. Annual mean temperature during that period was estimated at 1 degrees C higher than today for South China, 2 degrees C higher for the Changjiang River Valley, about 3 degrees C higher for North China, Northeast China and Northwest China and up to 4-5 degrees C higher for southern Qinghai-Xizang Plateau. Relative winter temperatures increased much more than average annual temperatures. The centennial-scale warming was accompanied by the expansion of summer monsoon and recession of winter cold currents as well as northward and westward shift of vegetation zones, Higher lake levels registered in all inland lakes of Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai and Xizang indicated that precipitation increased to a certain extent. The Holocene highest sea level in East China about 1-3 m higher than today, occurred within 6.5 and 5.0 kaB. P. and sea water covered coastal areas of about 7X10(4) km(2), which was the Holocene greatest scope of transpression.

Although this species is known for its ecological and economic impacts, there are still significant gaps in our knowledge of its ecophysiology. This is particularly true when its growth rate under natural conditions is considered. Using a photogrammetry-based approach, we assessed bivalve growth in Lake Geneva during different seasons and for a variety of habitats. Based on the recorded changes in maximum shell length analysed during the period of this study (winter and spring 2023-2024), we measured average growth rates ranging from 0.142 +/- 0.099 mm day-1 for individuals smaller than 10 mm to 0.089 +/- 0.071 mm day-1 for larger individuals. The size class-dependent growth rate was analysed on the basis of the time of year, the type of environment (depth, substrate) or, again, the temperature. Our results reveal that the growth rate, obtained in situ and without manipulation, primarily depends on size and is independent of temperature or habitat within the studied range. This growth capacity in Lake Geneva is the highest found to date and is likely to explain the invasion success of this species.

Of them, 59 samples (2.9%) were found to be positive. RT-PCR positive samples were examined with the same method with respect to H5N1 and 4 samples (6.8%) were found to be positive. RT-PCR positive 59 samples were inoculated in Embryonated Chicken Egg (ECE) and AI type A virus was isolated from 12 samples (20.3%). Of the isolates, 3 were typed as H1N7,2 as H11N9 and 1 as H8N4 with Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) and Neuraminidase Inhibition (NI) tests. About 4 isolates obtained from winter visitor Anas cylpeata which had been determined as H5N1 by RT-PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis, gave positive reaction by HI test both with H1 and H5 antisera and all were typed as N1 by NI-test. Feces samples found to be positive by RT-PCR belonged to avian species Anseriformes, Charadriiformes, Passeriformes, Gruiformes and Phoenicopteriformes orders. The highest positivity was determined in winter visitor Anas acuta (37.1%) and Anas penelope (22.5%) ducks.

J	Xue, ZL; Zhao, SM; Zhang, B				Xue, Zelong; Zhao, Shangmin; Zhang, Bin			Study on Soil Freeze-Thaw and Surface Deformation Patterns in the Qilian Mountains Alpine Permafrost Region Using SBAS-InSAR Technique	REMOTE SENSING												The Qilian Mountains, located on the northeastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, are characterized by unique high-altitude and cold-climate terrain, where permafrost and seasonally frozen ground are extensively distributed. In recent years, with global warming and increasing precipitation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, permafrost degradation has become severe, further exacerbating the fragility of the ecological environment. Therefore, timely research on surface deformation and the freeze-thaw patterns of alpine permafrost in the Qilian Mountains is imperative. This study employs Sentinel-1A SAR data and the SBAS-InSAR technique to monitor surface deformation in the alpine permafrost regions of the Qilian Mountains from 2017 to 2023. A method for spatiotemporal interpolation of ascending and descending orbit results is proposed to calculate two-dimensional surface deformation fields further. Moreover, by constructing a dynamic periodic deformation model, the study more accurately summarizes the regular changes in permafrost freeze-thaw and the trends in seasonal deformation amplitudes. The results indicate that the surface deformation time series in both vertical and east-west directions obtained using this method show significant improvements in accuracy over the initial data, allowing for a more precise reflection of the dynamic processes of surface deformation in the study area. Subsidence is predominant in permafrost areas, while uplift mainly occurs in seasonally frozen ground areas near lakes and streams. The average vertical deformation rate is 1.56 mm/a, with seasonal amplitudes reaching 35 mm. Topographical (elevation; slope gradient; aspect) and climatic factors (temperature; soil moisture; precipitation) play key roles in deformation patterns. The deformation of permafrost follows five distinct phases: summer thawing; warm-season stability; frost heave; winter cooling; and spring thawing. This study enhances our understanding of permafrost deformation characteristics in high-latitude and high-altitude regions, providing a reference for preventing geological disasters in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau area and offering theoretical guidance for regional ecological environmental protection and infrastructure safety.

The city of Winnipeg, the capital of the province of Manitoba in central Canada, was one of the first in North America to deal with a rapid presentation of large numbers of patients requiring critical care services resulting from pandemic (pH1N1) 2009 influenza-associated respiratory failure. Mexico City, Orlando, FL, and Salt Lake City, UT, were other Northern Hemisphere sites of heavy disease activity during the spring wave of the pandemic. This article is written in a narrative format that allows the reader to understand the problems (both major and mundane, anticipated and unexpected) experienced by healthcare workers in these sites during this pandemic. Descriptions cover a range of issues and difficulties that caused significant stress to the operations of intensive care units in these cities. We hope to offer some insight into potential pitfalls and problems that may be experienced by other centers and provide some potential approaches to addressing these issues.

J	Worm, J; Sondergaard, M				Worm, J; Sondergaard, M			Dynamics of heterotrophic bacteria attached to Microcystis spp. (Cyanobacteria)	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												We studied the ecology of heterotrophic bacteria attached to the mucilaginous colonies of Microcystis spp. (Cyanobacteria) in the eutrophic lake Frederiksborg Slotsso, Denmark. The succession in bacterial abundance, production and potential aminopeptidase activity in 20 mu m fractionated samples was followed during periods in which Microcystis dominated the phytoplankton. We operationally defined that nets of 20 mu m mesh-width segregated bacteria associated with Microcystis (Microcystis-associated bacteria, MB; 120 mu m size fraction) from the mainly fsee-living bacteria in the filtrate (FB, <20 mu m size fraction). According to this definition, the contribution of MB during summer 1995 and autumn 1994, respectively, averaged 10 +/- 4 (+/- standard deviation) and 37 +/- 12% of total bacterial biomass and 25 +/- 13 and 43 +/- 16% of total bacterial production, as estimated from thymidine (TdR) incorporation. During summer, MB further contributed 55 +/- 18% of total leucine incorporation measured at 600 nM leucine and 53 +/- 12% of total potential aminopeptidase activity. Although 20 mu m mesh-width nets also retained particles other than Microcystis, our results indicate that Microcystis was a 'hotspot' for bacterial activity, comparable to larger aggregates known as marine or lake snow. During summer, growth rate and specific aminopeptidase activity of MB generally exceeded those of FB, which points to diversified microenvironments or species compositions. In order to balance gain and loss rates within the community of MB, we hypothesize that a large fraction of MB produced were exported from Microcystis to the surrounding water, only modified by the loss due to viral lysis. This idea arose from reported low loss rates of Microcystis and continuous measures indicating that a surplus of more than 70% of MB production (TdR) was not reflected as biomass increases within the community of MB. According to this hypothesis Microcystis may be considered as a bacterial 'incubator' for the surrounding water.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				JAN 2	1998	14	1					19	28		10.3354/ame014019	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame014019													WOS:000071212600003
J	Wright, RF; Schindler, DW				Wright, RF; Schindler, DW			Interaction of acid rain and global changes: Effects on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION					5th International Conference on Acidic Deposition - Science and Policy: Acid Reign 95	JUN 26-30, 1995	GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN	Swedish Environm Protect Agcy, Swedish Environm Res Inst, Provincial Govt Goteborg, Provincial Govt Bohus Ian				Both acid deposition and changes in the global atmosphere and climate affect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In the atmosphere sulphate aerosols tend to increase haze, altering the global radiation balance. Increased nitrogen deposition to N-limited systems such as boreal forests results in increased growth and increased sequestration of atmospheric CO2, slowing the increase in CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Future reduction in S and N emissions may result in a trade-off - better with respect to some effects of acid deposition and greenhouse warming, but worse with respect to others. Global warming may cause the incidence and severity of drought to increase. Mineralisation of N and oxidation of organic S compounds release pulses of SO4, acid and Al to surface waters. Effects in lakes may include reduced deep water refugia for cold stenotherms, lower nutrient concentrations, and greater penetration of harmful UV radiation. Longer water renewal times cause declines in SO4 and NO3, due to increased in situ removal, but increases in base cations. The net result is increased internal alkalinity production. In areas characterised by cold winters, global warming may result in a major shift in hydrologic cycle, with snowmelt episodes occurring during the winter rather than the typical pattern of accumulation in the winter and melting in the spring. Increased storm frequency predicted for the future will cause increased frequency and severity of sea salt episodes in coastal regions. Predicting the interactions of regional and global environmental factors in the coming decades poses new challenges to scientists, managers and policy-makers.

The total annual days of ice-affected flow decreased significantly (p < 0.1) over the 20th century at 12 of the 16 rivers. On average, for the nine longest-record rivers, the total annual days of ice-affected flow decreased by 20 days from 1936 to 2000, with most of the decrease occurring from the 1960s to 2000. Four of the 16 rivers had significantly later first dates of ice-affected flow in the fall. Twelve of the 16 rivers had significantly earlier last dates of ice-affected flow in the spring. On average, the last dates became earlier by 11 days from 1936 to 2000 with most of the change occurring from the 1960s to 2000. The total annual days of ice-affected flow were significantly correlated with November through April air temperatures (r = -0.70) and with November through April precipitation (r = -0.52). The last spring dates were significantly correlated with March through April air temperatures (r = -0.73) and with January through April precipitation (r = -0.37). March mean river flows increased significantly at 13 of the 16 rivers in this study.

In early summer the number of young-of-the-year, YOY, pikeperch in stomach contents of older conspecifics positively correlated with density of juveniles in the pelagic zone. In two years (1994, 1997), when high density of YOY pikeperch (0.6 and 0.8 individual per m(3), respectively) was observed, more than seven juvenile pikeperch per stomach of older conspecifics were found. In years of low reproductive success of pikeperch (0.05 YOY per m(3)), the average number of juvenile pikeperch in stomachs of predatory conspecifics was below 1. The strong density-dependent predation resulted in a sharp decline of YOY pikeperch toward late summer. Cannibalistic pressure was also observed among YOY pikeperch. In the reservoir, juvenile cohorts displayed a bimodal size distribution in early summer. Small (zooplanktivorous) individuals served as a food for bigger (piscivorous) pikeperch. During shortages of alternative food (perch, cyprinids), cannibalism by YOY from the upper modal group may enhance their recruitment, at the cost of small juveniles (low winter survival). As an effect of this cannibalistic self-regulation, long-term stabilisation of pikeperch year-class strength has been observed.

Energy and carbon fluxes from an oil sands pit lake	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Currently, post-mining landscape plans in the Athabasca Oil Sand Region include large watersheds terminating in pit lakes. In 2012, Base Mine Lake (BML), was constructed with the aim of demonstrating technologies associated with lake reclamation in the region. This paper examines the first 6.5 years of lake-atmosphere energy and carbon exchange. Energetically, BML behaved similar to other northern lakes, storing large quantities of heat in the spring and releasing it in the fall as sensible and latent heat fluxes. At various times a hydrocarbon sheen formed on the lake, which may have suppressed evaporation. However, simple linear relationships failed to statistically quantify the impacts and more comprehensive modelling of the variability may be required. At daily scales, variability in evaporation was well explained by the product of vapour pressure deficit and wind speed as well as the available energy (R-2 = 0.74), while sensible heat was explained by the product of wind speed and the difference in air and surface temperature as well as available energy (R-2 = 0.85). Spring CH4 fluxes were high, particularly around ice melt, with a maximum flux of 3.3 g m(-2) day(-1). Otherwise fluxes were low, except during irregular periods. The peak flux of these periods occurred following similar to 58 h of continuously falling pressure, relating cyclone activity to these large periods of methane emissions. Annually, CO2 and CH4 fluxes were initially high, with median fluxes of 231 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) and 23 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in 2014. However, the median fluxes reduced quickly and over the least three years of the study (2017 through 2019) the median fluxes declined to 36 mg CO2 m(-2) h(-1) and 10 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). Overall, BML behaves similar to other boreal lake ecosystems with above average carbon fluxes compared to other constructed reservoirs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.						Clark, M.

Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in large shallow eutrophic lakes are susceptible to local meteorological conditions, but their response to climate system variability is rarely considered. This study reveals that HABs in Lake Taihu, the third largest freshwater lake in subtropical China, are promoted by the weakened East Asian monsoon system in precursory early winter, but show no response in late winter with the low temperature unfavorable for algal metabolism. The weak early winter monsoon system is characterized as the northward-shifted polar front jet and eastward-tilted East Asian Trough. The accompanied anomalous descending motion decelerates surface winds over the middle to lower reaches of the Yangtze River including Taihu basin by strengthening atmospheric stratification and decreasing turbulent activity in the lower troposphere. The weakened surface winds reduce sediment resuspension and improve underwater light availability in Lake Taihu, providing favorable light condition for phytoplankton growth. It is indicated that the early-winter surface winds rather than simultaneous nutrient supply, play a dominant role on the interannual variability of algal biomass in Lake Taihu. The positive algal biomass anomaly in early winter tends to persist and promote HABs in the following warmer seasons.

Historical landscape change in Cappadocia (central Turkey): a palaeoecological investigation of annually laminated sediments from Nar lake	HOLOCENE												Coupled multiproxy indicators (pollen, stable isotopes and charcoal) reconstructed from annually laminated lake sediments from Nar Golu in Cappadocia (central Turkey) complemented by documentary and archaeological evidence provide a detailed record of environmental changes and their causes from late Antiquity (AD 300) to the present day. Stable isotope data indicate marked shifts in the variability in summer drought intensity and winter-spring rainfall, but these did not coincide in time with changes in vegetation and land use shown by pollen data. Rather, human impacts appear to have been the main driver of landscape ecological changes in Cappadocia over the last two millennia. Pollen and charcoal data indicate four principal land-use phases: (i) an early Byzantine agrarian landscape characterized by cereals and tree crops, and marking the later part of the so-called Beysehir Occupation phase; (ii) a period of landscape abandonment and the establishment of secondary woodland from AD 670 to 950 coinciding with the Arab invasions of Anatolia and marking the transition from late Antiquity to the middle Byzantine period; (iii) the re-establishment of cereal-based agriculture and pastoralism from c. AD 950, with this cultural landscape being maintained through the Byzantine 'Golden Age', the Seljuk and Ottoman Empires; and (iv) agricultural intensification during the late Ottoman era and the Turkish Republic (AD 1830 to present). Charcoal fluxes indicate that prior to the twentieth century, landscape burning was most frequent at times of diminished human impact when fuel biomass increased. Pollen and historical data show remarkably close agreement in terms of the timing of landscape change, and the former suggest that rural cultural traditions were able to survive largely intact through short-lived periods of sociopolitical dislocation such as the sixth century Justinian plague and the thirteenth century Mongol invasions.

The Tibetan Plateau itself is a prominent topographic feature that exerts major control on regional atmospheric circulation. Previous compilations of meteorological data and documentary sources suggest that western China, and the Tibetan Plateau in particular, is highly sensitive to anthropogenically induced climate change. Temperature increases appear to be greatest at higher altitudes: moreover, precipitation variations seem to have been marked, although spatially complex. The region contains a wealth of information about past climate derived from instrumental, documentary and proxy sources although meteorological time series are generally too short to capture the full range of recent climatic variability. Documentary and proxy sources are therefore important. We review studies of climate change in western China for the past two millennia. Documentary records are complemented by proxy data from ice cores, tree rings, lake sediments, groundwater profiles and glacial geomorphology. Although general patterns of change can be identified, proxy records of past climate are often semi-quantitative at best, open to alternative interpretations and sometimes poorly dated. Despite evidence for marked variations in climate over the past 2000 years, changes during the 20th century, especially in temperature, may have been unprecedented. The density of data points over western China is currently too low for spatial patterns to be identified, especially in precipitation variation. However, there does seem to have been an increase in warming with altitude over the most recent past. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

Response of water temperatures and stratification to changing climate in three lakes with different morphometry	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Water temperatures and stratification are important drivers for ecological and water quality processes within lake systems, and changes in these with increases in air temperature and changes to wind speeds may have significant ecological consequences. To properly manage these systems under changing climate, it is important to understand the effects of increasing air temperatures and wind speed changes in lakes of different depths and surface areas. In this study, we simulate three lakes that vary in depth and surface area to elucidate the effects of the observed increasing air temperatures and decreasing wind speeds on lake thermal variables (water temperature, stratification dates, strength of stratification, and surface heat fluxes) over a century (19112014). For all three lakes, simulations showed that epilimnetic temperatures increased, hypolimnetic temperatures decreased, the length of the stratified season increased due to earlier stratification onset and later fall overturn, stability increased, and longwave and sensible heat fluxes at the surface increased. Overall, lake depth influences the presence of stratification, Schmidt stability, and differences in surface heat flux, while lake surface area influences differences in hypolimnion temperature, hypolimnetic heating, variability of Schmidt stability, and stratification onset and fall overturn dates. Larger surface area lakes have greater wind mixing due to increased surface momentum. Climate perturbations indicate that our larger study lakes have more variability in temperature and stratification variables than the smaller lakes, and this variability increases with larger wind speeds. For all study lakes, Pearson correlations and climate perturbation scenarios indicate that wind speed has a large effect on temperature and stratification variables, sometimes greater than changes in air temperature, and wind can act to either amplify or mitigate the effect of warmer air temperatures on lake thermal structure depending on the direction of local wind speed changes.

Vegetation, climate and human impact since 20 ka in central Yunnan Province based on high-resolution pollen and charcoal records from Dianchi, southwestern China	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												High-resolution pollen and charcoal records from Dianchi in central Yunnan Province, southwestern China are presented in this study and reveal variations in vegetation, fire, lake environments, and climate over the last 20,000 years (20 ka). The results show that the climate during the period 20.0-18.0 ka was relatively cold, and rainfall in winter and early spring was relatively lower than the present, which belongs to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) . After 18.0 ka, the temperature increased gradually, indicating the onset of deglacial warming in central Yunnan Province, though the mean annual temperature before 10.8 ka was still at least 1.5 degrees C lower than today. The climate began to obviously warm from similar to 10.8 ka and was at least 2 degrees C higher than today and relatively humid between 10.0 and 5.4 ka, denoting the early-Holocene Thermal Maximum. A major vegetation change around Dianchi occurred at similar to 5.4 ka and was most likely caused by the climate cooling and drying with no obvious evidence for cultivation activities except for some possible evidence of human fire use or selective deforestation from the pollen assemblage. Significant cultivation activities in Yunnan Province indicated by the first obvious increases in Poaceae (>40 mu m) and Poaceae (25-40 mu m) pollen percentages began at similar to 2.4 ka. In central Yunnan Province, there was a continuous deglacial warming that occurred between 18.0 and 12.5 ka without marked interruption during the interval of Heinrich Event 1 (H1). Additionally, the Holocene Thermal Maximum occurred in the early Holocene. The results from this study are different from the western region of southwestern China where the paleoclimate studies have clearly detected the H1, the B/A, and the YD events, and revealed a mid-Holocene climatic optimum.

Recent studies indicate the potential for rapid plankton shifts as short-term response to storm events and highlight the need for high-frequency methods to understand these complex processes. Here, we studied the effects of a strong short-term pulse of ammonium nitrate in a eutrophic temperate river that elevated nitrate-N concentrations from 3.1 to 10-55 mg L-1. An intense phytoplankton bloom increased chlorophyll a concentrations from below 10 mu g L-1 to over 140 mu g L-1 despite of high background N concentrations and followed the N-pulse downstream. High-throughput sequencing revealed the temporal dynamics of the bacterial (16S rRNA gene) and microeukaryotic (18S rRNA gene) community throughout the event. Bacterial and microeukaryotic community richness was reduced, and community composition changed significantly during the bloom. Few microeukaryote taxa (e.g., Cyclotella meneghiniana, Chlamydomonas) dominated the bloom and replaced the rich summer phytoplankton community. Long-term monitoring data (2008-2016) using classical microscope analyses showed that seasonal shifts in phytoplankton community composition were linked to physical parameters and nutrient availability with P-limitation observed in spring but not in summer. We conclude that a disturbance in abiotic and biotic control factors, such as caused by a nutrient pulse, can induce structural shifts in the microplankton community leading to a phytoplankton bloom, even in eutrophic waters.

J	Luoto, TP; Helama, S; Nevalainen, L				Luoto, Tomi P.; Helama, Samuli; Nevalainen, Liisa			Stream flow intensity of the Saavanjoki River, eastern Finland, during the past 1500 years reflected by mayfly and caddisfly mandibles in adjacent lake sediments	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Climate-change projections suggest altered precipitation, temperature, and hydrological patterns for the near future. To better understand these future changes, long-term evidence from paleoarchives is necessary to determine the natural variability and climate relations in surficial hydrology. In this study, we aim to demonstrate that distribution of sedimentary mouthparts (mandibles) of aquatic mayfly (Ephemeroptera) and caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae are dependent on stream conditions and this relationship can be used in paleohydrological studies to reconstruct past changes in stream flow. The results from a river-lake continuum in eastern Finland showed that the surface sediment accumulation of mayfly and caddisfly mandibles was strongly related to stream flow with highest abundances found from the riverine sediments. A sediment core taken from the deep basin of the lake revealed mandible accumulation patterns that correlated with a previous independent paleohydrological reconstruction. We interpret that the primary forcer for mandible deposition to lake sediments is spring floods caused by snow melt, and hence the mandible accumulation, represents amount of winter precipitation. Subsequently, the results indicated strong stream flow and wet winters during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and weaker stream flow and dry winters during and after the Little Ice Age (LIA). This wintertime reconstruction contrasts the general summertime trends of dry MCA and wet LIA. The present results confirm the usability of mayfly and caddisfly mandibles in paleohydrological studies and provide evidence for past hydrological dynamics that can be valuable when addressing the potential magnitude of future changes.

No similarity of dynamics curves in different years and generations was observed. Three types of subisolates with different numbers dynamics and with potentially high, medium, and low progeny return at optimal life conditions were distinguished. The data on numbers and biomass dynamics in populations supply insufficient information for final estimation of all regulation factors. Hence, dependence of numbers and biomass of parents-progeny at subpopulation level should be studied on the basis of joint data on numbers and biomass dynamics in different years and populations for estimation of regulating factors.																			0044-4596					MAY-JUN	1988	49	3					318	332																WOS:A1988N695300003

Increasing crop rotation diversity with overwintering cover crops can support ecological processes that maintain productivity while improving multiple ecosystem functions, including nutrient retention. We conducted a mixed-methods study to understand how financial incentive programs impact transitions to cover cropping in Michigan. Michigan farms span a wide range of soil types, climate conditions, and cropping systems that create opportunities for cover crop adoption in the state. We tested the relationship between Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) payments for cover crops and cover crop adoption between 2008-2019, as measured by remote sensing. We coupled this quantitative analysis with interviews with 21 farmers in the Lake Erie watershed to understand farmers' perspectives on how incentive programs could support greater cover crop adoption. Panel fixed effects regressions showed that EQIP increased winter cover crop presence. Every EQIP dollar for cover crops was associated with a 0.01 hectare increase in winter cover, while each hectare enrolled in an EQIP contract for cover crops was associated with a 0.86-0.93 hectare increase in winter cover. In semi-structured interviews, farmers reported that financial incentives were instrumental to cover crop adoption, but that program outcomes fall short of intended goals due to policy design problems that may limit widespread participation and effectiveness. Thus, strengthening EQIP and related conservation programs could support broader transitions to diversified farming systems that are more sustainable and resilient.

Atmospheric Anomaly Bioindicators in Peat Sections on the Eastern Macroslope of the Sikhote-Alin Range in the Late Holocene	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PACIFIC GEOLOGY												The studies of peat stratigraphy in the upper reaches of the Milogradovka River made it possible to reconstruct changes in humidity as a source of moisture in the Sikhote-Alin middle mountains over the last 3400 years. High-resolution reconstructions were based on the biostratigraphic analyses (botanic and diatom) data; the ash content of peat was also studied. Radiocarbon dating of the events was carried out using an age-depth model. B-Tm cryptotephra of the Baitoushan caldera-forming volcano was found in the upper part of the section; it was identified from the volcanic glass chemical composition. Long-term rains are assumed to have caused a massive landslide with the formation of a dam and a shallow reservoir turned the river valley into a bog. The bioindicators of humidity variations in the river valley and of flood events were determined. The events were correlated with the data on the main watershed of the Sikhote-Alin Range, mountainous plateaus, lakes on the slopes of the ancient Solontsovsky Volcano, and the eastern Primorye coast. The peat section in the valley recorded the hydrological changes related to the nature of cyclogenesis in more detail. Paleoevents and large-scale atmospheric circulation anomalies were revealed to be interrelated. Long-term dry phases under global cooling were accompanied by the East Asia aridization caused by a slacking of the East Asian summer monsoon. According to the study results, floods occurred in the summer-autumn period even during dry phases. The flooding phases were related to the summer monsoon activation, as well as to more intensive cyclogenesis. The most complicated climate rhythmicity was established for the last 1340 years.

J	Stevens, LR; Wright, HE; Ito, E				Stevens, LR; Wright, HE; Ito, E			Proposed changes in seasonality of climate during the Lateglacial and Holocene at Lake Zeribar, Iran	HOLOCENE												Calcareous sediments spanning the last 13 ka from Lake Zeribar, western Iran, were sampled for stable-isotope analysis as a means of augmenting earlier climatic interpretations based on pollen and macrofossils. The Lateglacial. period was cold and dry, supporting semi-desert vegetation and highly concentrated lake water. Low evaporation rates due to the cold resulted in long residence times and high lake stands. During the early Holocene, the upland vegetation changed to a pistachio-oak savanna as low temperatures and aridity ameliorated. Lake level dropped in response to increased evapotranspiration. The low oxy.-en-isotope values of lacustrine calcite during this period are interpreted as a relative increase in the contribution of winter moisture rather than overall changes in effective moisture. A gradual increase in oak pollen at similar to7 ka BP signalled the increase in effective moisture to levels similar to those of today. At the same time the delta O-18 values increased, reflecting a greater percentage of O-18-enriched spring rains. Modem values and seasonal distribution of precipitation were established by 6 ka BP. A short-lived return to winter-only precipitation occurred at similar to4.5 ka BP and resulted in a temporary increase in aridity. The covariance among delta C-13, carbonate deposition and delta O-18 values suggests that lake productivity is linked to these seasonal climatic changes.

Year-round presence of neonicotinoid insecticides in tributaries to the Great Lakes, USA	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												To better characterize the transport of neonicotinoid insecticides to the world's largest freshwater ecosystem, monthly samples (October 2015 September 2016) were collected from 10 major tributaries to the Great Lakes, USA. For the monthly tributary samples, neonicotinoids were detected in every month sampled and five of the six target neonicotinoids were detected. At least one neonicotinoid was detected in 74% of the monthly samples with up to three neonicotinoids detected in an individual sample (10% of all samples). The most frequently detected neonicotinoid was imidacloprid (53%), followed by clothianidin (44%), thiamethoxam (22%), acetamiprid (2%), and dinotefuran (1%). Thiacloprid was not detected in any samples. The maximum concentration for an individual neonicotinoid was 230 ng L-1 and the maximum total neonicotinoids in an individual sample was 400 ng L-1. The median detected individual neonicotinoid concentrations ranged from non-detect to 10 ng L-1. The detections of clothianidin and thiamethoxam significantly increased as the percent of cultivated crops in the basins increased (p = 0.73, P = .01; p = 0.66, P = .04, respectively). In contrast, imidacloprid detections significantly increased as the percent of the urbanization in the basins increased (p = 0.66, P = .03). Neonicotinoid concentrations generally increased in spring through summer coinciding with the planting of neonicotinoid-treated seeds and broadcast applications of neonicotinoids. More spatially intensive samples were collected in an agriculturally dominated basin (8 sites along the Maumee River, Ohio) twice during the spring, 2016 planting season to provide further information on neonicotinoid inputs to the Great Lakes. Three neonicotinoids were ubiquitously detected (clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiamethoxam) in all water samples collected within this basin. Maximum individual neonicotinoid concentrations was 330 ng L-1 and maximum total neonicotinoid concentration was 670 ng L-1; median detected individual neonicotinoid concentrations were 7.0 to 39 ng L-1.

J	Lang, C; Tao, S; Zhang, G; Fu, J; Simonich, S				Lang, Chang; Tao, Shu; Zhang, Gang; Fu, Jiamo; Simonich, Staci			Outflow of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from Guangdong, Southern China	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												The atmospheric outflow of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)from Guangdong, China, a region of high PAH emission, was modeled using a potential receptor influence function (PRIF) probabilistic model which was based on a spatially resolved PAH inventory and air mass forward-trajectory calculations. Photochemical degradation and deposition (dry and wet) of PAHs during atmospheric transport were taken into consideration. On average, 48% of the PAHs (by mass) remained in the atmosphere for a transport period of 5 days, staying within the boundary of the source region. The medium molecular weight PAHs (four rings) were predicted to travel longer distances in the atmosphere than the low (three rings) or high molecular weight PAHs (five rings) because they are less photodegradable than the lower molecular weight, gas-phase PAHs and less likely to undergo wet and dry depositions than the higher molecular weight, particulate phase PAHs. Under the strong influence of the East Asian monsoons in winter, the predominant outflow pattern of PAHs from Guangdong was to the South China Sea and Southeast Asian countries. In summer, PAHs were transported primarily to northern mainland China. Under particular weather conditions in winter, the PAH-containing air masses were lifted by cold fronts or convection and transported toward the Pacific Ocean by westerly winds.

J	FRIE, RV; SPANGLER, GR				FRIE, RV; SPANGLER, GR			DYNAMICS OF RAINBOW SMELT DURING AND AFTER EXPLOITATION IN SOUTH BAY, LAKE HURON	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We examined population dynamics of rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax in South Bay of Lake Huron during intensive fishing of the spring spawning runs (1948-1957) and after exploitation was stopped (1958-1970). Modal ages of spawning rainbow smelt changed from 2 to 3 during the intensive fishing period to 3 and 4 after 1959. Percentage males in the spawning run samples from dip nets increased from 60% (1950-1957) to 78% (1958-1964). Percentage males in summer samples from gill nets increased from 39% to 50% between the same periods. Total annual mortality rate averaged 90% during exploitation and 67% after fishing stopped. Instantaneous natural mortality rate during 1948-1970 was estimated as 1.1. Relative stock sizes, estimated from cohort analysis, sharply increased after 1957; an extremely large 1960 year-class caused a peak in 1962. Growth of rainbow smelt to age 1 and to age 2 was decreasing while their own abudance and that of alewives Alosa pseudoharengus were increasing. Growth after age 2 was independent of abundance of 1-year-olds and total stock. Average fish growth for each cohort declined and abundance of 1-year-olds increased during and after exploitation, but growth slowed more rapidly after 1960 and greater numbers of 1-year-olds fluctuated more widely. Lengths at capture were much greater during 1948-1957 during 1966-1970. Total abundance of rainbow smelt in South Bay increased and growth declined during exploitation because the stock was expanding to a carrying capacity not yet reached after a severe die-off in winter 1942-1943. We suggest that immigration of spawners into South Bay from a discrete stock in Lake Huron, and relatively faster growth to maturity, allowed the population to withstand the fishing pressure.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1985	114	5					713	724		10.1577/1548-8659(1985)114<713:DORSDA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1985)114<713:DORSDA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1985ASG8500005

Otolith trace element and stable isotopic compositions differentiate fishes from the Middle Mississippi River, its tributaries, and floodplain lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Naturally occurring stable isotope and trace elemental markers in otoliths have emerged as powerful tools for determining natal origins and environmental history of fishes in a variety of marine and freshwater environments. However, few studies have examined the applicability of this technique in large river-floodplain ecosystems. This study evaluated otolith microchemistry and stable isotopic composition as tools for determining environmental history of fishes in the Middle Mississippi River, its tributaries, and floodplain lakes in Illinois and Missouri, USA. Fishes were collected from 14 sites and water samples obtained from 16 sites during summer and fall 2006 and spring 2007. Otolith and water samples were analyzed for stable oxygen isotopic composition (delta O-18) and concentrations of a suite of trace elements; otoliths were also analyzed for carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13). Tributaries, floodplain lakes, and the Mississippi and Lower Missouri Rivers possessed distinct isotopic and elemental signatures that were reflected in fish otoliths. Fish from tributaries on the Missouri and Illinois sides of the middle Mississippi River could also be distinguished from one another by their elemental and isotopic fingerprints. Linear discriminant function analysis of otolith chemical signatures indicated that fish could be classified back to their environment of capture (Mississippi River, floodplain lake, tributary on the Illinois or Missouri side of the Mississippi River, or lower Missouri River) with 71-100% accuracy. This study demonstrates the potential applicability of otolith microchemistry and stable isotope analyses to determine natal origins and describe environmental history of fishes in the Middle Mississippi River, its tributaries, and floodplain lakes. The ability to reconstruct environmental history of individual fish using naturally occurring isotopic markers in otoliths may also facilitate efforts to quantify nutrient and energy subsidies to the Mississippi River provided by fishes that emigrate from floodplain lakes or tributaries.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2011	661	1					289	302		10.1007/s10750-010-0538-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0538-7													WOS:000285064900024

The shallow manmade lake is surrounded by residential development and used for recreation. Eutrophic conditions are addressed by alum and copper sulfate applications and aerators operating in the summer. In September 2005, arsenite was dominant in hypoxic to anoxic bottom water. Filterable As concentrations were about 1.6-2 times higher than those in the upper water column (23-25 mu g/L, mostly arsenate). Hypoxic/anoxic and near-neutral bottom conditions formed during the summer, but became more oxic and alkaline as winter approached. Acid-leachable As concentrations in lake-bed sediments ranged up to 694 mg/kg in highly organic material from the tops of sediment cores but were < 15 mg/kg in geologic substrate. During warm months, reduced As from the sediment diffuses into the water column and is oxidized; mixing by aerators, wind, and boat traffic spreads arsenate and metals, some in particulate form, throughout the water column. Similar levels of As in sediments of lakes treated with arsenic pesticides indicate that most of the As in Lake Mohawk probably derives from past use of arsenical pesticides, although records of applications are lacking. The annual loss of As at the lake outlet is only about 0.01% of the As calculated to be in the sediments, indicating that elevated levels of As in the lake will persist for decades.

They are inquiline commensals of the fresh water mussel H. menziesi (Gray) in Lake Taupo, New Zealand. The chironomid is univoltine and dependent on seasonal growth of the mussel shell for its pupation and adult emergence. The 1st instar larva is probably a free-swimming, dispersal stage. Second instar larvae appeared in mussels between the outer surface of the mantle and the inner surface of the valve in later summer. They overwintered there as 3rd and 4th instars until spring when they were at the margin of the valve opposite the inhalent siphon where they pupated and left the host to emerge at the lake surface. Some mortality of 1st and 2nd instar larvae occurred since there was an average of 25.5 whole larvae buried in the nacre of each valve of the mussels.																			0952-8369	1469-7998					1978	186	NOV					331	334																WOS:A1978FX40100003

A ratio between the first winter and spring growth rates, inferred from scale circulus patterns, met the criteria of being both distict between wild and hatchery adults and consistent among life stages, years, and geographic locations within respective wild and hatchery groups. This rule was applied to samples of unknown-origin adult steelhead collected in seven rivers in the northwestern Lower Peninsula of Michigan during 1983-1984, to estimate the percentage of wild fish in each river and its variance. Adults returning during these periods were representative of pre-1983 hatchery production in Michigan, when yearling parr was the typical life stage stocked. The percentage of wild fish in the adult population was estimated to be 100% for an unstocked trout river, 93% for four stocked trout rivers, and 60% for two stocked marginal trout rivers. This method should be applicable in other regions with similar winter temperature regimes and, possibly, to other species that are reared a full year in a hatchery.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				SEP	1988	117	5					444	451		10.1577/1548-8659(1988)117<0444:IACOWA>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1988)117<0444:IACOWA>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1988U731300003
J	Micheletti, S; Schanz, F; Walsby, AE				Micheletti, S; Schanz, F; Walsby, AE			The daily integral of photosynthesis by Planktothrix rubescens during summer stratification and autumnal mixing in Lake Zurich	NEW PHYTOLOGIST												It has been suggested that the populations of planktonic cyanobacteria that occupy the metalimnion of stratified lakes during the summer months may be aestivating between the main periods of growth during entrainment in the epilimnion in spring and summer. We determined the vertical distribution of the biomass and daily integral of photosynthesis of the population of Planktothrix (Oscillatoria) rubescens in Lake Zurich for 136 d from July to November 1995. The population showed an 80-fold increase during the stratified period but it only doubled over the subsequent period of entrainment. During the first eight days, part of the increase was attributed to recruitment of filaments floating up from greater depths but all of the subsequent production could be accounted for by photoautotrophic growth. On sunny days the biomass-specific photosynthesis of this population reached some of the highest values over the whole period despite its depth (> 13 m). On very cloudy days, however, primary productivity was very low and on 4 days, when the mean depth of the population exceeded 15 m, there was no net production. Over the whole period of the study, the accumulated photosynthetic production exceeded the increase in biomass of the population by a factor of 9.5. Although much of this production occurred during the period of entrainment only a small proportion was translated into growth of the population. It is concluded that the growth that takes place in the period of stratification in the metalimnion is essential to subsequent production.																			0028-646X	1469-8137				JUN	1998	139	2					233	246		10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00196.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00196.x													WOS:000074664800002

Two species of Red Sea origin were investigated, Metapenaeus stebbingi and Trachypenaeus curvirostris; the former is by far the commoner. Both species displayed seasonal breeding over the period April to October, with peaks in the early and late parts of the season. M. stebbingi had two main cohorts each year. A spring-spawned cohort survived 16 mo, and attained modal sizes of 23 mm carapare length (CL) for females and 16 to 17 mm CL for males. The autumn-spawned cohort survived 13 mo, and reached modal sizes of 20 mm and 15 mm CL for males and females, respectively. The reasons for the success of M. stebbingi in the Canal lakes, in contrast to other "Lessepsian" penaeids which have flourished in the Mediterranean Sea, have been considered. The main factors are that it is essentially a shallow-water species, with excellent tolerance of salinity variations and adverse environments. However, the Canal lake populations have smaller maximum sizes, and mature earlier, than those in open seas.

However, among wetland types in the lake basin, the differences in the carbon sequestration processes undertaken by autotrophic microorganisms remain unclear. We aimed to investigate these differences and compared the sediment CO2-fixation rates (CFRs) and the cbbL-and coxL-containing microbial communities in swamp, lake, and river wetlands in summer and autumn in Hulun Lake Basin, China, besides exploring the difference mechanism by considering the sediment physicochemical properties. We found that microbial CFRs and associated microbial communities varied significantly among wetland types. Specifically, CFRs in the static swamp and lake wetlands were significantly higher than those in the lotic swamp and river wetlands, and CFRs in the swamp wetlands with emergent plants were significantly higher than those in the river and lake wetlands without emergent plant in summer. Stochastic processes dominated the assembly of bacterial communities associated with CO2-fixation, and the assembly processes also differed among wetland types. The distance-decay model revealed that geographical distance and environmental differences both caused variations in the bacterial communities associated with CO2-fixation among wetland types. Further analysis showed that the high levels of total organic carbon in the wetlands with relatively static water flow and abundant emergent plants are conducive to the growth of facultative autotrophic CO2-fixation bacteria, resulting in the variations in CFRs and the associated microbial communities among wetland types. This study expands the understanding of spatial distribution of carbon sequestration driven by microbes in wetlands.

It can play an important role in the productivity of the entire ecosystem, with both production and degradation of organic carbon. The aim of this study was to determine the role of phytoplankton in primary production and respiration in the littoral zone, depending on the development of the basin. The research was conducted in the spring, summer and autumn at eight sites of littoral zone with a different level of the direct catchment area development: two sites (1, 2) in the western part of the lake, which is dominated by forests, three sites (3, 4, 5) in the northern part of the basin, dominated by wasteland and private recreational areas, two sites (6, 7) in the eastern, the most transformed by man and one site (8) located in the southern part of the lake near the outflow. The production volume of the primary and respiration were determined by the change of the oxygen concentration in water using the method of "light and dark bottles" exposed for 24 hours in the surface layer of water. The lake primary production was significantly lower in the littoral parts shaded by forest than in sites exposed to the sun, occurring in the northern part of the lake. The highest primary production with simultaneously high phytoplankton biomass was found at the site in the north. The additional factor intensifying the primary production was the nutrient inflow from the recreationally used land. The highest rate of respiration was recorded in not forested sites, located in the northeastern part of the lake, where the autochthonic and allochtonic organic matter was reduced to CO2. The results indicate a dual role of littoral in the metabolism of Lake Kortowskie. On the one hand, the littoral zone supplies the basin in autochthonic organic matter, on the other hand reduces the organic matter which was produced in the water column and was supplied from the catchment. One suspects that the actual primary production in the littoral zone of Lake Kortowskiego was higher because a significant cover the bottom of the macrophytes limited primary production of phytoplankton.

Seasonal Changes in Plankton Food Web Structure and Carbon Dioxide Flux from Southern California Reservoirs	PLOS ONE												Reservoirs around the world contribute to cycling of carbon dioxide (CO2) with the atmosphere, but there is little information on how ecosystem processes determine the absorption or emission of CO2. Reservoirs are the most prevalent freshwater systems in the arid southwest of North America, yet it is unclear whether they sequester or release CO2 and therefore how water impoundment impacts global carbon cycling. We sampled three reservoirs in San Diego, California, weekly for one year. We measured seasonal variation in the abundances of bacteria, phytoplankton, and zooplankton, as well as water chemistry (pH, nutrients, ions, dissolved organic carbon [DOC]), which were used to estimate partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), and CO2 flux. We found that San Diego reservoirs are most often undersaturated with CO2 with respect to the atmosphere and are estimated to absorb on average 3.22 mmol C m(-2) day(-1). pCO(2) was highest in the winter and lower in the summer, indicating seasonal shifts in the magnitudes of photosynthesis and respiration associated with day length, temperature and water inputs. Abundances of microbes (bacteria) peaked in the winter along with pCO(2), while phytoplankton, nutrients, zooplankton and DOC were all unrelated to pCO(2). Our data indicate that reservoirs of semi-arid environments may primarily function as carbon sinks, and that carbon flux varies seasonally but is unrelated to nutrient or DOC availability, or the abundances of phytoplankton or zooplankton.																			1932-6203					OCT 16	2015	10	10							e0140464	10.1371/journal.pone.0140464	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0140464								26473601					WOS:000363185500056

Operational management, which is based on a reliable hydrological understanding, has the potential to reduce the lake salinity. This is the case of the salinity in Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), where saline water flows into the lake through on-shore and off-shore springs. Here, we present a time-dependent flow and transport numerical model that successfully reproduces the monitored groundwater level, discharge, and salinity of the lake springs. The model utilizes a continuum approach and describes the flow through a confined saline carbonate aquifer, which interacts with the discharge lake through fractures and faults. In particular, the model investigates the hydrology around two groups of springs, Fuliya and Tabgha, along the western shore of the lake. Based on seasonal characteristics of the springs and measured boundary conditions, the two springs groups were defined as Lake Dominated Springs (LDS, Fuliya) and Aquifer Dominated Springs (ADS, Tabgha). The models of the two groups differ from each other in the distribution of fractured regions that link between the lake and the underlying aquifers. The numerical solution shows how the fractured regions affect groundwater head, spring discharge, and spring salinity. The different behavior of the LDS and ADS was reproduced with an excellent agreement between measured and calculated patterns. Differences in salinity within a group of springs are shown to be dependent on the depth of the fractured region. It was revealed that in addition to the appropriate distribution of fractured regions some adjustment in the up-stream boundary conditions is necessary to fully reproduce the system hydrology. The model has improved our understanding and provides a prediction tool for future management strategies. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Charles			Mapping the spatial distribution of the biomass and filter-feeding effect of invasive dreissenid mussels on the winter-spring phytoplankton bloom in Lake Michigan	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The effects of the invasive bivalves Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel) and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (quagga mussel) on aquatic ecosystems, including Lake Michigan, are a topic of current interest to scientists and resource managers. We hypothesised that the winter-spring phytoplankton bloom in Lake Michigan is reduced at locations where the fraction of the water column cleared per day by Dreissena filter feeding approached the net growth rate of phytoplankton, when the water column was not stratified. To test this hypothesis, we compared the spatial distribution of Dreissena filter-feeding intensity (determined from geostatistical modelling) to the spatial distribution of chlorophyll (determined from satellite remote sensing). 2. To map the spatial distribution of Dreissena biomass and filter-feeding intensity, we developed a geostatistical model based on point observations of mussel biomass measured in Lake Michigan in 1994/1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010. The model provided fine-scale estimates of the spatial distribution of biomass for the survey years and provided estimates, with their uncertainty, of total biomass lakewide and within subregions. The approach outlined could be applied more generally to map the distribution of benthic biota in lakes from point observations. 3. Total biomass of Dreissena in Lake Michigan, estimated from the geostatistical model, increased significantly over each five-year period. The total biomass in units of 10(6)kg ash-free dry mass (AFDM) (with 90% confidence interval) was 6 (4-8) in 1994/1995, 18 (14-23) in 2000, 408 (338-485) in 2005 and 610 (547-680) in 2010. From 1994/1995 to 2005, increases were observed in all regions of the lake (northern, central and southern) and in all depth zones (<30, 30-50, 50-90 and >90). However, from 2005 to 2010, for depths of <50m, biomass declined in the northern region, remained constant in the central region and increased in the southern region; biomass continued to increase in all three lake regions for depths >50m. 4. The filter-feeding intensity of Dreissena exceeded the benchmark spring phytoplankton growth rate of 0.06day(-1) in 2005 for depths <50m (lakewide). In 2010, the filter-feeding impact exceeded 0.06day(-1) within depths <90m (lakewide), which greatly increased the spatial area affected relative to 2005. A regression analysis indicated a significant relationship between the reduction in satellite-derived chlorophyll concentration (pre-D.r.bugensis period to post-D.r.bugensis period) and spatially co-located filter-feeding intensity (fraction of water column cleared per day) during periods when the water column was not stratified (December to April).

Monthly CO2 fluxes were derived from measurements of acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), pH, ionic strength, temperature, and wind speed. CO2 fluxes exhibited large seasonal variability, in particular in oligo-mesotrophic lakes. Most of the lakes emitted CO2 during winter (median rates ranging 300-1,900 mg C m(-2) day(-1)), and less CO2 during summer or, in the case of some of the highly eutrophic lakes, retained CO2 during summer. We found that seasonal CO2 fluxes were strongly negatively correlated with pH (r = -0.65, P < 0.01), which in turn was correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations (r = 0.48, P < 0.01). Our analysis suggests that lake trophic status (a proxy for pelagic production) interacts with the lake ANC to drive the seasonal dynamics of CO2 fluxes, largely by changing pH and thereby the equilibrium of the free CO2 and bicarbonate relation. Long-term observations from four lakes, which have all undergone a period of oligotrophication during the past two decades, provide further evidence that CO2 efflux generally increases as trophic status decreases, as a consequence of decreased pH. Across these four lakes, the annual average CO2 emission has increased by 32% during the past two decades, thus, demonstrating the strong link between lake trophic status and CO2 flux.

J	Helz, GR; Bura-Nakic, E; Mikac, N; Ciglenecki, I				Helz, George R.; Bura-Nakic, Elvira; Mikac, Nevenka; Ciglenecki, Irena			New model for molybdenum behavior in euxinic waters	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Rogoznica Lake, on the Adriatic coast of Croatia, undergoes vertical mixing in autumn, but quickly restratifies and becomes intensely sulfidic during the succeeding 11 months. Autumn's vertically homogeneous dissolved Mo concentrations quickly revert to a summer profile in which Mo concentrations are lower by an order of magnitude in the sulfidic layer than in the oxic layer. Other redox sensitive elements (As, U and V) are much less affected on this time scale. Below the depth where sulfidic waters become saturated with iron monosulfide, Mo concentrations become nearly constant. A similar pattern can be recognized in other euxinic basins and seems inconsistent with Mo removal by sorption on sinking particles. Precipitation of a previously unrecognized, probably nanoscale Fe(II)-Mo(VI) sulfide mineral is postulated to explain this phenomenon. By fitting the Rogoznica data, a provisional composition and solubility product constant for this material are derived. The mineral's formula approximates Fe5Mo3S14. Its Mo content is similar to that of a synthetic precipitate previously shown by X-ray spectroscopy to resemble molybdenum's host phase in black shales. Assuming saturation with this mineral, dissolved Mo in the deep water column of a number of other euxinic basins can be predicted in most cases to within a factor of three. The model has important implications for Mo behavior in euxinic basins. For example, the model attributes the near-total Mo removal from deep Black Sea waters to a serendipitous combination of pH and H2S concentration, implying that such removal would not be a general property of euxinic basins. This is a key point with regard to Mo isotope systematics. Contrary to previous views, the model assigns a critical role to pH in controlling the efficiency of Mo removal from euxinic basins.

J	Chenchouni, H				Chenchouni, H.			Diversity Assessment of Vertebrate Fauna in a Wetland of Hot Hyperarid Lands	ARID ECOSYSTEMS												A great paradox arises when we talk about biodiversity in wetlands located at hot-hyperarid lands. Ayata Lake (155 ha) belongs to the complex of wetlands of Oued Righ Valley in Algerian Lower-Sahara. Surveys conducted between October 2009 and June 2010 has allowed assessing vertebrate diversity living in the lake and its surrounding areas. Several methods and techniques were used for sampling and censing each group of vertebrate (fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals). Inventories revealed the existence of 03 fish, 02 amphibians, 06 reptiles, 55 birds, and 07 mammals. Phenological types (winter or summer migrant, resident-breeder occasional visitor) were attributed to birds then population dynamics were discussed. Birds used generally the waterbody in winter where migrants, mainly waterbirds, were abundant. We investigated for most inventoried species the specific habitats where they are occurring, and which respond to their behavioural and diet ecology. Biogeography status of vertebrate species revealed a desert affinity, which is represented mainly by Saharan and Saharo-sindian bio-models; except for birds which revealed dominance of Palaearctic biogeographical categories. This approach helped to highlight the biological resources of Ayata Lake and determine its actual ecological value. Furthermore, this study proposes some suggestions for management and conservation purposes.					; Chenchouni, Haroun/I-7494-2012	Chenchouni, Haroun/0000-0001-9077-2706; 													2079-0961	2079-0988				OCT	2012	2	4					253	263		10.1134/S2079096113010022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S2079096113010022													WOS:000218883100009
J	Farhadzadeh, A; Gangai, J				Farhadzadeh, Ali; Gangai, Jeffery			Numerical Modeling of Coastal Storms for Ice-Free and Ice-Covered Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH												Lake Erie is the shallowest among the Great Lakes. Because of its shallow depth and because predominant wind direction in the area is along the lake's longitudinal axis, eastern and western Lake Erie experience significant storm surge that are usually followed by seiches. The lake warms in summer and quickly freezes over in winter when it often develops extensive surface ice. The surface ice, in turn, can modify wind setup and waves and even hinder wave propagation in areas where the surface ice is densely concentrated. In the following, a coupled numerical model for storm surge and wave is utilized for the simulation of Lake Erie coastal storms under ice-free and ice-covered lake conditions. Six extreme events, affecting both eastern and western Lake Erie, are selected for presentation here. A high resolution mesh is developed using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) bathymetric data. The wind and pressure fields are developed for the selected storms based on the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis hindcast data and are used in the model as the primary forcing mechanism for the extreme events. For winter storms, the model is provided with temporally and spatially varying ice fields developed based on the NOAA Ice Atlas. Quantitative comparisons of spatial and temporal variations of simulated and measured storm surge and wave fields are presented. Furthermore, for the winter storms, the effect of ice cover on storm surge is assessed by comparing the model results for storm surge with actual ice-covered condition and the hypothetical ice-free condition.																			0749-0208	1551-5036				NOV	2017	33	6					1383	1396		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-16-00101.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-16-00101.1													WOS:000415373200013

ESTIMATING MUDPUPPY (NECTURUS MACULOSUS) ABUNDANCE IN THE LAMOILLE RIVER, VERMONT, USA	HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY												The Mudpuppy (Necturus maculosus) is classified as a Species of Greatest Conservation Need by the state of Vermont. There is concern regarding status of populations in the Lake Champlain basin because of habitat alteration and potential effects of 3-trifluromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM), a chemical used to control Sea Lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). The purpose of our research was to assess Mudpuppy capture methods and abundance in the Lamoille River, Vermont, USA. We sampled Mudpuppies under a mark-recapture framework, using modified, baited minnow traps set during two winter-spring periods. We marked each Mudpuppy with a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag and released individuals after collecting morphological measurements. We collected 80 individuals during 2,581 trap days in 2008-2009 (year 1), and 81 individuals during 3,072 trap days in 2009-2010 (year 2). We estimated abundance from spring trapping periods in 2009 and 2010, during which capture rates were sufficient for analysis. Capture probability was low (< 0.04), but highest following precipitation events in spring, during periods of higher river flow, when water temperatures were approximately 3 to 6 degrees C. During October 2009, management agencies treated the Lamoille River with TFM. Surveyors recovered more than 500 dead Mudpuppies during the post-treatment assessment. Overall, Mudpuppy captures did not change between sampling periods; however, we captured fewer females during year 2 compared to year 1, and the sex ratio changed from 0.79: 1 (M:F) during year 1 to 3:1 (M:F) during year 2. Our data may help wildlife managers assess population status of Mudpuppies in conjunction with fisheries management techniques.																			2151-0733	1931-7603				AUG	2017	12	2					422	434																WOS:000410547700012

The algal dominancy of the three Anabaena species, A. affinis, A. flos-aquae and A. spiroides, took place in early summer, while the dominance of the Microcystis species, M. aeruginosa, M. viridis and M. wesenbergii, took place from summer to fall. Water samples were collected at Tsuchiura Harbour in Lake Kasumigaura. The correlations between cell numbers of blue-green algal species and water qualities were investigated. The growth rates of algae in situ were determined. M. aeruginosa showed the highest increasing growth rate, while M. viridis was the lowest decay rate in the Microcystis species. M. aeruginosa exhibited high single correlations between water temperature, pH, total chemical oxygen demand (T-COD) and dissolved chemical oxygen demand (D-COD). The cell numbers of blue-green algal species were also compared with each other to know any correlation. The high correlations between the three Anabaena species were observed.																			0959-3330					MAY	1993	14	5					433	442		10.1080/09593339309385311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593339309385311													WOS:A1993KZ95000004

Chill out: physiological responses to winter ice-angling in two temperate freshwater fishes	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY												A large body of research has documented the stress response of fish following angling capture. Nearly all of these studies have taken place during the open-water season, with almost no work focused on the effects of capture in the winter via ice angling. We therefore conducted a study to examine physiological disturbance and reflex impairment following capture by ice-angling in two commonly targeted species, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus and yellow perch Perca flavescens. Fish were captured from a lake in eastern Wisconsin (USA) and sampled either immediately or after being held in tanks for 0.5, 2 or 4 h. Sampling involved the assessment of reflex action mortality predictors (RAMP) and a blood biopsy that was used to measure concentrations of plasma cortisol and lactate. The capture-induced increase in plasma cortisol concentration was delayed relative to responses documented in previous experiments conducted in the summer and reached a relative high point at 4 h post-capture. Reflex impairment was highest at the first post-capture time point (0.5 h) and declined with each successive sampling (2 and 4 h) during recovery. Bluegill showed a higher magnitude stress response than yellow perch in terms of plasma cortisol and RAMP scores, but not when comparing plasma lactate. Overall, these data show that ice-angling induces a comparatively mild stress response relative to that found in previous studies of angled fish. While recovery of plasma stress indicators does not occur within 4 h, declining RAMP scores demonstrate that ice-angled bluegill and yellow perch do recover vitality following capture.

This lake is connected to many principal and small rivers with inflow from west and outflow on the eastern side of the lake and these inflow rivers are believed to significantly contribute to the water pollution of the lake. This study was aimed at assessing the diversity and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and their relationship with water quality parameters and land use patterns. Water samples were collected from 10 major inflow rivers and the source water protection area of the Taihu Lake in spring and summer 2019. High-throughput profiling was used to detect and quantify 384 ARGs and MGEs and in addition, 11 water quality parameters were analyzed. The results showed that the number of ARGs/MGEs detected in each inflow river ranged from 105 to 185 in spring and 107 to 180 in summer. The aminoglycoside resistance genes were the most dominant types ARGs detected followed by beta-lactam resistance, multidrug resistance, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B (MLSB) resistance genes, which contributed to 65% of the ARGs. The water quality parameters showed significant correlation with absolute abundance of ARGs. Furthermore, significant correlation between ARGs and MGEs were also observed which demonstrates potential gene transfer among organisms through horizontal gene transfer via MGEs. ARGs showed strong positive correlation with cultivated and industrial lands whereas, negative correlation was observed with river, lake, forest, land for green buffer, and land for port and harbor. The overall results indicate that the inflow rivers of Taihu Lake are polluted by various sources including multiple nutrients and high abundance of ARGs, which needs attention for better management of the inflow rivers of this lake.

A description of different morphotypes of particles clearly assimilable to viruses is made in plankton samples from the euphotic layer of a eutrophic lake (Lake Aydat), during its spring and summer development. The particles possess a tail and a 6-sided icosahedral capsid-head, with dimensions similar to those of phages already described in marine systems. The diversity of viral forms and their abundance (10 fold higher than that of bacteria) in Lake Aydat, suggests a significant role in controlling bacterial number in lakes.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019	Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; 													0003-4088	2100-000X					1996	32	4					259	263		10.1051/limn/1996025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/1996025													WOS:A1996WB02200007

Nitrification contributes to winter oxygen depletion in seasonally frozen forested lakes	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												In lakes that experience seasonal ice cover, understanding of nitrogen-oxygen coupling and nitrification has been dominated by observations during open water, ice-free conditions. To address knowledge gaps about nitrogen-oxygen linkages under ice, we examined long-term winter data (30 + years, 2-3 sample events per winter) in 7 temperate lakes of forested northern Wisconsin, USA. Across lakes and depths, there were strong negative relationships between dissolved oxygen (DO) and the number of days since ice-on, reflecting consistent DO consumption rates under ice. In two bog lakes that routinely experience prolonged winter DO concentrations below 1.0 mg L-1, nitrate accumulated near the ice surface mainly in late winter, suggesting nitrification may depend on biogenic oxygen from photosynthesis. In contrast, within five oligotrophic-mesotrophic lakes, nitrate accumulated more consistently over winter and often throughout the water column, especially at intermediate depths. Exogenous inputs of nitrate to these lakes were minimal compared to rates of nitrate accumulation. To produce the nitrate via in-lake nitrification, substantial oxygen consumption by ammonium oxidizing microbes would be required. Among lakes and depths that had significant DO depletion over winter, the stoichiometric nitrifier oxygen demand ranged from 1 to 25% of the DO depletion rate. These estimates of nitrifier-driven DO decline are likely conservative because we did not account for nitrate consumed by algal uptake or denitrification. Our results provide an example of nitrification at temperatures < 5 degrees C having a substantial influence on ecosystem-level nitrogen and oxygen availability in seasonally-frozen, northern forested lakes. Consequently, models of under-ice dissolved oxygen dynamics may be advanced through consideration of nitrification, and more broadly, coupled nitrogen and oxygen cycling.					; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012; Lottig, Noah/AAE-4650-2020	Labou, Stephanie/0000-0001-5633-5983; Powers, Stephen/0000-0001-6267-2644; Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998; Lottig, Noah/0000-0003-1599-8144													0168-2563	1573-515X				NOV	2017	136	2					119	129		10.1007/s10533-017-0382-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-017-0382-1													WOS:000413988800001
J	Zaksek, K; Hort, M				Zaksek, Klemen; Hort, Matthias			REMOTE SENSING OF THERMAL ANOMALIES ON ACTIVE VOLCANOES	GEODETSKI VESTNIK												Thermal remote sensing is a valuable tool for monitoring active volcanoes. One can use it to detect smaller thermal anomalies, such as hot springs or fumaroles. It is successful also by detecting larger anomalies, such as lava flows or lava lakes. All these anomalies usually cover only a small area comparing to the ground sample distance of the sensors that are appropriate for their monitoring. This makes detecting and characterizing the thermal anomaly a difficult task that is solved by using more data from several bands covering the appropriate spectra. The most robust parameter to characterize a thermal anomaly is radiative heat flux. We need to analyse its time series in order to understand the volcano activity. Satellite data are influenced by the atmosphere, terrain, etc. Therefore, the time series always contains some noise. For a case study we applied Kalman filter to minimise the noise in the case study of Etna eruption in autumn 2002.

In this study, we estimated the spatial ecology of Saimaa ringed seals during the breeding season in the ice-covered period of December-April. The telemetry data on tagged seals (n = 20), with a total of 25 separate tracking periods and birth lair locations (n = 59) of non-tagged seals, were studied to estimate the movement ecology and breeding density. The movements of the ringed seals were more restricted during the ice-covered season; the total home range size (average 7.4 km(2)) in winter was 13 times smaller than that in summer. Individual tagged seals occupied an average of 5 +/- 3 SD subnivean haul outs (snow lairs or ice cavities), and the mean distance between the haul outs was 1.6 +/- 1.1 SD km (range 0.2-5.9 km). Moreover, our data indicated that ringed seal females likely exhibited breeding time avoidance of each other's core areas, which may indicate some degree of territoriality. This was supported by the findings that the core areas (mean 1.2 km(2)) of tagged adult females (n = 9), did not overlap with each other. Also data on non-tagged seals showed that females did not give birth to pups within the core area radius of other parturient females. This study, together with earlier findings on the home ranges of nursed pups and perinatal mortality rates, has implications into land usage planning in Lake Saimaa by highlighting the need of undisturbed area between seal lairs and anthropogenic disturbances.

J	Obertegger, U; Flaim, G				Obertegger, U.; Flaim, G.			A 40-year perspective of an alpine lake: Is everything the same?	LIMNOLOGICA												Mountain lakes are the most affected by climate change; however, few of these lakes are regularly sampled because of their remoteness. We discussed limnological data (e.g. water temperature, light transparency, and plankton diversity) of Lake Campo (1944 m above sea level, Adamello Mountains, Italy) scattered over almost forty years in the light of climate change. Specifically, occasional samplings in 1980, 1988, 2016, 2017, and 2018 and more extensive surveys in 1997 and 2015 were carried out. Among the investigated years, 2015 was the warmest. Inter-year variability in water temperature was quite marked in Lake Campo. Water temperature profiles of July (1980, 1997, 2015) showed increased surface warming, while the deeper layers (> 15 m) were always isothermal at around 5 degrees C. Hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen never decreased below 50 % saturation. Secchi disk depth was not substantially different among years. Summer profiles of light transparency showed discontinuous light attenuation, which was tentatively attributed to algae located in deeper layers. In cluster analysis of phytoplankton and zooplankton data, differences between seasons but not years were found. The autumn decline of Bacillariophyta and the increase of mixotrophic Cryptophyta was linked to decreasing silica concentrations towards autumn. Apart from this general pattern, several observations (e.g. high abundance of Tovellia sanguinea, requiring warmer temperatures and thermal stratification to compete with Bacillariophyta; a spatially extended metalimnetic oxygen maximum in July 2015) showed the effects of particularly warm conditions of 2015 compared to 1997. The continuous presence of crustacean males and first generation of rotifers (Polyarthra f. aptera) hatching from sexual eggs indicated the importance of sexual reproduction in the lake. Length measurements of Daphnia gr. longispina before (1997) and after (2015) non-native fish removal and Arctic char introduction were similar and indicated no apparent change in predation pressure. Studies like this, despite scattered data, can provide valuable insights into the changes mountain lakes undergo through time.

Agronomic data and physiological (sugar, phenol, chlorophyll content) and anatomical (porosity, cell size) measurements were also obtained. Reflectance data collected from emergence to harvest were statistically analyzed and compared with the physiological and anatomical changes. As the lettuce matured, there were regular changes in the 1100 to 1200 nm wavelength band and irregular changes in the far red. The change in the reflectance pattern of the lettuce in the various wavelength ranges could be correlated with the physiological and anatomical changes as the lettuce head matured.																			0249-5627						1982	2	8					685	694		10.1051/agro:19820801	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/agro:19820801													WOS:A1982PP99800001

Effects of physical and morphometric factors on nutrient removal properties in agricultural ponds	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Effects of physical and morphometric factors on nutrient removal properties were studied in small agricultural ponds with different depths, volumes, and residence times in western Japan. Average residence time was estimated to be > 15 days, and it tended to decrease from summer to winter because of the increase in water withdrawal for agricultural activity. Water temperature was clearly different between the surface and bottom layers; this indicates that thermal stratification occurred in summer. Chlorophyll-a was significantly high (> 20 mu g/L) in the surface layer (<0.5 m) and influenced by the thermal stratification. Removal ratios of dissolved total nitrogen (DTN) and dissolved total phosphorus in the ponds were estimated to be 53-98% and 39-98% in August and 10-92% and 36-57% in December, respectively. Residence time of the ponds was longer in August than in December, and DTN removal, in particular, was more significant in ponds with longer residence time. Our results suggest residence time is an important factor for nitrogen removal in small agricultural ponds as well as large lakes.

During 2009 it was found throughout most of the Shannon River Navigation (similar to 250km) occurring in swarms at estimated densities of similar to 6 per litre in shallows and in lower densities at depths of similar to 20m where its distribution overlaps with the native Mysis salemaai. Broods were found from March to September. It occurs mainly in lakes but small numbers were found at one river site. In summer, shallow-water specimens were found only during the night but in winter could be captured in daytime.

We analyzed 20 years (2001-2020) of data on lake water chemistry, land cover changes, and road salt applications for Lake Wilcox (LW) located in southern Ontario, Canada. The lake is situated within a rapidly urbanizing watershed in which, during the period of observation, on average 785 tons of road salt were applied annually. However, only about a quarter of this salt has reached the lake so far. That is, most salt has been retained in the watershed, likely through accumulation in soils and groundwater. Despite the high watershed salt retention, time series trend analyses for LW show significant increases in the dissolved concentrations of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-), as well as those of sulfate (SO42-), calcium (Ca2+), and magnesium (Mg2+). The relative changes in the major ion concentrations indicate a shift of the lake water chemistry from the mixed SO42--Cl--Ca2+-Mg2+ type to the Na+ -Cl- type. Salinization of LW has further been strengthening and lengthening the lake's summer stratification, which, in turn, has been enhancing hypoxia in the hypolimnion and increasing the internal loading of the limiting nutrient phosphorus. The theoretical salinity threshold at which fall overturn would become increasingly unlikely was estimated at around 1.23 g kg- 1. A simple chloride mass balance model predicts that, under the current trend of impermeable land cover expansion, LW could reach this salinity threshold by mid-century. Our results also highlight the need for additional research on the accruing salt legacies in urbanizing watersheds because they represent potential long-term threats to water quality for receiving freshwater ecosystems and regional groundwater resources.					; Gharabaghi, Bahram/F-9977-2016	Rezanezhad, Fereidoun/0000-0002-9608-8005; 													0883-2927	1872-9134				FEB	2024	162								105928	10.1016/j.apgeochem.2024.105928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2024.105928		FEB 2024											WOS:001180979400001

For the last 20 years, the lake has been stocked annually with 0.5 - 3.3 million eleutheroembryos (620 - 4100 per ha) in early spring, but the population is presumably self-sustaining. The contribution of stocking to commercial yields has never been assessed. In spring 1994, 1.5 million embryos were marked by immersion in Alizarin Red S (150 mdl fur 3 h) prior to stocking. Survival rate was better than 90 % after 48 h (76 % in one tank where the concentration had been higher initially) and ranged from 74 to 83 % after 24 d (21 % in one tank). Mark quality was excellent, as was mark retention after almost two years. In autumn 1995, more than one thousand specimens of the 1994 year-class were sampled from the lake. Lapilli and sagittae were removed, embedded in epoxy resin, ground and polished, and examined under ultraviolet light. Only 1.3 % of fish (14 specimens) were marked. We conclude that natural reproduction in Lake Werbellin was successful in 1994. the cost/benefit ratio of stocking was above unity. Evaluation of stocking programs in which eleutheroembryos are added to self-sustaining coregonid populations is strongly recommended.																			0071-1128		3-510-47052-4				1998	50						457	463																WOS:000078180200046

The decline of a hidden and expansive microhabitat: the subnivium	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT												The subnivium is the seasonal microhabitat at the snow-ground interface and serves as a refuge for a diversity of species. Increasingly warmer winters are disrupting the continuity of snow cover, and likely the stability of the subnivium. To examine how the extent and duration of this sensitive and widespread below-snow habitat will shift under warming winters, we deployed fully automated winter greenhouses across latitudinal and land-cover gradients to monitor subnivium conditions under different climate-change scenarios and predicted subnivium occurrence across the Great Lakes region. In a +3 degrees C warming scenario, we found little change in subnivium extent or duration, whereas a +5 degrees C scenario produced widespread and marked reductions in both extent (loss of 200,000 km(2) , a 45% decline) and duration (>1 month decline). Although the subnivium appears resilient to moderate future warming, we predict abrupt and extensive changes in response to increased winter warming, which will have sweeping ecological and environmental consequences in high-latitude ecosystems.

Minerals analyzed were P, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu, as well as ash. Apical mineral content was influenced by both the seasons and sample site location. Seasonal variations in mineral content were largest for Fe and Mn. A generalized seasonal pattern for Na, K, Ca and Mg was a summer maximum. Fe and Mn had later winter maxima, while ash, P and Zn had no significant seasonal variation. Recurrent seasonal patterns were most pronounced for Fe, Mn and Na. Seasonal maxima in Fe content were greater at tributary sampling sites than at nontributary sites. The recurrent seasonal variations in mineral content observed suggest that the time of sampling can greatly influence the results and, therefore, the interpretation of tissue chemistry studies of submersed hydrophytes.																			0304-3770	1879-1522					1982	14	2					139	149		10.1016/0304-3770(82)90093-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(82)90093-6													WOS:A1982PM00800003

The aim of the research was to understand the hydrogeological conditions of these high-discharge springs and the recharge-discharge relations in the Infranz catchment. The Infranz catchment is covered by highly pervious and young quaternary volcanic rocks, consisting of blocky, fractured, and strongly vesicular scoriaceous basalt. At the surface, these rocks crop out as lineaments forming ridges, delimiting closed depressions in which water accumulates during the rainy season without causing surface runoff. Geology and geomorphology thus combine to produce very favorable conditions for groundwater recharge. Three groundwater recharge methods were applied to estimate groundwater recharge and the results were compared. Groundwater recharge was calculated to be 30% to 51% of rainfall. Rapid replenishment raises the groundwater level during the rainfall period, followed by a rapid decline during the dry season. Shallow local flow paths discharge at seasonal springs and streams, while more regional and deeper flow systems downstream sustain the high-discharge springs and perennial Infranz River. The uptake of 75% of spring water for the water supply of Bahir Dar City, local extraction for domestic and small-scale irrigation use from springs, rivers and hand-dug wells, encroaching farming, and overgrazing are exacerbating wetland degradation.

Black-tailed deer traversed the reservoir using 43 routes located predominately in the narrowest sections of the reservoir. A group of 2-3 black-tailed deer typically swam together.

J	SCHMIDLIN, TW				SCHMIDLIN, TW			IMPACTS OF SEVERE WINTER WEATHER DURING DECEMBER 1989 IN THE LAKE ERIE SNOWBELT	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												December 1989 was the coldest December in over 100 years in the Lake Erie snowbelt of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. Mean temperatures of -9-degree-C were 7-degrees-C lower than average and extreme minima reached -30-degrees-C. Snow fell on 20 to 25 days of the month and snowfall totals of 100 to 200 cm were twice the December average. Some locations reported record snowfalls and the greatest snow depths of this century. Several segments of society were studied to assess the impacts of this severe winter weather. The severe weather had minimal impacts on school districts. Over half (54%) of the districts had no closures due to snow but costs for snow removal increased for schools. Ski centers reported a 50% to 100% increase in revenues over December 1988 and the best December skiing in many years. Lake ports had higher operating costs and loss of shipments. Costs for snow and ice control on Interstate 90 (I-90) in the snowbelt increased at least $1326 km-1 over December 1988, but traffic flow was maintained. Person-hours spent on snow and ice control on I-90 increased 59%. An average of 111 000 kg km-1 (200 tons mile-1) of salt and grit was spread on I-90, an increase of 50 000 kg km-1 (89 tons mile-1) over December 1988. Colleges, airports, agriculture, hospitals, urban mass transit, electric utilities, and government agencies had only minor disruptions due to the severe winter weather.																			0894-8755					APR	1993	6	4					759	767		10.1175/1520-0442(1993)006<0759:IOSWWD>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0442(1993)006<0759:IOSWWD>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1993KZ33500014
J	Zdanowski, B				Zdanowski, B			Precipitation of phosphorus in the zone of river and lake water mixing: R. Hancza and lake Wigry (North-East Poland)	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Studies on physico-chemical parameters of water in Czarna Hancza River and lakes Hancza and Wigry (North-East Poland) were carried out in 1991-1994 i.e. in the period of maximal pollution of this river-lake system. Basic information were obtained enabling explanation of high resistance of Lake Wigry to eutrophication. It was shown that co-precipitation of phosphates on calcite in the ecotone zone of Hanczanska Bay, where river waters mixed with lake waters, was an important process. Sedimentation of these substances in this lake part resulted in lower lake loading with phosphorus by as much as about 50%. The mechanisms were operating most of all during the vegetation season, when water pH exceeded 8.3. Availability of phosphorus to phytoplankton depended also on phosphate release from bottom sediments. The lowest rate of this release was observed in Hanczanska Bay. On the other hand, in autumn and winter the increase of organic matter decomposition and lowering of water pH enabled free spreading of pollutants over the whole lake.																			1505-2249						2003	51	2					143	154																WOS:000183729900005

Numbers of sulfate-reducing bacteria determined as the sum of cells hybridizing to Probes SRB385Db targeting Desulfobacteriaceae and SRB385 targeting Desulfovibrionaceae were similar at all samplings and accounted for 13 to 18% of the total microbial community, respectively. Abundance of cells detected with either probe, however, changed during the year, with cell numbers detected with SRB385Db being larger in early summer (June) and those detected with SRB385 being larger in late summer (October). Increasing cell numbers detected with SRB385Db were mainly caused by a yet uncultured and phylogenetically unidentified bacterium with a peculiar morphology ('Morphotype R') that followed the sulfide profile in June as well as in August with increasing numbers at increasing concentrations with depth. From the fraction of cells detected with SRB385, only a minor part represented a yet uncultured population without close cultured relatives. At all samplings, the majority of cells detected with SRB385 (93 to 99%) represented populations phylogenetically related to Desulfocapsa thiozymogenes DSM7269. Their cells were generally found in association with aggregates of small-celled phototrophic sulfur bacteria. This association was not specific for 1 of the 4 populations representing all small-celled phototrophic sulfur bacteria in Lake Cadagno. The association was also not obligate since non-associated cells were frequently found, especially in winter and early summer when limited light conditions caused by snow and ice cover reduced the abundance of small-celled phototrophic sulfur bacteria to about 50% of the values found in late summer. Nonetheless, the association between populations related to D. thiozymogenes and small-celled phototrophic sulfur bacteria suggests an ecological advantage to both organisms under appropriate environmental conditions.

J	Sidorchuk, A; Borisova, O; Panin, A				Sidorchuk, A; Borisova, O; Panin, A			Fluvial response to the Late Valdai/Holocene environmental change on the East European Plain	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The relicts of large meandering paleochannels are found throughout the territory of the periglacial zone of the last (Valdai = Weichselian) glaciation on the Russian Plain, on the lower levels of river terraces and on the floodplains. Channel widths of so-called macromeanders can be 15 times larger than the recent meanders on the same rivers. Paleolandscape and paleohydrological reconstructions show that such periglacial river channels were formed under the conditions of high spring water flow, up to right times greater than modern discharges, when the flow coefficient was close to 0.9-1.0 due to the existence of permafrost. Also, summers were dry and streams lacked ground water supply. Permafrost degradation increased soil permeability in the spring and increased ground water flow during summer, causing a decrease of annual flow 12,000-14,000 years BP in the southern periglacial zone, and up to 8500 years BP in the northern periglacial zone. In the taiga zone, an annual flow in the recent river basins is about 80-85% of that found in the periglacial zone in the east, and 30-60% of that in the west. In the east of the broad-leaved forest zone, it is about 40-50% of that of the periglacial zone, and 20-25% in the western part of the broad-leaved forest zone. In the eastern steppe and forest steppe, the modern annual flow is about 40-60% of that of the periglacial zone and about 10% in the western part of steppe and forest steppe zones. As a result, large periglacial channels were abandoned and transformed into floodplain lakes and bogs. The Holocene channels have much smaller channel widths and meander lengths, formed under conditions of lower annual flows and much steadier flow regime. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Statistical methods such as Pearson correlation analysis allow to identify correlations and time lags for data with linear relationship. Wavelets overcome limitations of Pearson correlation analysis by taking non-stationarity in ecological time series into account. Wavelet coherency can examine both correlations and time lags between cyanobacteria growth and water quality conditions at different time scales. This research applied the wavelet analysis to irregularly measured limnological data of the Meiliang Bay of Lake Taihu from 2010 to 2011. It aimed to better understand time lags between water quality conditions and cyanobacteria growth in this shallow-polymictic and hypereutrophic lake. Results from this research revealed time lags of 2 days in relation to water transparency measured as Secchi depth, and time lags of 3 days for both ammonia (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N). Both NH4-N and NO3-N appeared as key driving forces for cyanobacteria growth in summer and autumn because of seasonal N-limitation in the Meiliang Bay. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We further investigated the in vitro growth characteristics at different temperatures, pH values and light intensities of three strains of S. petersenii (termed JC, JD, and WM strains) isolated from three water bodies in Kyungpook Province, Korea. The three strains of S. petersenii exhibited the highest growth rates at 15 degrees C. The maximum growth of S. petersenii occurred between pH 7.5 and 8.2 according to strain. JC and JD strains of S. petersenii exhibited the highest growth rates at a light intensity of 80 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), whereas the maximum growth rate of WM strain was at 112 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The optimal light intensity of S. petersenii was affected by the temperature. The three strains of S. petersenii had different optimal growth requirements, suggesting that they exhibited strain-specific adaptation.

Multi-proxy studies which are based on five different archives (lakes, peat bogs, speleothems, marine sediments, and ice cores) including sixty-six records from India and nearby regions, particularly in the Himalaya and in addition to six archives from the equatorial Eastern part of Africa encompasses with high-resolution published and unpublished records for the last 50 ka BP. The proxy data is discussed towards REMO-ESM model Coupled Model Intercomprasion Project phase 5 (CMIP5 Project) results. Our results indicate that both Western Himalaya and East Africa had undergone mega-droughts from similar to 17.0-15.0 ka BP, and precipitation had increased during the Early Holocene (10.0-7.0 Ka BP) during the time span when the Westerlies dominated regions. The model results suggest that the Westerlies monsoon has significantly contributed to the Northwestern Himalaya and somewhat to a lesser degree to the Western Himalaya and lower solar insolation in the winters did support the glacier advance during the LGM. The time series from the proxy data are compared with glacier fluctuations in different valleys to understand the response of the aforementioned monsoon system including other forcing factors which drive these variabilities. The review results indicate that the Westerlies was the main driver of the climate and glacier fluctuations in Northwestern Himalaya during the Late Quaternary.

Experimental gill nets were most effective for capturing blue catfish <381 mm. Trotlines and 76-mm mesh gill nets were most effective for capturing larger blue catfish. Gill nets and trotlines were not very effective for capturing channel catfish, likely because they did not concentrate in either the rock-lined discharge channel or in the old river channel where these gears were fished. Channel catfish were sampled most effectively with hoop nets. Capture rates and channel catfish lengths were compared for hoop nets with different mesh sizes, baited with waste cheese or soy chips, set in spring or summer, and set along mud banks or near rock-lined banks. Catch rates and lengths of channel catfish were greater using 25-mm mesh hoop nets, set along rock-lined banks, baited with waste cheese, during the summer, and when flows were high and constant, approximately 0.5-0.75 m/s.																			0892-2284		1-888569-19-0				1999	24						301	307																WOS:000086864000027

During rapid lake drainage, ice flow speeds increased to similar to 400% of winter values, and icequake activity peaked. At times >7days after drainage, this seismicity developed variability over both diurnal and longer periods (similar to 10days), while coincident ice speeds fell to similar to 150% of winter values and showed nightly peaks in spatial variability. Approximately 95% of all detected seismicity in the lake basin and its immediate vicinity was triggered by fracture propagation within near-surface ice (<330m deep) that generated Rayleigh waves. Icequakes occurring before and during drainage frequently were collocated with the down flow (west) end of the primary hydrofracture through which the lake drained but shifted farther west and outside the lake basin after the drainage. We interpret these results to reveal vertical hydrofracture opening and local uplift during the drainage, followed by enhanced seismicity and ice flow on the downstream side of the lake basin. This region collocates with interferometric synthetic aperture radar-measured speedup in previous years and could reflect the migration path of the meltwater supplied to the bed by the lake. The diurnal seismic signal can be associated with nightly reductions in surface melt input that increase effective basal pressure and traction, thereby promoting elevated strain in the surficial ice.

Compared with Gonghu Bay, both nutrient concentrations and Microcystis colony sizes were greater in Meiliang Bay. The median colony size (D-50: 50% of the total mass of particles smaller than this size) increased from April to August and then decreased until November. In both bays, the average D-50 of Microcystis colonies were <100 mu m in spring, but colonies within moderate-size (100-500 mu m) dominated in summer. The differences in colony size in Meiliang Bay and Gonghu Bay were probably due to horizontal drift driven by the prevailing south wind in summer. Redundancy analysis (RDA) of field data indicated that colony size was negatively related to nutrient concentrations but positively related to air temperature, suggesting that low nutrient concentrations and high air temperature promoted formation of large colonies. To validate the field survey, Microcystis colonies collected from Lake Taihu were cultured at different temperatures (15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C) under high and low nutrient concentrations for 9 days. The size of Microcystis colonies significantly decreased when temperature was above 20 degrees C but had no significant change at 15 degrees C. The differences in temperature effects on colony formation shown from field and laboratory suggested that the larger colonies in summer were probably due to the longer growth period rather than the higher air temperature and light intensity. In addition, colony size decreased more significantly at high nutrient levels. Therefore, it could be concluded that high nutrient concentration and temperature may alleviate formation of large colonies of Microcystis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Explosive volcanic eruptions are one of the few natural phenomena that can produce global catastrophic effects. On 4 June 2011, an eruption in the Puyehue volcanic complex (40 degrees 35S, 72 degrees 06W, Chile) discharged massive amounts of ash and pumice into the surrounding landscape in Argentina (North Andean Patagonia). The ejected material affected nearby aquatic environments, producing an increase in total suspended solids. 2. We combined field data and laboratory experiment data to determine the effect of the volcanic ashes suspended in the water column on cladoceran populations. 3. During the summer of 2011-2012 (6months after the eruption), zooplankton populations in these lakes decreased, mainly due to the disappearance of cladocerans. This decrease in zooplankton was not caused by food shortage; chlorophyll a concentrations in the lakes were higher than in previous years or in the following season, and no change in phytoplankton size was observed. By the following summer (2013), 18months after the eruption, a recovery of cladoceran populations was observed, with a concomitant decrease in total suspended solids. 4. We performed a life-table experiment, examining Daphnia commutata survival and fecundity at a series of ash concentrations. Ash concentrations of 2, 3, 5 and 8mgL(-1) negatively affected survival and fecundity. Populations exposed to 8mgL(-1) of ash cannot persist; these organisms fail to produce offspring because they die before reaching reproductive age. 5. We conclude that the disappearance of cladocerans was due to the presence of ash. As the sedimentation process occurs, ash concentrations decrease, favouring population recovery, as observed the following summer. When the lakes recovered their original transparency with low total suspended solids values, the cladoceran populations also returned to their historical abundances. 6. Previous data on other explosive volcanic eruptions and the present data indicate that immediately after ash fall, the zooplankton suffer reduced abundance, particularly of non-selective filter feeders such as daphnids. However, recovery of zooplankton population growth can be expected within a few years.					; Balseiro, Esteban/Y-2743-2019	Laspoumaderes, Cecilia/0000-0001-7790-2975; Balseiro, Esteban/0000-0002-5052-0587; Bastidas Navarro, Marcela/0000-0002-6558-0451; Wolinski, Laura/0000-0002-8461-2578; Modenutti, Beatriz/0000-0002-8683-5679													0046-5070	1365-2427				SEP	2013	58	9					1878	1888		10.1111/fwb.12176	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12176													WOS:000321328800010

A Reconstructed Subaerial Hot Spring Field in the ∼3.5 Billion-Year-Old Dresser Formation, North Pole Dome, Pilbara Craton, Western Australia	ASTROBIOLOGY												Recent discoveries of geyserite and siliceous sinter with textural biosignatures in the similar to 3.5 Ga Dresser Formation of the Pilbara Craton, Western Australia, extended the record of inhabited subaerial hot springs on Earth by similar to 3 billion years, back to the time when siliceous sinter deposits are known to have formed on Mars (e.g., at Columbia Hills, Gusev Crater). Here, we present more detailed lithostratigraphic, petrographic and geochemical data collected from 100 measured sections across a similar to 14 km strike length in the Dresser Formation. The data indicate deposition of a wide range of hot spring and associated deposits in a restricted interval that directly overlies a hydrothermally influenced volcanic caldera lake facies, with shoreline stromatolites. Hot spring deposits show abrupt lateral facies changes and include associated channelized clastic deposits that support fluvial, subaerial hot spring deposition. All Dresser hot spring and associated lithofacies have direct analogs with proximal, middle, and distal apron hot spring facies that are characteristic of those from New Zealand, Yellowstone National Park, USA, and Argentina. Rare earth element and yttrium geochemistry shows that the Dresser geyserite shares identical patterns with Phanerozoic hot spring sinters. This geochemical data further supports textural and contextual evidence that indicate the Dresser geyserite formed as a subaerial hot spring sinter. Further, the Dresser hot spring deposits are temporally associated with a diverse suite of textural biosignatures that indicate a thriving microbial community existed within in a Paleoarchean hot spring field. The results presented here underscore the importance of continued study of the early geological record for astrobiological research. In particular these findings reinforce the long-standing hypothesis that hydrothermal systems are optimal places to search for past life on Mars.					; Van Kranendonk, Martin/J-8755-2012	Guido, Diego/0000-0003-4696-5644; Djokic, Tara/0000-0002-2063-3695													1531-1074	1557-8070				JAN 1	2021	21	1					1	38		10.1089/ast.2019.2072	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ast.2019.2072		DEC 2020						33270491					WOS:000595789500001
J	Mendez, J; Hinzman, LD; Kane, DL				Mendez, J; Hinzman, LD; Kane, DL			Evapotranspiration from a wetland complex on the Arctic coastal plain of Alaska	NORDIC HYDROLOGY												Evapotranspiration (ET) from an arctic coastal wetland near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, was studied during the summers between 1994 and 1996. The purpose of the study was to compare different ET models and to gain a better understanding of evapotranspiration from arctic wetlands. The models used to obtain ET from the watershed were the Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB), Priestley-Taylor (PT), Penman-Monteith (PM), Penman Combination (PC), energy balance (EB), water balance (WB), and WE based on Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR). For one of the ponds, evaporation determined by the EB, PT, PC, BREB, WE, and the aerodynamic (AD) methods were also compared. ET during the summer snow-free period for the watershed averaged 1.45 mm/day obtained via the BREB model. Evaporation from all ponds after spring snowmelt averaged 3.11 mm/day (obtained via the WE). Evaporation rate from ponds was on average twice that of the tundra as a whole. Latent heat flux was the dominant energy sink in wetlands and ponds, whereas sensible heat flux dominated in the drier upland area. The PT and PM models compared well to the BREB (used as the standard of comparison for ET) for 1994 and 1995, once parameters were properly calibrated using 1996 data. The BREB compared well with independent values of ET from the water balance and eddy correlation methods. For the pond, the EB, BREB, WE, PT,and AD methods gave very similar evaporation results for the summer.

In this study, a sediment profile from the lake was studied using fossil midge (Diptera: Nematocera) analysis and a hypolimnetic oxygen transfer function was applied to establish baseline conditions of hypolimnetic oxygen. In addition, physical properties of the sediment were determined. The inferred late winter hypolimnetic oxygen content was elevated in the beginning of the sediment sequence, but decreased dramatically at ca. 200 cal BP, as the inferred values indicated frequently anoxic condition coinciding with increased agricultural use in the catchment. The results indicated that dramatic changes have occurred in the taxon composition. The high-oxygen Stempellina-Ablabesmyia monilis-type community first changed to moderate-oxygen Procladius-Stempellinella community, and finally to low-oxygen Microchironomus tener-Chironomus plumosus-type community, following the eutrophication process. These changes in macrobenthic faunal assemblages reproduced considerably higher inferred hypolimnetic oxygen reference condition values for hypolimnetic oxygen, compared to the present status.

Observations of sediment transport in Lake Erie during the winter of 2004-2005	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Time series measurements of current velocity, wave action, and water transparency were made at two sites-one in 24 in of water and the other in 53 in-in Lake Erie during the fall and winter of 2004-2005. The observations at the shallow site show that bottom resuspension occurred several times during the deployment. Although local resuspension, did not occur at the deeper station, several advection episodes were observed. The storms during the observation period were not unusually large, so the processes observed are probably typical of those that occur on a yearly basis. The observations agree reasonably well with previous estimates for both the bottom shear stress during storms, and for the critical shear stress needed to resuspend bottom sediment, but previous estimates of the particle settling velocity are probably too low, while previous estimates of the sediment entrainment rate are too high. The results show that bottom material in the central basin is reworked numerous times before it is finally buried. Deposition in the eastern basin is a more continuous process, but the events observed were not sufficient to match the long-term accumulation rate, so deposition at this site is probably also due in part to larger, more infrequent storms.																			0380-1330					DEC	2007	33	4					816	827		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[816:OOSTIL]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[816:OOSTIL]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000252473500008

New infrared-stimulated luminescence ages for distinctive floodplain deposits of the Kuchchugui Suite (112.5 +/- 9.6 kyr) and thermokarst-lake deposits of the Krest Yuryakh Suite (102.4 +/- 9.7 kyr), respectively, provide new substantial geochronological data and shed light on the landscape history of the Dmitry Laptev Strait region during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5. Groundice stable-isotope data are presented together with cryolithological information for eight cryostratigraphic units and are complemented by data from nearby Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island. Our combined record of ice-wedge stable isotopes as a proxy for past winter climate conditions covers about 200 000 years and is supplemented by stable isotopes of pore and segregated ice which reflect annual climate conditions overprinted by freezing processes. Our ice-wedge stable-isotope data indicate substantial variations in northeast Siberian Arctic winter climate conditions during the late Quaternary, in particular between glacial and interglacial times but also over the last millennia to centuries. Stable isotope values of ice complex ice wedges indicate cold to very cold winter temperatures about 200 kyr ago (MIS7), very cold winter conditions about 100 kyr ago (MIS5), very cold to moderate winter conditions between about 60 and 30 kyr ago, and extremely cold winter temperatures during the Last Glacial Maximum (MIS2). Much warmer winter conditions are reflected by extensive thermokarst development during MIS5c and by Holocene ice-wedge stable isotopes. Modern ice-wedge stable isotopes are most enriched and testify to the recent winter warming in the Arctic. Hence, ice-wedgebased reconstructions of changes in winter climate conditions add substantial information to those derived from paleoecological proxies stored in permafrost and allow a distinction between seasonal trends of past climate dynamics. Future progress in ice-wedge dating and an improved temporal resolution of ice-wedge-derived climate information may help to fully explore the palaeoclimatic potential of ice wedges.

J	Yu, RL; Zhang, C				Yu, Ruolan; Zhang, Chen			Early warning of water quality degradation: A copula-based Bayesian network model for highly efficient water quality risk assessment	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In the context of global climate change and increasingly severe environmental pollution, drinking water quality risk assessments to provide crucial early warnings have become essential routine work. At present, traditional water quality assessment methods are commonly used without considering the correlation among different indicators and the substantial uncertainty from multiple sources, which limit their applications. To address this issue, a copula-based Bayesian network (CBN) method was proposed in this study to concretely evaluate the water quality risk with multiple environmental risk indicators in a large drinking water reservoir in Tianjin city, China. Taking rainfall and water temperature (WT) as external environmental risk indicators and pH, ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and permanganate index (CODMn) as internal environmental risk indicators, the CBN model was constructed to investigate the interaction between the indicators and water quality state and assess the contingent risk. Our results showed that TN and NH3-N should be considered key risk indicators. Additionally, we performed forward and backward risk analyses to assess water quality risk during different seasons and determined the distributions of key indicators under different water quality risk grades. From a time perspective, the reservoir's water quality risk is much higher in winter and spring than in other seasons affected by winter snowfall. From a spatial perspective, the water quality risk is much higher at the reservoir's entrance than at other locations affected by water diversion. Furthermore, we found that the probability of water quality risk events may be relatively high when the TN concentration is 3.6 mg/L to 6.4 mg/L at the reservoir's entrance. The results reveal that the CBN method could be an invaluable decision-support tool for reservoir managers and scientists, which could provide an early warning of water quality degradation by only inputting monitoring data.

J	JONES, RC				JONES, RC			ALGAL BIOMASS DYNAMICS DURING COLONIZATION OF ARTIFICIAL ISLANDS - EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND A MODEL	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Algal biomass during colonization of polyurethane foam islands (5.1 cm .times. 7.6 cm .times. 7.6 cm) was approximated by measuring chlorophyll a levels on islands after exposure periods of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 wk at 6 locations in a small lake in central Tennessee, USA. Chlorophyll, ash-free dry weight and concurrent environmental data were collected for 2 colonization periods: one in late winter and spring (set 1), a 2nd in summer (set 2). During set 1 algal biomass levels, as indicated by chlorophyll a, showed a sharp rise initially, but set 2 islands exhibited a lag period of 7-12 days before a rapid increase in algal biomass was noted. Equilibrium chlorophyll a values were similar for both sets. High levels of phaeopigments were found at stations 2, 3 and 4 during set 2, resulting in large corrections in chlorophyll a readings. Ash-free dry weight values increased steadily through each colonization period. A model of biomass accumulation during colonization was constructed postulating 3 major processes.sbd.photosynthesis, respiration and passive accumulation.sbd.which were modulated by 3 environmental factors.sbd.light, temperature and plankton chlorophyll a levels. For simulations parameter values were taken from the literature where possible. Additional parameter values were set and literature values adjusted when the model was tuned to set 2 data. A simulation with the tuned model using set 1 environmental input resulted in a good prediction of equilibrium values, but a misrepresentation of initial values. The discrepancy between model predictions and data was alleviated when the passive accumulation rate was increased demonstrating the dependence of biomass values early in colonization on passive accumulation from the plankton.

J	Terrazas, A; Hwangbo, N; Arnold, AJ; Ulrich, RN; Tripati, A				Terrazas, Alexa; Hwangbo, Nathan; Arnold, Alexandrea J.; Ulrich, Robert N.; Tripati, Aradhna			Seasonal lake-to-air temperature transfer functions derived from an analysis of 1395 modern lakes: A tool for reconstructing air temperature from proxy-derived lake water temperature	DEPOSITIONAL RECORD												Lacustrine palaeotemperature reconstructions are important for characterising past temperature and hydroclimate change, validating multi-proxy reconstructions and evaluating global climate models. In particular, lake water temperature is often derived from geochemical proxies-including clumped isotopes (Delta 47), oxygen isotopes (delta 18O), alkenone lipids (Uk'37) and GDGT compounds (TEX86). However, global climate models, constrained by resolution, computational demand and cost, are designed to simulate large-scale processes, often at the expense of resolving lakes and simulating lake temperature. Consequently, this limitation complicates the comparison of climate model-simulated variables such as air temperature, with lake water temperature or with other proxy variables (e.g. pollen-derived air temperature), and requires the use of a transfer function to relate lake temperature to air temperature. Previous work developed transfer functions to translate proxy-derived seasonal lake water temperature to mean annual air temperature using ground-based measurements from 88 lakes. This study reports new lake-to-air temperature transfer functions (for annual, spring through summer, spring, summer and warmest month) that incorporate lake surface water temperature, and new variables including latitude and elevation, by analysing climate reanalysis data and long-term satellite observations of surface temperatures for 1395 modern lakes via regression-based inverse modelling. With the use of multiple regression models and a dataset roughly 10 times larger, the error in predictions of mean annual air temperature is reduced by up to 48% compared to previous work. To demonstrate the potential of the new transfer functions for integrating and comparing proxy data with model output, Pliocene and Pleistocene mean annual air temperature was reconstructed from Delta 47-derived lake temperatures and compared with model simulations for the Last Glacial Maximum and mid-Piacenzian warm period.

AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY												Juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss; initially 2-5 g) were exposed for 90 days to either ambient water temperature (natural thermal regime) or to +2 degrees C superimposed above the ambient water temperature (simulated global warming scenario), in the presence or absence of a nominal 70 mu M total ammonia (1290 mu g l(-1) ionized (NH4+), 10 mu g l(-1) unionized (NH3) ammonia). The exposures were conducted in moderately hard de-chlorinated water from Lake Ontario ([Ca2+]=0.96+/-0.02 mM, [Na+]=0.55+/-0.01 mM, [Cl-]=0.737+/-0.004 mh?) on three occasions: over summer (temperature range, 13.0-21.0 degrees C; pH=7.57+/-0.26) and winter (temperature range, 3.5-7.0 degrees C; pH=7.46+/-0.02) without food limitation (satiation feeding), and during summer (temperature range, 13.0-18.5 degrees C; pH=7.38+/-0.09) with food limitation (1% daily, or restricted ration). Lethal temperature, lethal ammonia (1.8 mM total ammonia; approximately 31 700 mu g l(-1) NH4+, 900 mu g l(-1) NH3), and lethal temperature plus ammonia challenges were conducted after each 90-day exposure to determine whether or not chronic pre-exposure conferred any increased tolerance to elevated temperature or ammonia. In addition, acute sublethal ammonia challenges (1.0 mM total ammonia; approximately 17 800 mu g l(-1) NH4+, 200 mu g l(-1) NH3), together with unidirectional Na+ flux measurements, were conducted after the two summer exposures to gain further insight into the effects of prior sublethal ammonia exposure on Na+ regulation, as influenced by ration. The juvenile trout on unlimited ration and exposed to a warming scenario of +2 degrees C exhibited a slight, but significant elevation in lethal temperatures in both summer and winter, but the effect was not observed in fish fed a restricted ration. A challenge to lethal temperature and ammonia in combination reduced the lethal temperature anywhere from 3-7 degrees C for fish from all treatments; pre-exposure to ammonia offered some protective effect. However, prior ammonia exposure did not prolong survival times (LT(50)s) during lethal ammonia challenge, and there was no evidence of acclimation to elevated external ammonia with respect to Na+ balance, These results suggest that juvenile trout are likely to adapt to a small temperature increase, such as could be associated with a global warming scenario, but their potential for doing so may be restricted by sublethal ammonia and by nutritional status.

J	Lemke, AM; Benke, AC				Lemke, AM; Benke, AC			Growth, reproduction, and production dynamics of a littoral microcrustacean, Eurycercus vernalis (Chydoridae), from a southeastern wetland, USA	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Population and production dynamics of the chydorid Eurycercus vernalis were studied in the laboratory and in a small wetland during a 2-y period. Laboratory growth studies were conducted to measure the effects of temperature on E. vernalis growth and reproduction and to develop a multiple-regression equation that used temperature and mass-specific growth rates to estimate secondary production in the field population. Density, biomass, and production were estimated from benthic, water-column, and Nymphaea odorata leaf habitats within vegetated (Nymphaea) and nonvegetated (open-water) areas using monthly samples from the wetland. Eurycercus vernalis exhibited optimal growth, reproductive output, and net reproductive rate when reared at temperatures between 15 and 20degreesC. Reproductive age and egg development time decreased with increasing temperature, and these decreases led to increased innate capacity of population increase and decreased generation time with increasing temperature. In the field studies, annual density, biomass, and production were significantly higher in the Nymphaea zone than the open-water zone during both years. Eurycercus vernalis populations developed during the fall from oversummering resting eggs and reached maximum density, biomass, and daily production in mid to late spring when water temperatures reached 18 to 21degreesC. Mean annual density and biomass for the wetland pond were 2134/m(2) and 42.2 mg dry mass (DM)/m(2) in year 1 (1993), and 1122/m(2) and 19.0 mg DM/m(2) in year 2 (1994-1995). Annual production and the production/biomass ratio were 2138 mg DM m(-2) y(-1) and 50.7/y in year 1, and 1111 mg DM m(-2) y(-1) and 58.5/y in year 2. High production values suggested that E. vernalis is an important component of the microcrustacean community in the Nymphaea zone, especially during winter when production of most microcrustacean species is low.																			0887-3593					DEC	2004	23	4					806	823		10.1899/0887-3593(2004)023<0806:GRAPDO>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1899/0887-3593(2004)023<0806:GRAPDO>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000225376200011

Citizen science reveals unexpected solute patterns in semiarid river networks	PLOS ONE												Human modification of water and nutrient flows has resulted in widespread degradation of aquatic ecosystems. The resulting global water crisis causes millions of deaths and trillions of USD in economic damages annually. Semiarid regions have been disproportionately affected because of high relative water demand and pollution. Many proven water management strategies are not fully implemented, partially because of a lack of public engagement with freshwater ecosystems. In this context, we organized a large citizen science initiative to quantify nutrient status and cultivate connection in the semiarid watershed of Utah Lake (USA). Working with community members, we collected samples from similar to 200 locations throughout the 7,640 km(2) watershed on a single day in the spring, summer, and fall of 2018. We calculated ecohydrological metrics for nutrients, major ions, and carbon. For most solutes, concentration and leverage (influence on flux) were highest in lowland reaches draining directly to the lake, coincident with urban and agricultural sources. Solute sources were relatively persistent through time for most parameters despite substantial hydrological variation. Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus species showed critical source area behavior, with 10-17% of the sites accounting for most of the flux. Unlike temperate watersheds, where spatial variability often decreases with watershed size, longitudinal variability showed an hourglass shape: high variability among headwaters, low variability in mid-order reaches, and high variability in tailwaters. This unexpected pattern was attributable to the distribution of human activity and hydrological complexity associated with return flows, losing river reaches, and diversions in the tailwaters. We conclude that participatory science has great potential to reveal ecohydrological patterns and rehabilitate individual and community relationships with local ecosystems. In this way, such projects represent an opportunity to both understand and improve water quality in diverse socioecological contexts.

J	Glahn, JF; Harrel, JB; Vyles, C				Glahn, JF; Harrel, JB; Vyles, C			The diet of wintering Double-Crested Cormorants feeding at lakes in the southeastern United States	COLONIAL WATERBIRDS												The diet and potential impact of wintering Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) on sport fishing were studied during the winters of 1995-96 and 1996-97 at Lake Beulah, Bolivar County, Mississippi, an oxbow lake of the Mississippi River and during the spring of 1997 at Lake Eufaula, a large manmade reservoir on the border of Alabama and Georgia. The diet was determined from analysis of intact fish and otoliths found in the stomachs of 142 cormorants collected at Lake Beulah and 51 cormorants collected at Lake Eufaula. Consistent with previous studies, the diet at both sites consisted primarily of shad (Dorosoma spp.) and sunfishes (Lepomis spp.), but also included catfish (Ictalurus spp.). The catfish in the diet from both areas were most likely taken from nearby catfish ponds. The size of intact fish in the diet averaged 111 mm, but varied with fish species. For the most part, cormorants appeared to consume the fish species most available. However, based on fish availability data from Lake Beulah, cormorants appeared to have a preference for sunfishes, particularly bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). From cormorant bioenergetic projections of bluegill consumed in 1996-97 and the estimated range of bluegill available, cormorants consumed only a small percentage of the bluegill available at Lake Beulah. With the possible exception of their predation on harvestable size bluegill, burgeoning cormorant populations do not appear to have an appreciable negative impact on southern sport fisheries.																			0738-6028						1998	21	3					431	437		10.2307/1521657	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1521657													WOS:000080711400016

Spatiotemporal variation in the distribution of chytrid parasites in diatom host populations	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1.Many hostparasite interaction dynamics show distinct seasonality. Parasite population growth and invasion success are generally explained by host density dependence, while the direct influence of environmental factors on parasite life history traits has been underreported. 2. In waterbodies, resource availability and environmental conditions change with season (temperature, irradiance and rainfall patterns) and with depth (light, temperature and chemical gradients). Hence, hosts and parasites live in a spatially and temporally variable environment. Such environmental variation leads to structured populations, which in turn have implications for hostparasite interaction dynamics. Nevertheless, time-series data on the vertical distribution of aquatic hosts and their parasites are rare. 3. We present a dataset spanning 1.5years (20082010) of weekly sampling in Lake Maarsseveen (the Netherlands) focussing on the dynamics of the diatom Asterionella formosa and its parasite, the chytrid Zygorhizidium planktonicum, at four depths. Environmental variables measured included ice cover, temperature, global irradiance, light extinction, pH, soluble reactive silicate (SRSi), dissolved nitrate and ortho-phosphate. 4. We observed four host blooms, two in early spring and one each in summer and autumn. Each host bloom was followed by a time-lagged parasite epidemic. Blooms and epidemics started in the uppermost water layers and showed a time lag in onset date with increasing depth. 5. Host abundance was related to SRSi, global irradiance, Schmidt stability and parasite abundance in the upper 10m, whereas at 15m only a relationship with parasite abundance prevailed. Parasite abundance was related to host abundance, light extinction, temperature, SRSi, stability and global irradiance within the upper 10m; again, at 15m, parasite abundance correlated only with host abundance and disease prevalence. 6. Host vertical distribution was less aggregated during isothermal conditions than during thermal stratification, when host abundance was higher in the mixed, photic epilimnion and lower in the dark, colder hypolimnion. Parasite vertical distribution was patchy most of the year. Parasite epidemics seemed to reduce host vertical patchiness as they impacted higher density patches in the photic zone more strongly, a result of both higher host abundance and favourable environmental conditions for the parasite. 7. Seasonal variability and vertical gradients in biotic and abiotic factors expose host and parasite individuals to different environmental conditions even within a single population. Environmental variability affects parasite transmission rates through changes in host abundance and through changes in the strength and outcome of hostparasite interactions.

The deposits contain diatom assemblages dominated by Nitzschia spp., Stephanodiscus spp. and Navicula spp. as well as large quantities of Hantzschia amphioxys, Luticola imbricata and L. mutica and lesser amounts of Aulacoseira italica, A. granulata, A. ambigua, Cyclotella meneghiniana, Amphora montana and Synedra ulna. Samples collected from the Red River in late summer are dominated by the plankton Cyclotella atomus, species of Stephanodiscus, Cyclostephanos sp. 1 (cf. delicatus), Cyclotella meneghiniana, Nitzschia reversa and Nitzschia acicularis. Late summer, floodplain lake plankton are dominated by Fragilaria capucina, Cocconeis placentula, Stephanodiscus parvus/minutulus and Cyclotella atomus. Red River thecamoebian flood assemblages are dominated by Cyclopyxis spp., with lesser amounts of Centropyxis aculeata and Arcella vulgaris. Late summer water samples from the Red River contain very few thecamoebian remains. The majority of the taxa present are Centropyxis aculeata, Arcella vulgaris and Cyclopyxis spp. Floodplain lakes are dominated by benthic thecamoebians, especially Difflugia oblonga and Cucurbitella tricuspis, a eutrophic indicator. The results of this baseline study suggest that diatom and thecamoebian assemblages can characterize flood deposits, within floodplain lake basins, during both very high and moderately high flood years, and that these assemblages are inherently different from those typically found in lakes along the Red River.

Retrospective analysis of associations between water quality and toxic blooms of golden alga (Prymnesium parvum) in Texas reservoirs: Implications for understanding dispersal mechanisms and impacts of climate change	HARMFUL ALGAE												Toxic blooms of golden alga (GA, Prymnesium parvum) in Texas typically occur in winter or early spring. In North America, they were first reported in Texas in the 1980s, and a marked range expansion occurred in 2001. Although there is concern about the influence of climate change on the future distribution of GA, factors responsible for past dispersals remain uncertain. To better understand the factors that influence toxic bloom dispersal in reservoirs, this study characterized reservoir water quality associated with toxic GA blooms since 2001, and examined trends in water quality during a 20-year period bracketing the 2001 expansion. Archived data were analyzed for six impacted and six nonimpacted reservoirs from two major Texas basins: Brazos River and Colorado River. Data were simplified for analysis by pooling spatially (across sampling stations) and temporally (winter, December-February) within reservoirs and generating depth-corrected (1 m) monthly values. Classification tree analysis [period of record (POR), 2001-2010] using salinity-associated variables (specific conductance, chloride, sulfate), dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, temperature, total hardness, potassium, nitrate+nitrite, and total phosphorus indicated that salinity best predicts the toxic bloom occurrence. Minimum estimated salinities for toxic bloom formation were 0.59 and 1.02 psu in Brazos and Colorado River reservoirs, respectively. Principal component analysis (POR, 2001-2010) indicated that GA habitat is best defined by higher salinity relative to nonimpacted reservoirs, with winter DO and pH also being slightly higher and winter temperature slightly lower in impacted reservoirs. Trend analysis, however, did not reveal monotonic changes in winter water quality of GA-impacted reservoirs during the 20-year period (1991-2010) bracketing the 2001 dispersal. Therefore, whereas minimum levels of salinity are required for GA establishment and toxic blooms in Texas reservoirs, the lack of trends in water quality suggests that conditions favorable for toxic blooms pre-date the 2001 expansion. These observations are consistent with a climate change-independent scenario of past GA dispersals in Texas reservoirs driven by novel introductions into pre-existing favorable habitat. Reports of latent GA populations in certain nonimpacted reservoirs, however, provide a plausible scenario of future dispersals characterized by prolonged periods between colonization and toxic bloom development and driven by changes in water quality, natural, or anthropogenic.

The most important is El Hoyo lake. The Miocene and Quaternary sands constitute good aquifers with northward groundwater flow. In the vicinity of El Oso the groundwater table is very shallow and groundwater shows an ascendant vertical component. Groundwaters are fresh and have a bicarbonate-calcium-sodic composition. The natural regime of El Hoyo lake has been modified by the groundwater inputs from nearby boreholes. El Hoyo is a recharge lake during the winter, fed mainly by direct precipitation, but during the summer it can receive groundwater inputs.

J	Bubb, DH; Thom, TJ; Lucas, MC				Bubb, DH; Thom, TJ; Lucas, MC			Movement and dispersal of the invasive signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus in upland rivers	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The American signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus, an invasive species widely introduced throughout Europe, is a major threat to native European crayfish species and is causing increasing concern because of its wide impact on aquatic ecosystems. 2. Whilst various control and management methods have been proposed, very little is known about the factors influencing dispersal and movements of signal crayfish. 3. Sixty-four adult signal crayfish (carapace length 31.9-63.8 mm) were radiotagged in upland rivers in northern England, during four periods. Tracking was carried out at two sites, a low-density establishing population and a high-density established population. Tracking was carried out at both sites concurrently during midsummer (June to August 2002), during late summer (August to September 2001) at the low-density population site and during autumn to winter (October to February 2000/01) at the high-density population site. 4. Maximum movement occurred during midsummer. Temperature appeared to be a major factor influencing the timing and extent of movements between tracking periods. 5. The frequency distribution of the maximum distance moved upstream and downstream by radiotagged crayfish showed an inverse power relationship. The median maximal upstream and downstream distances moved were 13.5 m (range 0-283 m) and 15 m (range 0-417 m), respectively. There was a significant difference between the distributions of upstream and downstream ranges, with greater distances moved downstream. 6. All downstream movements made by crayfish appeared to be active movements and not the result of passive movement during periods of high discharge. There was no apparent influence of size, sex or density on the amount of movement recorded. 7. The study provides important information on the spatial and temporal behaviour of introduced crayfish in upland lotic systems. In contrast to lowland rivers, our results suggest that flow or gradient may influence the invasive potential of signal crayfish in an upstream direction in upland rivers.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				MAR	2004	49	3					357	368		10.1111/j.1365-2426.2003.01178.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2426.2003.01178.x													WOS:000188989600011
J	Peck, LS				Peck, LS			Physiological flexibility: the key to success and survival for Antarctic fairy shrimps in highly fluctuating extreme environments	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The anostracan fairy shrimp Branchinecta gaini inhabits one of the most hostile environments on earth, living in pools and lakes in Antarctica. Between January 2002 and January 2003 temperatures in two pools where B. gaini are extremely abundant on Adelaide Island ranged from -18.6 to -15.7 degreesC in winter, to 19.4 to 17.1 degreesC in summer, whilst air temperatures ranged from -34 to 6.3 degreesC. 2. Branchinecta gaini survives winter as cysts, but endures large summer temperature fluctuations as adults. Cysts froze between -24.4 and -25.7 degreesC. In experiments adults survived 0-10 degreesC with no mortality for 1 week, 25 degreesC for nearly 48 h with 50% mortality, and at 32 degreesC complete mortality occurred in <1 h. 3. Oxygen consumption ((M) over dotO(2)) in B. gaini approximately doubled for every 10 degreesC temperature rise (Q(10) = 2.04) up to 20 degreesC where it reached a peak. Females had, on average 19% higher (M) over dotO(2) than males. Females also had greater metabolic scopes, (maximum-minimum (M) over dotO(2) across temperatures was x3.6 for females, x3.1 for males). 4. Ventilation frequency increased linearly with temperature, and did not decline at 25 degreesC, indicating animals were 'trying' progressively harder to supply oxygen to tissues, and oxygen deficiency was the probable cause of death. Females had a higher ventilation frequency than males (8.6-17.1% higher) and they also exhibited greater scope to raise ventilation frequency (x2.4 for females versus x1.5 for males). 5. Great metabolic flexibility allows B. gaini to exploit extreme, highly fluctuating environments, and larger ventilatory and respiratory scopes allow females to survive higher temperatures than males. Because of this flexibility their prospects for coping with physical environmental change are high.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				SEP	2004	49	9					1195	1205		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01264.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01264.x													WOS:000223376200009

The upper muddy section of Core EC2005 has been formed mainly by suspended sediments derived from the Changjiang (Yangtze) River mouth since 7.3 ka BP. High precipitation and a strengthened EAWM might have played key roles in the high sedimentation rate (1 324-1 986 cm/ka) between 5.9-5.2 ka BP. The EAWM strengthened when the Asian summer monsoon weakened, especially around 5 500 a BP, which corresponded to a worldwide cold event.

Using waterbird surveys and remotely sensed images, we investigated how habitat availability for wintering waterbirds was regulated by seasonal water level fluctuation at Shengjin Lake in the lower Yangtze River floodplain, which is an important wintering area along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. We recorded 52 waterbird species during three field surveys, and categorised them into four groups based on their foraging preferences: grassland, mudflats, shallow water, or deep water. Habitat availability for the four groups was significantly influenced by fluctuations in water level. Habitat for deep-water feeders dominated the lake throughout the year, despite contracting during the wintering season. Water recession during winter exposed more diverse riparian habitats that showed high spatial heterogeneity at the landscape level, with the Upper Lake providing the most suitable habitats for the most diverse and abundant waterbirds. It is worth noting that the water level was regulated highly for aquaculture during the early wintering period, impeding access to suitable habitats for the early-arriving waterbirds that foraged in the riparian mudflats and grassland. Furthermore, rapid water recession from the opening of a sluice gate allowed the exposed moist mudflats to dry up quickly, reducing its suitability for shorebirds and cranes. For effective wintering waterbird conservation in the ephemeral lacustrine wetlands in the Yangtze River floodplain, we suggest stepwise water recession plans, together with the recovery of the aquatic vegetation community and reduction in high-density aquaculture, to synchronise the exposure of foraging habitats with the migration phenology of different waterbird species.					; Zhou, Lizhi/AAF-4535-2021	zhouZhou, li zhiLizhi/0000-0002-5702-4658; 													0959-2709	1474-0001				MAR	2019	29	1					100	114		10.1017/S0959270918000035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0959270918000035													WOS:000460544300007

They will dry seasonally, which makes them fishless ponds devoid of large aquatic predators. These ephemeral ponds are less studied compared to other freshwater ecosystems, such as lakes, although they are considered biodiversity hotspots. The aim was to study the use of vernal pools by birds and bats and compare this to permanent wetlands. We expected higher bat activity and bird abundance in vernal pools than permanent wetlands, and that is related to the spatial and temporal fluctuations of the emerging flying insects. However, no difference in bird abundance, diversity or community was found between the habitats. Regarding bats, the activity of Myotis spp was generally higher at lakes than vernal pools, while the activity of Eptesicus nilssonii increased during the study period regardless of habitat type. No relationship was found between the emergence of insects and the occurrence of bird and bats. Although, vernal pools were not more attractive habitats compared to lakes, they still form an important, largely neglected, diverse habitat type within the boreal landscape.					; Lilley, Thomas/F-2236-2015; Nummi, Petri/AAU-9666-2021	Marteau, Basile/0009-0006-5981-1045; Lilley, Thomas/0000-0001-5864-4958; 														2351-9894				DEC	2023	48								e02722	10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02722	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02722		NOV 2023											WOS:001112508600001

The wetland constitutes two man-made lakes. The lakes size, particularly the Lower Lake, is in continuous reduction, and the vegetation productivity pattern is changing as result of deteriorating water and soil quality, domestic and industrial activities. This research was carried out to map the spatial and seasonal distribution of certain physico-chemical parameters of geo-referenced soil samples covering the two lakes parts using ordinary kriging GIS technique. The study utilized ArcGIS ver.10.7 software, and 76 soil samples collected from representative sites; 38 samples during winter and 38 samples during summer seasons. Soil data were analyzed statistically and geo-statistically based on best fitted semivariogram model. The results indicated high concentrations of some soil physical and chemical parameters, especially in summer and in the Lower Lake of Wadi El-Rayan. The summary statistics for soil parameters had shown that the median of some soil parameters is higher than the mean which indicated the presence of abnormal data. This finding has been approved through the spatial distribution mapping which clearly showed the differences in spatial and temporal distribution between the upper and lower lakes of Wadi El-Rayan. The study concluded that the generated spatial distribution maps using ordinary kriging method can be used as an effective tool in Wadi El-Rap n wetlands' soil management.

A novel approach was used to describe the shape of CDOM absorption between 250-700 nm (distribution of the spectral slope, S(lambda)) and a new fluorescence ratio is used to distinguish between humic and amino acid-like components. Solar ultraviolet irradiance, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), DOM fluorescence and absorption measurements were analysed and compared to other physicochemical parameters. We show that in the UV-exposed mixed layer: (i) fluorescence by autochthonous amino acid-like CDOM, (ii) values of S(lambda) across UV-C and UV-B wavebands increased during the summer months, whereas (i) average molar absorption coefficient and (ii) fluorescence by allochthonous humic CDOM decreased. In the unexposed deep layer of the water column (and in the entire water column in winter), humic-like CDOM presented high values of molar absorption coefficients and low values of S(lambda). UV attenuation coefficients correlated with both chlorophyll a concentrations and CDOM absorption. In agreement with changes in CDOM, minimal values in UV attenuation were found in summer. The S(lambda) curve was used as a signature of the mixture between photobleached and algal-derived CDOM with respect to the unexposed chromophoric dissolved compounds in this thermal stratified lake. Furthermore, S(lambda) curves were useful to distinguish between low and high molecular weight CDOM.					; rossi, claudio/ACK-9713-2022; Loiselle, Steven/ABA-3324-2020; Santinelli, Chiara/F-6735-2012; , chiara/F-6735-2012	Loiselle, Steven/0000-0001-7414-0389; ROSSI, CLAUDIO/0000-0001-6032-1015; , chiara/0000-0002-8921-275X													1474-905X	1474-9092					2010	9	3					304	314		10.1039/b9pp00129h	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b9pp00129h								20221456					WOS:000275377200004

The assemblage diversity of dinoflagellate populations was higher (3.59) in the gulf of Gabes than in the lake of Bizerte, which was closely similar for the two surveys (1.76 in summer to 1.84 in winter). In the gulf of Gabes, harmful microalgae were dominated by Prorocentrum lima (Ehrenberg) Dodge, 1975 and Ostreopsis siamensis Schmidt, 1901, which are known to be benthic or epiphytic species. In the lake of Bizerte, harmful microalgae were dominated by Dinophysis sacculus Stein, 1883 and Dinophysis acuminata Clarapede et Lachmann,1859, which are strictly planktonic species. These later species were most abundant in winter. The densities of P. lima and O. siamensis represented up to 86.4% of the phytoplankton community in the gulf of Gabes while in the lake of Bizerte, their density ranged only between 0-2%. The amount of Dinophysis species reached 41.7% in the lake of Bizerte while these species, dominated by Dinophysis caudata, did not exceed 8.2% in the gulf of Gabes.																			0007-9723	2262-3094					2006	47	3					253	259																WOS:000241495600004

Long-term variation and regulation of internal phosphorus loading in Loch Leven	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Long-term monitoring data (1968-2008) were used to investigate internal phosphorus (P) loading following external P loading reduction in shallow Loch Leven, Scotland. A whole-lake sediment P inventory (upper 3 cm of sediment; 2005) suggested a release-potential of 29.7 tonnes (t) from the release sensitive sediment P pools. 18.5 t was contained within shallow water sediments (< 4.5 m water depth) with 7.6 t in deeper water sediments below the photic zone (> 5 m water depth). The "observed" release (< 5.1 t), estimated using a water column P mass balance approach (1989-2008), was < 5.1 t, indicating the presence of regulating mechanisms. Observed P release declined between 1989 and 2008, with the exception of 2003-2006. Observed P release estimates were positively correlated with annual average water column P concentration after 1989, highlighting the role of internal loading in maintaining poor water quality conditions after management intervention. Multiple regression analysis suggested that internal loading was driven by the wave mixed depth in spring (positive driver), summer water temperature (positive driver) and spring water clarity transparency (negative driver). The potential importance of biological and physico-chemical feedback mechanisms in the regulation of benthic-pelagic coupling and water quality in Loch Leven are discussed.

J	Johnson, SL; Stefan, HG				Johnson, Stephanie L.; Stefan, Heinz G.			Indicators of climate warming in Minnesota: Lake ICE covers and snowmelt runoff	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Records of hydrologic parameters, especially those parameters that are directly linked to air temperature, were analyzed to find indicators of recent climate warming in Minnesota, USA. Minnesota is projected to be vulnerable to climate change because of its location in the northern temperate zone of the globe. Ice-out and ice-in dates on lakes, spring (snowmelt) runoff timing, spring discharge values in streams, and stream water temperatures recorded up to the year 2002 were selected for study. The analysis was conducted by inspection of 10-year moving averages, linear regression on complete and on partial records, and by ranking and sorting of events. Moving averages were used for illustrative purposes only. All statistics were computed on annual data. All parameters examined show trends, and sometimes quite variable trends, over different periods of the record. With the exception of spring stream flow rates the trends of all parameters examined point toward a warming climate in Minnesota over the last two or three decades. Although hidden among strong variability from year to year, ice-out dates on 73 lakes have been shifting to an earlier date at a rate of -0.13 days/year from 1965 to 2002, while ice-in dates on 34 lakes have been delayed by 0.75 days/year from 1979 to 2002. From 1990 to 2002 the rates of change increased to -0.25 days/year for ice-out and 1.44 days/year for ice-in. Trend analyses also show that spring runoff at 21 stream gaging sites examined occurs earlier. From 1964 to 2002 the first spring runoff (due to snowmelt) has occurred -0.30 days/year earlier and the first spring peak runoff -0.23 days/year earlier. The stream water temperature records from 15 sites in the Minneapolis/St Paul metropolitan area shows warming by 0.11C/year, on the average, from 1977 to 2002. Urban development may have had a strong influence. The analysis of spring stream flow rates was inconclusive, probably because runoff is linked as much to precipitation and land use as to air temperature. Ranking and sorting of annual data shows that a disproportionately large number of early lake ice-out dates has occurred after 1985, but also between 1940 and 1950; similarly late lake ice-in has occurred more frequently since about 1990. Ranking and sorting of first spring runoff dates also gave evidence of earlier occurrences, i.e. climate warming in late winter. A relationship of changes in hydrologic parameters with trends in air temperature records was demonstrated. Ice-out dates were shown to correlate most strongly with average March air temperatures shifting by -2.0 days for a 1 degrees C increase in March air temperature. Spring runoff dates also show a relationship with March air temperatures; spring runoff dates shift at a rate of -2.5 days/1 degrees C minimum March air temperature change. Water temperatures at seven river sites in the Minneapolis/St Paul metropolitan area show an average rise of 0.46 degrees C in river temperature/1 degrees mean annual air temperature change, but this rate of change probably includes effects of urban development. In conclusion, records of five hydrologic parameters that are closely linked to air temperature show a trend that suggests recent climate warming in Minnesota, and especially from 1990 to 2002. The recent rates of change calculated from the records are very noteworthy, but must not be used to project future parameter values, since trends cannot continue indefinitely, and trend reversals can be seen in some of the long-term records.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				APR	2006	75	4					421	453		10.1007/s10584-006-0356-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-006-0356-0													WOS:000237793300002

Cs-137-input by suspended load of the river Ammer amounts to about 2 x 10(10) Bq. During floods, settling of coarse particles in the delta area leads to enrichment of Cs-137-contaminated fine suspensoids and to increases in the Cs-137 flux rate, which reaches 70 Bq/m2 d during flood pulses. Low Cs-137-activities and flux rates were found during diatom blooms in the summer months due to dilution of Cs-137-contaminated fines with autochthonous calcite. High Cs-137-activities were observed during fall and during winter circulation as a result of resuspension of littoral and sublittoral sediments. In addition, reduced fluviatile sediment input and decreases in autochthonous production during this time led to enrichment of slow-settling fine particles with higher Cs-137-activities. During the time of investigation (16 months) Cs-137-deposition at the deepest part of the lake amounted to about 2 kBq/m2 in a total sediment flux of 2.2 kg/m2. Both Cs-137-activities and Cs-137-flux rates show an exponential decrease with a half-life of about 250 days, which is caused primarily by the decreasing availability of Cs-137 in the catchment area. All particulate Cs-137 encountered here originates from the Chernobyl-fallout. Changes in the Cs-137-activities and flux-rates as observed here document an example of the long-term behaviour of pollutants with respect to sedimentation after an unique large-scale contamination event.																			0044-3727					AUG	1991	24	4					165	171																WOS:A1991GH53100002

Phytoplankton of Flowing and Flow- Regulated Stretches of the Ural River in Different Seasons	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												Features of the seasonal changes in the number of species, biomass, and the ratio of taxonomic groups of phytoplankton in flowing and regulated sections of the Ural River are described. In the unregulated section of the river, the maximum number of species was recorded in July and in the upper and lower reaches, in October. The maximum biomass of phytoplankton in the unregulated section of the river and in the lower part of the reservoir was recorded in summer, and in the upper part, in spring. The effect of a combination of a number of parameters of water bodies and environmental factors such as the typology, morphometry, flow velocity, input of substances from the catchment area and from the upper areas, and the temperature on the quantitative characteristics of communities is discussed. The leading role of the water temperature for phytoplankton development is shown in the unregulated sections of the river and in the lower part of the reservoir, which are characterized by environmental conditions that impede the abundant development of phytoplankton: high flow rates, the late onset of biological spring, and low nutrient availability. The biomass values correspond to beta-mesotrophic-beta-eutrophic waters in the unregulated sections of the river, to beta-mesotrophic in the upper part of the reservoir, and to alpha-beta-mesotrophic in the near-dam part. According to the saprobity index, the entire area surveyed is characterized by beta-mesosaprobic conditions.

J	Thomas, N; Nigam, S				Thomas, Natalie; Nigam, Sumant			Twentieth-Century Climate Change over Africa: Seasonal Hydroclimate Trends and Sahara Desert Expansion	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Twentieth-century trends in seasonal temperature and precipitation over the African continent are analyzed from observational datasets and historical climate simulations. Given the agricultural economy of the continent, a seasonal perspective is adopted as it is more pertinent than an annual-average one, which can mask offsetting but agriculturally sensitive seasonal hydroclimate variations. Examination of linear trends in seasonal surface air temperature (SAT) shows that heat stress has increased in several regions, including Sudan and northern Africa where the largest SAT trends occur in the warm season. Broadly speaking, the northern continent has warmed more than the southern one in all seasons. Precipitation trends are varied but notable declining trends are found in the countries along the Gulf of Guinea, especially in the source region of the Niger River in West Africa, and in the Congo River basin. Rainfall over the African Great Lakes-one of the largest freshwater repositories-has, however, increased. It is shown that the Sahara Desert has expanded significantly over the twentieth century, by 11%-18% depending on the season, and by 10% when defined using annual rainfall. The expansion rate is sensitively dependent on the analysis period in view of the multidecadal periods of desert expansion (including from the drying of the Sahel in the 1950s-80s) and contraction in the 1902-2013 record, and the stability of the rain gauge network. The desert expanded southward in summer, reflecting retreat of the northern edge of the Sahel rainfall belt, and to the north in winter, indicating potential impact of the widening of the tropics. Specific mechanisms for the expansion are investigated. Finally, this observational analysis is used to evaluate the state-of-the-art climate simulations from a comparison of the twentieth-century hydroclimate trends. The evaluation shows that modeling regional hydroclimate change over the African continent remains challenging, warranting caution in the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies.

J	Hétu, B				Hetu, Bernard			Late Holocene palaeohydrology in Eastern Quebec (Canada):: the contribution of small alluvial fans	GEOMORPHOLOGIE-RELIEF PROCESSUS ENVIRONNEMENT												The late Holocene (from 3500 yr BP to present) in eastern North America is characterised by a marked rise of water levels in lakes and by the accumulation of numerous peat bogs. According to a number of researchers, this could be due to an increase in winter precipitations that would have resulted in large water volumes released by snowmelt, inducing groundwater recharge and rise of water bodies such as lakes and aquifers. This hypothesis seems to be confirmed by stratigraphical studies of small alluvial fans in Quebec. Radiocarbon dates from four small alluvial fans in the Bas-Saint-Laurent and Gaspesie regions indicate that these fans have been formed in the last 3500 years, due to an increase in forest runoff associated with spring snowmelt.																			1266-5304	1957-777X				JAN-MAR	2008		1					45	57																WOS:000256014400004

Occurrence of helminth parasites in the Turkish endemic fish, Squalius anatolicus (Cyprinidae)	BULLETIN OF THE EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION OF FISH PATHOLOGISTS												In this study, the occurrence of helminth parasites in Squalius anatolicus (Cyprinidae) of Sarisu stream (Beysehir - Konya) was investigated from spring 2009 to autumn 2010. S. anatolicus is endemic to Turkey, having very limited distributions. The conservation status of the fish has been referred to as endangered. During the study, a total of 83 Squalius anatolicus specimens were examined for helminth parasites. Two species of helminth parasites [Dactylogyrus vistulae (Monogenea: Dactylogyridae), Pomphorhynchus laevis (Acanthocephala: Pomphorhynchidae)] were found on 51 fish. Male hosts had higher levels of infection of both isolated parasite species. A total of 52 specimens of D. vistulae infected 10 of 83 fish examined, with prevalence and mean intensity of 12.04 % and 5.2 respectively. A total 203 specimens of P. laevis infected 48 of 83 fish examined, with prevalence and mean intensity of infection 57.8 % and 4.2 respectively. Prevalence and infection intensity, length classes, and sex compositions of host populations, as well as the seasonality of infection were obtained and the results compared with other studies. This study is the first parasitological survey of S. anatolicus in Turkey, adding to the knowledge of geographical distribution and host range of two parasite species.

J	Morrison, D				Morrison, D			Inuvialuit fishing and the Gutchiak site	ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY												Much of the prosperity of the traditional Inuvialuit or Mackenzie Inuit of the western Canadian Arctic depended on an unusually rich and productive fishery. This paper explores that fishery using both written and archaeological sources. Living effectively beyond the limits of Pacific salmon, the Inuvialuit depended primarily upon anadromous coregonids (whitefish, ciscos, inconnu), burbot, lake trout, and herring. Fish were taken at all seasons of the year, particularly during the autumn and winter. Both jigging and netting were important capture techniques. Archaeological attention focuses on the Gutchiak site, an important late prehistoric Inuvialuit fishing site located on the Eskimo Lakes, just east of the Mackenzie Delta. It is an outdoor (house-less) site dominated by large hearths, numerous items of fishing gear, and probably the largest quantities of fishbone yet reported from a Canadian Arctic site. Species representation and diversity is compared with that of other regional sites, and investigated in terms of seasonal and locational variables. A large sample of fine-screened (1/8-inch mesh) fishbone from the immediate vicinity of hearths shows very high frequencies of ribs and vertebrae, which suggests that the processing and smoke drying of fillets and backbones was a major activity undertaken at the site.																			0066-6939						2000	37	1					1	42																WOS:000089408100001

The results suggest that (1) the water quality shows an overall improving trend owing to surface-water pollution control measures by the Chinese government in the region; (2) the turbidity of the surface waterbody declined gradually particularly after the spring of 2017; (3) the concentration of chlorophyll-a shows a weak decreasing trend, with a low value in spring and a high value in summer with a four-year average of 31.3 mu g/L; and (4) by comparing the results of the water quality of two ponds inside and outside the Lake Baiyangdian and the overall water quality of Xiong'an New Area, the changes in turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentration during the study period were consistent.					; Yue, Yao/KIC-2405-2024	mingxiu, wang/0009-0008-2150-9929; Wang, Mingxiu/0000-0002-7517-9055; Yao, Yue/0000-0001-5671-6399; 													0255-660X	0974-3006				APR	2021	49	4					857	872		10.1007/s12524-020-01264-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-020-01264-8		NOV 2020											WOS:000590976400001

The recruitment of juveniles was irregular due to the dependence of reproduction on filamentous algae. If compared to literature data, the growth was rather fast but varied between the years; possibly the lack of young age classes led to differences in density dependent factors influencing the growth. After appearance in spring the fish behaved stationary with only single mobile individuals. During this period, the distribution at the shore was very irregular. In autumn the animals disappeared from the shallow shore area. The fish fed exclusively upon benthic organisms and showed a special size spectrum of ingested items. No differences between the genetic forms concerning the investigated aspects were found. This indicates a high niche overlap between the levels of ploidy, which should lead to strong competative interactions. The fragile structure of the population- complex can be described as a sexual parasite- host interaction.

J	Pirajno, F				Pirajno, Franco			Subaerial hot springs and near-surface hydrothermal mineral systems past and present, and possible extraterrestrial analogues	GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS												The principal features, geotectonic settings and association with near-surface hydrothermal mineral systems of ancient and present subaerial hot springs, fumaroles and geysers are herein reviewed. Fumaroles and geysers usually occur in volcanic craters and are in most cases, part and parcel of hot spring environments. Subaerial hot springs are characterised by siliceous- and carbonate-rich chemical sediments, such as sinters and travertines, respectively. Sinters are commonly enriched in various metalliferous elements. Hot springs surface discharges are also characterised by pools, which exhibit bright colours due to the presence of microorganisms. Present-day examples discussed in this paper, include the fumaroles and hot springs of the White Island volcano (New Zealand), the world-renowned Yellowstone caldera (USA) and the Afar region of the East African Rift System. The Afar triangle, in the northern part of East African Rift System, provides a good example of hot springs associated with evaporative deposits. The Tuli-Sabi-Lebombo triple junction rifts were formed during the similar to 180 Ma Karoo igneous event in southern Africa, of which the Tuli arm is the failed rift (aulacogen), as is the Afar region. The Tuli rift is effectively an unusual, if not unique, tectono-thermal setting, because it comprises Karoo-age hot springs systems and associated vein stockworks and breccias, which includes the Messina Cu deposit as well as currently active hot springs with sinter deposits probably due to post-Karoo uplift. Fumarolic pipes in ignimbrites of the Erongo Volcano-Plutonic Complex in Namibia are discussed. This is followed by an example of banded chert rocks in the Killara Formation of the Palaeoproterozoic Capricorn Orogen (Western Australia), interpreted as hot spring chemical sediments, which also show evidence of "fossil" microbial filaments. The paper ends with a brief overview of possible analogues of hot springs on planet Mars.

J	Szymczyk, S				Szymczyk, Slawomir			INFLUENCE OF THE TYPE OF SOIL DEWATERING AND LAND USE ON THE DYNAMICS OF CONCENTRATIONS AND VOLUME OF NITROGEN DISCHARGED FROM AGRICUTLURAL AREAS	JOURNAL OF ELEMENTOLOGY												Studies on the dynamics of concentrations and discharge of nitrogen load through draining systems were carried out in Olsztyn Lake District (Pojezierze Olsztynskie) from 1994 to 2007. For the tests, three basins were selected: an agricultural basin drained with a drainage system, an agricultural and forested basin drained with a network of ditches and drains, and an agriculrual basin with a large forest cover (ca 30%), drained with ditches. The discharge of water through the draining facilities was measured every two weeks, and once a month, N-NO3, N-NO2, N-NH4 as well as Kjeldahl nitrogen were determined. It has been demonstrated that the volume of discharged water carried away through draining systems depends primarily on the amount and distribution of atmospheric precipitation, epsecially during the winter half-year. The dynamics of concentrations and loads of nitrogen in water discharged via draining systems varied with time and depended not only on the amount and distribution of precipitation over a year and in the multi-year period, but also on the type of land use in a given basin and a draining system. It was also found out that intensive rainfall in summer only slightly increased the discharge of water from the basinm drained with the drainage system. The load of total nitrogen flowing away through the draining systems from agricultural basins was closely connected with the amount of discharged water and water levels of mineral nitrogen compounds, especially N-NO3. The highest nitrogen loss from drained areas appeared in spring, which was associated with the seasonal character of water outflow, culmunating in March-April. The highest concentration of total nitrogen (16.69 mg dm(-3)) was determined in water discharged through the network of ditches and drains, but due to a more intensive dewatering of soils, a higher total nitrogen load (on average 33% more) was discharged through drains. Per 1 ha of an agricultural basin, the annual outflow of total nitrogen was up to 13.13 kg, including 12.04 kg of mineral nitrogen.

J	Van Onsem, S; Triest, L				Van Onsem, Stijn; Triest, Ludwig			Turbidity, Waterfowl Herbivory, and Propagule Banks Shape Submerged Aquatic Vegetation in Ponds	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												The aquatic vegetation in nutrient-rich shallow lakes and ponds is structured by the interplay of multiple biotic and abiotic drivers. We tested the contribution of the macrophyte propagule bank and the delayed as well as direct impact of waterbirds on submerged aquatic vegetation in a peri-urban pond system. To clarify the functional hierarchy of predictor variables, effects of herbivorous waterfowl and propagule bank potential were ranked relative to environmental, phytoplankton, and zooplankton indicators. Two aspects of the aquatic vegetation - community composition and total pond-scale cover -were discriminated. Within vegetation communities, phytoplankton biovolume and waterfowl herbivory during summer were linked to low macrophyte abundance, whereas propagule density of angiosperms was positively associated with specific assemblages of submerged macrophytes. High algal biovolume and summer waterfowl grazing seemed to affect maximal pond-scale cover of submerged aquatic vegetation. The presence of waterfowl in cold and spring periods was unrelated to vegetation structure in the consecutive main growth season. In addition, availability of propagules in the sediment did not automatically prompt pond-wide vegetation cover ( especially when overruled by high waterfowl densities), nor did it guarantee a position in the submerged macrophyte community. Nonetheless, propagule bank potential was related to the waterbody's general ecological status, since turbid ponds exhibited impoverished propagule reserves compared to ponds residing in a clear, macrophytedominated state. Inadequate recruitment therefore represents a plausible bottleneck for macrophyte establishment. We conclude that phytoplankton-caused turbidity and high waterfowl biomass densities greatly restrict submerged macrophyte abundance. Propagule banks also participate in structuring submerged aquatic vegetation, though a stronger role is reserved for herbivorous waterfowl.					; Van Onsem, Stijn/AAE-9572-2019	Triest, Ludwig/0000-0002-4946-9614; 													1664-462X					OCT 16	2018	9								1514	10.3389/fpls.2018.01514	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2018.01514								30459783					WOS:000447379200001
J	HAWES, I; SMITH, R				HAWES, I; SMITH, R			SEASONAL DYNAMICS OF EPILITHIC PERIPHYTON IN OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE TAUPO, NEW-ZEALAND	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												The biomass and species composition of epilithic periphyton in oligotrophic Lake Taupo was measured over a full year. Measurements of photosynthetic carbon uptake were made during summer and early winter. The lake supported a high biomass of epilithic periphyton throughout the year, averaging 100-600 mg m-2 over the 0-35 m water depth and peaking in early summer. Periphyton extended to at least 40 m depth. Depth-integrated carbon fixation rates of 242-362 mg m-2 h-1 were measured. Periphyton constituted more than 90% of the algal biomass and carbon fixation within the littoral zone, but less than 2% of production on a whole-lake basis. Based on taxonomic composition, periphyton could be divided into three zones, surface (0-2 m), mid water (2-20 m) and deep (> 20 m). The diatoms Aulacosira granulata, Rhopalodia novae zealandiae, Epithemia sorex, and Fragilaria spp. dominated the deep assemblage, Tolypothrix tenuis and Mastogloia elliptica the mid water, and Scytonema, Dichothrix, and filamentous chlorophytes the shallow zone. Indicator pigments, analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography, confirmed these groupings. Biomass-specific rates of photosynthesis were low in shallow water (assimilation number less-than-or-equal-to 1 at 1 m depth) and at depths of 20 m and below, photosynthesis was light-limited. We hypothesise that the periphyton community was slow-growing and that the high biomass seen at all depths resulted from gradual accrual with low rates of loss.

J	Rimmer, A; Hurwitz, S; Gvirtzman, H				Rimmer, A; Hurwitz, S; Gvirtzman, H			Spatial and temporal characteristics of saline springs: Sea of Galilee, Israel	GROUND WATER												Spatial and temporal characteristics of the saline springs that emerge along the western shore of the Sea of Galilee (Lake Kinneret) are analyzed. Three groups of onshore springs (Tiberias, Fuliya, and Tabgha) and two groups of offshore springs (Barbutim and Maagan), contribute saline water to the lake with concentrations in the range of 300 to 18,000 mgCl/L, depending on location and season. It is well accepted that water emerging from these springs is a mixture of two endmembers: deep-seated saline ground water and shallow, fresh circulating ground water. Temporal trends of discharge rates and of chloride (representing the deep saline aquifer) and nitrate (representing the shallow fresh water aquifer) concentrations within each group of springs are presented. Results show the proportions of the two water bodies while mixing are time dependent. Discharge and concentration peaks in Tabgha springs precede those in Fuliya and Tiberias springs by approximately two months. An analytical solution shows that in Tabgha, variations of these parameters are mainly controlled by recharge variations in the Galilee, and follow an exponential function. In Fuliya and Tiberias, variations of these parameters are mainly dependent on lake level, and follow a sine-cosine function. The different patterns are attributed to different hydraulic properties of the discharge area.

J	Long, JB; Yao, L; Jiang, HY				Long, Jibo; Yao, Lun; Jiang, Hanyu			Heat load-carrying capacity of surface water source and its heating load matching characteristics	ENERGY AND BUILDINGS												Meteorological parameter changes not only affect the heat load-carrying capacity of the surface water, but also affect the heat load demand of the building, thus changing the heat load matching between the water source heat pump system and the users. In order to study the climatic adaptation of the heat load-carrying capacity, this paper establishes an analytical model of the water body's heat load-carrying capacity and the building's heat load with the solar radiation intensity, the change of the water body and the heat extraction time as variables. Experimental and simulation studies on the heat load-carrying capacity of lake water were carried out under the winter climate conditions in hot summer and cold winter areas. The results show that increasing the depth or area of the lake can improve the heat load-carrying capacity. Solar radiation is an important factor affecting the temperature of surface water body, the stronger the solar radiation the greater the temperature rise of the water body. Changes in outdoor air temperature have a significant impact on water temperature, and a sudden drop in outdoor air temperature will result in a sharp drop in water temperature. When the water body area was 3000 m2 and 50000 m2, the maximum integrated temperature drop of the water body was 15.0 degrees C and 9.7 degrees C, which was 2.02 and 4.85 times of the temperature drop of heat extraction, respectively. Reduced heat load-carrying ca-pacity of the surface water body or decreased COP of the heat pump is an important reason why the surface water source heat pump heat supply fails to meet the user's heat demand in winter.

Collections were made every 2 wk during the summer and monthly during the winter from April 1978 to April 1979. Since the lakes were similar in most respects, including nannoplankton density, net phytoplankton density, temperature, depth, O2 concentration and phosphorus levels, the seasonal cycles of the main species (Keratella cochlearis, Kellicottia longispina, Polyarthra remata, P. vulgaris, Cyclops spp., Diaptomus spp.) were generally similar throughout the study area. Changes in the densities of herbivorous species were poorly correlated with fluctuations in nannoplankton and net plankton availability, implying that food did not limit development. Although predatory copepods, particularly Cyclops spp., were abundant, they also had no measurable impact on the main species. Temperature probably controlled the seasonal cycles and the ultimate population size of most zooplankters.																			0020-9309						1980	65	3					357	378		10.1002/iroh.19800650307	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19800650307													WOS:A1980KY83000004
J	Ramamurthy, P; Pardyjak, ER				Ramamurthy, Prathap; Pardyjak, Eric R.			Toward understanding the behavior of carbon dioxide and surface energy fluxes in the urbanized semi-arid Salt Lake Valley, Utah, USA	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												This paper describes the Salt Lake Valley urban flux study that was designed to understand the role of vegetation and urbanization on CO2 and surface energy fluxes over surfaces typical of urbanized and pre-urbanized land cover in the semi-arid Salt Lake Valley. The eddy covariance technique was applied at two different sites with distinct land forms within an urbanizing mountain basin. One site was located in a suburban neighborhood with substantial mature vegetative cover (urban forest), prototypical of many residential neighborhoods in the valley, and the other site was in a pre-urban area. Results indicate that the suburban site was a net sink of CO2 during the midday period in the summer due to photosynthetic activity and was a source of CO2 during the evening and nighttime periods. The pre-urban site was a net source of CO2 with positive fluxes throughout the day. Even though the vegetation at the suburban site sequestered carbon dioxide during the daytime in the summer months, the daily net CO2 flux remained positive (i.e. a net source). In addition, the net CO2 emission at the suburban site was found to be three times greater in the fall than during summer. The vegetative cover around the suburban site also had a significant impact on the partitioning of the surface energy fluxes. During the summer months, the contribution of the latent heat flux was substantially higher at the suburban site, while the sensible heat flux was much larger at the pre-urban site. The general behavior of the energy and CO2 fluxes are consistent with typical climate modification due to urbanization in semi-arid climates (i.e. introduction of an urban forest), but quite different from changes reported in more mesic climates where highly vegetated regions are replaced with urban surfaces.

The sequence is characterized by interglacial forest successions followed by alternating woodland and steppe phases. Higher levels of runoff formed lacustrine habitats during post-interglacial, cool steppe (woodland) phases. These were characterized by diverse chironomid assemblages with up to 27 chironomid morphotypes occurring simultaneously. Warmer forest phases were mostly void of chironomids when the site Schoningen 13 II fell dry owing to higher vegetational coverage and therefore lower runoff. Transitional periods between woodland and steppe phases show higher abundances of profundal, bottom-dwelling chironomid taxa, suggesting oligo-mesotrophic aquatic conditions, while steppe phases are dominated by shallow-lake taxa with higher tolerance to increasing productivity. We applied temperature inference models to the chironomid assemblages based on a Swiss-Norwegian and a Swiss-Norwegian-Polish chironomid-temperature calibration data set to reconstruct mean July air temperatures for the Reinsdorf sequence. The Swiss-Norwegian-Polish training set (TS) seems better suited owing to a longer temperature gradient and the presence of the dominant taxon, Propsilocerus lacustris-type, which is missing from the Swiss-Norwegian TS. In sections of the record with low taxon richness (Shannon index <2) and a dominance of P. lacustris-type, indicating increased nutrient impact, summer temperatures may have been overestimated by the Swiss-Norwegian-Polish TS. In the other sections, the chironomid-based reconstructions based on the Swiss-Norwegian-Polish TS were in line with ostracod and plant remains-based temperature reconstructions, suggesting summer temperatures of the post-interglacial Reinsdorf oscillations between 16.5 and 22 degrees C. Our results show that summer air temperatures were lower during warmer, wetter transitional zones (-0.5-0.2 degrees C colder/warmer than today) and increasing during cooler, dry steppe phases (1 degrees C warmer than today), most likely caused by higher continentality.					; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023	Krahn, Kim/0000-0002-1646-7612; Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Rigterink, Sonja/0000-0003-2259-5175; Schwalb, Antje/0000-0002-4628-1958; Kotrys, Bartosz/0000-0002-2732-6970; 													0300-9483	1502-3885				OCT	2024	53	4			SI		525	542		10.1111/bor.12658	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12658		APR 2024											WOS:001202258700001
J	SCHAEFER, JA; PRUITT, WO				SCHAEFER, JA; PRUITT, WO			FIRE AND WOODLAND CARIBOU IN SOUTHEASTERN MANITOBA	WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS												The effects of fire on the Aikens Lake population of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) were studied over a 2-year period. Quantity, quality, and accessibility of forages were determined in recently-burned (5-yr-old) habitats and compared to those in intermediate (37 yrs) and old-growth (90-160 yrs) stands. These measures were correlated with patterns of habitat use by Aikens caribou over 2 winters. Forage productivity was determined by harvesting the current growth of vascular plants and standing crop of arboreal and terrestrial lichens. Quality of forage was inferred from the content of acid detergent fiber and published digestibility studies of Rangifer. Accessibility of forage was estimated from the Varrio Snow Index, including hardness and thickness of snow cover, and from the intersection frequency of windfallen trees. Principal components analysis revealed that original floristic distinctions between jack pine (Pinus banks-iana) and mixed forest communities persisted after fire. Compared to old-growth stands (90 yrs), most burned upland habitats exhibited enhanced productivity of summer forages but a decline in quality and accessibility of winter forages. This deterioration of winter habitat for caribou resulted from the loss of lichens (Cladina spp.) in the predominant jack pine communities, the increase in both thickness and hardness of snow cover, and the accumulation of deadfalls. The oldest stands (160 yrs) showed the lowest forage productivity, including lichens, but had the most favorable nival conditions. Caribou winter travel and feeding were significantly skewed towards use of lakes, old-growth uplands and bogs, and away from burned uplands. In both winters of study, Aikens caribou continued to exploit the remnant lichen supply in old-growth bogs and crown-burned habitats within the limits of the 5-year-old burn. In late winter, however, caribou shifted their activity entirely outside the recent burn in favour of stands greater-than-or-equal-to 55 years old. The heightened accumulations of snow and deadfalls are implicated in this late-winter range abandonment. The winter range of the population, 5.5 years after fire, was mutually exclusive with its prefire range. Taiga in southeastern Manitoba is not suitable for woodland caribou in its recently-burned and intermediate stages (up to 50 yrs following fire). Yet fire may be necessary to maintain optimal, long-term lichen resources. Due to the remnant lichen supply in burned areas and the delay in the accumulation of windfallen trees, the short-term detriments of fire may not be fully realized until 5 years or more after burning. Woodland caribou adapt to these short-term effects by abandoning their range. Local fire history-in particular, proximity to alternative, lichen-rich stands-must be considered in the management of woodland caribou habitat.

J	Senent-Aparicio, J; López-Ballesteros, A; Nielsen, A; Trolle, D				Senent-Aparicio, Javier; Lopez-Ballesteros, Adrian; Nielsen, Anders; Trolle, Dennis			A holistic approach for determining the hydrology of the mar menor coastal lagoon by combining hydrological & hydrodynamic models	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												A combination of hydrological and hydrodynamic modelling can be applied to understand the hydrology and key water balance components of lakes and lagoons. In this research, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and the QGIS Water Ecosystems Tool (QWET) were applied for the Mar Menor coastal lagoon and its watershed known as Campo de Cartagena. First, the SWAT model was calibrated and validated based on remote sensing evapotranspiration data. Results showed an acceptable performance of the SWAT model in both calibration (R2 = 0.63, NSE = 0.62, PBIAS = 2.91%) and validation (R2 = 0.68, NSE = 0.68, PBIAS = 2.47%) periods on a monthly basis. The SWAT simulated streamflow was fed into the QWET model to simulate the water balance of the lagoon. The hydrodynamic model performance was evaluated based on a comparison between simulated and observed water temperatures and also the model estimated evaporation. Simulated daily temperatures showed a good agreement with observed data by capturing the timing and inter-annual variations, with an NSE of 0.98, and a BIAS of 2.7%. Our water balance estimation, using the reference period 2003-2019, yields a mean annual rainfall over the lake of 301 mm and a mean annual evaporation of 1325 mm. The average surface runoff and groundwater discharge to the lagoon are 49 hm3/year and 11 hm3/year, respectively. Extreme storm events cause annual surface runoff to vary between 8 hm3/year and 202 hm3/year. The water balance was closed with the water exchange with the Mediterranean Sea, resulting in an overall positive flow from the Mediterranean Sea of 82 hm3/year. Our study showed that during summer months, in particular, there is considerable inflow of Mediterranean water to the lagoon, whereas for some autumn and winter months (November, December and January) there is a net outflow from the lagoon to the Mediterranean. This novel approach by combining the SWAT hydrological model and QWET hydrodynamic model complex provides a useful tool for understanding the hydrology of the lagoon and may also play a role for decision makers when developing strategies for mitigating eutrophication.					; Lopez-Ballesteros, Adrian/R-9003-2018; Trolle, Dennis/B-5465-2008; López-Ballesteros, Adrián/R-9003-2018; Senent Aparicio, Javier/L-2481-2017	Senent Aparicio, Javier/0000-0002-1818-5811; Lopez-Ballesteros, Adrian/0000-0001-6350-5653; Nielsen, Anders/0000-0002-5885-4100; Trolle, Dennis/0000-0001-7568-2411; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				DEC	2021	603		D						127150	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127150	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.127150		DEC 2021											WOS:000731711900007

Variable Reduction for Water Quality Investigation using VARCLUS Technique. A Case Study of Mosul Dam Lake, Northern Iraq	WATER RESOURCES												Water quality data parameters consist of a large data set. Such a large amount of data incurs great effort in processing and conducting visualization techniques to facilitate the analysis and building of the necessary views for decision makers. The current study included a set of steps to data reduction for 34 parameters during two seasons, at different sites and depths for Mosul Dam Lake, Northern Iraq by using VARCLUS technique. VARCLUS showed that there were seven main clusters during winter with 77% of the total variation in the dataset. Depending on R-ratio results indicating that there are 12 parameters could be used to monitoring the water quality and F, SO4 and Li are appears to be more important parameters than among them to predict overall the water quality of the lake for this season. During summer eight main clusters with 79% of the total variation displayed result of summer season. B, Na and S were more significant parameters depending on R-ratio among 11 parameters for this season. Each of Li, Ni, S, and total inorganic carbon are dominate parameters during measurement periods. This technique for water quality assessment could be using to reduce by about 64% of water quality data and can support decision-makers by providing an effective and secure tool for managing and monitoring the reservoir.

The Water Framework Directive of the European Commission aims to protect water resources and monitoring is seen as an essential step for achieving this goal. Remote sensing can provide frequent data for large scale studies of water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a (chl-a). In this work we use a dataset of maps of chl-a derived from over 200 MERIS (MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) satellite images for comparing water quality of 12 perialpine lakes in the period 2003-2009. Besides the different trophic levels of the lakes, results confirm that the seasonal variability of chl-a concentration is particularly pronounced during spring and autumn especially for the more eutrophic lakes. We show that relying on only one sample for the assessment of lake water quality during the season might lead to misleading results and erroneous assignments to quality classes. Time series MERIS data represents a suitable and cost-effective technology to fill this gap, depicting the dynamics of the surface waters of lakes in agreement with the evolution of natural phenomena.

We examined glacier change since the last Little Ice Age advance in the late 19th century by mapping historic glacier areas using clearly defined moraines. At least six glaciers existed in the Trinity Alps around the 1880s and estimated glacier cover was at least 55.4 ha (0.554 km(2)). We tracked changes in two glaciers and two perennial snowfields since that time. Total glacier area decreased by 79% (43.8 ha to 9.1 ha) from the 1880s to 1994. By 2013, glacier area decreased another 7% of the 1880s area to 6.0 ha. Overall, retreat was similar for Salmon Glacier (-89%) and Grizzly Glacier (-84%), but since 1994 Salmon retreat has been much faster, 53% versus 16% for Grizzly. The extended 2012 to 2016 drought resulted in catastrophic retreat of both glaciers such that by 2015 Salmon Glacier disappeared and Grizzly Glacier retreated to 1.67 ha and partially stagnated, a -97% loss of total glacier area since the 1880s. Two snowfields (3.02 ha total area in 1955) were tracked since 1955, the Mirror Lake snowfield disappeared by the summer of 2013 and the Canyon Creek snowfield disappeared by October 2014. The unusually warm summer temperatures since 2005 combined with extremely low winter precipitation from 2013 to 2015 caused rapid retreat and near elimination of the Trinity Alps perennial snow and ice threatening local biodiversity that depends on these features.																			0029-344X	2161-9859				WIN	2020	94	1					44	61		10.3955/046.094.0104	http://dx.doi.org/10.3955/046.094.0104													WOS:000529335100004

We studied seasonal changes in the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of larval Chironomus anthracinus and C. plumosus from the profundal sediments of four contrasting lakes. 2. Pronounced seasonal changes in both delta(13)C and delta(15)N values were evident in chironomid larvae of both species from two summer-stratified, eutrophic lakes: Esthwaite Water and Wyresdale Park. Changes were most marked in the larvae of C. plumosus and in larvae from greater depths. In contrast, neither C. anthracinus in summer-stratified but mesotrophic Schohsee, nor C. plumosus in polymictic Grosser Binnensee, showed marked seasonality in larval stable isotope ratios. 3. The particularly strong C-13-depletion of larvae from the stratified, eutrophic lakes is attributed to a significant contribution of methane-derived carbon to their diets. Feeding by larvae on isotopically light methanotrophic bacteria appears to occur mainly when autumn overturn of the water column restores oxygenated conditions to the sediment surface. At this time both delta(13)C and delta(15)N values of larvae decreased sharply. 4. Changes in the mean stable isotope ratio of the larval populations can also occur when larger, more isotopically light, larvae pupate and emigrate from the population to hatch as imagos. This effect can induce seasonal changes in larval isotope values even in lakes in which there is no evidence of a significant involvement of methane-derived carbon in their diets. Variations in emergence patterns between species and between lakes may generate differences in the seasonal pattern of change in stable isotope ratios in larval populations. 5. Our results emphasise the importance of adequate seasonal sampling if stable isotope ratios are to be used as biomarkers to study the role of key groups, such as chironomid larvae, in the trophic structure of lakes.					; Grey, Jonathan/B-3346-2012; Jones, Roger/C-7703-2011	Grey, Jonathan/0000-0001-9069-2271; Jones, Roger/0000-0002-0835-8264													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUN	2004	49	6					681	689		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01217.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01217.x													WOS:000221492000001

Based on a mowing experiment in two calcareous fens near Lake Neuchatel, Switzerland, we investigated whether shea-term treatment effects (i.e. during the first four years) were confirmed by longterm results (13 - 14 yr). Plots were mown in summer or in winter or left unmown. The main long-term trends in overall species composition (based on percentage cover estimates) were already observable in the first four years: mown and unmown plots diverged, whereas summer-cut and winter-cut plots remained similar. At the individual species level, however, short-term and long-term treatment effects differed considerably: many species whose abundance seemed affected by treatments during the first four years showed no response in the long term, and vice versa. These discrepancies were similar when based on cover estimates or on counts of shoots. Species responses did actually depend on the time scale considered. Short-term and long-term treatment effects on species richness were similar (i.e. a decrease in unmown plots), although only long-term effects were significant. Treatment effects on the above-ground biomass varied considerably, and short-term trends (lower biomass in unmown plots) differed from long-term trends (higher biomass in unmown plots). Our sites showed little overall change in species composition during the period investigated, and treatment effects were low compared with other similar experiments. if study sites are less stable or treatment effects more drastic, a short-term evaluation is expected to be even less reliable. Knowledge on species dynamics at a site may help to choose the adequate spatial and temporal scale of investigation, and thus increase the efficiency of management experiments.

Using the combined sampling method of bulk and volume reduced sampling the samples are collected from 19 different locations in winter, summer and monsoon weather for understanding the seasonal impact. MPs particles have been observed in the surface waters of all the water bodies of the Bhopal city across all seasons. The overall and average maximum MPs has been observed in Shahpura Lake near children's park and fishing area with overall abundance (SH2-1640 f 162.69 particles/m3) and average abundance (SH2-1410 f 162.69 particles/m3) during the monsoon of 2022. The least polluted waterbody is Kerwa dam having overall abundance of 510 f 43.20 particles/m3 and average abundance of 570 f 43.20 particles/m3 which was observed in summer of 2022. The identification by FTIR showed that the nylon and polypropylene are the most abundant types of polymers in all the locations. Statistical analysis shows that there is strong positive correlation in between the MPs abundance in different seasons. With all the above studies it can be concluded that MPs abundance in freshwater is increasing with the passage of time which is having adverse effect on the surrounding environment.

However, previous studies have shown abundant methanotrophic bacteria (MOB) and photoautotrophic green sulphur bacteria (GSB) in some boreal lakes. We used genetic and lipid biomarkers to follow the seasonal succession of the abundance and carbon biomass of the major bacterial groups in Lake Mekkojarvi, a small Finnish polyhumic lake with a large anoxic hypolimnion. Biomarkers were based on length heterogeneity analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (LH-PCR) and on phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Representative strains closely affiliated to the dominant bacterial groups in the lake were cultured and their characteristic PLFA biomarkers were selected. According to these biomarkers, the relative abundance and biomass of the anaerobic photo autotrophic bacteria (e.g. GSB) were extremely high in the pelagial during summer stratification (on average 47% of the bacterial rRNA genes and 77% of the total particulate organic carbon). Type I MOB were especially abundant during autumn mixing, forming on average 32%-but occasionally up to 73%-of the carbon biomass. Heterotrophic bacteria affiliated to Actinobacteria and Poly nucleobacter spp. together contributed 1 to 8% of the seasonal carbon biomass in the lake, although their genetic biomarkers were much more common. The results indicate that a significant proportion of the bacterial biomass was formed through methanotrophic and photoautotrophic production, both being comparable with the summer primary production rates of phytoplankton. These findings challenge the current model of the heterotrophic microbial pathway as the principal basis for microbial mobilisation of carbon and energy in freshwater food webs in oxygen-stratified lakes.

The season-specific sensitivity of the record provides an opportunity to more robustly evaluate long-term variability in large-scale Pacific teleconnection patterns such as ENSO and PDO, as precipitation anomalies associated with these teleconnection patterns occur primarily in winter. Seasonal climate composite maps of high and low snowpack years at the study site demonstrate that winter precipitation is strongly linked to the relative strength of the Aleutian Low and the associated changes from/to more meridional or more zonal steering level wind patterns. Minnetonka Cave data suggest wetter/cooler than modern early Holocene winters, and a dry middle Holocene with a consistent warming trend from 7400 to 3800 BP. After 4000 BP, data suggest a return to wetter and/or colder than modern winters for much of the late Holocene.

J	Lees, K; Clark, SP; Malenchak, J; Chanel, P				Lees, Kevin; Clark, Shawn P.; Malenchak, Jarrod; Chanel, Paul			A novel methodology to quantify hydraulic conveyance through an ice-impacted lake-outlet system	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												River ice can pose considerable challenges to hydropower operations in cold regions. Relative to open-water conditions, the presence of ice in various forms contributes to lower hydraulic efficiency. At the outlet of Lake Winnipeg, maintaining winter conveyance through the channels of the Outlet Lakes Area (OLA) is of paramount importance for downstream energy production on the Nelson River. The complex hydraulic conditions of the OLA are attributed to various factors, including the influence of hydraulic system operation, flow routing through lakes and rivers with non-uniform attributes, and the presence of dynamic ice processes throughout winter. In this study, a methodology was designed to quantify the impacts of ice on the OLA hydraulics using a combination of numerical modelling and statistical techniques. This approach includes adaptation and configuration of a two-dimensional river ice model, selection of suitable performance metrics, and derivation of hydraulic datasets for model simulations using historical observations and statistical relationships. Numerical modelling simulations feature treatments for predominant ice processes in the OLA, including freeze-up jamming, thermal growth and decay of a stable ice cover, and under cover transport and deposition of brash ice. The methodology was evaluated using historical winters 1996-1997 to 2020-2021, with most results falling within an acceptable performance range, even in response to varying hydro-meteorological conditions. Instances of error exceeding accepted thresholds were attributed mainly to factors outside of the study, including uncertainty in discharge estimation and the effects of mid-winter forebay operation. Influence of Lake Winnipeg water levels on winter hydraulics was identified as significant, as higher upstream Lake Winnipeg water levels can mitigate ice impacts by providing more hydraulic head for conveyance. As expected, ice restriction severity also varies in accordance with heat fluxes. Targeted areas for improvement of the methodology and future work are discussed, including enhancing the simulation of the thawing ('pre-breakup') period and field verification of flow split quantities during winter. The methodology presented provides an estimate of ice-impacted hydraulic conveyance which serves to benefit hydropower operators, regional water resources studies, and further investigations of river ice impacts that can be attributed to future climate change.																			0165-232X	1872-7441				FEB	2023	206								103713	10.1016/j.coldregions.2022.103713	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2022.103713		NOV 2022											WOS:001007898300001

However, nutritional and contaminant-related implications of recent dietary shifts are hindered by the fact that few studies have documented foods consumed by diving ducks before zebra mussels invaded the Great Lakes in 1988. We examined diets of greater scaup (Aythya marila), lesser scaup (Aythya affinis), and long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis) collected from eastern Lake Ontario during autumn 1986 and 1987 to determine differences among the 3 species. Gastropods were the main food item of greater (92% aggregate dry mass) and lesser scaup (86%), but they consumed relatively small amounts (3% and 7%, respectively) of amphipods. In contrast, amphipods made up 66% of the diets of long-tailed ducks; gastropods were 28% of their diet. Amphipod populations have increased and native gastropods decreased in the presence of zebra mussels in the lower Great Lakes, such that zebra mussel invasion likely has had greater dietary implications for scaup than for long-tailed ducks. Dietary shifts from nonfilter-feeding gastropods to filter-feeding zebra mussels likely contributed to elevated contaminant burdens in lesser and greater scaup on the lower Great Lakes. We encourage further research into the diet-, nutrient-, and contaminant-related implications of zebra mussel induced ecological changes to the Great Lakes.																			2328-5540					SPR	2005	33	1					81	91		10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[81:ADOGSL]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2005)33[81:ADOGSL]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000230521000014

These two species showed a 1-year life cycle. The total densities of chironomids varied from 0 to 5,927 ind. m(-2); no chironomids, or very low densities, were found during the winter/spring period, probably due to low oxygen concentrations in the medial part of the lake. These low oxygen concentrations probably caused the relocation of larvae from the medial part of the sedimentary area at the same time.

Infection regularly manifests in numerous macroscopic cysts on the fins of two to three month-old pondcultured carp fingerlings in July and August. However, a Thelohanellus infection is also common on the scales of two to three year-old common carp in ponds and natural waters in May and June. Based on myxospore morphology and tissue specificity, infection at both sites seems to be caused by the same species, namely T. nikolskii. This presumption was tested with molecular biological methods: SSU rDNA sequences of myxospores from fins of fingerlings and scales of older common carp were analysed and compared with each other and with related species available in GenBank. Sequence data revealed that the spores from the fins and scales represent the same species, T. nikolskii. Our study revealed a dichotomy in both infection site and time in T. nikolskii-infections: the fins of young carp are infected in Summer and Autumn, whereas the scales of older carp are infected in Spring. Myxosporean development of the species is well studied, little is known, however about the actinosporean stage of T. nikolskii. A previous experimental study suggests that aurantiactinomyxon actinospores of this species develop in Tubifex tubifex, Muller, 1774. The description included spore morphology but no genetic sequence data (Sze ' kely et al., 1998). We examined >9000 oligochaetes from Lake Balaton and Kis-Balaton Water Reservoire searching for the intraoligochaete developmental stage of myxozoans. Five oligochaete species were examined, Isochaetides michaelseni Lastochin, 1936, Branchiura sowerbyi Beddard, 1892, Nais sp., Muller, 1774, Dero sp. Muller, 1774 and Aelosoma sp. Ehrenberg, 1828. Morphometrics and SSU rDNA sequences were obtained for the released actinospores. Among them, from a single Nais sp., the sequence of an aurantiactinomyxon isolate corresponded to the myxospore sequences of T. nikolskii.

J	Lowe, DJ; Pittari, A				Lowe, David J.; Pittari, Adrian			The Taupo Eruption Sequence of AD 232 ± 10 in Aotearoa New Zealand: A Retrospection	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI												The Taupo eruption, also known as eruption Y, occurred in late summer to early autumn (typically late March to early April) in AD 232 +/- 10 yr at Taupo volcano, an 'inverse' caldera volcano underlying Lake Taupo in the central Taupo Volcanic Zone, North Island, Aotearoa New Zealand. The complex rhyolitic eruption, the most powerful eruption globally in the last 5000 years, lasted between several days and several weeks and generated five markedly contrasting pyroclastic fall deposits (units Y1 to Y5) followed by the extremely violent emplacement of a low-aspect-ratio ignimbrite (unit Y6). The fall deposits include three phreatomagmatic units, Y1, Y3, and Y4, the latter two being the products of archetypal phreatoplinian events; and two magmatic units, Y2 and Y5, the latter being the product of an exceptionally powerful plinian (previously described as 'ultraplinian') event with an extreme magma discharge rate around 10(8) to 10(10) kg s(-1). The pyroclastic fall-generating eruptions were followed by the climactic emplace- ment of the entirely non-welded Taupo ignimbrite (Y6) . It was generated by the catastrophic collapse of the 35 to 40-km-high plinian eruption column (Y5) that produced a very-fast-moving (600 to 900 km h(-1)), hot (up to 500 degrees C) pyroclastic flow (density current) that covered about 20,000 km 2 of central North Island over a near-circular area similar to 160 km in diameter, centred on Lake Taupo, in fewer than about ten to 15 minutes. This violent ground-hugging pyroclastic flow generated its own air lubrication, forming a near-frictionless basal region, and the resultant highly fluidised ignimbrite was spread as a near-continuous but thin sheet over the entire landscape, both infilling valleys and mantling ridges. Caldera collapse formed a new basin in the older Oruanui caldera in Lake Taupo. The pressure-wave arising from the plinian-column collapse probably generated a global volcano-meteorological tsunami. Studied intensely by extraordinary volcanologists Colin Wilson and George Walker, and others, the exceptionally wellpreserved and readily-accessible Taupo eruptives provide a one-in-a-hundred classic sequence that is arguably the most informative in the global world of volcanology with respect to explosive rhyolitic eruptions and their products. The total volume of the Taupo eruptives amounts to similar to 35 km(3 )as magma, equivalent to similar to 105 km(3 )of bulk (loose) pyroclastic material, of which the Taupo ignimbrite comprises similar to 30 km(3). The impacts and landscape response of the eruption were profound, spatially extensive, and enduring, and the young glassy soils (Vitrands in Soil Taxonomy, Pumice Soils in the New Zealand Soil Classification) developed in the silica-rich pumiceous deposits, although well suited to plantation forestry (especially exotic Pinus radiates), pose unique problems for agriculture and other land uses, including a high susceptibility to gully erosion and an inherent deficiency in cobalt and other trace elements, and require special management.

Lab Rearing of a Freshwater Polychaete (Manayunkia speciosa, Sabellidae) Host for Salmon Pathogens	NORTHWEST SCIENCE												The freshwater polychaete Manayunkia speciosa serves as the obligate intermediate host for the myxosporean parasites Ceratomyxa shasta and Parvicapsula minibicornis, which adversely affect the survival and freshwater production of juvenile salmon in the Klamath River and elsewhere in the Pacific Northwest USA. Scant information on the life history of the polychaete and inability to maintain individuals in culture has hindered development of management strategies to control disease outbreaks in Klamath River salmon. Through trial-and error- manipulations of food and water sources, culture environments and water velocities, we established conditions that allowed us to maintain M. speciosa in culture over a 10-mo period. In lab culture, eggs and young were brooded within the maternal tube for a 6-8 wk period during which 5 developmental stages were distinguished. Peak egg production occurred in late spring-early summer, with each female brooding up to 35 offspring. Juveniles left the maternal tube at a length of approximately 1 mm, and became reproductively mature in late December to early January at a length of approximately 2 mm. Duration of survival in lab culture, coupled with the absence of adult polychaetes in preserved river samples that were collected in mid-summer, suggests that M. speciosa has an approximately annual generation time.

From June to October C4 and C5 copepodid stages persist in the anoxic sediment. Prior to diapause lipids ale accumulated. The seasonal patterns of the total lipids and energy reserve lipids in Cyclops kolensis were examined during a two-year period, and the role of the reserve lipids in the life cycle of the copepod was assessed. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) were the dominant lipid class. The seasonal pattern of this energy reserve lipids resembled the seasonal pattern of the total lipids. Total lipid content of diapausing copepodids was approximately one third of their dry mass and decreased only slightly during the diapause period. A drastic decrease of lipids occurred after termination of diapause in November when copepodids emerged. When egg production started in February, the lipid content of adult females was approximately 20% of their dry mass. During the four-month long reproductive period a decrease in the lipid content of the females was observed, whereas the lipid concentration of the eggs remained almost constant. The offspring developed during the algal spring bloom and accumulated lipids before they entered diapause in June. Stored lipids are considered to provide energy for reactivation of the copepodids after termination of diapause and for early reproduction.																			0071-1128		3-510-47054-0				1998	52						477	492																WOS:000089402600036
J	Ghaderpour, E; Mazzanti, P; Bozzano, F; Mugnozza, GS				Ghaderpour, Ebrahim; Mazzanti, Paolo; Bozzano, Francesca; Mugnozza, Gabriele Scarascia			Trend Analysis of MODIS Land Surface Temperature and Land Cover in Central Italy	LAND												Land Surface Temperature (LST) is an important climate factor for understanding the relationship between the land surface and atmosphere. Furthermore, LST is linked to soil moisture and evapotranspiration, which can potentially alter the severity and regime of wildfires, landslide-triggering precipitation thresholds, and others. In this paper, the monthly daytime and nighttime LST products of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are employed for the period 2000-2023 in order to find areas that have been cooling or warming in a region of great interest in Central Italy, due to its complex geological and geomorphological settings and its recent seismic sequences and landslide events. The annual MODIS land cover images for 2001-2022 are also utilized to investigate the interconnection between LST and land cover change. The results of the non-parametric Mann-Kendall trend test and its associated Sen's slope reveal a significant nighttime warming trend in the region, particularly in July, linked to forest and woodland expansion. Grasslands toward the coastline with low elevation (less than 500 m a.s.l.) have experienced significant heat waves during the summer, with an LST of more than 35 degrees C. A significant negative correlation between the elevation and LST is observed for each calendar month. In particular, the daytime and nighttime LST have more than 80% correlation with elevation during winter and summer, respectively. In addition, nighttime warming and gradual drainage are noticed in Lake Campotosto. The results of this study could be useful for wildfire and landslide susceptibility analyses and hazard management.					; Mugnozza, Gabriele/D-3821-2009; Ghaderpour, Ebrahim/ABF-8335-2020; MAZZANTI, Paolo/A-8970-2012; Mazzanti, Paolo/A-8970-2012; Bozzano, Francesca/D-3841-2009	Ghaderpour, Ebrahim/0000-0002-5165-1773; MAZZANTI, Paolo/0000-0003-0042-3444; SCARASCIA-MUGNOZZA, Gabriele/0000-0002-2917-0324; Bozzano, Francesca/0000-0002-0297-842X														2073-445X				JUN	2024	13	6							796	10.3390/land13060796	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land13060796													WOS:001256119600001
J	Nguyen, HL; Leermakers, M; Kurunczi, S; Bozo, L; Baeyens, W				Nguyen, HL; Leermakers, M; Kurunczi, S; Bozo, L; Baeyens, W			Mercury distribution and speciation in Lake Balaton, Hungary	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The distribution and speciation of mercury in air, rain, lake water, sediment, and zooplankton in Lake Balaton (Hungary) were investigated between 1999 and 2002. In air, total gaseous mercury (TGM) ranged from 0.4 to 5.9 ng m(-3) and particulate phase mercury (PPM) from 0.01 to 0.39 ng m(-3). Higher concentrations of both TGM and PPM occurred during daytime. Higher concentrations of PPM occurred in winter. In rain and snow, total mercury ranged from 10.8 to 36.7 ng L-1 in summer but levels up to 191 ng L-1 in winter. Monomethylmercury (MMHg) concentrations ranged from 0.09 to 1.26 ng L-1 and showed no seasonal variations. Total Hg in the unfiltered lake water varied spatially, with concentrations ranging from 1.4 to 6.5 ng L-1. Approximately 70% of the total Hg is dissolved. MMHg levels ranged from 0.08 to 0.44 ng L-1 as total and from 0.05 to 0.37 ng L-1 in the dissolved form. Lower Hg concentrations in the water column occurred in winter. In suspended particulate matter and in sediment, total mercury ranged from 9 to 160 ng g(-1) dw, and MMHg ranged from 0.07 to 0.84 ng g(-1) dw. In zooplankton, an average mercury level of 31.0 +/- 6.8 ng g(-1) dw occurred, with MMHg accounting for approximately 17%. In sediments, suspended-matter- and zooplankton-high Hg and MMHg levels occurred at the mouth of the River Zala, but, in the lake, higher concentrations occurred on the Northern side, and an increasing trend from north-west to north-east was observed. In general, regarding Hg, Lake Balaton can be considered as a relatively uncontaminated site. The high-pH and well-oxygenated water as well as the low organic matter content of the sediment does not favour the methylation of Hg. In addition, bioconcentration and bioaccumulation factors are relatively low compared to other aquatic systems. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Estimation of burial flux and source apportionment of sedimentary OC in the Inner Archipelago (IA) was based on extensive sediment sampling of seismically surveyed accumulation bottom areas. The resulting IA-averaged OC content was 56 +/- 16 mg g dw(-1) sediment, yielding an IA-wide bottom sediment deposition for the 1992-1995 period of 3.1 Gg year(-1). The sediments in the eastern Lake Malaren (LM), IA, and Outer Archipelago (OA) were geochemically distinguishable based on their stable carbon isotope signatures (delta C-13). The 6 13C values were -28.2 +/- 0.6, -25.4 +/- 1.0, and -23.6 +/- 0.3, respectively, for LM (n=15), IA (n=17), and OA (n=31). These spatial trends were consistent with the C:N ratios, which were 9.96 +/- 1.2, 9.29 +/- 0.73, and 9.13 +/- 0.22 for the same subsystems. Using a simple isotopic mass balance model, it was deduced that about one-third (39%) of the OC burial in the IA sediments was of Lake Malaren runoff origin. Hence, a low archipelago-trapping efficiency of only 4% for the runoff TOC was found to be accumulating in the sediments underlying the approximately 30 km transect through the IA eastward of Stockholm. This scenario suggests that the organic matter and associated substances added by the Lake Malaren outflow, passing through urban Stockholm, are largely either remineralised and released to the IA water column, or transported with the currents to more pristine offshore Baltic ecosystems.

We sampled all the remaining 110 representatives of this habitat type (including recently restored ones) in Europe in an area covering approximately 125 000km(2). We analyzed spring and summer zooplankton species composition including rotifers, copepods, and cladocerans. We found 105 Rotifera, 26 Cladocera, and 26 Copepoda taxa, with local species richness ranging between 1 and 38 taxa. Alpha diversity was comparable in the two main groups (Rotifera, Crustacea), while beta and gamma diversity was higher in rotifers. The most frequently occurring zooplankters were crustaceans, while rotifer taxa were rarer as the most frequent species inhabited less than half of the pans. Dominance of the natronophilic Arctodiaptomus spinosus proved to be a reliable indicator for high quality soda pans. We concluded that the most typical soda pan zooplankton communities developed by early summer, in the concentrated pans, thus we would suggest considering this period as a reference for ecological state monitoring, and especially for evaluating the success of soda pan rehabilitations or reconstructions with the help of zooplankton. Based on these criteria, restorations could be considered only moderately successful.

Specific conductance is used as a calcite precipitation tracer. The results allow to calculate a steady CaCO3 precipitation of 14,000 tons year(-1). A photosynthetic-respiration budget points out that phosphorus behaves quite differently from other nutrients. Sedimentation fluxes data show that calcite precipitation and phosphorus cycle are closely associated. Understanding of mechanisms of calcite and phosphorus interactions still require further studies but they certainly act toward an improvement of the trophic status of the lake by enhancing the internal phosphorus sink.

Impacts of Urban Albedo Increase on Local Air Temperature at Daily-Annual Time Scales: Model Results and Synthesis of Previous Work	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												The authors combine urban and soil-vegetation surface parameterization schemes with one-dimensional (1D) boundary layer mixing and radiation parameterizations to estimate the maximum impact of increased surface albedo on urban air temperatures. The combined model is evaluated with measurements from an urban neighborhood in Basel, Switzerland, and the importance of surface-atmosphere model coupling is demonstrated. Impacts of extensive albedo increases in two Chicago, Illinois, neighborhoods are modeled. Clear-sky summertime reductions of diurnal maximum air temperature for the residential neighborhood (lambda(p) = 0.33) are -1.1 degrees, -1.5 degrees, and -3.6 degrees C for uniform roof albedo increases of 0.19, 0.26, and 0.59, respectively; reductions are about 40% larger for the downtown core (lambda(p) = 0.53). Realistic impacts will be smaller because the 1D modeling approach ignores advection; a lake-breeze scenario is modeled and temperature reductions decline by 80%. Assuming no advection, the analysis is extended to seasonal and annual time scales in the residential neighborhood. Yearly average temperature decreases for a 0.59 roof albedo increase are about -1 degrees C, with summer (winter) reductions about 60% larger (smaller). Annual cooling degree-day decreases are approximately offset by heating degree-day increases and the frequency of very hot days is reduced. Despite the variability of modeling approaches and scenarios in the literature, a consistent range of air temperature sensitivity to albedo is emerging; a 0.10 average increase in neighborhood albedo (a 0.40 roof albedo increase for lambda(p) = 0.25) generates a diurnal maximum air temperature reduction of approximately 0.5 degrees C for "ideal" conditions, that is, a typical clear-sky midlatitude summer day.

Observations during the 1986 and 1987 water-years were used as base conditions. In 1986 snowfall in the Sierra Nevada was well above average, although chemical fluxes were lower than in 1987, which was a low-accumulation year. The chemical composition of stream water during the early part of snowmelt was sensitive to chemical loading in the snowpack and to snowmelt rate, both of which are subject to year-to-year natural variations and to anthropogenic perturbations. Stream-water chemical composition was also sensitive to uncertainties in the model, including rate of chemical release from the snowpack, nitrogen reactions, and flow routing in the catchment. The largest effects were limited to a period lasting up to a few days, coinciding with the ionic pulse in spring snowmelt. Some significant effects were also apparent during summer rains. Stream waters in late summer and fail were also affected by a faster snowmelt rate, primarily associated with soil drying and lower late-season streamflows. Overall, the analysis suggests that the Emerald Lake basin may be particularly sensitive to acidic loadings in precipitation and to faster snowmelt and thus earlier runoff associated with climate warming.																			0024-3590					JUL	1996	41	5					947	954		10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.0947	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.5.0947													WOS:A1996VN45800017

AN UPDATED HISTORY OF PRE-CONTACT NEW ENGLAND: NEW AMS DATES FOR THE HORNBLOWER II AND FRISBY-BUTLER ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES	RADIOCARBON												Faunal assemblages from the pre-Contact period sites Frisby-Butler and Hornblower II on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, USA, remain unstudied since excavation during the 1980s. This project establishes radiocarbon (C-14) dates from faunal remains and evaluates occupation and abandonment at each site. C-14 measurements were collected from 17 specimens and 13 dates from previous analyses were re-examined. Dates were identified from the archaeological time periods Transitional Archaic (2700-3700 BP), Early Woodland (2000 2700 BP), and Late Woodland (450 1200 BP) at Frisby-Butler. Occupation likely represented seasonal visitations during autumn and winter to hunt based on white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) demographic profiles. A combined dataset of new and re-calibrated C-14 measurements from Hornblower II date to the Late Archaic (3700 6000 BP), Early Woodland, Middle Woodland (1200 2000 BP), and Late Woodland periods. Settlement was focused on gathering warm-weather foods like demersal fish and lakebirds. Together, the sites demonstrate periodic seasonal use of the southwest coast of the island throughout the Late Holocene and fit within an established regional pattern in southern New England.

J	Bradshaw, EG; Anderson, NJ; Jensen, JP; Jeppesen, E				Bradshaw, EG; Anderson, NJ; Jensen, JP; Jeppesen, E			Phosphorus dynamics in Danish lakes and the implications for diatom ecology and palaeoecology	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Seasonal phosphorus variability may be considerable in eutrophic lakes and patterns are influenced by internal, as well as external, nutrient loading. The strong seasonality of planktonic diatoms, with main growth periods in the spring and also in the autumn in meso- to eutrophic lakes, means that the measure of total phosphorus (TP) that is most relevant for diatom ecology may not be adequately assessed by single or few measurements during the year. 2. The diatom species assemblage of surface sediments can be used to infer in-lake nutrient concentrations. Weighted averaging (WA) and weighted averaging partial least squares (WAPLS) regression and calibration models for diatoms and annual mean TP were developed for a 29-site data set of Danish lakes based on (a) all diatom species and (b) planktonic species only. Jack-knifed error statistics were: =0.37, root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP)=0.28 log(10) mug TP L-1 and mean bias=0.04 log (10)mug TP L (-1) for the WAPLS 2-component model based on all species; =0.23, RMSEP= 0.32log(10) mug TP L (-1) and mean bias=0.07 log (10)mug TP L-1 for the WA model with tolerance downweighting based on planktonic species only. These are comparable with similar, published data sets. 3. A subset of 23 sites was used to develop models based on seasonal TP measurements. Mean spring TP concentrations gave only slightly improved RMSEP values for models based on all species and plankton-only (0.24 log(10) mug TP L-1 and 0.29 log(10) mug TP L-1, respectively). 4. Weighted averaging models derive environmental optima, for individual species, which are not necessarily of ecological relevance. However, good water chemistry data are required to model species' responses adequately and to develop calibration data sets.

Their morphology and remnants potentially indicate past base-level fluctuations and changing regional slopes. The prevailing presence of meandering segments in low-slope areas somewhat confuses the physically based relationships between slope and channel meandering. This relationship underlies a fundamental debate: do incised sinuous channels actively develop during steepening of a regional slope, or do they inherit the planform of a preexisting sinuous channel through vertical incision? This question was previously explored through reconstructed evolution of meandering rivers, numerical simulations, and controlled, scaled-down laboratory experiments. Here, we study a rare, field-scale set of a dozen adjacent perennial channels, evolving in recent decades in a homogeneous erodible substrate in response to the Dead Sea level fall (> 30 m over 40 years). These channels are fed by perennial springs and have no drainage basin or previous fluvial history; they initiated straight and transformed into incising meandering channels following the emergence of the preexisting lake bathymetry, which resulted in increased channel lengths and regional slopes at different rates for each channel. This field setting allows testing the impact of changing regional slope on the sinuosity of a stream in the following cases: (a) relatively long and low-gradient shelf-like margins, (b) a sharp increase in the basinward gradient at the shelf-slope transition, and (c) gradually steepening slopes. Under a stable and low valley slope, the channels mainly incise vertically, inheriting a preexisting sinuous pattern. When the regional slope steepens, the channels start to meander, accompanying the vertical incision. The highest sinuosity evolved in the steepest channel, which also developed the deepest and widest valley. These results emphasize the amplifying impact of steepening regional slope on sinuosity. This holds when the flow is confined and chute cutoffs are scarce.

J	STAUFFER, RE				STAUFFER, RE			LINKAGE BETWEEN THE PHOSPHORUS AND SILICA CYCLES IN LAKE MENDOTA, WISCONSIN	WATER RESEARCH												The phosphorus and silica cycles in Lake Mendota were studied during 1970-1973, bracketing the diversion of all municipal wastewater inputs to the lake, and again in 1977-1980, following 1 to 1/2 lake hydraulic residence times. Because of the high concentrations of soluble phosphate and inorganic nitrogen, the vernal diatom bloom is limited by silica. The low nutrient uptake ratio (mean .DELTA.Si/.DELTA.P = 5.5 .+-. 0.2, by atoms) reflects nutrient availability and the dominance of low silica diatoms (especially Stephanodiscus spp.) in this eutrophic calcareous lake. The lower ratio, .DELTA.Si/.DELTA.P, in the hypolimnion during summer stratification (mean 2.8 .+-. 0.1) illustrates that phosphorus recycling proceeds more efficiently than in the case for Si. The vertical fluxes of biologically available P and Si into the epilimnion averaged 9.5 .+-. 1.0 and 33 .+-. 6 mg m-2 (AO) day-1 during summers 1977-1979. Despite the low Si/P flux ratio, soluble silica accumulated each summer in the epilimnion whereas epilimnetic P declined. This difference is probably a consequence of seasonal blue-green algal dominance in the epilimnion. The available Si/P in the epilimnion shifts downwards by 3 orders of magnitude during September and October, because of entrainment of metalimnetic and hypolimnetic waters with a lower ratio, and the selective uptake of Si by the fall diatom crop. Because of the seasonal demands by diatoms, coupled with the comparative inefficiency of Si recycling (vs P), Lake Mendota''s annual retention coefficient for soluble silica is 0.98 .+-. 0.001, as compared to 0.40 .+-. 0.01, as compared to 0.40 .+-. 0.05 for biologically available P. Based on various nutrient and hypolimnetic redox indices, Lake Mendota failed to respond during the eight years following nutrient diversion. Nor has the lake changed significantly in the twentieth century.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1986	20	5					597	609		10.1016/0043-1354(86)90024-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(86)90024-2													WOS:A1986D609600008

Seasonal changes in the surface phosphatase kinetics of aquatic mosses in northern England	JOURNAL OF BRYOLOGY												The widespread occurrence of surface phosphatase activity in aquatic mosses, presumably synthesized to utilize organic phosphates in the environment, suggests the likelihood of strategies to optimize this process. Here we report seasonal changes in the kinetics of surface phosphatase in six moss populations, representing four species (Fontinalis antipyretica, Fontinalis squamosa, Rhynchostegium riparioides and Warnstorfia fluitans) from N. E. England. Kinetic parameters of shoots assayed within a few hours of sampling from the streams showed a summer/autumn increase in K(m) and V(max) corresponding to seasonal decrease in phosphate supply. The detection of phosphomonoesterases and phosphodiesterases with both low and high substrate affinities in all the populations studied confirms the widespread existence of this phenomenon in mosses. Similar two-phase kinetics were found for clonal, axenic isolates of two of the species (Rhynchostegium and Warnstorfia), indicating that any influence of epiphytes on the results with stream material was negligible. The seasonal changes in the kinetic parameters indicate that surface phosphatase activity is a dynamic response to seasonal changes in nutrient supply and/or requirement.					; Haile, Sossina/I-3448-2015; Turner, Benjamin/E-5940-2011	ELLWOOD, Neil Thomas William/0000-0001-7933-4246; Turner, Benjamin/0000-0002-6585-0722													0373-6687					SEP	2007	29						174	182		10.1179/174328207X227384	http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/174328207X227384													WOS:000250771800005

Mesozooplankton, calanoid copepod Acartia hudsonica showed ten times higher abundance under high oxygen condition at the bottom than under control where there was less oxygen at the bottom. On the other hand, during summer when microzooplankton such as rotifers and small cyclopoid species Oithona spp. were dominant, no difference in their distribution pattern and abundance was observed. Results have suggested that oxygen concentration at the bottom is one important factor determining the abundance and distribution of mesozooplankton even in local-scale probably by providing bottom refuge, but not for microzoooplankton. Since spring season is important for recruitment of many commercial fish juveniles, the distribution of oxygen in the lake seems very important for the fish stock in the lake.						chang, Kwang-Hyeon/0000-0002-7952-4047													1961-9502						2013		408							03	10.1051/kmae/2013038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2013038													WOS:000319447800003

Results of chemical fractionation showed that different OP fractions ranked along the sediment depth in the order: humic acid-P > HCl-OP > NaHCO3-OP > fulvic acid-P > residual OP. Results of simulated P release showed that soluble reactive P (SRP) flux rates under anaerobic condition were much more than those under aerobic condition. The experiments of P release under seasonal temperature cycle condition (5 degrees C-15 degrees C-25 degrees C-15 degrees C-5 degrees C)were also simulated. The positive P flux rates were observed under both simulated spring (the first 15 degrees C) and summer (25 degrees C) conditions from sediment cores in the shallow and deep sites, indicating P release from sediments.

Pools, transformations, and sources of P in high-elevation soils: Implications for nutrient transfer to Sierra Nevada lakes	GEODERMA												In high-elevation lakes of the Sierra Nevada (California), increases in P supply have been inferred from shifts in P to N limitation. To examine factors possibly leading to changes in P supply, we measured pools and transformations in soil P, and developed a long-term mass balance to estimate the contribution of parent material weathering to soil P stocks. Common Sierra Nevada soils were found to not be P-deficient and to be retentive of P due to the influence of Fe- and Al-oxides. Total P averaged 867 mu g P g(-1) in the top 10 cm of soil (O and A horizons) and 597 mu g P g(-1), in the 10-60 cm depth (B horizons), of which 70% in A horizons and 60% in B horizons was freely exchangeable or associated with Fe and Al. Weathering of parent material explained 69% of the P found in soils and lost from the catchment since deglaciation, implying that long-term atmospheric P deposition (0.02 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) represented the balance of P inputs (31%) during the past 10,000 years of soil development. During spring snowmelt similar to 27% of the total soil P was transferred between organic and inorganic pools; average inorganic P pools decreased by 232 mu g P g(-1), while organic P pools increased by 242 mu g P g(-1). Microbial biomass P was highest during winter and decreased six-fold to a minimum in the fall. Interactions between hydrology and biological processes strongly influence the rate of P transfer from catchment soils to lakes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	McEwen, DC; Butler, MG				McEwen, Daniel C.; Butler, Malcolm G.			The effects of water-level manipulation on the benthic invertebrates of a managed reservoir	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Reservoir creation and management can enhance many ecological services provided by freshwater ecosystems, but may alter the natural conditions to which aquatic biota have adapted. Benthic macroinvertebrates often reflect environmental conditions, and this community may be particularly susceptible to water-level changes that alter sediment exposure, temperature regime, wave-induced sediment redistribution and basal productivity. 2. Using a before-after control-impact experimental design, we assessed changes in macroinvertebrate community structure corresponding with changes in water-level management in two lentic systems in the Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, U. S. A. Littoral zone (depths 1-5 m) benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were sampled in Rainy Lake (control system) and Namakan Reservoir (impact system) in 1984-85, and again in 2004-05 following a change in water-level management that began in January 2000. The new regime reduced the magnitude of winter drawdown in Namakan Reservoir from 2.5 to 1.5 m, and allowed the reservoir to fill to capacity in late May, a month earlier than under the prior regime. Rainy Lake water levels were not altered substantially. 3. We found changes in macroinvertebrate community structure in Namakan Reservoir relative to Rainy Lake at 1-2 m depths but not at 3-5 m depths. These shallower depths would have been most directly affected by changes in sediment exposure and ice formation. 4. In 2004-05, Namakan Reservoir benthos showed lower overall abundance, more large-bodied taxa and an increase in non-insect invertebrates relative to 1984-85, without corresponding changes in Rainy Lake. 5. Changes in the benthic community in Namakan may reflect cooler water in spring and early summer as well as lower resource availability (both autochthonous production and allochthonous inputs) under the new regime.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				MAY	2010	55	5					1086	1101		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02382.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02382.x													WOS:000276655200012
J	Lemenkova, P				Lemenkova, Polina			Monitoring Seasonal Fluctuations in Saline Lakes of Tunisia Using Earth Observation Data Processed by GRASS GIS	LAND												This study documents the changes in the Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) in the region of saline lakes in north Tunisia, Sahara Desert. Remote sensing data are a valuable data source in monitoring LULC in lacustrine landscapes, because variations in the extent of lakes are visible from space and can be detected on the images. In this study, changes in LULC of the salt pans of Tunisia were evaluated using a series of 12 Landsat 8-9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared (TIRS) images. The images were processed with the Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) Geographic Information System (GIS) software. The study area included four salt lakes of north Tunisia in the two regions of the Gulf of Hammamet and Gulf of Gabes: (1) Sebkhet de Sidi el Hani (Sousse Governorate), (2) Sebkha de Moknine (Mahdia Governorate), (3) Sebkhet El Rharra and (4) Sebkhet en Noual (Sfax). A quantitative estimate of the areal extent analysed in this study is 182 km x 185 km for each Landsat scene in two study areas: Gulf of Hammamet and Gulf of Gabes. The images were analysed for the period 2017-2023 on months February, April and July for each year. Spatio-temporal changes in LULC and their climate-environmental driving forces were analysed. The results were interpreted and the highest changes were detected by accuracy assessment, computing the class separability matrices, evaluating the means and standard deviation for each band and plotting the reject probability maps. Multi-temporal changes in LULC classes are reported for each image. The results demonstrated that changes in salt lakes were determined for winter/spring/summer months as detected changes in water/land/salt/sand/vegetation areas. The accuracy of the classified images was evaluated using pixel rejection probability values, which were filtered out using the 'r.mapcalc' module of GRASS GIS. The confidence levels were computed and visualised with a series of maps along with the error matrix and measured convergence level of classified pixels. This paper contributes to the environmental monitoring of Tunisian landscapes and analysis of climate effects on LULC in landscapes of north Africa.

Characterization of eukaryotic microbial diversity in hypersaline Lake Tyrrell, Australia	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												This study describes the community structure of the microbial eukaryotic community from hypersaline Lake Tyrrell, Australia, using near full length 18S rRNA sequences. Water samples were taken in both summer and winter over a 4-year period. The extent of eukaryotic diversity detected was low, with only 35 unique phylotypes using a 97% sequence similarity threshold. The water samples were dominated (91%) by a novel cluster of the Alveolate, Apicomplexa Colpodella spp., most closely related to C. edax. The Chlorophyte, Dunaliella spp accounted for less than 35% of water column samples. However, the eukaryotic community entrained in a salt crust sample was vastly different and was dominated (83%) by the Dunaliella spp. The patterns described here represent the first observation of microbial eukaryotic dynamics in this system and provide a multiyear comparison of community composition by season. The lack of expected seasonal distribution in eukaryotic communities paired with abundant nanoflagellates suggests that grazing may significantly structure microbial eukaryotic communities in this system.					; Nelson, William/E-9263-2016; Heidelberg, Karla/L-2096-2017	Holm, Johanna/0000-0002-7646-4085; Nelson, William/0000-0002-1873-3929; Heidelberg, Karla/0000-0002-2645-8269; Emerson, Joanne/0000-0001-9983-5566													1664-302X					MAY 13	2013	4								115	10.3389/fmicb.2013.00115	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2013.00115								23717306					WOS:000331106000002

Therefore, fine beam RADARSAT-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images were acquired in winter and spring 2000 and, 2001 and analyzed for ice cover types. Video footage of the ice conditions on the Peace River was obtained from aerial ice observations that were conducted simultaneously with the image acquisitions. The analysis of, the images was done (i) visually and (ii) using an unsupervised Fuzzy K-means classification. To streamline the process in an operational environment, the unsupervised ice classification was semi-automated. The unsupervised classification broke the data. into seven classes, which represent the major ice cover types observed on the Peace River. The spatial distribution of ice cover types as generated by the ice classification generally coincides well with air-truth information and backscatter, signatures from SAR images. The location of the boundaries between the ice types appears to be accurate, but it may not be precise. The ice maps can be used for ice monitoring, decision-making purposes, or the verification of ice models.																			0315-1468					FEB	2003	30	1					11	27		10.1139/L02-073	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/L02-073													WOS:000182266300005

WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Small mountain lakes function as temporary storage basins for rain and snowmelt-derived water. Many small lakes lose water seasonally, but questions remain about the processes involved and effects on watershed hydrology. Evaporation and groundwater outflow from lakes may influence baseflow in streams, hydrologic connections among lakes, and water fluxes from a watershed. To evaluate the role of small mountain lakes in watershed hydrology and the dominant pathways of water loss, we studied the water balances of four shallow, closed-basin, subalpine lakes in southern Wyoming that lose up to 99% of their volumes between early summer and late fall. We tested the performance of seven evaporation models, compared observed rates of water loss with simulations of evaporation and drainage, and conducted geophysical surveys to evaluate the hydrologic environment between lakes. Our results show that groundwater outflow, rather than evaporation, can dominate water loss and cause closed-basin mountain lakes to be ephemeral. Groundwater fluxes may contribute to varied rates and timing of water loss from the lakes. Evaporation accounted for 14% of water loss in a lake that overlays thin (<0.5 m) sediments and fractured bedrock and 83% in a lake underlain by >3 m of sediments and clay. Gradual recharge of groundwater (<18,000 m(3).km(-2).day(-1)) from each study lake likely helps sustain baseflow in streams once snowmelt has subsided. Total water loss from closed-basin, subalpine lakes may therefore help to maintain baseflow of rivers in late summer, but their impact varies based on geological context and snowmelt availability.					; Mercer, Jason/AAE-8703-2019	Shuman, Bryan/0000-0002-8149-8925; Mercer, Jason/0000-0002-6193-5032; Parsekian, Andrew/0000-0001-5072-9818													0043-1397	1944-7973				AUG	2018	54	8					5245	5263		10.1029/2017WR022261	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2017WR022261													WOS:000445451800005
J	Liu, Y; Keller, I; Heckel, G				Liu, Yang; Keller, Irene; Heckel, Gerald			Temporal genetic structure and relatedness in the Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula suggests limited kin association in winter	IBIS												Conspecific aggregation of waterfowl in winter is a common example of animal flocking behaviour, yet patterns of relatedness and temporal substructure in such social groups remain poorly understood even in common species. A previous study based on mark-recapture data showed that Tufted Ducks Aythya fuligula caught on the same day were re-caught together in subsequent winters more often than expected by chance, suggesting stable assortments of socially familiar' individuals between wintering periods. The genetic relationships within these social groups were not clear. Based on 191 individuals genotyped at 10 microsatellite markers, we investigated the temporal genetic structure and patterns of relatedness among wintering Tufted Ducks at Lake Sempach, Switzerland, in two consecutive winters. We found no evidence of genetic differentiation between temporal groups within or between winters. The average levels of relatedness in temporal groups were low and not higher than expected in random assortments of individuals. However, Mantel tests performed for each sex separately revealed significant negative correlations between the pairwise relatedness coefficients and the number of days between the capture dates of pairs of wintering Tufted Duck in males and females. This pattern suggests the presence of a small number of co-migrating same-sex sibling pairs in wintering flocks of Tufted Ducks. Our findings provide one of the first genetic analyses of a common duck species outside the breeding season and contribute to the understanding of social interactions in long-distance migratory birds.

The model inputs include only lake morphometry and total phosphorus concentration at spring-overturn. In this study, we tested the validity of the model using information for lakes that are larger or deeper, and have higher phosphorus concentrations than the lakes that were the basis for the original regression model. Data from 32 lakes in the Gull River watershed in central Ontario and 10 takes in eastern Ontario were used to evaluate the model's ability to predict end-of-summer oxygen profiles. Results indicated that the original model was satisfactory for most of the 42 study lakes, but had more limited success in the deeper and larger lakes within the data set. For the eastern Ontario lake set, the original model's ability to predict oxygen in the hypolimnia. was better than for the Gull River watershed lakes. It is suggested that the most useful application of the model would be to predict the change in hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations at given depths that would result from increases or decreases in total phosphorus concentrations in the take.

Here we forced the physical lake model Simstrat with locally downscaled climate models under three future scenarios to investigate the impact on 29 Swiss lakes, varying in size along an altitudinal gradient. Results from the worst-case scenario project substantial change at the end of the century in duration of ice-cover at mid to high altitude (-2 to -107 days), stratification duration (winter -17 to -84 days, summer -2 to 73 days), while lower and especially mid altitude (present day mean annual air temperature from 9 degrees C to 3 degrees C) dimictic lakes risk shift to monomictic regimes (seven out of the eight lakes). Analysis further indicates that for many lakes shifts in mixing regime can be avoided by adhering to the most stringent scenario.					; Schmid, Martin/C-3953-2009	Bouffard, Damien/0000-0002-2005-9718; Raman Vinna, Love/0000-0002-9108-8057; Medhaug, Iselin/0000-0002-1115-8896; Schmid, Martin/0000-0001-8699-5691														2662-4435				FEB 18	2021	2	1							35	10.1038/s43247-021-00106-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s43247-021-00106-w													WOS:000665746600002

Habitats sampled grouped distinctly based on percent composition and abundance of YOY fishes with those having submergent vegetation dominated by a number of important sport species. In late spring, the grouping of stations depended on the presence or absence of newly transformed northern pike (Esox lucius). In early summer, stations did not differ as distinctly in composition, but in total abundance of young. Those stations with submergent vegetation had total catches which were more than double those elsewhere. By late summer, submergent and mixed vegetation stations formed a distinct assemblage influenced by the preponderance of 3 spp. of sunfishes. Their diets suggested that species inhabiting areas of submergent vegetation were very flexible in their choice of food resources. Black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus), rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) fed on similarly sized items. Increased sedimentation or deposition of dredged material in backwaters may adversely and severely affect recruitment of several sport fish species by reducing or removing critical beds of submergent vegetation.																			0270-5060	2156-6941					1985	3	1					81	91		10.1080/02705060.1985.9665094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1985.9665094													WOS:A1985AJV5900008
J	Zhang, J; Li, DL; Li, L; Deng, WT				Zhang, Jie; Li, Dongliang; Li, Laurent; Deng, Weitao			Decadal variability of droughts and floods in the Yellow River basin during the last five centuries and relations with the North Atlantic SST	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Droughts and floods are frequent disasters in the Yellow River basin in northern China. They have a strong impact on agriculture and water resource management. To explore the physical mechanisms of these droughts and floods, influences exerted by the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the mid-latitude North Atlantic on the wetness and dryness in the Yellow River basin have been investigated. The drought/flood index (DFI), derived from a reconstructed dataset covering the last five centuries, is used. Numerical simulations are conducted with the Community Atmospheric Model version 3.0 (CAM3) to study the influence of various mechanisms. It is found that DFI in the entire Yellow River basin experienced oscillations at about 50-60years during the past five centuries. Droughts and floods have inconsistent patterns in different areas of the Yellow River. The periodic variation of DFI in Xi'an, a station in a semi-humid subarea, is in contrast to the North Atlantic SST (10 degrees N-55 degrees N and 70 degrees W-10 degrees W) oscillation in spring and summer; the periodic variation of the Yinchuan DFI in a semi-arid subarea (the upper reaches of Yellow River) correlates with the North Atlantic SST oscillation variation in spring and summer. The North Atlantic SST is probably one of the key sources of internal variability of the climate system, which results in Rossby wave adjusting. The warm phase of the North Atlantic SST is related to the operation of a Northern Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) like pattern conducive to easterly wind anomalies in northern China and enhances anti-cyclones around Lake Baikal that leads to less precipitation or more frequent droughts in the semi-arid subarea in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, but wet conditions in the semi-humid subarea in the middle reaches, monsoon subarea in the lower reaches and plateau subarea in the upper reaches of the river.

An evaluation of gillnet CPUE as an index of perch density in small forest lakes	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Gillnets are commonly used for monitoring fish communities and assessing the ecological quality in European lakes. However, the relationship between gillnet CPUE and fish abundance is not linear and depends on several factors affecting the catchability of gillnets. We investigated the effects of high water colour, naturally anoxic hypolimnion, water temperature and sex ratio on the catchability of perch Perca fluviatilis in gillnets. Data were collected during 10 years in nine forest lakes in southern Finland. Such lakes are very common in Finland. The density and size structure of perch populations were estimated by mark and recapture method during spring and standard gillnet fishing (CEN, 2005. Water quality Sampling of Fish with Multimesh Gillnets. European Committee for Standardization, Brussels (EN 14757)) in late summer. Perch CPUE was positively but non-linearly dependent on the perch density. Catchability increased with water colour, water temperature, and the volume of the anoxic hypolimnion. The sex ratio was also important because late summer gillnetting overestimates the proportion of female perch. If the factors that affect the catchability of perch in gillnets are taken into account, gillnet CPUE using standard methods can be used as rough index of fish density in small forest lakes.

J	Johnson, MS; Munger, F				Johnson, MS; Munger, F			Observations on excessive abundance of the midge Chironomus plumosus at Lake Pepin	ECOLOGY												This midge occurs in spring and again in summer in such numbers as to be a serious pest, having largely replaced, within the last 10 or 12 years, the mayflies which were abundant formerly. Mud samples from the lake bottom showed larvae of this species in excess of 7,000 per sq. yd., a figure much greater than has been reported from other lakes. The bottom samples showed a seasonal change in size and number of larvae. Apparently this midge has 2 genera- tions a year. Several kinds of fish eat the larvae, but not in sufficient numbers to effect control of the adult. There is evidence that the lake water is not seriously polluted, but the great abundance of the midge larvae seems to result from the enrichment of the lake bottom by pollution brought by the Mississippi River from Minneapolis and St. Paul.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1930	11						110	126		10.2307/1930784	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1930784													WOS:000200209700007

The water samples were concentrated on silica C-18 cartridges and the adsorbates were tested at increasing doses with a bacterial short-term mutagenicity test (Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains), which reveals the gene-mutation-inducing ability of pollutants, and with a plant genotoxicity bioassay (Tradescantia/micronucleus test), which determines clastogenicity (chromosome-breaking ability). Raw water samples from all treatment plants were found to contain bacterial direct-acting mutagens detectable mainly with TA98 strain. The analyses of drinking water samples after water treatment showed some interesting results: TA98 mutagenicity was reduced when ozone was used together with chlorine dioxide, but TA100 mutagenicity was increased, though only in the summer sample; mutagenicity detectable with both strains was always reduced after chlorine dioxide disinfection; on the contrary, in all treatment plants using NaClO TA98 mutagenicity of winter samples increased. Raw lake water induced a high number of micronuclei in the Tradescantia/micronucleus lest, showing a strong clastogenicity. This activity was higher in the NaClO-treated samples, and lower with the other disinfectants. Therefore, disinfection of lake water with ozone and/or chlorine dioxide seems to be a suitable alternative to the use of NaClO for controlling the formation of nonvolatile mutagens. The concentration method coupled with the two mutagenicity tests was found to be a simple, rapid and relatively inexpensive system for monitoring treatment plants and studying the influence of different disinfection systems on water mutagenicity.

Phosphorus loading decreased to a much smaller extent than nitrogen loading. In L. Vortsjarv both N and P concentrations followed the decreasing trends of loading, which show the high sensitivity of large shallow lakes to catchment processes. Our study showed a positive relationship between P content in sediments and the relative depth of the lake. Assumingly the resilience of a lake in responding to the reduction of nutrient loading decreases together with the decrease of its relative depth. In L. Peipsi the concentration of P has not decreased since the 1990s. Our data show indirectly that P loading from Russia to L. Peipsi may have increased. The N/P ratio has decreased in both lakes. Cyanobacterial blooms have been common in both lakes already at the beginning of the 20th century. The blooms disappeared during heavy nitrogen loading in the 1980s but started again in L. Peipsi in recent years together with the drop of the N/P ratio. In L. Vortsjarv the N/P ratio is higher and the ecosystem is more stable although the share of N-2-fixing cyanobacteria increased from the 1990s. Reappearing cyanobacterial blooms in L. Peipsi have caused fish-kills in recent years. In L. Peipsi summer/autumn fish-kills during water-blooms are a straightforward consequence of reduced nitrogen level at remaining high phosphorus level while in L. Vortsjarv the climatic factors affecting water level are more critical-at low water level winter fish-kills may occur. In L. Vortsjarv nutrient loading has decreased and water quality has improved, present ecological status seems to be mostly controlled by climatic factors through changes of water level. The most important measure to improve water quality in L. Peipsi would be the reduction of phosphorus loading from both Estonian and Russian subcatchments.					; Noges, Tiina/AAL-5373-2020; Kisand, Anu/G-9758-2017; Nõges, Peeter/AAL-5343-2020	Kisand, Anu/0000-0001-5175-9031; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2007	584						253	264		10.1007/s10750-007-0603-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-0603-z													WOS:000246583500024

WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Using airborne thermal infrared imaging and horizontally resolved in situ temperature monitoring at the lake surface, we estimated strength and duration of regular wind-driven upwelling of dense deep water to the lake surface in two small (in terms of Rossby radius) temperate lakes during the initial phase of summer thermal stratification. The onset and duration of the upwelling events correlated well with the balance between stratification (in terms of Schmidt stability) and wind forcing, as expressed by Lake and Wedderburn numbers. The period of regular upwelling appearances lasted 7-15 days, identified by Schmidt stabilities around 30 J m(-2) and Lake numbers between 0 and 1, and resulted in persistent temperature gradients of up to 2 degrees C across the lake surface. Our results suggest that spring upwelling should inevitably take place in all freshwater temperate lakes with mean temperatures crossing the maximum density value of freshwater on annual cycle, whereas duration and intensity of the upwelling would vary depending on lake morphometry and weather conditions. Our results suggest major contribution of upwelling in nutrient supply to the upper waters, oxygenation of the deep water column, and air-lake gas exchange, in particular, the release of the sediment-produced methane into the atmosphere.					; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010; Lewandowski, Jorg/E-9028-2012; Ruhtz, Thomas/Z-5496-2019; Lewandowski, Jörg/E-9028-2012	Ruhtz, Thomas/0000-0003-4646-3791; Kirillin, Georgiy/0000-0001-7337-3586; Lewandowski, Jorg/0000-0001-5278-129X; 													0043-1397	1944-7973				DEC	2015	51	12					9612	9627		10.1002/2015WR017579	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015WR017579													WOS:000368421500012

B.S.P from northwestern Ontario, a short-term provenance test was carried out for 75 seed sources collected east and west of Lake Nipigon. Provenances were grown in common environments at a greenhouse for two seasons (1990-1991) and a farm field and a forestry trial each for four growing seasons (1990-1993). Twenty-five growth and phenological variables were determined, including seedling height, needle flushing date, and the timing of shoot elongation. Significant levels of interprovenance variation were present for is of these variables. Graphic analysis of the pattern of variation indicated that sources from the southwestern portion of the collected area generally grew faster and flushed later than easterly sources near the north shore of Lake Superior. Superimposed on this general pattern were several irregularities caused by one or more provenances. Multiple regressions were run for each of the 18 variables against latitude, elevation, and 12 climatic variables interpolated for each of the seed sources by a geographic information system from 1951-1980 data obtained from 56 nearby weather stations. Large coefficients of variation (up to 0.57) were obtained for some variables. Combinations of climatic variables, including winter minimum and summer maximum temperatures together with precipitation and timing of the growing season, were excellent predictors of black spruce needle flushing dates, while summer temperature, precipitation, and elevation were moderately good predictors of height growth.																			0045-5067					AUG	1994	24	8					1653	1661		10.1139/x94-214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/x94-214													WOS:A1994QA52700016
J	Gibson, JAE				Gibson, JAE			The meromictic lakes and stratified marine basins of the Vestfold Hills, East Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Thirty-four permanently stratified water bodies were identified in a survey of the Vestfold Hills. Of these, 21 were lakes, six were seasonally isolated marine basins (SIMBs), and seven were marine basins with year round connection to the open ocean. The basins varied markedly in salinity (4 g l(-1) to 235 g l(-1)), temperature (- 14 degrees C to 24 degrees C), depth (5 m to 110 m), area (3.6 ha to 146 ha) and surface level (-30 m to 29 m above sea level). The stratification in all the basins was maintained by increases in salinity. During winter, a thermohaline convection cell was present in all lakes and SIMBs directly beneath the ice cover. These cells were the result of brine exclusion from the forming ice, and increased in density throughout winter, penetrating progressively deeper into the lake. Minimum stability, and therefore the maximum likelihood of turnover, occurred at the time of maximum ice formation in spring. At the end of the period of ice formation, the convection cell broke down, and stratification of the surface water occurred. When the ice melted completely, lenses of relatively fresh water capped the lakes, which reduced the effect of wind mixing. Net meltwater input increased the stability of the meromictic basins, while periods of lower water level resulted in deeper penetration of the thermohaline convection cell, increasing the possibility of turnover and destratification.																			0954-1020					JUN	1999	11	2					175	192		10.1017/S0954102099000243	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0954102099000243													WOS:000084414100007

Abundance and recruitment indices were calculated for the 1961-1985 year classes based on lake whitefish catch and effort data from the commercial fishery in each area. Previous research indicates that spawning stock abundance, winter ice cover, and spring temperatures are important in determining the egg and larval abundance and survival of lake whitefish. Therefore, spawning stock abundance, ice cover, winter wind velocity, and spring water and air temperature variables were used as model inputs in regression modeling. The biotic/abiotic recruitment model for northern Green Bay hindcasted lake whitefish recruitment as a function of spawning stock abundance and the number of days that ice cover exceeded 40% during egg incubation. This regression model (R2 = 0.62) demonstrated improved hindcasting ability of historic recruitment when compared to the Beverton-Holt (R2 = 0.37) or the Ricker (R2 = 0.33) stock-recruitment models for the 1961-1985 cohorts. The biotic/abiotic recruitment model for the North Shore hindcasted lake whitefish recruitment as a function of average air temperature in May after larval emergence, the number of days that ice concentration exceeded 70% during egg incubation, and spawning stock abundance. The regression model (R2 = 0.57) also demonstrated. improved hindcasting ability of historical recruitment when compared with Beverton-Holt (R2 = 0.09) or the Ricker (R2 = 0.13) stock-recruitment models. Results of this study indicate that biotic/abiotic recruitment models were more successful in hindcasting recruitment than solely biologically based stock-recruitment relationships. Consideration of significant abiotic variables will be useful in the management of lake whitefish stocks in the Great Lakes by improving forecasts of recruitment.																			0380-1330						1993	19	2					418	428		10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71229-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(93)71229-0													WOS:A1993LN30700021

Spatial and Temporal Study of Climatic Variability on Grape Production in Southwestern Michigan	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ENOLOGY AND VITICULTURE												Daily climatic data were obtained from several sources to calculate growing degree days (GDD) for multiple sites in southwest Michigan, which contains the Lake Michigan Shore American Viticultural Area. The data were examined for spatial and temporal (1950 to 2011) patterns and trends over the region in order to better quantify the role of Michigan climate on juice grape production. The occurrence and severity of frost and freezing temperatures were also considered in this study, as subfreezing temperatures in late spring and early fall can have severe impacts on the region's juice grape production and fruit quality at harvest. Michigan's cool-cold climate has warmed in recent decades, particularly since 1980, with an average increase over the region of more than 3.7 GDD (base 10 C) per year. Southwestern Michigan was also found to have higher seasonal temperature variability when compared with Napa Valley (California). Since 1980, the season-to-season variability in Michigan has increased at a more rapid pace. The impacts of the increasing GDD have been positive for fruit quality, with a strong positive correlation between seasonal GDD and fruit maturation, indexed as total soluble solids (Brix). The growing season has also increased by 28 days in length since 1971. However, despite warmer temperatures, the number of days of potential frost and their seasonal variability in southwestern Michigan have remain unchanged, which continues to pose a risk for grapegrowers in the region. While it has become warmer in Michigan, and the spring warm-up is typically arriving earlier in the year, the number of days with damaging frost still has a profound impact on overall climate-related risk for grape production.

In other catchments, NO3- concentrations peaked during the autumn and winter. Long-term trends in surface water chemistry were evident in only two catchments: an increase in SO42- concentrations in surface waters of the Ruby Lake basin, and a lowering of annual maxima and minima of NO3- concentrations at Emerald Lake.

On several occasions, ambient densities of benthic and drifting invertebrates were also estimated. Stomach content analysis identified the trichopterans, primarily Cheumatopsyche sp., were the dominant prey item, accounting for at least 40% of diet biomass for each fish species. The amphipod Gammarus fasciatus and chironomids accounted for more than 40% of the yellow perch and channel catfish diets, respectively, but contributed less than 10% to the diet of the other fish species. Diurnal feeding patterns were most apparent for yellow perch, whose feeding was limited almost exclusively to daylight hours. Species composition and relative abundance in the diets of all three fish were more like the composition and abundance of the benthos than of the drift, suggesting that most foraging occurred on the bottom rather than in the water column. The timing and composition of drift did not appear to be related to prey selection by any of these fish species.

J	HAKALA, I				HAKALA, I			SEASONAL-VARIATION IN THE CARBON AND ENERGY CONTENTS AND ASSIMILATION OF A MYSIS-RELICTA POPULATION IN PAAJARVI, SOUTHERN FINLAND	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												Assimilation of a M. relicta population was studied in the light of the previous population and respiration studies on this species in the oligotrophic lake Paajarvi. Background information was obtained from a study of the variation in the organic C content of the mysids during 1 yr. The amount of organic C in the animals was measured by a new technique based on the IR gas analyzer and converted to the energy equivalent. The organic C content varied seasonally from about 50-63%. The values were highest in the young embryos and lowest in young mysids about 2 mo. after liberation, in males after copulation and in females liberating their embryos in the spring after the winter starvation period. In mature animals C contents were high just before the breeding season, in the 2nd cohort in Aug.-Sept., when about 13-15 mo. old, and in the 1st cohort in Nov.-Dec., when about 7 mo. old. The former cohort attained 62-63% and the latter 57-59% organic Ca. The males accumulated Ca faster and earlier, but lost it almost totally in copulation. The females lost about 8% of their stored C in egg-laying, but still had a reserve for the winter. Active feeding was necessary during the winter because the stored C was sufficient for only 2 wk respiration. A male maturing in the 1st yr assimilated 426.4 J and a female 628.0 J. A male maturing in the 2nd yr assimilated 858.4 J and a female 1287.6 J. The corresponding production efficiencies were 34.3, 23.6 and 15.7. The mysid population produced 1.016 .times. 107 kJ, respired 2.670 .times. 107 kJ and assimilated 3.684 .times. 107 kJ in Paajarvi. The production efficiency of the population was 27.58.																			0003-455X	1797-2450					1979	16	2					129	137																WOS:A1979HN44500005

Aerosols entrained from White Sands are sometimes visible on satellite images as distinct, light-colored plumes crossing the Sacramento Mountains to the east and northeast. The IMPROVE network (Interagency Monitoring of PROtected Visual Environments) operates long-term aerosol samplers at two sites east of the Sacramento range. In recent years a spring pulse of sulfate aerosol has appeared at these sites, eclipsing the regional summer peak resulting from atmospheric reactions of sulfur dioxide emissions. A significant fraction of this spring sulfate is contributed by gypsum and other salts from White Sands, with much of the sulfur in coarse particles and concentrations of calcium and strontium above regional levels. The increase in these gypsiferous species coincides with a drought following a period of above-average precipitation. White Sands and the IMPROVE samplers together provide a natural laboratory: a climatically sensitive dust source that is both well characterized and chemically distinct from its surroundings, with a signature that remains identifiable at long-term observatories 100-200 km downwind.

Patterns and trends in lead (Pb) concentrations in bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nestlings from the western Great Lakes region	ECOTOXICOLOGY												Most studies examining bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) exposure to lead (Pb) have focused on adults that ingested spent Pb ammunition during the fall hunting season, often at clinical or lethal levels. We sampled live bald eagle nestlings along waterbodies to quantify Pb concentrations in 3 national park units and 2 nearby study areas in the western Great Lakes region. We collected 367 bald eagle nestling feather samples over 8 years during spring 2006-2015 and 188 whole blood samples over 4 years during spring 2010-2015. We used Tobit regression models to quantify relationships between Pb concentrations in nestling feathers and blood using study area, year, and nestling attributes as covariates. Pb in nestling feather samples decreased from 2006 to 2015, but there was no trend for Pb in blood samples. Pb concentrations in nestling feather and blood samples were significantly higher in study areas located closer to and within urban areas. Pb in feather and blood samples from the same nestling was positively correlated. Pb in feathers increased with nestling age, but this relationship was not observed for blood. Our results reflect how Pb accumulates in tissues as nestlings grow, with Pb in feathers and blood indexing exposure during feather development and before sampling, respectively. Some nestlings had Pb concentrations in blood that suggested a greater risk to sublethal effects from Pb exposure. Our data provides baselines for Pb concentrations in feathers and blood of nestling bald eagles from a variety of waterbody types spanning remote, lightly populated, and human-dominated landscapes.

Samples of water and sediments for microbiological analysis and genotoxicity monitoring were collected from 6 sites during spring and/or autumn 2010. Sanitary analysis, i.e. enumeration of total and fecal coliforms and intestinal enterococci, indicated moderate to critical fecal contamination, while organic load assessment (oligotroph to heterotroph ratio, index of phosphatase activity) revealed the category of moderately polluted water. Mercury-resistant bacteria were detected in all water samples, with high numbers at locations positioned downstream of Belgrade. There was no correlation of the microbiological parameters of the sediment and water samples. Genotoxicity monitoring, performed by the comet assay on hemocytes of mussels Sinanodonta woodiana, indicated a significant increase of DNA damage in mussels collected from the studied sites compared with the control group.					; Tomović, Jelena/GLR-2721-2022; Kolarevic, Stoimir/JQW-3696-2023; Tomovic, Jelena/GLR-2721-2022; Paunović, Momir/H-9177-2019	Paunovic, Momir/0000-0002-6432-1191; Vukovic-Gacic, Branka/0000-0001-8767-1912; Knezevic-Vukcevic, Jelena/0000-0002-8138-6579; Kolarevic, Stoimir/0000-0002-6938-8803; Tomovic, Jelena/0000-0001-6359-0683; 													0354-4664	1821-4339					2011	63	4					1209	1217		10.2298/ABS1104209K	http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ABS1104209K													WOS:000299244500033
J	Prado, P; Caiola, N; Ibáñez, C				Prado, Patricia; Caiola, Nuno; Ibanez, Caries			Water management alters phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in Ebro delta coastal lagoons	LIMNETICA												Coastal lagoons of the Ebro Delta (Catalonia, Spain) have been subjected to historical reductions of their hydrological connections with the sea and to freshwater discharges from rice agriculture, with a more recent switch to freshwater inputs from the Ebro River to improve their trophic state. As a result, the seasonal salinity regime in three formerly connected coastal lagoons varies, being polyhaline to oligohaline from May to November but polyhaline in winter. We evaluate the effects of current water management on the abundance and community structure of phytoplankton and zooplankton within the three lagoons and assess the contribution of environmental variables in February and August. Temporal variation evidenced the typical increase in phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance from winter to summer. However, contrasting August salinities among lagoons showed opposite effects in the two communities, with higher abundance of total zooplankton and lower abundance of total phytoplankton at higher salinities. Besides, each lagoon displayed distinctive groups of taxa and showed important temporal differences. Temperature and salinity were the most important factors determining the structure of assemblages (ca. 60% and 72% of phytoplankton and zooplankton variance, respectively). Compared to the period of agricultural runoff ca. 30 yrs ago, our results show an important decrease in the overall abundance of phytoplankton (>50%), whereas zooplankton abundances are ca. 6 times higher. However, environmental variability associated with the salinity gradient appears to be responsible for observed changes in the abundance and structure of planktonic assemblages.					; Caiola, Nuno/A-5694-2008; Prado, Patricia/J-7483-2012; Prado, Patricia/N-9903-2019; Ibanez, Carles/AAV-6637-2021	Ibanez, Carles/0000-0002-7091-5527; Caiola, Nuno/0000-0003-2692-2954; Prado, Patricia/0000-0002-4986-2010; 													0213-8409	1989-1806				MAY	2017	36	1					113	126		10.23818/limn.36.09	http://dx.doi.org/10.23818/limn.36.09													WOS:000404325000009

Increasing heatwave frequency in streams and rivers of the United States	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												Heatwaves are increasing in frequency, duration, and intensity in ocean, coastal, and lake ecosystems. While positive water temperature trends have been documented in many rivers, heatwaves have not been analyzed. This study examined heatwaves in rivers throughout the United States between 1996 and 2021. Riverine heatwaves increased in frequency over the study period, with the most robust increases occurring in summer and fall, in mid- to high-order streams, and at free-flowing sites and sites above a reservoir. The increase in heatwave frequency was accompanied by an increase in moderate strength heatwaves as well as a doubling of the annual mean total number of heatwave days at a site. Riverine heatwaves were often associated with normal or below-normal discharge conditions and at sites with a mean annual discharge <= 250 m(3) s(-1). These results provide the first assessment of heatwaves in rivers for a large geographic area in the United States.					; Tassone, Spencer/AAH-9053-2020; Ha, Dat/D-4995-2015	Tassone, Spencer/0000-0002-9340-7170; Buelo, Cal/0000-0001-7909-1440; Ha, Dat/0000-0003-4031-4373; Pace, Michael/0000-0001-5945-6131; Besterman, Alice/0000-0003-2311-4281; Walter, Jonathan/0000-0003-2983-751X														2378-2242				APR	2023	8	2					295	304		10.1002/lol2.10284	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10284		OCT 2022											WOS:000862798100001
J	Jan, K; Ahmed, I				Jan, Kousar; Ahmed, Imtiaz			The influence of sex and season on some hematological and biochemical parameters of snow trout Schizothorax labiatus in the Indian Himalayan Region	FISHERIES SCIENCE												Snow trout Schizothorax labiatus constitute a significant part of the diet of large human population of colder regions of the Indian Himalayan subcontinent, and are also important for local livelihoods there. In the present study, the hematological and serum biochemical parameters of S. labiatus were examined with respect to sex and season. Hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, red blood cell (RBC) count and hematocrit (Hct) were higher in males than females in each season, while white blood cell (WBC) count were notably higher in females. A significant difference (P < 0.05) was noted in Hb concentration, RBC and WBC counts, and Hct between males and females during the summer compared to the other seasons. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between erythrocyte indices with respect to sex and season. Serum biochemical parameters (glucose, cholesterol and urea) differed significantly (P < 0.05) between the sexes, as well as among the seasons. However, no significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed in biochemical parameters (total protein, albumin and globulin) with respect to sex, although the highest values of all serum biochemical parameters were reported during the summer and the lowest values during the winter. The data reported here on the influence of sex and season on hematological and biochemical parameters of S. labiatus inhabiting the Sindh River could provide a reliable basis for the future monitoring of the health status of this fish.					; Jan, Kousar/JDC-9440-2023; Ahmed, Imtiaz/I-2083-2019	Ahmed, Dr. Imtiaz/0000-0003-4821-1707; 													0919-9268	1444-2906				JAN	2021	87	1					39	54		10.1007/s12562-020-01469-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-020-01469-3		NOV 2020											WOS:000591257800001
J	Hampton, SE; Romare, P; Seiler, DE				Hampton, SE; Romare, P; Seiler, DE			Environmentally controlled Daphnia spring increase with implications for sockeye salmon fry in Lake Washington, USA	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												In Lake Washington, juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) strongly prefer Daphnia over other prey, switching uniformly to Daphnia when the threshold abundance of 0.4 Daphnia L-1 is achieved. Using long-term Lake Washington data (1978-2001) and fry trap data (1992-2001) from a major tributary, we examined the following: (i) factors that predict Daphnia pulicaria and Daphnia thorata increase to this threshold "switching" abundance, (ii) trends in Daphnia dynamics that may affect sockeye foraging and (iii) temporal correspondence of Daphnia increase and fry arrival. The winter abundance of D. pulicaria, in combination with basic parameters of spring conditions, was an important predictor of the date of D. pulicaria spring increase, indicating greater reliance on pelagic population dynamics (versus diapause hatch) than D. thorata exhibited. In addition, D. pulicaria was a more consistent prey than D. thorata, the latter exhibiting larger population fluctuations. Thus, recently increasing D. thorata prominence could decrease diet consistency for sockeye fry. Additionally, the timing of sockeye arrival to Lake Washington and Daphnia's increase to the switching threshold has become less concordant, so that fry in recent years have had to rely upon less profitable prey for longer periods. Long-term trends and species-specific differences in Daphnia phenology may affect fry through altering diet composition, with additional implications for other zooplankton withstanding greater predation pressure in Daphnia's absence. Recent decades of warming in Lake Washington are consistent with the warming of lakes worldwide, and complex phenological responses such as those reported here may be common as the climate continues to change.

Aquatic invasive species exhibit contrasting seasonal detectability patterns based on environmental DNA: Implications for monitoring	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are a global threat to freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem services. Documenting AIS prevalence at broad spatial scales is critical to effective management and early detection. However, conventional monitoring for AIS is costly and is rarely applied at the resolution and scale required for effective management. Monitoring of AIS using environmental DNA (eDNA) has the potential to enable broadscale surveillance at a fraction of the cost of conventional methods, but key questions must first be addressed related to how eDNA detection probability varies among environments, seasons, and multiple species with different life histories. To quantify spatiotemporal variation in the detection probability of AIS using eDNA sampling, we surveyed 20 lakes with known populations of four aquatic invasive species: common carp (Cyprinus carpio), rusty crayfish (Faxonius rusticus), spiny waterflea (Bythotrephes longimanus), and zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha). We collected water samples at 10 locations per lake, five times throughout the open water season resulting in a total of 1,000 water samples. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used with species-specific assays to determine the presence of each species' eDNA in water samples. With Bayesian occupancy models, we quantified the effects of lake and site characteristics and Julian date on eDNA detection probability. The probability of eDNA detection varied seasonally, and the seasonal variation was species-specific and related to species life histories. Zebra mussel eDNA was generally the most detectable among the species we targeted, and detection probability peaked in midsummer when only six water samples were required to achieve a 95% probability of detection (80% Bayesian credible interval: 3-12 samples). Spiny waterflea eDNA detections also peaked in mid to late summer, but were overall the most difficult species to detect, requiring 160 samples for a 95% probability of detection (80% Bayesian credible interval: 67-1,616 samples). Common carp eDNA was most detectable in the spring and rusty crayfish eDNA was most detectable in the early autumn, corresponding to key life history events. Sampling for eDNA during the optimal time of the year for each species decreased the number of samples required to reach a 95% probability of detection by an order of magnitude or more. Our results are relevant for decision makers interested in using eDNA as a multi-species monitoring tool and highlight the importance of life history in the efficacy of eDNA monitoring.					; Hansen, Gretchen/ABE-3860-2022; Arnold, Todd/H-6945-2019; Rounds, Christopher/HII-8337-2022; Larson, Eric/P-8253-2016; Chun, Chan Lan/K-1016-2019	Nelson, Jenna/0000-0003-2960-8485; Rounds, Christopher/0000-0003-1346-5707; Arnold, Todd/0000-0002-7920-772X; Larson, Eric/0000-0002-9232-5907; Hansen, Gretchen/0000-0003-0241-7048													0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	2024	69	10					1479	1493		10.1111/fwb.14320	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14320		AUG 2024											WOS:001292709300001

Effect of temperature on organic matter transformation in a different ambient nutrient availability	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												We experimentally manipulated the thermal environment in laboratory mesocosms to evaluate the effect of temperature on organic matter transformation in two systems of lower and higher ambient nutrient availability. We used a system of 6 mesocosms, equipped with heating and cooling systems; 3 were filled with water from a mesotrophic lake and 3 with water from a eutrophic lake. Each of the 3 mesocosms were maintained at different temperatures: ambient lake temperature (10 degrees C and 20 degrees C), ambient + 5 degrees C, and ambient + 10 degrees C and the experiment was replicated in twice, in the spring and summer seasons. We measured rates of physicochemical and bacteriological parameters changes over a 2- day period. Results of the study demonstrated that, irrespective of nutrient concentration, an increase in temperature resulted in enhanced the level of labile organic matter, indicated by significantly elevated concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and low values of SUVA (specific UV absorbance = Abs 260 1000/DOC). The effect of temperature was stronger in the lower nutrient concentration in the spring experiment treatments elevated by 5 degrees C. The increase in temperature was additionally accompanied by significant increased total bacterial counts (TBC), biomass (BB) and heterogeneity of bacterioplankton. In the higher nutrient concentration, the increase in temperature exerted a greater influence on the dynamics of concentration of heteromorphic organic matter, shown by the negative correlation between particulate organic carbon (POC) and DOC content and TBC value. The accumulation of considerable quantities of refractory DOC and POC and low bacterioplankton activity may intensify the rate of degradation of eutrophic lake ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kuehn, SC; Foit, FF Jr				Kuehn, SC; Foit, FF Jr			Correlation of widespread Holocene and Pleistocene tephra layers from Newberry Volcano, Oregon, USA, using glass compositions and numerical analysis	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					Pan-Africa PAGES Workshop on African Palaeoperspectives	JUL 19-20, 2004	Nairobi, KENYA	PAGES SSC				During the last ca. 500,000 years, Newberry Volcano in Oregon has produced at least 50 rhyolitic and dacitic tephras ranging from locally distributed pumice rings and cones to ignimbrites to widely dispersed plinian fallout deposits. To date, 13 tephra units with ages ranging from about 1525 C-14 years BP to > 200,000 years BP have been traced to 20 sites across five western states of the USA. Correlations have been established by applying similarity coefficient and discriminant function analysis to major element compositions of tephra-derived glasses determined by electron microprobe analysis. Newberry Pumice correlates to four locations in Oregon and Idaho. East Lake or Central Pumice Cone tephra correlates to two locations in Oregon. Paulina Creek, Ice Quarry, 9912D, 9920C, 984F, 984G5, 9917C, and 9881C tephras correlate to ash beds at Summer Lake, Oregon. Paulina Creek tephra also correlates to several locations in northern California and is equivalent to the Olema ash bed. Tephra 9917C is very similar to tephras K and D at Pringle Falls, Oregon. Lava Pass or a related tephra correlates to all unnamed tephra in the Bonneville basin, Utah. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

J	Chanudet, V; Filella, M				Chanudet, Vincent; Filella, Montserrat			The fate of inorganic colloidal particles in Lake Brienz	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The fate of colloidal particles in Lake Brienz and its two main tributaries, the Aare and Lutschine Rivers, was studied over a period of more than a year. Lake colloid loads from the unmodified Lutschine fluctuated significantly across seasons. The highest loads are in summer due to glacier melting. Colloid loads from the Aare reflected the seasonal water use by upstream hydropower plants. A significant number of mineral particles, even outside the theoretical non-settling range, remain in suspension in the epilimnion of Lake Brienz in summer because of the mineralogical nature and shape of the particles and the high input loads. Only 1730 of the 16,800 tons of colloidal particles that entered the lake during the period from 1 June 2004 - 31 July 2005 were exported through the lake outlet. The remainder was presumably lost in the lake through coagulation-sedimentation processes. Coagulation properties of non-fractionated colloid samples in quiescent conditions were studied in the laboratory both in the absence and presence of different organic compounds representative of natural organic matter. Lake Brienz colloids coagulate slowly, as expected from particles (mainly phyllosilicates) bearing a net negative surface charge. Slightly higher coagulation rates were recorded in March and April during the spring algal bloom, which suggests that colloid coagulation is enhanced by carbohydrates. This effect was confirmed in laboratory experiments. However, the concentration of natural organic matter in Lake Brienz is so low that it is not having any significant effect on the fate of inorganic colloids.

J	Lowndes, AG				Lowndes, AG			The occurrence of Eurytemora lacinulata and Diaptomus gracilis A Critical note	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												A criticism of statements regarding the interrelationships of Eurytemora lacinulata and Diaptomus gracilis, and also on the seasonal distribution of certain species of Cyclops, made by C. Elton in his book on Animal Ecology. Elton stated that E. lacinulata is limited in its inland distribution to ponds not containing Diaptomus, and that these ponds are all artificial and fairly new. Evidence is given of the occurrence of E. lacinulata in older ponds and lakes, and in company with Diaptomus. The statement that D. gracilis has poor powers of dispersal and therefore does not reach new ponds quickly is controverted.

Tyler			Climate and ecology of the palaeo-Agulhas Plain from stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in bovid tooth enamel from Nelson Bay Cave, South Africa	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We measured delta C-13(enamel) and delta O-18(enamel) in 213 archaeological bovid teeth from Nelson Bay Cave (NBC), spanning the last 22 ka. We also recorded dental mesowear (occlusal relief [high versus low] and cusp shape [sharp, round, or blunt]) of all maxillary first and second molars from NBC. We use these values to explore glacial/interglacial shifts in bovid palaeoecology and to reconstruct aspects of the climate and environment of the Palaeo-Agulhas Plain. Our results indicate that at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), there was a significantly greater proportion of C-3 (winter-rainfall) grasses, although some C-4 (summer rainfall) varieties were present. This conclusion is strengthened by correction for lower pCO(2) at the LGM, leading to reduced carbon isotope fractionation in C-3 photosynthesis. Terminal Pleistocene and Holocene grazers show a stronger C-4 signal. Our findings are consistent with an eastwards extension of winter rainfall at the LGM, as proposed by some previous researchers. Beyond the broad distinction between browsers and grazers, delta C-13 values reflect species-specific dietary preferences. delta O-18 is more positive in browsers than grazers, probably due to their deriving a significant proportion of their water intake from evaporatively enriched leaf water. delta O-18 values do not show significant changes through time. The location of Nelson Bay Cave on the present-day interface between temperate and tropical weather systems means that this area is sensitive to past shifts in the relative importance of these systems. These findings therefore contribute to the reconstruction of past Southern Hemisphere climate dynamics on a glacial/interglacial time scale. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Plants inhabiting discrete habitats, like lakes and wetlands, experience dispersal limitation, and rely heavily on zoochory for their spatial population dynamics. Granivorous waterbirds may disperse viable seeds of wetland plants over long distances during migration. The limited knowledge of waterbird migration has long hampered the evaluation of the importance of waterbirds in seed dispersal, requiring key metrics such as realistic dispersal distances. Using recent GPS tracking of mallards during spring migration, we built a mechanistic seed dispersal model to estimate realistic dispersal distances. Mallards are abundant, partially migratory ducks known to consume seeds of >300 European plant species. Based on the tracking data, we informed a mallard migration simulator to obtain a probabilistic spring migration model for the mallard population wintering at Lake Constance in Southern Germany. We combined the spring migration model with seed retention curves to develop seed dispersal kernels. We also assessed the effects of pre-migratory fasting and the availability of suitable deposition habitats for aquatic and wetland plants. Our results show that mallards at Lake Constance can disperse seeds in the northeastern direction over median distances of 293 and 413 km for seeds with short and long retention times, respectively, assuming a departure immediately after foraging. Pre-migratory fasting strongly affected the dispersal potential, with only 1-7% of ingested seeds left for dispersal after fasting for 12 h. Availability of a suitable deposition habitat was generally <5% along the migratory flyway. The high probability of seed deposition in a freshwater habitat during the first stopover, after the mallards completed the first migratory flight, makes successful dispersal most likely to happen at 204-322 km from Lake Constance. We concluded that the directed long-distance dispersal of plant seeds, realized by mallards on spring migration, may contribute significantly to large scale spatial plant population dynamics, including range expansion in response to shifting temperature and rainfall patterns under global warming. Our dispersal model is the first to incorporate detailed behavior of migratory waterbirds and can be readily adjusted to include other vector species when tracking data are available.

J	Öterler, B				Oterler, Burak			Winter Phytoplankton Composition Occurring in a Temporarily Ice-Covered Lake: a Case Study	POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES												It is generally thought that the seasonal succession of phytoplankton is minimized during winter months. However, some studies have indicated that there is also diversity in phytoplankton communities in winter. The main purpose of this study was to determine the phytoplankton community structure and species composition of a lake during winter, when covered with ice. Phytoplankton samples from the lake were taken in the winter seasons of 2015 and 2016, during the period from the appearance of the ice cover on the lake until it completely melted, and phytoplankton composition in the lake and some physicochemical properties of the lake water were measured. The phytoplankton community was found to be dominated by Cyclotella meneghiniana, which is a centric diatom, followed by the flagellates, especially Synura uvella, small cryptophytes (Cryptomonas paramecium), dinoflagellates (Peridinium aciculiferum and Gymnodinium sp.), and nonfilamentous greens (Pediastrum duplex, Scenedesmus spp., and Monoraphidium spp.). Phytoplankton development under ice-cover is largely related to temperature, but the development of phytoplankton composition is random. A low correlation was determined between the dominant organisms and ice thickness. Species biodiversity was low, but the dominant species started to be represented with different taxonomic groups after mid-winter.

J	Krivtsov, V; Bellinger, EG; Sigee, DC				Krivtsov, V; Bellinger, EG; Sigee, DC			Changes in the elemental composition of Asterionella formosa during the diatom spring bloom	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Changes in the elemental composition of the diatom Asterionella formosa within mixed phytoplankton samples were determined over the spring bloom period using energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis. Using a 10 kV electron microprobe, X-ray information from the top 1-2 mu m of the cell revealed overall mean concentrations of: Si (4636 mmol kg(-1) dry wt), P (82), S (54), Cl (71) K (94) and Ca (90). Concentrations of all elements showed wide variation within each date sample, with unimodal frequency distributions approximating to a Normal distribution. Correlation of the entire data set demonstrated clear statistical associations between elements, including Si, P and K. Uptake of Si during the course of the diatom bloom led to a major fall in lake water concentration (1.0 to 0.07 mg l(-1)), which correlated with a decrease in the mean cell Si concentration (6735 to 3107 mmol kg(-1) dry wt) during the final phase of the bloom. Mean cell concentrations of P and K also showed marked decreases with time, in close parallel with cell Si. These changes in P and K were attributed to the high level of internal correlation with Si and not to any significant decrease in P and K availability in the environment.

The crystals precipitate in the alkaline epilimnion between spring and fall turnover, consistent with Langelier Saturation Index calculations that predict calcite precipitation when pH and temperature exceed 7.76 and similar to 15 degrees C, respectively. Climate, primary production, and the pH of the epilimnion control lamina thickness: acid rain primarily affects the precipitation and accumulation of calcite crystals, whereas both endogenic calcite and authigenic organic matter are affected by climate and primary production. Thin varves, often with barely perceptible light-coloured calcite laminae were deposited between the late 1940s and mid-1970s, when the pH of the epilimnion fell slightly in response to deterioration in air and water quality associated with rapid industrialization. Conditions required for precipitation of calcite laminae were absent during the sixteenth to mid-nineteenth centuries, an interval corresponding to the Little Ice Age when no human impact affected the catchment. Varves dating from 1867 CE onwards (the Canadian Zone) facilitate the candidacy of the deep basin sediments of Crawford Lake to define the Anthropocene epoch.

The lake was ice-covered during winter (about 200 days), and hypolimnic water temperature during winter was about 4 degrees C. During winter there was an increase in specific fat, in particular among the larger sized fish, while there was a general decrease in specific protein content among both small (<5 winters) and large (age 5 or older) trout. During winter (end of October to mid-May) an average trout gained 32 kJ of fat, but protein energy content decreased by 14 kJ, yielding a net energy increase of 18 kJ or a daily energy gain of 0.09 kJ . day(-1). During the ice-free season (mid-May to the end of October) the trout increased mainly in protein content with daily energy gains of about 1.4 kJ . day(-1), a value about 14 times higher than the corresponding winter value. Trout living in lakes may store considerable amounts of fat during wintertime in contrast to the depletion of fat reserves found among stream-living trout in the same area, which face lower water temperatures in the winter period.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				SEP	2000	9	3					163	169		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2000.eff090305.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2000.eff090305.x													WOS:000088989900005

Metals such as Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), Potassium (K), Sodium (Na), Copper (Cu), Iron (Fe) and Lead (Pb) were analyzed from six sampling stations i.e. Beaskund, Shamshi, Pandohdam, Dharampur, Nadaun and Pongdam in the study area. The analysis of data reveals that Ca, Mg, K, Na, Cu were found to be within acceptable limit prescribed by WHO, 2011 and BIS, 2012. However, Cd and Pb were found to be higher than acceptable limit prescribed by WHO, 2011 and BIS, 2012. The presence of higher concentration of heavy metals such as Cd and Pb due to their toxicity and bioaccumulation has adverse effect on the health of living beings including humans. The study indicates that water of river Beas needs constant bio monitoring.

We analysed data from 1979 to 2004 from Lake Muggelsee (Berlin, Germany), using physical and biological parameters to define the spring period. We show that a change in timing of spring plankton events in warm years led to the paradox of lower mean water temperatures during the growth period, favouring cold-adapted diatoms over cyanobacteria, and within the diatoms, some cold-adapted centric forms over pennate forms. Under high P : Si ratios, the increased time between phytoplankton and cladoceran peaks opened a loophole for filamentous cyanobacteria (Oscillatoriales) in warm years to establish dominance after the diatoms, which are silicate limited. Therefore, the warming trend promotes filamentous cyanobacteria, a well-known nuisance in eutrophic lakes, and surprisingly, cold-adapted diatoms.

Spatial Measurements of Ultrafine Particles Using an Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer™ within a Local Community Downwind of a Major International Trade Bridge in Buffalo, New York	AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Ultrafine particles (UFP) can be defined as having at least one dimension that is less than 100 nanometers. Because of their dimensions, they exhibit unique properties that affect atmospheric transport, exposures, and possibly health endpoints. Freshly generated Diesel particulate matter (DPM) is predominantly in the ultrafine particle size range size range, which in practice is defined by the detection characteristics of the sampling instrument. During two seasons, an Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer (TM) (TSI, St. Paul, MN) detects particles over a range of 5.6-560 nm was used to continuously measure real-time particle size distributions along several streets that extend from the Peace Bridge (PB), a major international trade bridge, into a the nearby adjacent neighborhood that has reported a high prevalence rate of asthma (LwebugaMukasa 2000). The Peace Bridge connects Buffalo, NY, USA to Fort Erie, ON, Canada. During summer 2004, one minute average particle number concentrations were continuously monitored along neighborhood streets near the Peace Bridge Complex (PBC) plaza out to about 2 km. Ultrafine particle counts as a function of bridge traffic showed downwind UFP levels at 300 m ranging from 60,000-70,000 p/cm(3). Upwind background UFP levels at the shore line of Lake Erie were typically 8,000-10,000 p/cm(3) under similar traffic and meteorological conditions. During winter 2006, additional measurements were conducted in front of several homes that were part of a separate indoor-outdoor exposure study (McAuley et al. 2010). Sampling at the homes was done during the weekdays when heavy diesel truck traffic was highest. Results showed that most of the UFP number concentrations fell between 10-20 nm in front of homes with UFP levels ranging from 59,000 p/cm(3) at couple hundred m downwind to 81,000 p/cm(3) several hundred m directly downwind of the Peace Bridge under similar diesel trucks traffic and meteorological conditions.

The role of eelgrass, Zostera marina L., in the uptake and release of nutrients was investigated for 1977 in relation to studies on the nutrient dynamics of Lake Grevelingen. The internal concentrations of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the above-ground parts showed minima for nitrogen (2% of dry weight (DW)) and phosphorus (0.15% of DW) in summer. The total year''s production of above-ground biomass was calculated as 8510 tons ashfree dry weight (AFDW) for the entire Lake Grevelingen; 93% of eelgrass biomass entered the detritus pool. The decomposition processes of leaching, fragmentation, mineralization, transport and burial are presented in a descriptive model, and input and output data are given. An eelgrass sub-system in shallow water and a gully sub-system in the deeper parts where eelgrass detritus is deposited have been recognized. In autumn, .apprx.2% of the eelgrass annual production accumulated near the seawalls. In spring, only 4% of the eelgrass production of the previous year was detected as coarse and fine detritus on the bottom of gullies and sandflats. Eelgrass decomposes slowly and it is likely that, according to the model calculations, after 1 year about one-third of the total eelgrass detritus pool finally accumulates as ultrafine particulate organic matter (POM) on the anoxic gully bottom. From 1971 until 1978, Lake Grevelingen was isolated from the North Sea and rivers. During this period, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool in the water column increased by 2-3 mg l-1. Refractory DOC derived from leaching eelgrass detritus contributed 25-40% of this increase. The amounts of nutrients fixed by eelgrass during the growing season, May-August, were estimated at 3829 tons of carbon,178 tons of nitrogen and 29 tons of phosphorus. These amounts are quite high compared to the results of nutrient balance studies of Lake Grevelingen. It can be concluded that eelgrass is of such importance for the nutrient cycling in Lake Grevelingen that its role must be integrated in the existing nutrient balance model.																			0304-3770	1879-1522				MAR	1988	30	3					189	214		10.1016/0304-3770(88)90051-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3770(88)90051-4													WOS:A1988N308000002
J	Baran-Gurgul, K; Walega, A				Baran-Gurgul, Katarzyna; Walega, Andrzej			Seasonal and Regional Patterns of Streamflow Droughts in Poland: A 50-Year Perspective	SUSTAINABILITY												Hydrological drought in Central Europe is becoming an increasingly serious threat to agriculture, industry, and people due to climate change and the rising frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The main aim of the paper was to assess the spatial variability of streamflow drought in Poland. The spatial analysis was conducted using daily streamflow series from 340 gauging stations for the period 1973-2022. Hydrological drought was defined as a period with a streamflow lower than Q90%. The results show that, on average, hydrological droughts occur 52 times per year at a given gauging station. Drought duration and volume depend on the gauge elevation. At higher-altitude stations, shorter and smaller-volume droughts are most commonly observed. The longest droughts are recorded in Northern Poland, particularly in the Lakeland regions, which is a serious problem mainly for the agriculture sector. Hydrological droughts in Poland most frequently begin in summer and end in late summer or early autumn. Analyses showed that hydrological drought has a strong spatial distribution, and it is possible to identify five main regions with homogeneous drought duration and volume. Trend analysis of the annual number of low-flow days indicates no statistically significant trend at 46% of stations, while 54% exhibit statistically significant increases, with marked regional variability. The highest number of stations with statistically significant decreasing trends occurs in the Southern and Eastern Baltic Lake District and in the Central Poland Lowlands and Highlands with Polesie. The study highlights the necessity of enhancing water retention, particularly in the central, lowland regions of Poland.

Aschers. In the winter, the activity was low (5 .mu.mol of N m-2 h-1) and was restricted to the uppermost debris layer at a depth of 0 to 1 cm. By midsummer, the activity increased to 50 .mu.mol of N m-2 h-1 and was found throughout the root zone to a depth of 10 cm. The root zone accounted for as much as 50 to 70% of the annual denitrification. A significant release of organic substrates from the roots seemed to determine the high activities of root zone denitrification in the summer. The denitrification in the surface layer and in the root zone formed two distinct activity zones in the summer, when the root zone also contained nitrification activity, as indicated from the accumulation of NO3-. Light conditions inhibited dentrification in both the surface layer and the upper part of the root zone, suggesting that a release of O2 by benthic algae and from the roots of L. uniflora controlled a diel variation of denitrification. In midsummer, the rate of denitrification in both the surface layer and the upper part of the root zone was limited by NO3-. In the growth season, there was evidence for a significant population of dentrifiers closely associated with the root surface.																			0099-2240	1098-5336				JUN	1986	51	6					1174	1179		10.1128/AEM.51.6.1174-1179.1986	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.51.6.1174-1179.1986								16347074					WOS:A1986C593100005

Fish were captured by electrofishing near spawning areas in two tributaries 60 km apart, fitted with temperature-sensing radiotransmitters and released in their "home" tributaries or displaced to the lake 3-10 km from these tributaries. Twenty-six percent of displaced smallmouth bass and 42% of rock bass returned to their original sites of capture in tributaries. Non-homing fish generally dispersed along the lake shore and eventually established small residence areas in the lake, often near home or other tributaries. No differences were observed in movement rates, temperatures occupied or diel activity patterns between years or tributary stock, but differences were found between species and between lake and tributary habitats for smallmouth bass. Smallmouth bass homing to, or released in tributaries generally established home ranges downstream from spawning areas and often occupied tributaries all summer, but rock bass did not. Both species occupied temperatures between 20-22 C in lake and tributary habitats when available. Smallmouth bass were most active in May, least active in July and generally more active in the lake than in tributaries. Rock bass activity did not appear to vary by season or habitat. Both species were most active Lake Ontario at mid-day; differences in tributaries were less pronounced.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	1988	4	4					425	440		10.1080/02705060.1988.9665194	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1988.9665194													WOS:A1988R307500003
J	Kienel, U; Schwab, MJ; Schettler, G				Kienel, U; Schwab, MJ; Schettler, G			Distinguishing climatic from direct anthropogenic influences during the past 400 years in varved sediments from Lake Holzmaar (Eifel, Germany)	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A 336-year floating varve chronology from Lake Holzmaar (Eifel, Western Germany) covering the recent period has been established by microfacies analysis of thin sections. This sequence terminates 23 cm below the core top. In the top 23 cm, the varves are disturbed. By means of linear regression, the varve sequence was dated to the period AD 1607 - 1942. The influences of climatic variability and anthropogenic activities in the lake's catchment (e. g., forestry, agriculture) on lithology, fabric, and microfossil content of the varve sublaminae could be discriminated by applying statistical analyses (ordination and clustering) to the combination of the sublaminae in the varves and their thickness. Four clusters are obtained. Cluster 1 indicates cold springs, and shorter, cooler summers reflected primarily in below-average varve thickness (VT) for two stable phases: from AD 1650 - 1700 (during the Maunder Minimum) and from AD 1750 - 1785. Cluster 2 indicates years with conditions transitional to that indicated by cluster 1, characterized by vigorous and prolonged spring circulation with massive blooms of the nordic-alpine Aulacoseira subarctica. The samples assigned to Cluster 3 and Cluster 4 show the imprint of anthropogenic influences. Cluster 3 (AD 1795 - 1815 and AD 1825 - 1885) is characterized by above-average VT due to high detritus input throughout the year. The increased soil erosion can be linked to anthropogenic deforestation as a consequence of the production increase of the Eifelian iron industry at the end of the 18th century. This input dampens the climatic signal of a colder Dalton Minimum, which is reflected in a short drop in VT centered around AD 1810. At about AD 1885, Cluster 4 conditions, characterized by increased nutrient concentrations, low detritus input, and longer periods of stable summer strati. cation, become the stable state in Lake Holzmaar. They indicate the response of the lake to natural reforestation and the use of artificial fertilizers in the catchment, which began, according to historical records, in the 1850s in the Eifel region. The prolonged, stable summer strati. cation periods may be the first indication of the modern warming trend. A drop in VT centered around AD 1890 and recurring cluster-1 conditions may indicate the Damon Minimum.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2005	33	3					327	347		10.1007/s10933-004-6311-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-004-6311-z													WOS:000227704300006

The high-resolution resistivity data acquired with the FloaTEM method (a floating transient electromagnetic system) showed structures interpreted as glacio-tectonically stacked layers beneath the lake that connect the deep aquifer with sand layers just beneath the lakebed. Satellite-based temperature data (Landsat) were used to create a lake surface anomaly map showing where sufficient volumes of relatively cold (9 degrees C) groundwater might seep into the lake with an average water surface temperature of 20-23 degrees C on the warmest summer days. Drone-borne thermal infrared imaging of the winter ice cover indicates thaw holes (i.e., hotspots) created by upwelling relatively warm groundwater. Traditional methods, including in-lake boreholes sampling of the lakebed sediments, and installation of in-lake piezometers were used to support and constrain the geological interpretation of geophysical data and detect hydraulic gradients. The combined use of field-methods showed a lakebed covered by thick low-permeability clay till only accommodating focused groundwater discharge to subaqueous springs in areas where tilted layers derived from glacial tectonics convey the artesian pressure from a deep aquifer.

The milky water phenomenon ("whiting") occurred regularly in summer and fall during the period studied, 1972-1975, in Lakes Ontario, Erie and Michigan but not in Superior and Huron. In situ data provide nearly irrefutable evidence that these whitings are calcareous. They are attributed to supersaturation of CaCO3 during periods of thermal stratification and are most intense in the warmer areas of the lakes. The whitings are maximal several meters below the surface and are undoubtedly significant with respect to light transmission, affecting the euphotic zone and thereby photosynthetic production. They may serve as lakewide markers in synoptic analysis of large-scale epilimnial horizontal motions.

J	Harding, RJ; Pomeroy, JW				Harding, RJ; Pomeroy, JW			Energy balance of the winter boreal landscape	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												During the winter of 1993/94 a study to quantify the Minter energy balance of the main cover types of the boreal landscape took place. The study was based an the southern edge of boreal forest in Canada. Measurements were made over a mature jack pine stand and a frozen lake. Shortwave albedos of 12% to 14% over the jack pine and 20% to 88% on the frozen lake (both depending on snow cover) were measured. There were correspondingly large contrasts in the total radiation inputs and the turbulent heat fluxes. The mean net all-wave radiation input was large and positive into the forest and negative over the lake. The sensible heat fluxes were of the same sign as the radiative inputs with positive values over the forest peaking at +200 W m(-2) and falling to -100 W m(-2) over the lake. The evaporation from the forest depended on whether the there was snow on the canopy. When the canopy was snow-free, the evaporation was low, about 50% of net radiation but, when there was snow on the canopy, the evaporation was large, 4 mm over a 36-hour period. The results of these experiments are being used to design much-improved descriptions of boreal forest within the next generation of climate models.

To assess the impact of these pollution sources on local air quality, the chemical composition of PM10 aerosol particles was collected within a year at Dushanbe, Tajikistan. Primary sources of the pollutants, their impact on PM10 composition, and their seasonal trends were assessed. The measurement approach employed analysis of trace metals, ions, organic compounds, laboratory investigations, diagnostic ratio calculations, all complemented by positive matrix factor analysis. The results reveal that for about 70% of the year, PM10 levels (80 +/- 55 mu g m(-3) as the annual average) in Dushanbe were higher than the WHO limits, with varying levels during the seasons. Summer concentrations peaked up to 434 mu g m(-3) due to a combined mineral and road dust influence. Interestingly, winter concentrations reached 152 mu g m(-3) due to strong contributions (about 64%) from residential heating and fossil fuel combustion, often triggered during sub-10 degrees C temperatures. Mineral dust events were associated with elevated concentrations of trace metals, including Zn and Pb, alongside organic carbon and high-chain n - alkanes. During such events, Ca/Fe, Ca/Al ratios exceeded those of Saharan dust, suggesting a high salt content in Asian dust, potentially influenced by dried-off lake emissions. It was striking to observe that winter periods exhibited concerning levels of carcinogenic PAHs, such as benzo(b)fluoranthene (<25 ng m(-3)) and benzo[a]pyrene (<12 ng m(-3), BaP), with average values of 4.1 +/- 5.9 ng m(-3) (BaP) that significantly exceed WHO recommendations. The high PM10 and PAH exposure could pose severe health risks, necessitating collective attention from the local authorities in developing new mitigation strategies concerning the reduction of emissions from residential heating of coal and wood in winter to curb combustion emissions and reduce exposure.					; Souza, Eduardo/MGT-1708-2025; Abdullaev, Sabur/GZK-4288-2022; Hofer, Julian/JBR-9629-2023; Herrmann, Hartmut/C-2486-2009	dos Santos Souza, Eduardo Jose/0000-0003-2626-6424; Fomba, Khanneh Wadinga/0000-0002-4952-4863													1352-2310	1873-2844				SEP 15	2024	333								120667	10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.120667	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.120667		JUN 2024											WOS:001283116300001

Based on metabarcoding data obtained from a meromictic lake ecosystem (Pavin, France), we performed a morpho-physio-phenological traits-based approach to infer functional groups of microbial eukaryotes. Metatranscriptomic data were also analysed to assess the metabolic potential of these groups across the diel cycle, size fraction, sampling depth, and periods. Our analysis highlights a huge microbial eukaryotic diversity in the monimolimnion characterized by numerous saprotrophs expressing transcripts related to sulfur and nitrate metabolism as well as dissolved and particulate organic matter degradation. We also describe strong seasonal variations of microbial eukaryotes in the mixolimnion, especially for parasites and mixoplankton. It appears that the water mixing (occurring during spring and autumn) which benefits photosynthetic host communities also promotes parasitic fungi dissemination and over-expression of genes involved in the zoospore phototaxis and stage transition in the parasitic cycle. Mixoplanktonic haptophytes over-expressing photosynthesis-, endocytosis- and phagosome-linked genes under nutrient limitation also suggest that phagotrophy may provide them an advantage over non-phagotrophic phytoplankton.					; Aury, Jean-Marc/N-1621-2019; BILLARD, Hermine/HPI-2266-2023; Monjot, Arthur/LRB-6383-2024	AURY, Jean-Marc/0000-0003-1718-3010; Courtine, Damien/0000-0002-9162-0111; Wawrzyniak, Ivan/0000-0002-5362-6117; DA SILVA, Corinne/0000-0002-7618-7831; Mone, Anne/0000-0002-8686-703X; Monjot, Arthur/0000-0002-6978-4785; Bronner, Gisele/0000-0002-4863-4518													1462-2912	1462-2920				DEC	2023	25	12					3406	3422		10.1111/1462-2920.16531	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.16531		NOV 2023						37916456					WOS:001097007400001

SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN DENITRIFYING BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES IN SEDIMENTS, WATER, AND EPIPHYTIC BIOFILMS OF MACROPHYTIC LAKE	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Microbially driven plays a crucial role in nitrogen cycling within aquatic ecosystems. However, seasonal variations in denitrifying bacterial communities (DBC) in aquatic environments remain insufficiently understood. This study used high-throughput sequencing to examine seasonal shifts in DBC within the sediments, water, and epiphytic biofilms (EB) of Caohai Lake, China. Phylum-level analysis revealed that unclassified bacteria and Proteobacteria were the dominant groups in both nirS-type and nirKtype DBC. Significant structural differences were found among DBC in different habitats, with sediments and water exhibiting higher diversity compared to EB. Moreover, the co-occurrence networks of nirS-type and nirK-type DBC were more complex in EB during winter than in summer. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of DBC ecology in macrophytic lake systems.																			1589-1623	1785-0037				2025 JUL 31	2025										10.15666/aeer/2305_93019317	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/2305_93019317		JUL 2025											WOS:001560955400001

Extended Molting against the Background of Climate Warming Explains the Emergence of the Baikal Seal (Pusa sibirica, Pinnipedia) onto Coastal Rookeries	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												An analysis of the video films taken at a Baikal seal rookery in the period 2011-2021 on Dolgii Island (Ushkan'i Islands, northern Lake Baikal), showed that the total number and time of emergence of animals onto the shore were determined by the time of the disappearance of ice in the northern part of the lake. Nonetheless, regardless of the ice regime, a significant part of the animals (up to 80%) leaving land continued molting. At the same time, the nature of molting (its topology) was disturbed in the vast majority of cases, molting being diffuse in character, often with elements of pathological manifestations. The number of molting individuals (in %) decreased by autumn, but still remained large, even though such dynamics were not observed every year. Incomplete molting did not interfere with fattening of the animals, as most seals were well or very well fed (especially by autumn), with individuals leaving the rookery immediately after the disappearance of ice also being quite fat. At the same time, animals in coastal haulouts showed pathologies of the skin and hairline annually, the occurrence of which was probably associated, among other things, with abnormal molting. A large number of animals seem to leave for wintering with an incomplete molt, with their further fate being unknown. The data obtained indicate that disturbing the dormancy of molting seals on rookeries is inadmissible, since the excessive factor of disturbance (observed at the rookery at the present time) can play significantly negative roles affecting the physical condition (health) of animals.																			1062-3590	1608-3059				DEC	2023	50	8					2050	2062		10.1134/S1062359023080198	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1062359023080198													WOS:001125987500011

Little is known about nutrient dynamics within coastal wetlands or their role in modifying or contributing to nutrient fluxes from watersheds to Lake Superior. We conducted an intensive study of Lost Creek Wetland (LCW) near Cornucopia, Wl, with the objective of determining influences of temporal variability in hydrology on dynamics and retention of N and P. We measured hydrologic inputs and distributions of inorganic and organic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus within LCW under hydrologic conditions ranging from summer base flow to spring snow melt. Our study confirms that the interrelationship between hydrologic connections to take and tributary and seasonal variations in hydrology can regulate internal nutrient dynamics of coastal wetlands. The strength of hydrologic linkage of LCW to Lake Superior and tributary varied greatly among seasons, resulting in shifts in the relative importance of these nutrient sources and influencing spatial distribution of nutrients within the wetland. Ratios of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in the wetland were consistently low (< 16) indicating a potential for nitrogen limitation. Retention of inorganic nitrogen ranged from 11% to 94% and was positively related to hydraulic residence time which ranged from 1 day during snow melt to 26 days in summer. Retention of total and soluble reactive phosphorus was generally lower than retention of inorganic nitrogen and was not related to hydraulic residence time.																			0380-1330						2004	30			1			82	96		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70379-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70379-2													WOS:000227991500007

The age-depth model was established using fifteen AMS C-14 dates. Lake water level began increasing about AD 400, and reached its maximum during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), AD similar to 900-1100. Low lake water level was recorded during the Little Ice Age (LIA), AD similar to 1400-1820, which allowed macrophyte development in the littoral zone that was recorded by high C-org/N-total ratios. Considerable lake level variability was evident during the Current Warm Period (CWP). Humid/dry conditions in northeast Brazil during MCA/LIA, respectively, are related to the southward shift of Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during austral summer and fall. Those conditions contrast with records of a decrease/increase in the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) during these periods. This observation also contrasts with paleoclimate inferences from the circum-Caribbean region indicating a northward shift of the ITCZ northern hemisphere summer position during the MCA and a southward shift during the LIA. We suggest that these shifts in ITCZ seasonality were higher during the MCA and smaller during the LIA. Our aim was to answer whether the zonal atmospheric circulation cell between the Amazon and northeast Brazil was responsible for antiphasing with the SASM. A strong monsoon over South America during the LIA reinforced convection upon Amazon, increasing the northeast low in the upper troposphere and large-scale subsidence over northeast Brazil and the Atlantic Ocean leading to a northward repositioning of the South Atlantic Subtropical Anticyclone. These factors in combination may have limited the southward seasonal shift of ITCZ, and they must have been responsible for drier conditions in northeast Brazil during the LIA. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrologic response to extreme warm and cold summers in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, East Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												The meteorological characteristics and hydrological response of an extreme warm, and cold summer in the McMurdo Dry Valleys are compared. The driver behind the warmer summer conditions was the occurrence of down-valley winds, which were not present during the colder summer. Occurrence of the summer down-valley winds coincided with lower than typical mean sea level pressure in the Ross Sea region. There was no significant difference in the amount of solar radiation received during the two summers. Compared to the cold summer, glaciological and hydrological response to the warm summer in Taylor Valley included significant glacier mass loss, and 3- to nearly 6000-fold increase in annual streamflow. Lake levels decreased slightly during the cold summer, and increased between 0.54 and 1.01 m during the warm summer, effectively erasing the prior 14 years of lake level lowering in a period of three months. Lake level rise during the warm summer was shown to be strongly associated with and increase in degree days above freezing at higher elevations. We suggest that strong summer down-valley winds may have been responsible for the generation of large glacial lakes during the Last Glacial Maximum when ice core records recorded annual temperatures significantly colder than present.

J	Granados, I; Toro, M; Giralt, S; Camacho, A; Montes, C				Granados, Ignacio; Toro, Manuel; Giralt, Santiago; Camacho, Antonio; Montes, Carlos			Water column changes under ice during different winters in a mid-latitude Mediterranean high mountain lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Winter limnology has been developed mainly in northern-temperate or subarctic lakes, while mid-latitude Mediterranean high mountain lakes have been less studied during the ice-covered season. We present a five-year study in one of these lower latitude high mountain lakes, conducted with multiprobes located at two different depths recording high-frequency data. We have studied highly contrasted winters regarding temperature and snowfall. The results of a principal component analysis and a subsequent hierarchical clustering show that bottom oxygen depletion under ice is strongly influenced by winter cover thickness and transparency. A thick and opaque winter cover (dark mode) leads to an intense oxygen depletion until anoxia, while a thin and clear winter cover (clear mode) allows higher dissolved oxygen saturation due to oxygen production by photosynthesis. Under unusual conditions of cold and dry climate, only a weak decrease in bottom dissolved oxygen was observed. The extent of dissolved oxygen depletion and its relationship with meteorological parameters and climate patterns are further investigated with generalized additive models. Winter cover thickness and phenology are driven by the joint effect of the North Atlantic Oscillation and East Atlantic climatic patterns. Ice phenology could also influence the following ice-free period given the correlation of lake heat content with the ice-off date and the ice cover length. We propose some features jointly occurring in Lake Cimera as a model for mid-latitude Mediterranean high mountain lakes, including (yet not exclusive) the occurrence of very thick winter covers, the prevalence of dark mode, the relatively high and similar through the years oxygen depletion rates, and high water temperatures during the ice-free periods. It is unclear how the ongoing climate change will affect the prevalence of dark over clear modes due to the expected antagonistic effects of warmer temperatures and lower snowfalls.

Arctic Tundra Lake Drainage Increases Snow Storage in Drifts	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Snowdrifts formed by wind transported snow deposition represent a vital component of the earth surface processes on Arctic tundra. Snow accumulation on steep slopes particularly at the margins of rivers, coasts, lakes, and drained lake basins (DLBs) comprise a significant water storage component for the ecosystem during spring and summer snowmelt. The tundra landscape is in constant change as lakes drain, substantially altering the surface morphology that partially controls how snow drifts and accumulates throughout the cold seasons. Here, we combine field measurements, remote sensing observations, and snow modeling to investigate how lake drainage affects snow redistribution at Inigok on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska, where the snow movement is controlled by wind. Field observations included measurements of snow depth using ground penetrating radar and probe. We mapped mid-July snow cover and modeled snow redistribution before and after drainage simulation for 33 lakes (similar to 30 km(2)) in our study area (similar to 140 km(2)). Our results show the advantage of using a wide range of snow depth measurements on frozen lakes, DLBs, and upland to validate the snow modeling in order to capture the variability inherent in the landscape. The lake drainage simulation suggests an increase in snow storage of up to similar to 24% at DLBs compared to extant lakes, similar to 35% considering only snowdrifts (assumed as >= 1 m depth), and similar to 4% considering the whole study area. This increase in snow accumulation could significantly impact the landscape when it melts, including wildlife, vegetation, biogeochemical processes, and potential natural hazards like snow-dam outburst floods. Plain Language Summary Snowdrift is formed when snow accumulates on hills due to wind transport and it is a vital source of water when the snow melts during the spring and summer. Lake drainage in the Arctic tundra creates ideal topographical conditions for snowdrift formation. This study combines field measurements of snow depth, remote sensing observations of summer snow cover, lake drainage simulation, and snow modeling to quantify how much snow is stored in drifts before and after lake drainage. Our study site is in Inigok on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska, where wind controls the snow transport. We simulated lake drainage and calculated the volume of snow that is stored in the drained basins. We found that snow accumulation in drifts increases after lake drainage. The larger the lake, the higher the amount of snow stored in the basin after drainage.					; Correa Rangel, Rodrigo/GRS-5496-2022; Rangel, Rodrigo Correa/GRS-5496-2022	Parsekian, Andrew/0000-0001-5072-9818; Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711; Correa Rangel, Rodrigo/0000-0003-4934-7016; Ohara, Noriaki/0000-0002-7829-0779													2169-9003	2169-9011				SEP	2023	128	9							e2023JF007294	10.1029/2023JF007294	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2023JF007294													WOS:001066231500001
J	Amirbahman, A; Pearce, AR; Bouchard, RJ; Norton, SA; Kahl, JS				Amirbahman, A; Pearce, AR; Bouchard, RJ; Norton, SA; Kahl, JS			Relationship between hypolimnetic phosphorus and iron release from eleven lakes in Maine, USA	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												We studied five eutrophic ( high phosphorus) and six mesotrophic/oligotrophic ( low phosphorus) lakes in Maine, USA, all of which are dimictic and develop anoxic hypolimnia during stratification. The lakes were sampled during the stratified period from May to September 1999. Late summer hypolimnetic total phosphorus ( P) concentrations in the high-P lakes ranged from 185 to 460 ppb; epilimnetic total P increased up to 30 ppb from the spring to the fall overturn. During the same period, the low-P lakes had hypolimnetic total P concentrations in the range of 6 - 19 ppb. Individual high-P lakes demonstrated strong temporal correlations between aqueous hypolimnetic dissolved Fe and total P concentrations (R-2 greater than or equal to 0.88) with an average molar Fe: P ratio of 11.9 4.2. For the combined data, the high-P lakes exhibited strong correlation between hypolimnetic Fe and P concentrations (R-2 = 0.82). The low-P lakes, however, did not show a good correlation between the hypolimnetic Fe and P concentrations. Among the low-P lakes two lakes had hypolimnetic Fe fluxes comparable to the Fe fluxes of the high-P lakes. These two lakes had considerably higher hypolimnetic Fe: P ratios than all other lakes studied here. There were no significant differences in surface sediment Fe( III) or P fractions that correlated with the differences in the relationship between aqueous concentrations of Fe and P in these two outlier low-P lakes. A model for the generation of hypolimnetic acid neutralization capacity (ANC) was developed based on microbially-catalyzed reduction of Fe( III) hydroxide, Mn(IV) oxide and sulfate. Reduction of Fe( III) hydroxide was the most important contributor to the increase in the hypolimnetic ANC in all high-P and the two outlier lakes. Assuming that all hypolimnetic P was due to the reduction of Fe( III) hydroxide by bacteria and sulfide, average summer hypolimnetic P flux for each lake was predicted using the sediment reducible Fe( III): P ratio. The observed and predicted average P fluxes in the high-P lakes corresponded reasonably, suggesting that in these lakes internal P release is closely related to the reduction of Fe( III) hydroxide. Other release or sequestration mechanisms may operate for the release and availability of P in the low-P lakes.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				OCT	2003	65	3					369	385		10.1023/A:1026245914721	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026245914721													WOS:000186041300005

The temporal variation and spatial relationships of soundscape components to the landscape in winter have not been quantified and described until now. Objectives Our objectives were to determine the temporal and spatial variation and acoustic-environmental relationships of a winter soundscape in south-central Alaska. Methods We recorded ambient sounds at 62 locations throughout Kenai National Wildlife Refuge (December 2011-April 2012). We calculated the normalized power spectral density in 59,597 recordings and used machine learning to determine acoustic-environmental relationships and produce spatial models of soundscape components. Results Geophony was the most prevalent component (84 %) followed by technophony (15 %), and biophony (1 %). Geophony occurred primarily at night, varied little by month, and was strongly associated with lakes. Technophony and biophony had similar temporal variation, peaking in April. Technophony occurred closer to urban areas and at locations with high snowmobile activity. Biophony occurred closer to rivers and was inversely related to snowmobile activity. Over 75 % of sample sites had > 1 recordings of airplane or snowmobile noise, mainly in remote areas. Conclusions The soundscape displayed distinct patterns across 24-h and monthly timeframes. These patterns were strongly associated with land cover variables which demonstrate discrete acoustic-environmental relationships exhibiting distinct spatial patterns in the landscape. Despite the predominance of geophony, the presence of technophony in this winter soundscape may have significant negative effects to wildlife and wilderness quality.

J	Worsa-Kozak, M; Arsen, A				Worsa-Kozak, Magdalena; Arsen, Adalbert			Groundwater Urban Heat Island in Wroclaw, Poland	LAND												In the face of climate change and constantly progressing urbanization processes, so-called heat islands are observed with growing frequency. These phenomena are mainly characteristic of large cities, where increased air and land surface temperatures form an atmospheric (AUHI) or surface (SUHI) urban heat island (UHI). Moreover, UHIs have also been recognized in the underground environments of many cities worldwide, including groundwater (GUHI). However, this phenomenon is not yet as thoroughly studied as AUHI and SUHI. To recognize and characterize the thermal conditions beneath the city of Wroclaw (SW, Poland), we analyze the groundwater temperature (GWT) of the first aquifer, measured in 64 wells in 2004-2005. The study aimed to identify groundwater urban heat islands (GUHI) in Wroclaw. Therefore, we used a novel approach to gather data and analyze them in predefined seasonal periods. Meteorological data and satellite imagery from the same period allowed us to link GWT anomalies to the typical conditions that favor UHI formation. GWT anomaly related to the GUHI was identified in the central, urbanized part of Wroclaw. Moreover, we found that the GUHI phenomenon occurs only seasonally during the winter, which is related to the city's climate zone and anthropogenic heat sources. Comparing our results with previous works from other cities showed untypical behavior of the observed anomalies. In contrast to AUHI and SUHI temperatures, the GWT anomalies detected in Wroclaw are characterized by seasonal transitions from a heat island in winter to a cold lake in summer. Such a transitional character of GUHI is described for the first time.

Modeling the propagation of impurities from point sources in the winter atmosphere of the Baikal region	26TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEAN OPTICS, ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS	Proceedings of SPIE				26th International Symposium on Atmospheric and Ocean Optics, Atmospheric Physics	JUL 06-10, 2020	Moscow, RUSSIA	Russian Fdn Basic Res, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, V E Zuev Inst Atmospher Opt, Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Inst Solar Terrestrial Phys, Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geosphere Dynam, MDPI, Atmosphere Journal, Photon Journal, Laser Syst LLC				The paper presents some results of a numerical scenario on pollutants dispersion in the south of the Lake Baikal region. We used the scenario approach and simulated the case corresponding to the late fall or early winter. At this time, in Eastern Siberia, low temperatures are established in the atmosphere and on the ground. However, Lake Baikal is not yet covered with ice: according to climatic data, ice cover appears only in January. Therefore, a situation arises when large temperature gradients between land and lake form in vast areas of the region. Under such conditions, we examined the formation of atmospheric circulation in the Baikal region. To describe the meteorological processes, we use a mesoscale model for the dynamics of the atmosphere, developed in ICMMG SB RAS. Performing the scenario, we use the results of the COSMO-SIB6 predictive mesoscale model to specify the initial distributions of meteorological fields. Based on hydrodynamic processes, we also simulated the processes of impurity propagation from the sources of the Irkutsk-Cheremkhovo industrial hub and other major industrial centers in the region. Under the conditions of the considered winter scenario with north-west background flow, the calculation results showed that the lightweight impurities from high sources at the enterprises of the region not only from Irkutsk, but also from more distant enterprises of the Angarsk complex can reach the water area of Lake Baikal.					; Faleychik, Larisa/B-4346-2016; Pyanova, Elza/S-3093-2017; Penenko, Vladimir/A-8748-2016	Gochakov, Aleksander/0000-0001-9909-9730; Faleychik, Larisa/0000-0003-2963-1992; Pyanova, Elza/0000-0002-9505-9448; 													0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-3942-3				2020	11560								1156071	10.1117/12.2575569	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2575569													WOS:000652167500250

The objective of this study was to use normalised size spectra (NSS) to investigate whether small-scale spatial variation in predation risk (by fish) can modulate zooplankton community structure at the within-lake level in a small temperate lake.We tested the difference in the NSS between two hydrologically well-connected basins of a lake exhibiting contrasting thermal regimes. The first is a well-mixed shallow basin (max. depth 2.5 m) that is inaccessible to brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) during summer because the temperature is too warm. The second is a deeper basin (max. depth 18 m) offering a thermal refuge during summer because of lake stratification. As a consequence of these differences in fish accessibility, the fishless basin should contain larger and more abundant zooplankters, inducing a change in NSS slope and height.Our results showed that both the zooplankton size structure and taxonomic composition were distinct in the two basins, with a higher proportion of small individuals and a higher abundance of zooplankton in the shallow basin compared to the deep one. Furthermore, following cooling of the epilimnion in late summer, the zooplankton communities of both basins exhibited a clear shift in size structure and species composition: in autumn, there were smaller individuals and larger proportions of Bosminidae and Daphniidae compared to colonial rotifers than in summer. These results suggest a potential effect of the change in the spatial distribution of brook charr which feed preferentially on large individuals, reducing the average body size of the zooplankton community.Our results show that predation risk by fish can induce a spatial and temporal variation in zooplankton community structure within small temperate lake ecosystems exhibiting contrasted thermal regimes. Other potential predators also influenced the zooplankton community structure, creating a complex interplay that has to be taken into account to disentangle ecological processes and predict their future changes.

Salts can accumulate through a variety of primary and secondary processes with the soil degrading directly and indirectly as the physico-chemical properties are altered. Preliminary results are presented here for two contrasting salt-affected landscapes in North Africa and Spain. The Guadalentin Valley, Murcia, Spain has increasingly been used for irrigation-related agricultural production which has expanded rapidly, both spatially and in intensity. This has lead to an increased water demand, overexploitation of aquifers and a fall in piezometric level with the deeper groundwaters being increasingly contaminated with salts. Application of these saline waters has led to areas of the valley being abandoned due to soil salinisation preventing even the most tolerant crops from growing. Within the soil profile salt accumulation is dictated predominantly by the irrigation methods employed and quality and quantity of waters used. Salinisation was found to be highest on intensely flood-irrigated land, with a complex spatial pattern found. The Chott el Fedjad, Tunisia is a naturally salt affected landscape. Salts accumulate as meteoric waters containing dissolved solutes collect to form lakes in local low depressions during winter. In summer as the lake water evaporates salts are concentrated and precipitated out as evaporites as the water table progressively drops. In this natural system the brine and soil salinity were found to increase towards the centre of the chott where the water table was also at its shallowest.																					90-5809-571-1				2003							327	334		10.1201/NOE9058095718.ch34	http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/NOE9058095718.ch34													WOS:000184355600034
J	STONER, JD; LORENZ, DL; WICHE, GJ; GOLDSTEIN, RM				STONER, JD; LORENZ, DL; WICHE, GJ; GOLDSTEIN, RM			RED RIVER OF THE NORTH BASIN, MINNESOTA, NORTH-DAKOTA, AND SOUTH-DAKOTA	WATER RESOURCES BULLETIN												The environmental setting of the Red River of the North basin within the United States is diverse in ways that could significantly control the areal distribution and flow of water and, therefore, the distribution and concentration of constituents that affect water quality. Continental glaciers shaped a landscape of very flat lake plains near the center of the basin, and gently rolling uplands, lakes, and wetlands along the basin margins. The fertile, black, fine-grained soils and landscape are conducive to agriculture. Productive cropland covers 66 percent of the land area. The principal crops are wheat, barley, soybeans, sunflowers, corn, and hay. Pasture, forests, open water, and wetlands comprise most of the remaining land area. About one-third of the 1990 population (511,000) lives in the cities of Fargo and Grand Forks, North Dakota and Moorhead, Minnesota. The climate of the Red River of the North basin is continental and ranges from dry subhumid in the western part of the basin to subhumid in the eastern part. From its origin, the Red River of the North meanders northward for 394 miles to the Canadian border, a path that is nearly double the straight-line distance. The Red River of the North normally receives over 75 percent of its annual flow from the eastern tributaries as a result of regional patterns of precipitation, evapotranspiration, soils, and topography Most runoff occurs in spring and early summer as a result of rains falling on melting snow or heavy rains falling on saturated soils. Lakes, prairie potholes, and wetlands are abundant in most physiographic areas outside of the Red River Valley Lake Plain. Dams, drainage ditches, and wetlands alter the residence time of water, thereby affecting the amount of sediment, biota, and dissolved constituents carried by the water. Ground water available to wells, streams, and springs primarily comes from sand and gravel aquifers near land surface or buried within 100 to 300 feet of glacial drift that mantles the entire Red River of the North basin. Water moves through the system of bedrock and glacial-drift aquifers in a regional flow system generally toward the Red River of the North and in complex local flow systems controlled by local topography. Many of the bedrock and glacial-drift aquifers are hydraulically connected to streams in the region. The total water use in 1990, about 196 million gallons per day, was mostly for public supply and irrigation. Slightly more than one half of the water used comes from ground-water sources compared to surface-water sources. Most municipalities obtain their water from ground-water sources. However, the largest cities (Fargo, Grand Forks and Moorhead) obtain most of their water from the Red River of the North. The types and relative amounts of various habitats change among the five primary ecological regions within the Red River of the North basin. Headwater tributaries are more diverse and tend to be similar to middle-reach tributaries in character rather than the lower reaches of these tributaries for the Red River of the North. Concentrations of dissolved chemical constituents in surface waters are normally low during spring runoff and after thunderstorms. The Bed River of the North generally has a dissolved-solids concentration less than 600 milligrams per liter with mean values ranging from 347 milligrams per liter near the headwaters to 406 milligrams per liter at the Canadian border near Emerson, Manitoba. Calcium and magnesium are the principal cations and bicarbonate is the principal anion along most of the reach of the Red River of the North, Dissolved-solids concentrations generally are lower in the eastern tributaries than in the tributaries draining the western																			0043-1370					JUL-AUG	1993	29	4					575	615																WOS:A1993MG99700004
J	Rybakov, DS				Rybakov, Dmitriy S.			DYNAMICS OF SURFACE AIR TEMPERATURE, WIND REGIME AND POPULATION MORTALITY RATE ON THE EXAMPLE OF PETROZAVODSK	GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH												The influence of the long-term, seasonal and intra- seasonal dynamics of the average monthly values of surface air temperature and wind regime (repeatability of wind directions and calm) on the mortality rates of the population of Petrozavodsk (Republic of Karelia) was studied using a set of statistical methods, including regression, harmonic, first-order difference and correlation analyses. Nonstationary and stationary time series was determined and analyzed. A comparison of the two periods 2000-2009 and 2010-2019 showed a statistically insignificant (pt(exp) = 0.344) increase in the average long-term air temperature in the study area by 8.2% and a statistically significant (pt(exp) < 0.001) decrease in the recurrence of calm by 52.5 %, total mortality by 17% and mortality from diseases of the circulatory system by 21.3%. It is shown that a statistically justified indicators of favorable conditions affecting the level of total mortality in long-term dynamics are the frequencies of the east, north-east (both from the Onega Lake water area) and south (from the side of suburban forests) wind directions. The causes of these fluctuations may be multi-scale processes, including favorable ones both for improving meteorological conditions in general and for reducing urban air pollution. A negative impact on mortality rates is possible with an increase in the transfer of harmful substances from the main stationary sources of pollution to large residential areas by the wind of the north-west direction. At the same time, this circumstance requires confirmation, since the influence of another "third factor" is assumed, namely the circulation of the atmosphere, depending on the level of solar activity. When considering the seasonal dynamics for the period 2013-2017, characterized according to previously obtained data by minimal amounts of emissions of harmful substances from stationary sources, it was found that the influence of the temperature (seasonal) factor on overall mortality can be obscured by a statistically significant positive correlation of the latter one with the off-season parameter of windless weather (p = 0.007-0.032). Herewith a dependence the mortality on factors of temperature and calm (cold and windless weather) has been established for winter time, and this one turns out to be especially strong when excluded from calculations average monthly data characterizing the actual absence of calm (we getp = 0.007 for temperature andp = 0.020 for calm), whereas in autumn the dependence on temperature is not expressed (p = 0.347), and the influence of calm (p = 0.018) is supplemented by dependence on the north wind direction (p = 0.006). The studied intra-seasonal weather factors do not affect the overall mortality rate in the spring and summer periods during the five-year period. The results obtained are compared both with the results of the results of our own previous work and with the publications of other authors. The results of the research can be used in the planning of geoecological and medico-ecological studies of urbanized territories, as well as taken into account in urban planning activities.

J	Ziegelgruber, KL; Zeng, T; Arnold, WA; Chin, YP				Ziegelgruber, Kate L.; Zeng, Teng; Arnold, William A.; Chin, Yu-Ping			Sources and composition of sediment pore-water dissolved organic matter in prairie pothole lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Sediment pore-water dissolved organic matter (DOM) in two North Dakota prairie pothole lakes was quantified by dissolved organic carbon analysis (DOC) and its composition was characterized as a function of sediment depth for molecular weight distribution (MWD), molar absorptivity at 280 nm (epsilon 280), and fluorescence properties. Fluorescence excitation emission matrices were further analyzed by creating a Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) model specific to sedimentary pore-water DOM. The range of absolute pore-water DOC concentrations (similar to 26-183 mg C L-1) greatly exceeded abundances reported for other wetlands and generally increased with depth. Significant changes occurred in epsilon 280 and fluorescence seasonally. Prairie pothole pore-water DOM is primarily allochthonous in nature and three 'humic-like' components explained similar to 90% of total sample fluorescence, while a single 'non-humic' component was responsible for the remaining 10%. The contribution of the non-humic component, however, was more significant in the top 7 cm of sediment in samples collected in early autumn and is presumably derived from algal precursor material produced by primary production in the water column over the summer. The PARAFAC results corroborate epsilon 280 and MWD changes in pore-water DOM composition over the growing season. This dynamic process could affect the type of DOM available for biogeochemical processes seasonally.

Drivers of dominance shifts between invasive Ponto-Caspian dreissenids Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771) and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (Andrusov, 1897)	AQUATIC INVASIONS					20th International Conference on Aquatic Invasive Species (ICAIS)	OCT 22-26, 2017	Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Invas Species Ctr, Fort Lauderdale, FL		Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Invas Species Ctr			Two of the most invasive freshwater bivalve species in temperate regions worldwide are the Ponto-Caspian dreissenids Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis. Throughout their range, observations have been made of a dominance shift favouring D. r. bugensis where the two species co-occur. Although both dreissenids have been widely studied, the mechanisms driving this dominance shift are not completely understood. Our long-term and short-term field experiments assessed a selection of species traits related to growth and settlement, which may be linked to a competitive benefit for either of both species. We assessed relative population densities in time and space, mortality, and inter- and intraspecific interactions in relation to environmental factors like temperature, salinity, and light intensity, using 14 x 14 cm PVC settlement plates. Dreissenids were identified, counted and measured over 11 years in the waterbody where D. r. bugensis was first discovered in Western Europe. Dreissena polymorpha appeared to have a competitive benefit over D. r. bugensis by being able to settle earlier, i.e. in spring, while other studies indicate the opposite. As salinities in the study region were relatively high in spring, this discrepancy may be explained by a higher salinity tolerance of D. polymorpha, as is known from the literature. In addition, Common Coots predated D. r. bugensis clusters. Dreissena polymorpha were not usually found in such clusters. Regardless of these competitive benefits for D. polymorpha, D. r. bugensis is the dominant species in the region. One possible explanation could be the fact that D. r. bugensis was found in similar densities on both light exposed and shaded fouling plates. Dreissena polymorpha on the other hand, was practically absent on light-exposed plates after 12 months. Therefore, a wider range of habitats seems to be suitable for the settlement of D. r. bugensis. Another driver of the dominance shift can be linked to it having faster growth than D. polymorpha, especially during spring. More generally, D. r. bugensis occurred in higher population densities on plates with D. polymorpha than on plates with only D. r. bugensis. Dreissena polymorpha individuals may thus induce the settlement of additional individuals of D. r. bugensis. A final reason for the dominance of D. r. bugensis concerns its low winter mortality. While the number of D. polymorpha individuals more than halved over the winter 2016-2017, no significant decrease in numbers of D. r. bugensis was recorded.

J	Grimaldi, R				Grimaldi, Richard			Climate teleconnections related to El Nino winters in a lake-effect region of west-central New York	ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE LETTERS												A 64-year climatological record for the cold season in Syracuse, New York is analyzed for temperature and snowfall. Evidence suggests that El Nino winters are characterized by warmer temperatures and below normal snowfall during the first month of winter followed by colder temperatures and above normal snowfall for the second month of winter. Major snow events were more than five times more likely to occur for El Nino winters compared to climatology. It is suggested that the greater frequency of heavy snowfalls is related to both favorable dynamics and warmer lake/ocean temperatures which follow the mild early winter period.

J	Autio, J; Hicks, S				Autio, J; Hicks, S			Annual variations in pollen deposition and meteorological conditions on the fell Aakenustunturi in northern Finland: Potential for using fossil pollen as a climate proxy	GRANA												Annual variation in meteorological parameters (7 years) and pollen deposition (6 years) for 4 sites on a transect across an altitudinal timberline on Aakenus, a fell in northern Finland were monitored, in order to see how pollen production, as reflected by pollen deposition (grains cm(-2) year(-1)), is related to climate conditions. Wind direction and wind speed before and after estimated flowering time were determined. These indicated that within the forest and at the physiognomic forest line, pollen deposition is primarily from plants growing within the forested area on the fell and that the contribution of windblown pollen from further south is minimal. Pollen deposition can, therefore, be taken as equivalent to pollen production. Simple linear correlation coefficients between pollen deposition and one-month and two-week mean temperature effective temperature sums and cumulative effective temperature sums for the current and previous summers were calculated. For Pinus sylvestris the quantity of pollen deposited is affected by July mean temperature, July effective temperature sum and total effective temperature sum, for the year previous to pollen emission. Pollen deposition of Betula pubescens and Picea abies is also affected by thermal factors but of different time periods (Betula of early June and Picea of early July), but always of the year previous to flowering. However, the correlation is not as strong as for Pinus. The results suggest that annual fossil Pinus pollen quantities, if calculated from peat and/or lake sediments, are a potential climate proxy. They also demonstrate that it is possible to use temperature parameters of the current year to make forecasts of the intensity of flowering and pollen production in the following year.																			0017-3134						2004	43	1					31	47		10.1080/00173130310017409	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00173130310017409													WOS:000220490600004

The influence of conditions in Lake Superior and the Bois Brule River, Wisconsin on returns of migratory rainbow trout	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Rainbow trout were introduced to Lake Superior in the late 1800's and exhibit a potamodromous life his-tory and exhibit high variability in reproductive success. We examined reproductive variability in the Bois Brule River, WI (Lake Superior), through analyses of returns of wild first spawning (hereafter "maiden" returning) adults. We used classification and regression tree analyses to identify in-stream and in-lake (western Lake Superior) sources of variability and to identify the environment (stream or lake) that was most influential to the returns to each location. Among in-stream influences, high dis-charge rates in the spring period (March - May) during a pre-smolt's first stream year were the strongest source of variability and were negatively correlated with returns. High discharge during the fall period from September to November in the pre-smolt first stream year was also negatively correlated with num-bers of maiden returning steelhead from that year class. When variables associated with Lake Superior were considered, maiden returns were positively correlated with higher lake surface temperatures in Lake Superior. Returns were negatively correlated with the abundance of adult rainbow smelt and bloater suggesting a possible competitive interaction among those species. Finally, we also observed a condi-tional (minor) positive effect of age-0 smelt abundance indicating the importance of this prey for juve-niles in colder years in western Lake Superior. Taken together, our findings indicate that both stream and lake conditions in their first lake year are important sources of variability and point to spates in the spring and fall as initial controlling variables.(c) 2023 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Response of the invertebrate predator Bythotrephes to a climate-linked increase in the duration of a refuge from fish predation	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Climate warming can affect ecological food chains directly by increasing the rates of physiological processes and indirectly by changing habitat use and altering predator-prey interactions. In Lake Maggiore, Italy, a greater than 10-fold increase in the mean annual population density of Bythotrephes longimanus (Cladocera Onychopoda) was recorded between 1987 and 1993, when high values of the North Atlantic Oscillation winter index indicate warmer winter and spring temperatures across Europe. Bythotrephes remained abundant and further increased during the following 10 yr, as water temperature continued to increase. We analyzed changes in water temperature, timing of thermal stratification, and hypolimnion depth to test whether changes in the duration and thickness of a warm, low-light, deep-water refuge from fish predation can account for increases in the invertebrate predator's abundance and seasonal duration. Using a 21-yr data set, we found that the sharpest increase in Bythotrephes abundance coincided with a shift from late August to May in its first appearance in the water column. The appearance of the planktonic population was, in turn, linked with earlier thermal stratification and earlier establishment of the predation refuge. The duration and thickness of the refuge increased as a result of earlier warming and deeper mixing, factors affected by climate rather than decreased water clarity. Daphnia hyalina galeata, the dominant grazer and a prey of Bythotrephes, decreased sharply as Bythotrephes increased. This study provides an example of how climate warming can indirectly affect the population density and phenology of a key invertebrate predator and, hence, the functioning of the pelagic food web.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				NOV	2009	54	6	2				2506	2512		10.4319/lo.2009.54.6_part_2.2506	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2009.54.6_part_2.2506													WOS:000272785700018
J	Green, K				Green, K.			Interannual and seasonal changes in the ice cover of glacial lakes in the Snowy Mountains of Australia	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												Seasonal ice cover is uncommon on Australian lakes. In the Snowy Mountains, there are five natural, seasonally ice-covered lakes including Lake Cootapatamba, the highest lake in Australia. Blue Lake is the only one of the five lakes with sufficient volume to be relatively independent of short-term changes in ambient temperature, and therefore is the lake most likely to be of use in tracking long-term regional climate change. Ice forms on Blue Lake near the winter solstice and ice-breakup occurs from late September to November. Timing of breakup is related to spring temperature and, as such, mirrors the timing of general snow thaw in the mountains. The existence of historic photographs taken of the lake at about the time of ice breakup allows for the possibility of reconstructing a history of alpine climate and in 1905 ice breakup was probably as late as mid-December.																			1672-6316	1993-0321				OCT	2011	8	5					655	663		10.1007/s11629-011-2084-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-011-2084-9													WOS:000294964500003
J	ISTVANOVICS, V				ISTVANOVICS, V			SEASONAL-VARIATION OF PHOSPHORUS RELEASE FROM THE SEDIMENTS OF SHALLOW LAKE BALATON (HUNGARY)	WATER RESEARCH												Phosphorus release was low from intact sediment cores of the mesotrophic area of the lake throughout the year, and amounted to 0.3 mg P m-2 d-1 during autumn in short-term incubations. In the hypertrophic area maximum release (2.8 mg P m-2 d-1) was measured during summer. Phosphorus release showed a rapid increase from long-term incubated intact sediment cores with the increasing pH of the overlying water. At the ecologically real maximum pH the release may amount to 0.8 and 4.0 mg P m-2 day-1 in the mesotrophic and hypertrophic areas, respectively. A release of 2.0-3.9 mg P m-2 day-1 was estimated from sediment suspensions of the hypertrophic area within a pH range of 8-9. These values are similar to external phosphorus loadings of the respective areas. The most important phosphorus mobilizing factors are pH and the decomposition of the organic matter in the sediments. Redox conditions may play a significant indirect role in the regulation of the internal loading. A positive feedback is hypothesized between the internal phosphorus loading and primary production both processes being affected by the external loading in different ways.

The methods used to establish source-sink relationships of atmospheric water vapor are reviewed, and the advantages and caveats associated with each technique are discussed. The methods described include analytical and box models, numerical water vapor tracers, and physical water vapor tracers (isotopes). In particular, consideration is given to the wide range of recently developed Lagrangian techniques suitable both for evaluating the origin of water that falls during extreme precipitation events and for establishing climatologies of moisture source-sink relationships. As far as oceanic sources are concerned, the important role of the subtropical northern Atlantic Ocean provides moisture for precipitation to the largest continental area, extending from Mexico to parts of Eurasia, and even to the South American continent during the Northern Hemisphere winter. In contrast, the influence of the southern Indian Ocean and North Pacific Ocean sources extends only over smaller continental areas. The South Pacific and the Indian Ocean represent the principal source of moisture for both Australia and Indonesia. Some landmasses only receive moisture from the evaporation that occurs in the same hemisphere (e. g., northern Europe and eastern North America), while others receive moisture from both hemispheres with large seasonal variations (e. g., northern South America). The monsoonal regimes in India, tropical Africa, and North America are provided with moisture from a large number of regions, highlighting the complexities of the global patterns of precipitation. Some very important contributions are also seen from relatively small areas of ocean, such as the Mediterranean Basin (important for Europe and North Africa) and the Red Sea, which provides water for a large area between the Gulf of Guinea and Indochina (summer) and between the African Great Lakes and Asia (winter). The geographical regions of Eurasia, North and South America, and Africa, and also the internationally important basins of the Mississippi, Amazon, Congo, and Yangtze Rivers, are also considered, as is the importance of terrestrial sources in monsoonal regimes. The role of atmospheric rivers, and particularly their relationship with extreme events, is discussed. Droughts can be caused by the reduced supply of water vapor from oceanic moisture source regions. Some of the implications of climate change for the hydrological cycle are also reviewed, including changes in water vapor concentrations, precipitation, soil moisture, and aridity. It is important to achieve a combined diagnosis of moisture sources using all available information, including stable water isotope measurements. A summary is given of the major research questions that remain unanswered, including (1) the lack of a full understanding of how moisture sources influence precipitation isotopes; (2) the stationarity of moisture sources over long periods; (3) the way in which possible changes in intensity (where evaporation exceeds precipitation to a greater of lesser degree), and the locations of the sources, (could) affect the distribution of continental precipitation in a changing climate; and (4) the role played by the main modes of climate variability, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation or the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, in the variability of the moisture source regions, as well as a full evaluation of the moisture transported by low-level jets and atmospheric rivers.					; Yoshimura, Kei/F-2041-2010; Stohl, Andreas/A-7535-2008; Yu, Lisan/AIB-2264-2022; Durán-Quesada, Ana/ABG-4788-2020; Trigo, Ricardo/B-7044-2008; Nieto, Raquel/AAT-8925-2020; Dominguez, Francina/AAH-6741-2020; Gimeno, Luis/B-8137-2008; Drumond, Anita/G-5767-2013	Duran-Quesada, Ana Maria/0000-0003-0913-0154; Yoshimura, Kei/0000-0002-5761-1561; GIMENO, LUIS/0000-0002-0778-3605; Stohl, Andreas/0000-0002-2524-5755; Trigo, Ricardo/0000-0002-4183-9852; Yu, Lisan/0000-0003-4157-9154; Drumond, Anita/0000-0002-0432-8842; Dominguez, Francina/0000-0003-2674-3382; Nieto, Raquel/0000-0002-8984-0959													8755-1209	1944-9208				NOV 8	2012	50								RG4003	10.1029/2012RG000389	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2012RG000389													WOS:000310960600001

Thermal regime and salinity are factors that affect the quality of water reservoirs. These two parameters were studied in Mamloo Dam in Tehran province. This dam has recently started to be uses as a source of drinking water for Tehran and thus its water quality is of increased importance. In this regard, the hydrodynamic model for 2014 to 2015 was built and calibrated by the CE-QUAL-W2 model and the model was used to simulate the thermal regime and salinity up to 2020. Two main scenarios were studied in this period, the continuation of the current situation or a 2.5% increase in water requirements and 5% decrease in discharge. The results show that the reservoir will experience thermal stratification in the summer and vertical mixing in the winter. Dased on these results Mamloo reservoir is in branch of warm Monomictic lake. Also results showed that thermal stratification and ssalinity stratification dominates simultaneity. Besides this issue with 2.5% increase in water requirements and 5% decrease in discharge, duration of summer thermal stratification will decrease although intensity of thermal stratification will increase.

J	Feng, L; Hu, CM; Chen, XL; Cai, XB; Tian, LQ; Gan, WX				Feng, Lian; Hu, Chuanmin; Chen, Xiaoling; Cai, Xiaobin; Tian, Liqiao; Gan, Wenxia			Assessment of inundation changes of Poyang Lake using MODIS observations between 2000 and 2010	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												China's largest freshwater lake, Poyang Lake, is well known for its ecological and economic importance as well as its rapid changes in lake inundation areas. However, due to technical difficulties, to date long-term records of its dynamic inundation areas are lacking, not to mention how they are affected by climate change and/or human activities. Using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) medium-resolution (250-m) data collected between 2000 and 2010 and an objective water/land delineation method, we documented and studied the short- and long-term characteristics of lake inundation. Significant seasonality and inter-annual variability were found in the monthly and annual mean inundation areas. The inundation area ranged between 714.1 km(2) in October 2009 and 3162.9 km(2) in August 2010, and the inundation area during any particular year could change by a factor of 2.3-3.2. During the 11-year period, the maximum possible inundation area was 14 times the minimum possible inundation area, indicating extreme variability. Both the annual mean and minimum inundation areas showed statistically significant declining trends from 2000 to 2010 (-30.2 km(2) yr(-1) and-23.9 km(2) yr(-1), p<0.05). The changes of the inundation area were primarily driven by local precipitation during non-summer months, while during summer months of July to September when the outflow into the Yangtze River was impeded the effect of precipitation became less significant. These results provide long-term baseline data to monitor future changes in Poyang Lake's inundation area in a timely fashion, for example quantifying the extreme drought conditions during spring 2011.

The present study determined the key parameters of water level fluctuations (WLFs) influencing the distribution of a typical wetland plant, Carex, in shallow lakes along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The plant community and environmental variables in 13 shallow lakes with different WLFs were investigated during 2011-2015. A total of 14 parameters included in three components of WLFs were identified, and their effects on the distribution of Carex were analyzed. The results showed that distribution of Carex in the studied lakes differed obviously in time and space. WLFs were the critical factors influencing the taxa distribution, whereas soil organic matter, human disturbance, substrate type, and soil moisture were of little importance. Rate of water level change and elevation above water were the main parameters determining the coverage and biomass of Carex during the spring growing season. In the autumn growing season, rate of water level change, elevation above water, and emergence timing were important. These results provide important insights into the conservation and restoration of Carex and other hygrophytes in shallow lakes in this region.

J	LaPerriere, JD				LaPerriere, JD			Limnology of two lake systems of Katmai National Park and Preserve, Alaska: physical and chemical profiles, major ions, and trace elements	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Six large lakes in the Naknek River drainage and four in the Alagnak River drainage were sampled once a summer for three summers, 1990-1992, in a baseline water quality study of Katmai National Park and Preserve. These pristine lakes are discontinuous cold polymictic, mixing to great depths occasionally through the ice-free season due to frequent winds of coastal storms. Cation proportions were similar among lakes with sodium somewhat overrepresented, most likely due to the location at the base of the Alaska Peninsula in proximity to the influences of the Pacific Ocean. Anion proportions varied. Six Naknek lakes and one Alagnak lake were typical calcium carbonate lakes. Chloride and sulfate were proportionally high in the others, resulting in the extreme in a 'triple water' lake (Kulik Lake) and a calcium sulfate lake (Battle Lake). The high chloride proportions were, like sodium, probably due to the influences of ocean spray on precipitation. The high sulfate of Naknek Lake was probably due to volcanic influence, and there was some evidence of local geothermal imputs to Kulik Lake. Iron Springs Lake and Creek, which form one of Battle Lake's inlets, are known to be strongly influenced by sulfur minerals. The very low alkalinity of Battle Lake was associated with elevated concentrations of aluminum. These aluminum concentrations exceeded the freshwater chronic criterion for the protection of aquatic life.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 26	1997	354						89	99		10.1023/A:1003067525783	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003067525783													WOS:000071762900009

Life form-specific gradients in compound-specific hydrogen isotope ratios of modern leaf waxes along a North American Monsoonal transect	OECOLOGIA												The use of hydrogen isotope ratios (delta H-2) of sedimentary n-alkanes from leaf waxes has become an important tool for reconstructing paleoenvironmental and ancient hydrologic conditions. Studies of modern plant waxes can elucidate driving ecological mechanisms behind geologic deposits. Here, we used a transect across the North American Monsoon region of the western USA from Tucson, Arizona to Salt Lake City, Utah to study variations in leaf wax delta H-2 among co-occurring plants. Three co-occurring life forms were selected: perennial shrub (rabbit brush, Chrysothamnus nauseosus; sagebrush, Artemisia tridentata); tree (Gambel's oak tree, Quercus gambelii); and annual (sunflower, Helianthus annuus). Our results showed that the distributions and abundances of n-alkanes in perennial plants were similar across all sites and generally did not vary with environmental conditions (e.g., precipitation and temperature). In contrast, variations in n-alkane delta H-2 were significantly correlated with the fraction of the annual precipitation coming during the summer monsoon period. We use a modified Craig-Gordon model to speculate on the possible drivers of the delta H-2 values of leaf wax n-alkanes of plants across the region. The model results suggest that the most likely explanation for variation in wax delta H-2 values was a combination of seasonal source water usage and subsequent environmental conditions.

Seasonal movements of Chinook salmon in Lake Michigan based on tag recoveries from recreational fisheries and catch rates in gill-net assessments	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												There are no specific studies of the movements of introduced Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in Lake Michigan, despite the need for such information for population assessments and stocking allocations. We investigated the seasonal distribution of hatchery-reared Chinook salmon between May and September based on fishery-dependent (recoveries from recreational fisheries of fish marked with coded wire tags [CWTs]) and fishery-independent sources (catches in assessment gill-net surveys). We modeled recoveries by fishing trips in Michigan waters of Lake Michigan to estimate spatially and temporally explicit abundance indices using generalized linear models (GLMs) and accounted for the efficiency among recovery sources (charter boat captain reports, creel clerk interviews, and headhunter collections of CWT samples from charter boat and non-charter boat catches). Recovery levels varied among areas, months, years, and recovery sources, and distribution among areas also varied by month. We used CWT data with lakewide geographical coverage and evaluated the distributions of the absolute numbers of coded-wire-tagged fish recovered in Michigan and Wisconsin waters of Lake Michigan from all possible recovery sources. From both analyses we found that the distribution of Chinook salmon varied seasonally, with displacements from southern areas toward the north from May through summer, from inshore to offshore areas toward the west during summer, and movement back east in the fall. For the analysis of Chinook salmon catch rates in gill-net assessments, we used GLMs to compare levels among months, statistical districts, years, nearshore and offshore areas, and different depths. The temporal and spatial trends were similar to those from the CWT analyses, and the distribution shifted toward deeper waters in July and August. Movement patterns coincided with favorable temperature and prey distribution and were consistent with those exhibited by the Pacific Ocean Chinook salmon population from which the Lake Michigan population originated. Seasonal changes in Chinook salmon distribution influence recreational fisheries, and stocking strategies should consider the influences of movement patterns on fishing opportunities in Lake Michigan.

No seasonal pattern in mean caloric density of ages 1 and 2 walleye, chinook salmon, and rainbow trout was observed, but caloric content differed among months. Seasonal differences in caloric density were also observed for rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax, yellow perch Perca flavescens, spottail shiners Notropis hudsonius, and lake herring Coregonus artedi.

The region around Lake Baikal possesses unique landscapes and cultural unity, making it a hot spot for winter tourism in Russia. The ski resorts around Lake Baikal are among the most attractive tourist destinations during the winter season, attracting a large number of domestic and international tourists. Based on the experience of the Northeast Asia Sustainable Development Research Centre, this study includes a survey of experts from China and Russia. The study focuses on five major ski resorts near Lake Baikal. A comprehensive competitiveness assessment index system and a quantitative evaluation model for winter tourism resorts have been established, which enable a scientific evaluation of the level of comprehensive competitiveness of winter tourism regions near Lake Baikal. The study showed that the Sobolinaya ski resort has excellent competitiveness among the resorts studied, while Bychya and Istland have average competitiveness and Davan and Mamai have low competitiveness. Local natural resources and the level of infrastructure development make the most significant contributions to the overall competitiveness of a resort. The study proposes development measures, such as the creation of a winter tourism complex with the Sobolinaya resort as its core and the establishment of an international special zone for winter tourism along the China-Mongolia-Russia economic corridor. The research results can serve as a basis for decision making to improve the overall competitiveness of the winter tourism industry around Lake Baikal and provide scientific and technical support for cross-border international cooperation in the winter tourism industry between China and Russia.

J	Laybourn-Parry, J				Laybourn-Parry, J			Survival mechanisms in Antarctic lakes	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES					Discussion Meeting on Coping with the Cold	SEP 26-27, 2001	ROYAL SOC, LONDON, ENGLAND		ROYAL SOC			In Antarctic lakes, organisms are confronted by continuous low temperatures as well as a poor light climate and nutrient limitation. Such extreme environments support truncated food webs with no fish, few metazoans and a dominance of microbial plankton. The key to success lies in entering the short Antarctic summer with actively growing populations. In many cases, the most successful organisms continue to function throughout the year. The few crustacean zooplankton remain active in the winter months, surviving on endogenous energy reserves and, in some cases, continuing development. Among the Protozoa, mixotrophy is an important nutritional strategy. In the extreme lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, planktonic cryptophytes are forced to sustain a mixotrophic strategy and cannot survive by photosynthesis alone. The dependence on ingesting bacteria varies seasonally and with depth in the water column. In the Vestfold Hills, Pyramimonas, which dominates the plankton of some of the saline lakes, also resorts to mixotrophy, but does become entirely photosynthetic at mid-summer. Mixotrophic ciliates are also common and the entirely photosynthetic ciliate Mesodinium rubrum has a widespread distribution in the saline lakes of the Vestfold Hills, where it attains high concentrations. Bacteria continue to grow all year, showing cycles that appear to be related to the availability of dissolved organic carbon. In saline lakes, bacteria experience sub-zero temperatures for long periods of the year and have developed biochemical adaptations that include anti-freeze proteins, changes in the concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids in their membranes and suites of low-temperature enzymes.																			0962-8436	1471-2970				JUL 29	2002	357	1423					863	869		10.1098/rstb.2002.1075	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2002.1075								12171649					WOS:000177132200006

We studied the Northern European (Lake Ladoga region, NW Russia) population considered to be irruptive, and the Northeastern Asian (Primorye, Russian Far East) population which is believed to migrate regularly. We analyzed year-to-year fluctuation in numbers, timing of movements, body mass, fat reserves and plumage condition in migrating birds. We found that the two studied populations shared similar characteristics of autumn migration. Apart from significant fluctuations in numbers recorded in Northern Europe and Northeastern Asia, other features were similar to what have been observed for regular migrant species. Autumn movements of Long-tailed Tits in NW Russia and in the Russian Far East were registered every year and occurred in the dates specific to each population; the median date in different years spanned a two week period. In both populations, individuals that migrated later in the season gained larger fat reserves. Birds were involved in autumn movements either at the final stage of moult or just after the end of feather replacement. Our results indicate that Northern European and Northeastern Asian populations of Aegithalos c. caudatus show similar patterns of migratory behaviour.

Juvenile population dynamics of Oreochromis mossambicus in an intermittently open estuary at the limit of its natural distribution	AFRICAN ZOOLOGY												Juvenile Oreochromis mossambicus in the 25 ha, temperate, intermittently open, East Kleinemonde Estuary in the Eastern Cape, South Africa (33 degrees 32'S, 27 degrees 03'E), showed a seasonal shift in distribution, occupying all areas of the estuary in summer and, subsequently, being limited to the upper reaches in winter. The young of the year in the littoral zone were rapidly depleted and resultant estimates of the instantaneous rate of total mortality (Z) ranged from 5.4/yr to 6.9/yr. High annual rates of juvenile mortality and small adult populations imply that stock recovery after a reduction in adult population numbers, through activities such as fishing, may be slow.

J	Blake, WH; Plater, AJ; Boyle, JF				Blake, WH; Plater, AJ; Boyle, JF			Seasonal trends in the uranium-series isotopic signatures of lake waters and sediments: Hawes Water, northwest England	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Potential seasonal variation in the U-series radioisotopic signatures of lake and input waters was investigated in Hawes Water, north-west England, and the sedimentary record was examined to establish whether any observed seasonality is presented in the sediment U and Th radioisotopic activity ratios. U-series disequilibrium in the waters is indicative of both surface and shallow sub-surface origins for the dissolved U, and that this supply is influenced by changes in the prevailing hydrological regime. However, the lake is buffered from this seasonality in that the U-234/U-238 activity ratio remains constant during the year, and the U content undergoes only a marginal decrease during summer. The change in the mechanism of lake sedimentation from allochthonous organic input during winter to autochthonous carbonate formation during summer has a more significant influence on the U-series radioisotopic characteristics of sedimentary record in that the proportion of organic and carbonate material both exhibit a strong control on the U-234/U-238 activity ratio and U content. In addition, significant proportions of 'sediment' U and Th are associated with ferromanganese oxyhydroxides. Given this seasonality, it is of some significance that the U-234/U-238 activity ratios of the bottom sediments preserve a reasonable record of lake U-series disequilibrium and are, therefore, potential indicators of long-term changes in catchment hydrology.

J	Jackson, JR; Noble, RL				Jackson, JR; Noble, RL			Relationships between annual variations in reservoir conditions and age-0 largemouth bass year-class strength	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Variable recruitment has been documented in populations of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides throughout the species' range. Shoreline electrofishing was used from 1988 to 1998 to assess the magnitude of variations in year-class strength of largemouth bass at the time cohort mean lengths reached 50 mm in Jordan Lake, North Carolina. Concurrent measures of adult stock characteristics, dynamics of larval and juvenile shad Dorosoma spp., lake elevation dynamics, and seasonal air temperatures were used to test published findings concerning factors that influence largemouth bass year-class strength. Catch rates of juvenile largemouth bass varied fourfold from 1988 to 1995. No significant relationships were observed between largemouth bass year-class size and spawning stock size, shad dynamics, or variations in lake elevations. However, late-winter and early spring air temperatures explained a significant amount of the observed variation in catch rates of age-0 largemouth bass. Abundance of yearling largemouth bass in early spring also varied significantly among years and was significantly correlated with differences in age-0 abundance at 50 mm the previous year, suggesting that differences in abundance established early in the life history of largemouth bass play a significant role in recruitment variation. Although relative year-class strength varied predictably with prespawn air temperatures, long-term trends indicated a decline in relative year-class strength over the course of 11 years. Broadscale factors, such as temperature, may introduce variation about the expected mean year-class size of largemouth bass in Jordan Lake, which can be further modified by variations in local conditions.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	2000	129	3					699	715		10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<0699:RBAVIR>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<0699:RBAVIR>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000089076500006

Bacterial and heterotrophic protistan (flagellate and ciliate) abundance was determined by fluorescence direct counts, protistan grazing on planktonic bacteria was measured from fluorescently labeled bacteria uptake rates, and the estimate of bacterial heterotrophic activity was obtained from leucine and thymidine incorporation rates. The abundance of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF) was low, ranging from 8.4 to 27.1 cells ml(-1), while ciliate numbers dominated, ranging from 55 to 180 cells ml(-1). The population of ciliated protozoans was dominated by scuticociliates (Uronema sp., Cyclidium spp., and 1 unidentified scuticociliate) and oligotrichs (Strobilidium spp. (diameter > 50 mu m), Strobilidium spp. (diameter < 50 mu m), and Strombidium sp.). Ciliates were predominant grazers of bacteria, showing higher clearance rates (14 to 65 nl ciliate(-1) h(-1)) than HNF (1 to 11 nl HNF-1 h(-1)); the total grazing rate of ciliates (on average 2398 bacteria h(-1) ml(-1)) was 28 times higher than total grazing of HNF (87 bacteria h(-1) ml(-1)). In general terms protozoan grazing balanced with bacterial production but was not sufficient to support ciliate growth: on the basis of conversion factors the calculated generation time of bacterivorous ciliates was long, on average 121 d (ranging from 43 to 198 d).

Our understanding of the spatial and seasonal pattern of DOM hydrophobicity in aquatic systems and the major controlling factors is still limited. In this study, the hydrophobicity of 124 DOM samples collected from northern Lake Taihu, a typical eutrophic lake, was quantified using the partition coefficient of DOM in the aqueous two-phase system (K-ATPS). The results revealed high-resolution spatial patterns and seasonal variations of DOM hydrophobicity in Lake Taihu. The riverine input, algae activity, and photodegradation were identified as important processes shaping the spatial and seasonal pattern of DOM hydrophobicity. The riverine input and algae activity strongly affected DOM hydrophobicity in the west part and the central area of the lake. Photodegradation process played a significant role in DOM hydrophobicity in the east part of the lake in summer. The high-resolution spatial and seasonal pattern of the hydrophobic organic pollutant partition affinity of DOM (K-OC) was assessed based on the two-phase system model and the K-ATPS dataset. The K-OC values vary significantly in Lake Taihu between spring and summer, especially in the Zhushan Bay and east coast areas, highlighting the need for considering DOM dynamics in sorption assessment. Our results detailly profiled the spatial and seasonal patterns of DOM hydrophobicity and sorption behavior and elucidated the major controlling factors, which is crucial for environmental risk assessment.

J	RAVELING, DG				RAVELING, DG			STATUS OF GIANT CANADA GEESE NESTING IN SOUTHEAST MANITOBA	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Surveys and banding between 1967-1970 delineated most of the nesting range of the giant Canada goose (Branta canadensis maxima) in Manitoba [Canada], which is occupied by 3 population segments with different migration routes. Canada geese nesting S, and perhaps E, of Lake Winnipeg occupy a small range of marginal habitat and number about 3000-4000. About 1/3 of this total congregates at the Alf Hole Sanctuary in autumn. The population during the study was relatively stable with indications of limitation because of delayed breeding and not because of mortality. Recaptures (88) demonstrated a high fidelity of adults to their breeding area and a delayed entry of birds of potential nesting age into the banding site nesting population. Lowered body weights were associated with poor reproductive success in 1 yr. Distribution of band recoveries revealed a strong association with the Rock Prairie of SE Wisconsin [USA], and some geese were recovered in S Illinois and vicinity. SE Manitoba and SE Wisconsin together accounted for 69 and 82% of 58 direct and 85 indirect band recoveries, respectively, the majority being taken in Wisconsin. Yearling geese were recovered in a wider distribution than adults or immatures. A higher proportion of geese banded in autumn was directly recovered outside the main Manitoba-Wisconsin recovery area as compared to geese banded as flightless birds in July, indicating that a segment of the population has a migration path bypassing the main Wisconsin wintering area. Immatures were 1.56 times more likely to be shot than adults, but vulnerability did not vary by geographic area.																			0022-541X	1937-2817					1976	40	2					214	226		10.2307/3800418	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3800418													WOS:A1976BV46700002

The annual dynamics of methane (CH4) in a temporarily flooded meadow, mire bank, lacustrine sedge fen, temporarily and continuously inundated sedge (Carex sp.) and reed (Phragmites australis) marshes were studied from June to November in the humic mesoeutrophic Lake Mekrijarvi and in eutrophicated parts of the mesotrophic Lake Heposelka in the southern part of East Finland. The effects of water level and temperature on littoral CH4 fluxes were determined. Vegetation zonation along the moisture gradient, and associated CH4 fluxes, were evaluated. 2. The CH4 flux increased along the moisture gradient from -0.2 to 14.2 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1), and was highest in the permanently inundated marshes. The duration of anoxia in the sediment caused differences in the CH4 flux. Estimated emissions for the period 1 June 30 September in continuously inundated sparse reed and sedge marshes, drying sedge marsh, and lacustrine sedge fen were 13, 11 and 6 g CH4 m(-2), respectively. 3. In continuously inundated vegetation, the fluxes were highest in late July/early August. The seasonal CH4 flux pattern suggested that the fluxes were regulated by the supply of organic matter during the course of the summer and the water level. In the temporarily flooded zone, the seasonal CH4 flux dynamics was greatly affected by changes in the lake water level, the fluxes being highest during the spring flood in early June.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2001	46	7					855	869																WOS:000170293900001

Eutrophication evolution would influence nutrient status of waters and investigating the DOM variation helps a better understanding of bioremediation on environmental behavior of DOM in eutrophic lakes. In our study, the contents, compositions and characteristics of systematic DOM&SOM (sediment organic matter) were greatly influenced by seasonal changes. But the effective bioremediations obviously reduced the DOM concentration and thus mitigated the eutrophication outbreak risks in water bodies due to the increased MBC (microbial biomass carbon), microbial activity and metabolism. In early summer, the overall DOM in each treatment were readily low levels and derived from both autochthonous and exogenous origins, dominated by fulvic acid-like. In midsummer, the DOM contents and characteristics in each treatment increased significantly as phytoplankton activity improved, and the majority of DOM were humic acid-like and mainly of biological origin. The greatest differences of enzymes, MBC, microbial metabolism and DOM&SOM removal among different treatments were observed in summer months. In autumn, the systematic DOM&SOM slightly reduced due to the deceased microbial activity, in which the microbial humic acids were main component and derived from endogenous sources. Additionally, the gradually decreased SOM with cultivated time in each treatment was a result of microbiological conversion of SOM into DOM. For various treatments, BE, BE.A, BE.C and BE.E increased the MBC, enzymatic and microbial activities due to the application of biochar-supported EMs. Among these, BE and BE.A, especially BE.A with oxygen supplement, achieved the most desirable effect on reducing systematic DOM&SOM levels and increasing enzymatic and microbial activities. The group of EM also reduced the levels of DOM&SOM as improved degradation of EMs for DOM. However, BC, BE.C and BE.E finally did not achieved the desirable effect on reducing DOM&SOM due to the suppression of microbial activities, respectively, from high dose of biochar, weakening of dominant species and additional introduction of EMs in low liveness.					; Zhao, Jun/AAA-3317-2022; Song, Biao/HCH-2214-2022	zhao, jun/0009-0006-5303-9701; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAY 1	2024	923								171476	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171476	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171476		MAR 2024						38458471					WOS:001226312300001
J	Sahuquillo, M; Miracle, MR; Morata, SM; Vicente, E				Sahuquillo, Maria; Rosa Miracle, Maria; Maria Morata, Sara; Vicente, Eduardo			Nutrient dynamics in water and sediment of Mediterranean ponds across a wide hydroperiod gradient	LIMNOLOGICA												In Mediterranean ponds, summer drought enhances seasonality whose intensity varies along topographic and climatic gradients. The alternation of wet and dry periods in rain dependent ponds affects their biogeochemistry and differentiates them from ponds fed by more stable water sources, such as groundwater springs. Superimposed onto this, land use is also a very strong factor of variability. In this study we compared nutrients and organic matter concentrations, in water and in sediment, among different types of Mediterranean ponds based on the source of water, hydroperiod and land use. Forty-three ponds were sampled in Eastern Spain corresponding to five pond types: (1) permanent spring ponds in lowlands, (2) permanent spring ponds in mountains, (3) semi-permanent rain ponds, (4) temporary rain ponds with long hydroperiod and (5) temporary rain ponds with short hydroperiod. The results of this study indicate relevant differences among these pond types. The temporary rain ponds with short hydroperiod are characterized by high turbidity due to suspension of sediment particles rich in phosphorous adsorbed onto them (argillotrophic aquatic systems). They are used for watering domestic sheep that enhance sediment suspension by trampling. Total phosphorous (TP) concentrations in the water are high (like those of hypertrophic lakes), but planktonic chlorophyll a is very low and not correlated with TP, because of the low P-bioavailavility in the water. At the other extreme, we have permanent ponds in lowlands fed by groundwater springs. They are heavily loaded with nitrates due to the surrounding intensive agriculture. In these and other permanent/semipermanent ponds chlorophyll is highly correlated with TP. Sediment characteristics provide a good indication of the hydroperiod, since desiccation has important effects on biogeochemical transformations. A threshold of 5% organic matter (OM) in the sediment separates temporary ponds-with a short hydroperiod from those with a long hydroperiod, and a threshold of 8% separates the later from the semi-permanent and permanent ponds. Besides OM reduction, important loss of N occurs during desiccation through mineralization, ammonia volatization and the sequential nitrification/denitrification pathway. On the other hand, the increase of organic P mineralization in dry sediments does not represent a loss of P from the system, since o-P remains adsorbed or bound onto the soil. This leads to a low TN/TP ratio in sediments in temporary ponds with short hydroperiod. These characteristics have to be taken into account when establishing pond typologies and ecological thresholds to assess water quality in these unique aquatic habitats. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

Cold terrestrial sulfur springs are less studied compared to sulfur-oxidizing microbiota of hydrothermal vents, volcanic environments, or soda lakes. Despite that, several studies suggested that sulfur springs harbor diverse microbial communities because of the unique geochemical conditions of upwelling waters. In this study, the microbiota of five terrestrial sulfur springs was examined using a 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. The clear dominance of the Proteobacteria and Campylobacterota phyla of cold sulfur springs microbiota was observed. Contrary to that, the microbiota of the hot sulfur spring was dominated by the Aquificota and Firmicutes phylum respectively. Sulfur-oxidizing genera constituted a dominant part of the microbial populations with the Thiothrix and Sulfurovum genera identified as the core microbiota of cold sulfur terrestrial springs in Slovakia. Additionally, the study emphasizes that sulfur springs in Slovakia support unique, poorly characterized bacterial communities of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria.					; Mekadim, Chahrazed/B-3420-2019; Mrazek, Jakub/B-7764-2017; Pristas, Peter/K-7512-2016; MEKADIM, Chahrazed/B-3420-2019	Nosalova, Lea/0000-0001-6498-0640; MEKADIM, Chahrazed/0000-0002-5793-3501														2524-6372				SEP 20	2023	18	1							72	10.1186/s40793-023-00527-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40793-023-00527-4								37730677					WOS:001072349600001

Survival and Growth of Three Geographically Distinct Stocks of Muskellunge Introduced into Midwestern Reservoirs	MUSKELLUNGE MANAGEMENT: FIFTY YEARS OF COOPERATION AMONG ANGLERS, SCIENTISTS, AND FISHERIES BIOLOGISTS	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Hugh C Becker Memorial Muskie Symposium: 50 Years of Cooperation - Anglers, Science and Management	MAR 13-15, 2016	Minnetonka, MN	Hugh C Becker Fdn, Muskies Inc, Amer Fisheries Soc, N Central Div, Esocid Tech Comm				Muskellunge Esox marquinongy management programs often rely on stocking to create and maintain populations. In many instances, a native and nearby stocking source is unavailable or a genetically suitable brood source is unclear. Genetic differences among stocks of Muskellunge may influence survival and growth when introduced into novel environments. Consequently, the selection of a suitable brood source can be difficult and possibly critical to the success of Muskellunge stocking programs. We examined differences in long-term survival and growth among introduced Muskellunge stocks from the Ohio and upper Mississippi River drainages and a mixed-origin Illinois broodstock population in three Illinois reservoirs. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) from spring modified-fyke netting suggested that the upper Mississippi River drainage stock at ages 3 and 4 persisted at lower relative abundance compared to conspecifics; however; low lake- and stock-specific catches of older ages precluded robust CPUE comparisons among stocks. Apparent survival, estimated from mark recapture data with the Cormack-Jolly Seber open population model, differed among stocks 1-year poststocking, with the upper Mississippi River drainage stock exhibiting markedly lower survival compared to conspecifics. Annual variation in survival to-age 1.5 was related to water temperature at stocking, fish size at stocking, first winter temperatures, and first summer temperatures. However, survival did not differ among stocks for Muskellunge age 2 and older, indicating that important factors structuring long-term survival exert their effects most strongly in the first year poststocking. Despite overall low survival of Muskellunge from the upper Mississippi River drainage, males that survived exhibited a slight growth advantage compared to conspecifics. No growth advantage was observed for upper Mississippi River drainage stock females. Our findings suggest that stock selection in addition to environmental conditions can influence survival of introduced Muskellunge and subsequent contribution to the fishery.																			0892-2284		978-1-934874-46-2				2017	85						437	465																WOS:000422891800037

Despite high uncertainties due to the limited data, the results provide important first estimates for better understanding the modern and past sedimentation processes in this basin. Formed ca. 3.6 million years ago as a result of a meteorite impact, the basin contains one of the longest paleoclimate records in the terrestrial Arctic. Fluvial activity is concentrated over the short snowmelt period (about 20 days in second part of June). Underground outflow plays a very important role in the water balance and predominates over surface outflow. The residence time of the lake water is estimated to be about 100 yr.

Climatic effects on ice-jam flooding of the Peace-Athabasca Delta	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												The Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) in northern Alberta is one of the world's largest inland freshwater deltas, home to large populations of waterfowl, muskrat, beaver, and free-ranging wood bison. In recent decades, a paucity of ice-jam flooding in the lower Peace River has resulted in prolonged dry periods and considerable reduction in the area covered by lakes and ponds that provide habitat for aquatic life in the PAD region. Building on previous work that has identified the salient hydro-climatic factors, the frequency of ice-jam floods is considered under 'present' (1961-1990) and 'future' (2070-2099) climatic conditions. The latter are determined using temperature and precipitation output from the Canadian Climate Centre's second-generation Global Climate Model (CGCM2) for two different greenhouse-gas/sulphate emission scenarios. The analysis indicates that the ice season is likely to be reduced by 2-4 weeks, while future ice covers would be slightly thinner than they are at present. More importantly, a large part of the Peace River basin is expected to experience frequent and sustained mid-winter thaws, leading to significant melt and depleted snowpacks in the spring. Using an empirical relationship between ice-jam flood occurrence and size of the spring snowpack, a severe reduction in the frequency of ice-jam flooding is predicted under both future-climate scenarios that were considered. In turn, this trend is likely to accelerate the loss of aquatic habitat in the PAD region. Implications for potential mitigation and adaptation strategies are discussed.

The data are from 17 sites and include for the water fraction of a melted ice sample pH (4.0-7.5), electric conductivity and soluble matter (5-20 mg/l), and for the suspended matter within the ice include the total mass (1-5 mg/l), organic proportion and concentrations of some chemical elements. The snow cover showed lower pH and amount of soluble matter. A potential ecological risk exists in spring as the ice and snow meltwater, with possibly a very low pH and enriched in pollutants, is mixed with the surface water layer.																									1998							897	905																WOS:000078339600090

Sex-specific variation in denning by brown bears	MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY												Denning characteristics of brown bears (Ursus arctos) have been described in numerous studies; however, population specific factors (i.e., landscape characteristics and climate) can greatly influence the location and timing of denning. Our objective was to evaluate den-site characteristics and denning chronology for male and female brown bears in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska. We used maximum entropy modeling to characterize attributes of den sites and generalized linear mixed models to compare denning chronology between males and females. We located 70 den sites (19 male and 51 female) and documented den entrance (n= 61 [15 male and 46 female]) and emergence (n= 60 [13 male and 47 female]) dates for bears from fall 2014 to spring 2017. The best performing model for estimating probable male den-site use (AUC = 0.862) was most influenced by slope (79.5%). The most parsimonious female model (AUC = 0.910) included elevation (49.3%), slope (43.1%), and aspect (7.6%). Female brown bears on average denned at higher elevations (868, SE = 190 m) than males (762, SE = 195 m) (F-1,F-73 = 4.08, P = 0.047). Additionally, female bears entered dens 8 days earlier than males (SE = 12.82; 20 and 28 October, respectively, P = 0.04), and although not significant (P = 0.09), average female den emergence dates were 7 days (SE = 15.14) later than males. With the potential for increased human activities (i.e. resource extraction and associated access), gaining an understanding of population specific denning requirements is essential for developing future management actions. Our results provide valuable information that will allow decision makers to structure future development in a way that avoids habitats important for denning, and allows for reduced disturbance of winter den sites.

J	WAITZBAUER, W				WAITZBAUER, W			STUDIES IN ENERGETICS AND POPULATION-DYNAMICS OF WATER SCORPION, NEPA-RUBRA L (INSECTA HEMIPTERA)	OECOLOGIA												There is little information on the energy turnover of carnivorous water insects. This study concerns energy flow through an imaginal population of the water scorpion, N. rubra, a water bug common in the lake Neusiedler See in eastern Austria. Population dynamics, production and respiration were determined from 1972-1975 under conditions as natural as possible. The cumulative sum of production energy is small, comprising 179.3 J for .male..male. and 223.8 J for .female..female., with an additional 241.6 J for reproduction. Food reserves, particularly fat accumulated in the fat body during prediapause, are utilized in winter and extensively by females during breeding the next spring. The largest fat content indicated for .male..male. was 4.64 mg and 9.64 mg for .female..female. (crude lipoids). The respiration rate is high even in winter. Probably, at this time O2 is utilized exclusively for fat oxidation. Cumulative respiration energy for the adult stage was 2000.2 J for males and 3221.4 J for females. Total annual energy flow through a population of adults was about 663 kJ/100 m2 of which 596 kJ (= 89%) were applied to respiration and 67 kJ (= 11%) to production.																			0029-8549	1432-1939					1978	33	2					235	253		10.1007/BF00344851	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00344851								28309167					WOS:A1978EU86600009

In recent years, light-level geolocators have improved our understanding of migratory connectivity. Such information is valuable for evaluating how conservation efforts align between the breeding and non-breeding areas of at-risk species, and help to more effectively prioritize the allocation of conservation funding. Golden-winged Warblers (Vermivora chrysoptera) are imperiled migratory songbirds, but the extent to which conservation efforts in their breeding and non-breeding areas coincide with patterns of migratory connectivity are not well known. We used light-level geolocators to evaluate the extent to which conservation actions targeting Golden-winged Warblers in Nicaragua and in their breeding range in North America align with patterns of migratory connectivity. We recovered six of 22 geolocators that had been deployed on male Golden-winged Warblers at the El Jaguar Reserve during the winter of 2015-2016. All six males migrated to breeding areas in the western Great Lakes region that includes eastern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, southwestern Ontario, and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. All six males also had similar migration routes, with spring stopovers in southern Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize, a trans-Gulf flight, and a stopover in the region of Louisiana, Arkansas, eastern Oklahoma, and Texas. Our results, in combination with those of previous studies, demonstrate strong migratory connectivity between portions of the breeding and winter distributions of Golden-winged Warblers currently targeted for conservation. However, additional studies are needed to improve our understanding of the stopover ecology of Golden-winged Warblers, especially in areas where they remain for extended periods of time. Finally, patterns of migratory connectivity revealed in our study should be used in combination with existing demographic parameters for Golden-winged Warblers in the western Great Lakes and Nicaragua to help inform full life cycle population models for this imperiled songbird.

J	Ramstedt, M; Carlsson, E; Lövgren, L				Ramstedt, M; Carlsson, E; Lövgren, L			Aqueous geochemistry in the Udden pit lake, northern Sweden	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												The Udden pit lake in northern Sweden was studied from June 1998 to February 1999 in order to increase knowledge of the geochemistry in lakes created as a result of decommissioning open pit mines. The vertical water profile in the lake was sampled on 4 different occasions, in June, August, September and February. Water samples were analysed for total concentrations of Fe, As, Cu, Cd, Zn, Pb, Al, Ca, K, Mg, Na, Mn, S, Cl, N and P. Temperature, concentration of dissolved 02, conductivity, pH, and redox potential were measured in situ at different depths. Four layers could be observed in the lake during summer, and 3 layers during winter. A thermocline was observed during summer at a depth of 5 m and on all 4 occasions a halocline was observed at a depth of similar to 20 m, and a redoxcline at similar to 35 m. Oxygen concentration decreased dramatically at a depth of 20 m. pH increased downwards in the lake from 4.8 at the surface to 6.4 at the bottom of the lake. Geochemical processes occurring in the lake, the origins of the layers, the metal concentrations ;and the anion concentrations are discussed in this article. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

S.; Prakasam, Muthusamy; Kotlia, Bahadur Singh			Middle Holocene Indian summer monsoon variability and its impact on cultural changes in the Indian subcontinent	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Agriculture is a major contributor to the economic development of modern as well as ancient India and largely depends on the rainfall in the monsoon season. In order to understand the impact of climate variability on cultural changes in the Indian subcontinent, high resolution centennial to millennial scale middle Holocene Indian summer monsoon (ISM) variability was reconstructed from Bednikund lake, located in an alpine meadow of the Pindar basin, Chamoli, Central Himalaya. Increased ISM precipitations were found during similar to 5930-3950 (mid-Holocene climate optimum), similar to 3380-2830 (Minoan Warm Period), similar to 2610-1860 (Roman Warm Period), similar to 1050-760 (Medieval Climate Anomaly), and similar to 320 cal yr BP to Present (Current Warm Period). The decreased ISM strengths were found during similar to 3950-3380, similar to 2830 -2610, similar to 1860-1050 (Dark Ages Cold Period), similar to 760-580, and similar to 500-320 cal yr BP (Little Ice Age). The covariance between our records of precipitation change and total solar irradiance for the middle to late Holocene and with Northern hemisphere (NH) temperature for the past two millennia suggested solar insolation as a primary forcing mechanism of ISM variability. The reconstructed paleoclimate combined with archaeology and historical records indicated that ancient Indian civilizations e.g., the Indus Valley (similar to 5200-3300 cal yr BP) and Vedic (similar to 3400-2400 cal yr BP) had established and thrived during periods of strengthened ISM precipitation, whereas their collapse closely corresponded to the decreased strength in ISM. From similar to 2400 to 200 cal yr BP, the Indian subcontinent witnessed the rise and fall of various Kingdoms/dynasties. This period saw an exponential expansion/growth in agriculture, economy, population, languages, architecture, and religions in the Indian subcontinent. The agrarian-based economy showed little or no impact of monsoon weakening after similar to 2400 cal yr BP possibly due to development and reforms in administrative policies, construction of irrigation systems such as dams, lakes and canals, use of technology for irrigation such as waterwheel, knowledge of double cropping, production of cash crops. The ancient civilizations of India were directly impacted by the strengthening and weakening of ISM, whereas for the later periods, civilizations were able to adapt to climate change.

On orbital timescales transformations of the desert into a grassland landscape in response to higher precipitation provided "windows of opportunity" for hominin dispersal from Africa into Eurasia. On long timescales, palaeoenvironmental reconstructions for the region are predominantly derived from marine sediments and available terrestrial records from the Arabian Peninsula are limited to 450 ka before present (BP). Here, we present a new stalagmite-based palaeoclimate record from Mukalla Cave in Yemen which extends back to similar to 1.1 million years BP or Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 31, as determined by Uranium-lead dating. Stalagmite Y99 grew only during peak interglacial periods and warm substages back to similar to 1.1 Ma. Stalagmite calcite oxygen isotope (delta O-18) values show that every past interglacial humid period was wetter than the Holocene, a period in which large lakes formed in the now arid areas of southern Arabia. Carbon isotope (delta C-13) values indicate habitable grassland environments developed during these pluvial periods. A total of 21 pluvial periods with precipitation of more than 300 mm yr(-1) occurred since similar to 1.1 Ma and thus numerous opportunities for hominin dispersals occurred throughout the Pleistocene. New determinations of hydrogen (delta D-Fl) and oxygen (delta O-18(Fl)) isotopes in stalagmite fluid inclusion water demonstrates that enhanced precipitation in Southern Arabia was brought by the African and Indian Summer Monsoons. When combined with sub-annual calcite analysis of delta O-18 and delta C-13, these data reveal a distinct wet (summer) and dry (winter) seasonality. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Results show that air quality has slightly improved over the recent years. While the NO2 concentration is still increasing, the PM10 concentration shows a clearly downward trend with some small fluctuations. In addition, the SO2 concentration has steadily decreased since 2008. Nevertheless, the current level of air pollutants is still quite high, with the PM10 and NO2 levels exceeding the air quality standard. Seasonal variation exists consistently for all the pollutants, with the highest concentration in winter and the lowest in summer. Cluster analysis evidenced that nine urban monitoring sites could be classified into three clusters. Cluster I consists of only the LY site, which is located in the famous East Lake scenic area with the best air quality. Cluster II corresponds to three monitoring sites with heavily trafficked roads nearby, where relatively severe NO2 pollution occurred. Cluster III is comprised of the remaining five sites, characterized by PM10 and SO2 pollution.																			2073-4433					APR	2016	7	4							56	10.3390/atmos7040056	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos7040056													WOS:000375211200008

The relative distribution of Po and inositol in GPC fractions by use of Sephadex G-25 favored the lower IP esters (ITriP, IDiP, IMP). Based on results from GPC analysis of nontreated foam and lake water, the IP esters were associated with high-molecular-weight organic matter. The percentages of total P present as IP esters averaged 19 and 26 for the foam and lake water, respectively. Estimated spring and summer IP concentrations in Lake Mendota were 3-15 .mu.g P/l.																			0013-936X	1520-5851					1977	11	5					497	501		10.1021/es60128a017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es60128a017													WOS:A1977DD44200017

Hepatotoxic blooms are more common than neurotoxic ones and microcystins have been found to be the most prevalent cyanobacterial hepatotoxins. Lake Pamvotis is an ancient (having been in continual existence throughout the Plio-Pleistocene period) suburban Mediterranean Lake used for recreation, fishing and irrigation purposes which has suffered eutrophication for the last three decades. We investigated cyanobacterial species composition and microcystin loads in this lake over a 16-month period. The highest microcystin concentrations were recorded in autumn, one to two months after the midsummer severe bloom. With the exception of the winter months, microcystin concentrations exceed the WHO upper limits for drinking water but not for recreational waters. Seasonal changes of microcystin bioaccumulation in edible species were also investigated. Microcystin concentrations never exceed the WHO upper limits in those species with the exception of bivalves. For a detailed characterization of the cyanobacterial species composition of the lake, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) between 16S and 23S rRNA genes, in combination with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). ITS sequences from Lake Pamvotis revealed that the cyanobacterial community of this lake is made of two major populations. A population well defined both microscopically and molecularly as Microcystis sp. dominated during autumn, and another population of filamentous cyanobacteria microscopically characterized as Anabaena sp./Aphanizomenon sp. dominated during midsummer blooms. Sequences of filamentous cyanobacteria from Lake Pamvotis revealed that this cyanobacterial population is homogeneous, although divergent from other populations worldwide. Finally, by using a combination of general and genus specific primer sets against the mcyE gene, we identified Microcystis as the only genus responsible for microcystin production in Lake Pamvotis.																			1464-0325	1464-0333					2009	11	8					1506	1512		10.1039/b903093j	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b903093j								19657535					WOS:000268741100009

We have analysed the thickness of 1912 varves in this time-series by means of auto-correlation analysis, in the hope of obtaining information on patterns in past climate, for example patterns of 11 years, which might indicate a relation with solar activity. We analysed the total varve thickness and the thickness of the summer and the winter layer. Two single-bootstrap experiments confirmed the validity of the methods in general, but they indicated that the moving-window technique with overlapping windows hampered the assessment of statistical significance. Three global significance assessment procedures, taking into account the total number of auto-correlation coefficients (ACs) that is tested, showed significance of the ACs only at a lag of one year and only for the winter layer and the total varve. This auto-correlation with the preceding year may be explained by a factor internal to the lake, for instance some depositional mechanism. We found no indication of a relation between varve formation and the sun-spot cycle.

A late-winter to early-spring temperature reconstruction for Southeastern Norway from 1758 to 2006	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY, VOL 46, 2007	Annals of Glaciology-Series				International Symposium on Cryospheric Indicators of Global Climate Change	AUG 21-25, 2006	Cambridge, ENGLAND	Int Glaciol Soc, British Antarct Res, IUGG Commiss Cryospher Sci, World Climate Res Program Climate & Cryosphere Project				Systematic temperature observations were not undertaken in Norway until the early 19th century, and even then only sporadically. Climate-proxy data may be used to reconstruct temperatures before this period, but until now there have not been any climate proxies available for late winter. This situation has recently changed, as a diary containing historical ice break-up data from a farm near lake Randsfjord in southeastern Norway has been discovered. These data, together with observations from lake Mjosa in the same region, make it possible to reconstruct temperature back to 1758. The reconstructed series, combined with instrumental series from the area near the lake, were merged into one composite time series covering the period 1758-2006. The lowest temperatures are seen during the Dalton sunspot minimum in the early 19th century. The 20th century was 1.3 degrees C warmer than the 19th century, whereas the 19th century was 0.4 degrees C warmer than the last 43 years of the 18th century. During the period 1758-1850, the mean temperature was 1.4 degrees C lower than the mean value of the 20th century. The warmth observed in the 1990s and at the start of the 21st century is unprecedented during the whole series.

J	Kagotani, Y; Kanzaki, M; Yoda, K				Kagotani, Y; Kanzaki, M; Yoda, K			Methane budget determined at the ground and water surface level in various ecosystems in Shiga Prefecture, central Japan	CLIMATE RESEARCH												A methane budget at the ground and water surface level was estimated in various ecosystems in Shiga Prefecture, central Japan, and its seasonality was measured. Measuring sites were set up in 9 of 11 land use types in Shiga Prefecture, and methane fluxes were measured by the chamber method for 1 yr. Methane emission rates from sources were generally high in summer: the mean emission rate was 19.4 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) from a paddy field and 9.6 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) from a Phragmites swamp in July-August. In 4 main types of forest, atmospheric methane was absorbed by forest soils, at mean rates ranging from 0.01 to 0.12 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1). The methane budget of Shiga Prefecture in each season was evaluated on the basis of the following data: A large amount of methane was emitted in summer, about 370 Mg CH4 d(-1) in July-August. In winter, however, the methane emission from the area as a whole was much lower than that in summer, owing to a decrease of methane emission from the sources. In particular, forest ecosystems absorbed about 3.4 Mg CH4 d(-1) in November-December, an amount exceeding that of the emission from the other land use types. Summing the annual methane emissions and absorption of every land use type and adding the estimates of methane emissions from domestic animals and landfills, the annual net release of methane to the atmosphere in Shiga Prefecture was estimated to be about 34.1 Gg CH4, Among all land use types, the contribution of paddy fields to the total emission was the highest, al 81.7%. The annual methane absorption by forests was estimated to be about 1.0 Gg CH4, representing 2.7% of the total emission.																			0936-577X					JAN 30	1996	6	1					79	88		10.3354/cr006079	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr006079													WOS:A1996UB31600007

The extensive eolian deposits of the desert/loess transition in central China provide important terrestrial archives of paleoclimate change, especially the evolution of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM). As yet, however, due to the specific geographical location of the region, relatively few eolian sedimentary records have been reported since the Holocene. Here we investigated paleoclimatic implications of color parameters and grain size end-member (EM) components in three eolian sand-paleosol sequences. The chronology framework of the stratigraphic sections was established using 11 radiocarbon dates from organic material and 9 optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages from quartz. We reconstructed the early-mid Holocene climate changes in the southeastern margin of the Mu Us Desert by combining magnetic susceptibility (MS) and total organic carbon (TOC) analyses. Similar to the loess-paleosol sequence in central China, the lightness was significantly negatively correlated with TOC, MS and fine EM and all were controlled primarily by effective moisture. However, the redness and blueness were more influenced by the sand's parent materials rather than from weak pedogenesis and therefore reflected eolian activity. This was supported by the significant positive correlation between redness and blueness and coarse EM that represented components transported by saltation and creep from near-source areas during dust outbreaks in cold and dry climate condition. Our multi-proxy analysis indicated that during the Younger Dryas and early Holocene, the Mu Us Desert was dominated by cold and dry climate conditions with frequent strong eolian activities. During 8.5-3.7 ka BP, the climate shifted to warm and humid that effectively fixed dunes and the paleosol was widely developed confirming the occurrence of the Holocene climate optimum. In addition, these alterations during the Holocene were primarily controlled by the EASM that was driven by summer insolation in the Northern Hemisphere, as well as changes in high latitude ice-sheets area and the ocean-atmosphere interaction patterns in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans on different scales.

In terms of mean salinity levels (0.2-5.2 PSU), the lakes represented freshwater, transitional, and brackish types. Results showed that salinity determines the spatial and seasonal distribution patterns of microorganisms in costal lakes. Increased salinity contributed to a significant decline in total bacterial numbers (TBN). The TBN was lowest in brackish lakes in autumn (4 x 10(6) cells/mL) and highest in freshwater lakes in summer (7.11 x 10(6) cells/mL). The groups of Proteobacteria are appropriate bioindicators in any classifications of coastal ecosystems, particularly at low-haline stress. Alpha- and Gamma- subclasses of Proteobacteria are identifiers for brackish habitats, while Betaproteobacteria, due to their intolerance to haline stress, prefer freshwater habitats. Counts of euryhaline Actinobacteria, the dominant group of bacterioplankton (31.8%), decreased significantly with increased salinity. Actinobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria were identifiers of transitional lakes. Cytophaga-Flavobacteria showed affinity with freshwater ecosystems, but this relation was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The bacteria groups correlated with other physico-chemical parameters of water, such as oxygenation (Actinobacteria) or organic carbon (Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria). The impact of hydrological connectivity and salt-water interference on the microbiota structure and biogeochemistry of coastal waters should be considered in the assessment of the ecological status of coastal lakes.					; Glinska-Lewczuk, Katarzyna/H-9759-2019	GLINSKA-LEWCZUK, KATARZYNA/0000-0002-7845-6353; Kobus, Szymon/0000-0002-1106-3918; Lew, Sylwia/0000-0003-1408-4041; Obolewski, Krystian/0000-0001-9361-0286; Burandt, Pawel/0000-0001-6514-4361; 														1660-4601				APR	2022	19	8							4592	10.3390/ijerph19084592	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19084592								35457457					WOS:000785176100001

Muller) Bergh	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Blooms of Ceratium hirundinella (O. F. Muller) Bergh. have been detected in different water bodies in the Neotropical Region since 1990. The colonization began in Southern lakes, and during the last decade the dinoflagellate arrived and bloomed in subtropical reservoirs. fit this context the colonization of C. hirundinella and its population development have been analyzed from its first record in the Rio Tercero Reservoir (February 1999 to February 2001). Phytoplankton and physicochemical samples were obtained from three sampling stations at the Reservoir, one in the outlet of the water cooling channel of the nuclear power plant, and one in the nearest tributary (Quillinzo River). Two blooms of C. hirundinella were detected during the warm seasons with temperatures higher than 18 degrees C, and pH ranging between 8.5 and 8.9. Environmental conditions such as certain light intensity range and percentage of dissolved oxygen mentioned as favorable for Ceratium development were always recorded in Rio Tercero Reservoir. Cysts were observed in spring and summer months. Another dinoflagellate (Peridinium gatunense Nygaard) bloomed in previous Summer in this water body but its population density decreased during the invasive phase of colonization of C hirundinella. Asplanchna girodi, became the dominant zooplankter after the first bloom of C hirundinella. We believe that the presence of this dinoflagellate in the Neotropical Region Could be a regional phenomenon associated with some dispersal mechanisms and favorable local conditions for its proliferation like those recorded in the Rio Tercero Reservoir.

Sedimentation rates by the 210Pb chronological method in Itanhaem river watershed, southeast Brazil	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The historical variation of sedimentation rate was investigated in five cores collected from the Itanhaem watershed main rivers, the second largest coastal watershed of the Sao Paulo state, Brazil, using the lead-210 radioisotope as a geochronometer. The main characteristics of the rivers' waters and sediments were determined in order to support the geochronological analysis results and associate sediments with possible source areas. In this context, the fluvial waters' general classification indicated the facies sulfated or chlorinated sodium in the winter and summer seasons, except for the Branco river waters in summer, which were classified as calcium or magnesium bicarbonate. A longitudinal salinity gradient was found in the downstream river courses, under greater marine influence, with the ions Cl-, Na+, SO42+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and K+ being most common in the waters. Silica is the predominant constituent in the sediment cores and is inversely related to the organic matter (OM) presence. Inverse correlations were also found between silica and other constituents. The watershed sedimentation rates were determined in the range of 0.31 up to 3.97 g/cm(2)/year and 0.30 up to 3.40 cm/year, highlighting the core extracted from Branco river, which showed the highest sedimentation rate. The profiles corresponding to Preto and Aguapeu rivers presented discontinuities in the sedimentation rates. The discontinuities were dated and would probably be related to the anthropic activities, which intensified in the municipality of Itanhaem around the middle of the twentieth century.

All materials controlled vegetation the 1st yr. They then accumulated sediments and were invaded by rooted plants. The blankets could not be easily removed or cleaned in the lake. New blankets would have to be added each year to control macrophytes. The screens were easily removed. When cleaned each year, the screens prevented new growth in spring and eliminated growing plants in summer. Few plants grew back 1-2 mo. after removing the screens. Most benthos were eliminated beneath the screens. For opening boat lanes across plant beds and controlling plants along shore, removable screens can be a useful technique.																			0146-6623						1984	22	JAN					43	48																WOS:A1984SL84600008

These algae, which are major components of the summer-autumn phytoplankton in Lake Kinneret, Israel, showed marked differences in growth response. Scenedesmus and Tetraedron strains grew most rapidly, with highest yields on some DOP compounds, such as ribose phosphate and ATP, whereas Pediastrum was most effective in exploiting some DON sources, such as tryptophan. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the differential ability of microalgae to utilize DOP and DON as P and N sources may be ecologically significant, and may play a role in determining the species composition of phytoplankton assemblages in aquatic systems.																			0031-8884					JUL	1991	30	4					339	345		10.2216/i0031-8884-30-4-339.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2216/i0031-8884-30-4-339.1													WOS:A1991FZ30600003
J	Seaby, RMH; Martin, AJ; Young, JO				Seaby, RMH; Martin, AJ; Young, JO			Food partitioning by lake-dwelling triclads and glossiphoniid leeches: Field and laboratory experiments	OECOLOGIA												The triclads Polycelis tenuis and Dugesia polychroa and the glossiphoniid leeches Glossiphonia complanata and Helobdella stagnalis are abundant on the stony shores of productive British lakes. All species are food limited and there is considerable overlap in the diets of these triclads and leeches. This paper investigates interactions between the two groups using field and laboratory experiments to try to identify the mechanism of their co-existence. Triclad and leech numbers were manipulated inside experimental enclosures, matched by controls, erected on the stony shore of an eutrophic English lake. Increasing the numbers of P. tenuis and D. polychroa prior to the reproductive season in spring resulted in a significant decrease in the numbers and body size of G. complanata and H. stagnalis compared with control populations in the summer months, and vice versa. However, increases and decreases were temporary with a readjustment of numbers and body size to control levels in the autumn after reproduction had ceased. It is suggested that increasing the numbers of either group elevated the severity of both intra- and interspecific competition for food. The ''condition'' of prey may, in part, determine the strength of competition, and this was examined in laboratory experiments in which different densities and ratios of P. tenuis and H. stagnalis were offered either live of recently crushed Asellus aquaticus. In monospecific controls, growth rates of P. tenuis were greater when fed on crushed than live Asellus, but there was no significant difference in the growth of H. stagnalis fed either live or crushed prey. In mixed cultures of predators, P. tenuis and H. stagnalis were the superior competitors when fed on crushed and live Asellus, respectively. However, when competitive pressure was low, at low densities of predators, the presence of H. stagnalis in mixed cultures fed on live prey was beneficial to the growth of P. tenuis. These results are explained in terms of the greater ability of triclads to detect damaged prey, leaking body fluids, due to their sophisticated chemosensory system, and the ability of leeches to capture live prey due to the presence of suckers. It is concluded that co-existence of the two groups in British lakes is assisted by the partitioning of food on a live or damaged basis.

LESSER BLACK-BACKED GULLS, LARUS FUSCUS FUSCUS (LARIDAE, CHARADRIIFORMES) ON LAKE ONEGA (THE RED DATA BOOK OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION)	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The material on the biology and population dynamics of the globally endangered Lesser Black-backed Gull (Larus f. fuscus) in the islands of Lake Onega, all collected between 1974 and 2024, are summarized. The study presents the distribution of the birds across the area, data on the timing of arrival, nesting biology, and post-nesting movements. Long-term population trends and the factors influencing changes are analyzed. The primary nesting sites of the Lesser Black-backed Gull are located in the Kizhi skerries and Kondopoga Bay, both in the northwestern skerry region of the lake. Birds typically arrive between the middle and last third of April, with egg-laying commencing in early to mid-May. The average clutch size is 2.47 +/- 0.03 eggs (n = 530). The hatching period varies annually within a three-week range, depending on April and May air temperatures (r(s) =-0.53, p < 0.01). Due to rising spring temperatures, hatching gradually shifts to an earlier period (2 days in 10 years). The population peaked in 1985, with 210 individuals recorded in the Kizhi skerries. The numbers declined until the late 1990s, then recovered in the 2000s, but have been decreasing again since 2012, reaching just 25 individuals in 2024. Annual fluctuations negatively correlated with water levels in the primary wintering areas of the eastern subspecies in the Sudd Wetlands and Lake Victoria (rs =-0.52, p < 0.01). This indirectly supports the hypothesis that some mature birds remain in Africa during summer (Cherenkov et al., 2014) and indicates that their numbers may depend on the state of wintering habitats. There was no strong interspecific competition between the Lesser Black-backed Gull and the Herring Gull: the abundance of these species correlated (rs = 0.63, p < 0.01), and long-term trends had a similar direction. A more significant role is played by local factors associated with visits to the islands by people during the nesting period. The flow of tourists arriving by water routes is constantly growing, and the conservation of large gull colonies without protection strengthening is hardly feasible even within the Kizhi Federal Nature Reserve.																			0044-5134					AUG	2025	104	8					66	78		10.31857/S0044513425080056	http://dx.doi.org/10.31857/S0044513425080056													WOS:001555642600001

The raw data of the habitat areas and the migration routes are usually in large scale and with high complexity when they are determined by high-tech GPS satellite telemetry. In this paper, we convert these biological problems into computational studies and introduce efficient algorithms for the data analysis. Our key idea is the concept of hierarchical clustering for migration habitat localizations, and the notion of association rules for the discovery of migration routes from the scattered location points in the GIS. One of our clustering results is a tree structure, specially called spatial-tree, which is an illusive map depicting the breeding and wintering home range of bar-headed geese. A related result to this observation is an association pattern that reveals a high possibility that bar-headed geese's potential autumn migration routes are likely between the breeding sites in the Qinghai Lake, China and the wintering sites in Tibet river valley. Given the susceptibility of geese to spread H5N1, and on the basis of the chronology and the rates of the bar-headed geese migration movements, we can conjecture that bar-headed geese play an important role in the spread of the H5N1 virus at a regional scale in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.					; Wang, Weihang/LUZ-1131-2024; Li, Jinyan/K-4293-2012; Tang, Mingjie/NTQ-4211-2025	Li, Jinyan/0000-0003-1833-7413; 													0219-1377	0219-3116				MAY	2011	27	2					227	251		10.1007/s10115-010-0308-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10115-010-0308-x													WOS:000289562400004

J	HARTMANN, J; PROBST, L				HARTMANN, J; PROBST, L			DIVERGENT DISTRIBUTIONS OF PREY AND PREDATOR, A FISHING EFFECT	AQUATIC SCIENCES												To compare the vertical distributions of benthos and fish species of Upper Lake Constance (Bodensee), 552 benthos samples were taken with an Auerbach grab at four transects (10-250 m). An additional 54 samples (1-10 m) were collected elsewhere. Complementary data was taken from the literature. In winter, most fish feed on benthos, mainly chironomids, but in summer less than 5% do so. Formerly the bottom gill-netting aimed mainly at catching Coregonus pidschian, but it now aims at Perca fluviatilis. Contrary to expectation, in winter the greatest abundance of P. fluviatilis is much deeper (55 m) than that of its preferred food, i.e. chironomids (<20 m). Comparably, C. pidschian also stayed deeper than its main food source (chironomids and mollusks). Lota lota, Salvelinus profundus and S. alpinus - unlike the unwanted cyprinids - also stay or stayed deeper than the attractive chironomids. It is argued that the fish reduce their ''predation risk'', i.e. the risk of being gillnetted in the upper 50 m, by ''selecting'' the deeper less dangerous, but also less food-abundant habitat. Balancing predation risk against food abundance may have led to ''survival of the deepest''.																			1015-1621						1995	57	2					106	118		10.1007/BF00877379	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00877379													WOS:A1995RK31100002
J	Showqi, I; Lone, FA; Naikoo, M				Showqi, Irfana; Lone, Farooq Ahmad; Naikoo, Mehrajuddin			Preliminary assessment of heavy metals in water, sediment and macrophyte (Lemna minor) collected from Anchar Lake, Kashmir, India	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												Water samples, sediments and free floating macrophytic plant, Lemna minor specimens were collected from five designated sites in Anchar lake (Srinagar, J&K, India) to assess its heavy metal (Cu, Cr, Zn, Ni, Cd, Pb) load and changes on seasonal basis. The concentration of heavy metals was determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Most of the samples were found within limits of maximum permissible concentrations as recommended by WHO (Guidelines for drinking water quality, pp 491-493, 2006). During all the seasons, highest concentration of all heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Zn, Ni, Cd, Pb) was recorded at highly polluted sites of the lake viz. near agricultural fields (S-1), near settlements (S-3) and SKIMS (S-4). These sites received huge agrochemical run-off from the surrounding agricultural fields, solid and liquid wastes from the nearby catchment areas and effluents from Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) compared to control site lake centre (S-5). Furthermore, most of the metals in water and sediment were found with highest concentration during autumn (Viz., Cu-1.5 ppm; Zn-0.38 ppm; Ni-1.89 ppm; Pb-0.84 ppm in water and Cu-26.9 ppm; Zn-13.6 ppm; Pb-4.33 ppm in sediment) and summer (Viz., Cr-0.68 ppm in water and Ni-4.8 ppm; Cd-2.6 ppm; Cr-8.01 ppm in sediment) seasons. Also in Lemna minor plant highest concentration was observed during summer season (Cu-29.09 ppm; Zn-19.11 ppm; Ni-5.7 ppm; Cd-1.34 ppm; Cr-9.18 ppm and Pb-9.77 ppm). From these observations, it was found that the sources of heavy metals in Anchar lake were both natural and anthropogenic ones. This study recommended that continuous monitoring of heavy metals (Viz; Cu, Cr, Zn, Ni, Cd and Pb) in water, sediment and other aquatic biota of Anchar lake should be directed to protection of ecological status of the lake and its surrounding area.																			2190-5487	2190-5495				JUN	2018	8	3							80	10.1007/s13201-018-0720-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13201-018-0720-z													WOS:000439084700004

Both compounds were emitted via wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), with methyl triclosan probably being formed by biological methylation. A regional mass balance for a lake (Greifensee) indicated significant removal of triclosan by processes other than flushing. Laboratory experiments showed that triclosan in the dissociated form was rapidly decomposed in lake water when exposed to sunlight (half-life less than 1 h in August at 47degrees latitude). Methyl triclosan and nondissociated triclosan, however, were relatively stable toward photodegradation. Modeling these experimental data for the situation of lake Greifensee indicated that photodegradation can account for the elimination of triclosan from the lake and suggested a seasonal dependence of the concentrations (lower in summer, higher in winter), consistent with observed concentrations. Although emissions of methyl triclosan from WWTPs were only approximate to2% relative to those of triclosan, its predicted concentration relative to triclosan in the epilimnion of the lake increases to 30% in summer. Passive sampling with semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) indicated the presence of methyl triclosan in lakes with inputs from anthropogenic sources but not in a remote mountain lake. Surprisingly, no parent triclosan was observed in the SPMDs from these lakes. Methyl triclosan appears to be preferentially accumulated in SPMDs under the conditions in these lakes, leading to concentrations comparable to those of persistent chlorinated organic pollutants.

From 1840 to the mid-20th century, the Arctic warmed to the highest temperatures in four centuries. This warming ended the Little Ice Age in the Arctic and has caused retreats of glaciers, melting of permafrost and sea ice, and alteration of terrestrial and lake ecosystems. Although warming, particularly after 1920, was likely caused by increases in atmospheric trace gases, the initiation of the warming in the mid-19th century suggests that increased solar irradiance, decreased volcanic activity, and feedbacks internal to the climate system played roles.

J	Rimmer, A; Gal, G				Rimmer, A; Gal, G			Estimating the saline springs component in the solute and water balance of Lake Kinneret, Israel	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The relatively high salinity of Lake Kinneret, Israel (190-350 ppm Cl-) is a result of the activity of saline springs located at the bottom of the lake. Their subsurface location inhibits direct monitoring of their fluxes. The objective of this work is to characterize the monthly ground water flow and salinity of the unmonitored saline springs over a long-term period, and to find a functional relationship between deriving variables and these monthly discharges. Results of the long-term evaluation of the unmonitored saline springs activity, are intended to help distinguish between two competing models ('gravity driven flow' (GFM) and 'self potential' models), which were proposed as the mechanism of the Lake Kinneret saline springs. The monthly solute and water balance of 32 consecutive years (1968-2001) was calculated, in which the contribution of the saline springs was considered as the residual. Error analyses were conducted for both the water and the solute residuals, and constraints were used to calculate a better, physically based time series representing the unmonitored saline springs activity. The calculated time-series of water and solute discharge from the springs were used to find the functional relationship with the lake level. It was found that there was an increase of water and solute fluxes to the lake at periods of high lake level. We concluded that the results are in agreement with the proposed GFM: high fluxes of ground water to the lake, and high leaching of solute are the result of rainy seasons, which usually cause high lake levels as well.

Fluvio-deltaic avulsions during relative sea-level fall	GEOLOGY												Understanding river response to changes in relative sea level (RSL) is essential for predicting fluvial stratigraphy and source-to-sink dynamics. Recent theoretical work has suggested that rivers can remain aggradational during RSL fall, but field data are needed to verify this response and investigate sediment deposition processes. We show with field work and modeling that fluvio-deltaic systems can remain aggradational or at grade during RSL fall, leading to superelevation and continuation of delta lobe avulsions. The field site is the Goose River, Newfoundland-Labrador, Canada, which has experienced steady RSL fall of around 3-4 mm yr(-1) in the past 5 k.y. from post-glacial isostatic rebound. Elevation analysis and optically stimulated luminescence dating suggest that the Goose River avulsed and deposited three delta lobes during RSL fall. Simulation results from Delft3D software show that if the characteristic fluvial response time is longer than the duration of RSL fall, then fluvial systems remain aggradational or at grade, and continue to avulse during RSL fall due to superelevation. Intriguingly, we find that avulsions become more frequent at faster rates of RSL fall, provided the system response time remains longer than the duration of RSL fall. This work suggests that RSL fall rate may influence the architecture of falling-stage or forced regression deposits by controlling the number of deposited delta lobes.

In this work, the flow variations of the saline springs during the wet and dry seasons were monitored using volumetric and cross-sectional methods, and the cycling process of the saline springs was quantitatively identified using the integrated hydrochemical and isotopic methods. The results show that most saline springs in the Nangqen Basin had significantly different flow rates, ion concentrations, and TDS concentrations. The ions mainly come from carbonate and sulfate minerals. There is no internal hydraulic connection between these saline springs, and the impact of seasonal changes on the flow is relatively small, indicating that the saline springs originate mainly from deep circulation. The recharge elevation of the saline springs ranges 3 661-4 990 m a.s.l., with an average of 4 100 m a.s.l. The circulation depth of the saline springs ranges of 240-570 m, with an average of 431 m. The recycle time ranges of 1.15-30.86 years, with an average of 15.66 years. These results could provide a scientific basis for the development and utilization of saline spring resources in the Nangqen Basin.

Near-surface internal melting: a substantial mass loss on Antarctic Dry Valley glaciers	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												The McMurdo Dry Valleys, southern Victoria Land, East Antarctica, are a polar desert, and melt from glacial ice is the primary source of water to streams, lakes and associated ecosystems. Previous work found that to adequately model glacier ablation and subsurface ice temperatures with a surface energy-balance model required including the transmission of solar radiation into the ice. Here we investigate the contribution of subsurface melt to the mass balance of (and runoff from) Dry Valley glaciers by including a drainage process in the model and applying the model to three glacier sites using 13 years of hourly meteorological data. Model results for the smooth glacier surfaces common to many glaciers in the Dry Valleys showed that sublimation was typically the largest component of surface lowering, with rare episodes of surface melting, consistent with anecdotal field observations. Results also showed extensive internal melting 5-15 cm below the ice surface, the drainage of which accounted for similar to 50% of summer ablation. This is consistent with field observations of subsurface streams and formation of a weathering crust. We identify an annual cycle of weathering crust formation in summer and its removal during the 10 months of winter sublimation.

Due to the potential role of nosZ II in N2O mitigation, emerging studies in terrestrial ecosystems have taken this newly reported N2O-reducer into account. However, our knowledge about the interactions between denitrification activities and both N2O-producers and reducers (especially for nosZ II) in aquatic ecosystems remains limited. In this study, we investigated spatiotemporal distributions of in situ N2O flux, potential N2O production rate, and potential denitrification rate, as well as of the related genes in a riparian zone of Baiyangdian Lake. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and high-throughput sequencing targeted functional genes were used to analyze the denitrifier communities. Results showed that great differences in microbial activities and abundances were observed between sites and seasons. Waterward sediments (constantly flooded area) had the lowest N2O production potential in both seasons. Not only the environmental factors (moisture content, NH4+ content and TOM) but also the community structure of N2O-producers and N2O-reducers (rtirK/nirS and nosZ II/nosZ I ratios) could affect the potential N2O production rate. The abundance of the four functional genes in the winter was higher than in the summer, and the values all peaked at the occasionally flooded area in the winter. The dissimilarity in community composition was mainly driven by moisture content. Altogether, we propose that the N2O production potential was largely regulated by the community structure of N2O-producers and N2O-reducers in riparian zones. Increasing the constantly flooded area and reducing the occasion- ally flooded area of lake ecosystems may help reduce the level of denitrifler-produced N2O. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Skeffington, MS; Scott, NE				Skeffington, Micheline Sheehy; Scott, Nick. E.			DO TURLOUGHS OCCUR IN SLOVENIA?	ACTA CARSOLOGICA												Turloughs are karst basins that fill seasonally with mostly groundwater and drain, usually in summer, to reveal a sedge or grassland community. They are often described as being virtually unique to Ireland. The much larger seasonal poljes of the Slovenian karst are considered different to turloughs. However, a series of small temporary karst lakes in the Slovenian Pivka valley seem remarkably similar to Irish turloughs. Like turloughs, they fill and empty largely through estavelles connecting to underground water systems, which rise and fall with high seasonal rainfall. The Slovenian sites, however, support less wetland communities than Irish turloughs, probably due to drier summer conditions. The plant communities of both systems Occur in zones around the basin, related to flood duration. Releves taken at five Slovenian sites revealed that Petelinjsko jezero, which floods longest each year, is the most similar to turloughs, with, in the lower basin, Eleocharis palustris, Potentilla reptans and the unusual form of Ranuculus repens commonly found in Irish turloughs. The difference in climate and terrain means that the Slovenian sites are managed for hay or silage, while the Irish turloughs are under pasture. However, for both, regular flooding precludes Much agricultural improvement, so that they are now refuges for flora and fauna. A revised definition for turloughs is proposed and a case made for these Slovenian wetland systems to be recognised as turloughs and for the EU Habitats Directive to be amended to include poljes and other similar temporary karst wetland systems as well as turloughs.																			0583-6050						2008	37	2-3					291	306																WOS:000262834100010

However, protistan diversity in freshwater habitats with oxygen gradients received very little attention. We applied high-throughput sequencing of the V9 region (18S rRNA gene) to provide a hitherto unique spatiotemporal analysis of protistan diversity along the oxygen gradient of a freshwater meromictic lake (Lake Alatsee, SW Germany). In the mixolimnion, the communities experienced most seasonal structural changes, with Stramenopiles dominating in autumn and Dinoflagellata in summer. The suboxic interface supported the highest diversity, but only 23 OTUs(95%) (mainly Euglenozoa, after quality check and removal of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with less than three sequences) were exclusively associated with this habitat. Eukaryotic communities in the anoxic monimolimnion showed the most stable seasonal pattern, with Chrysophyta and Bicosoecida being the dominant taxa. Our data pinpoint to the ecological role of the interface as a short-term meeting point' for protists, contributing to the coupling of the mixolimnion and the monimolimnion. Our analyses of divergent genetic diversity suggest a high degree of previously undescribed OTUs. Future research will have to reveal if this result actually points to a high number of undescribed species in such freshwater habitats.

Implications of projected climate change on winter road systems in Ontario's Far North, Canada	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Understanding climate change impacts on winter road systems in Ontario's Far North is critical due to the high dependence on such seasonal corridors by local residences, particularly among remote First Nations communities. In recent years, a warmer climate has resulted in a shorter winter road season and an increase in unreliable road conditions, thus limiting access among remote communities. This study focused on examining the future freezing degree day (FDD) accumulations during the preconditioning period of the winter roads at five locations using the multi-model ensembles of general circulation models (GCMs) and regional climate models (RCMs), under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios. The Statistical DownScaling Model Decision Centric Version 5 (SDSM-DC) was applied to validate the baseline climate. The results from the CMIP5 showed that by mid-century, the trends of FDDs under RCP4.5 for Moosonee and Kapuskasing were projected to decrease below the lowest threshold with the mean FDDs at 376 and 363, respectively. Under RCP8.5, the mean FDDs for Lansdowne House and Red Lake were projected to be below the lowest threshold, at 356 and 305, respectively, by the end of the century. Results of the FDD threshold measure indicated that climate conditions would possibly be unfavorable during the winter road construction period by mid-century for Moosonee and Kapuskasing and for Lansdowne House and Red Lake by the end of the century. For Big Trout Lake, on the other hand, climate conditions are expected to remain favorable for the winter road construction through the end of 2100.					; Gough, William/L-5231-2013	Hori, Yukari/0000-0002-6929-9931; 													0165-0009	1573-1480				MAY	2018	148	1-2					109	122		10.1007/s10584-018-2178-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-018-2178-2													WOS:000431788500008

Growth was measured by thymidine and leucine incorporation applying the dual-label approach. Psychrotolerant or mesophilic communities with a growth optimum of >18 degrees C were present in surface waters at the Polar Front at an in situ temperature of 4 to 5 degrees C. Further south in surface waters of the Antarctic circumpolar current (ACC), in the marginal ice zone and at the shelf ice edge, psychrophilic communities with growth optima of 11 and 4 to 8 degrees C, respectively, were present. Growth at the ambient temperature of ca 0 degrees C or slightly below was reduced. By in situ hybridization with fluorescent rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes, between 63 and 96% of all DAPI-stainable picoplankton cells were identified as Bacteria whereas Archaea were never detected. Cells belonging to the Cytophaga/Flavobacterium cluster were most abundant from all bacterial groups tested (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subclass of Proteobacteria, Cytophaga/Flavobacterium cluster) and comprised 20 % of DAPI counts at the Polar Front and 40 % in the ACC. In the marginal ice zone during a bloom of Phaeocystis sp. they even comprised 72%. gamma-subclass proteobacteria accounted for <1% of DAPI counts at the Polar Front and for 7 to 9% further south. alpha-subclass proteobacteria never exceeded 1% and beta-subclass proteobacteria were not detected at all. The results indicate that different communities of heterotrophic picoplankton established along the transect from the Polar Front south to the marginal ice zone as shown by the reduction of the temperature optima and coinciding with a change in the community structure and a pronounced dominance of bacteria of the Cytophaga/Flavobacterium cluster in the psychrophilic communities.

In the spring, summer, and fall of 2015, we conducted six field sampling campaigns at 24 sites in northern Lake Taihu's high-incidence area of algal blooms. Absorbance coupled with three-dimensional fluorescence and parallel factor analysis (3DEEMs-PARAFAC), together with water quality parameters, were used to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of DOM and water quality in Lake Taihu under the influence of algal bloom to provide scientific support for the management and restoration of the Lake Taihu ecosystem and ensure the safety of its water supply. During the sampling period (from May 12 to October 20), the three lake regions experienced significant algal bloom and degradation. The algal blooms were closely related to the input of exogenous nutrients. During the summer, the rapid growth of algal biomass significantly consumed NO3--N generated NH4+-N and inhibited the denitrification process of microorganisms. Parallel factor analysis identified four fluorescent DOM components: two protein-like components (tryptophan-like C1 and tyrosine-like C3) and two humic substances (microbial humic-like C2 and terrestrial humic-like C4).Terrestrial inputs from the northwest significantly affected the composition and structure of DOM in northern Lake Taihu, showing a trend of decreasing abundance and terrestrial aromaticity from west to east. In addition, the large amount of terrestrial DOM also provided an important carbon source for the growth of planktonic algae, which further influenced the composition and structure of DOM and led to the increased participation of autochthonous DOM (C2 and C3) with strong microbial activity in the lake carbon cycling process. There were differences among the three northern algal areas, and the algal bloom management in these three lakes needs to be adapted to local conditions; exogenous inputs should be reduced in the northwestern part of the lake, algal bloom monitoring and ecological restoration should be strengthened in Meiliang Bay, and ecological diversity should be preserved and restored in the northeastern part of the lake to enhance the natural purification capacit					han, ziyi/LFT-5878-2024														1000-0593					DEC	2024	44	12					3568	3575		10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2024)12-3568-08	http://dx.doi.org/10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2024)12-3568-08													WOS:001376841800001

Three macro-algae, Gracilaria verrucosa, Enteromorpha intestinalis and Chaelomorpha linum occured abundantly in the lake throughout the year. These organisms preferred moderate salinity of Southern and Central sectors and their biomass changed in response to the salinity levels during different seasons. Gracilaria verrucosa and E. intestinalis did not grow in the Northern sector where the salinity level was least in the lake. Maximum biomass was obtained in the winter followed by summer and rainy seasons. The total biomass of 26,963 tonnes dry weight in 7.63% of the total area surveyed showed richness of macro-algal resources in the lake. Of this, occurrence of 14,467 tonnes of the economically important alga Gracilaria verrucosa suggests its possible exploitation for agar production.

Chains as strong as the weakest link: remote assessment of aquatic resource use on spring migration by Bewick's Swans	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Migratory species are threatened worldwide by climate change, overexploitation, and habitat changes. Availability of suitable habitat is important for flying migrants, and in particular for large birds that use the energetically expensive flapping flight mode, such as the Bewick's Swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii). Bewick's Swans largely feed on aquatic macrophytes during migration that may disappear when nutrient levels, waves, and turbidity exceed certain thresholds. Macrophyte collapse has been suggested as a reason for the sharp decline of the Bewick's Swan population during 1995-2015. We used Bewick's Swans fitted with GPS/GSM neck collars including an accelerometer and water sensor to record the occurrence of aquatic foraging in remote stopovers along their migratory route. We concentrated on spring migration, when stopovers are longer than during autumn, and focused on four key sites identified in earlier tracking studies. Within these sites, we identified areas that are protected based on the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA). During three years (2017-2019), we obtained a total of 51 complete spring tracks of adult female Bewick's Swans. Most swans showed aquatic foraging along the coast of Estonia and in Dvina Bay, and about half in the Gulf of Finland and Cheskaya Bay. In Estonia and in the Gulf of Finland, swans predominantly used protected zones, but in Dvina Bay swans also foraged extensively in areas that are currently not protected according to WDPA. No protected areas occur in Cheskaya Bay. Macrophyte vegetation is threatened by ongoing or planned construction works in the Gulf of Finland and Dvina Bay, and by future oil and gas exploitation in Cheskaya Bay. Our study shows how migrants can be used as sentinels to pinpoint areas that require protection in order to maintain a chain of suitable stopovers on their migration.

The evidence of two types of non-volatile RSS that have different interaction with the Hg electrode was confirmed: mercapto-type which complexes Hg as RS-Hg and sulfide/S0-like compounds which deposits HgS. The analytical protocol that was used for RSS determination in aerosol samples is based on separate voltammetric studies of a methyl 3-mercaptopropionate (3-MPA) as a representative of mercapto-type compounds and sulfide as a representative of inorganic RSS. Our preliminary study indicates the presence of mainly RS-Hg compounds in spring samples, ranging from 2.60-15.40 ng m(-3), while both, the mercapto-type (0.48-2.23 ng m(-3)) and sulfide and/or S0-like compounds (0.02-0.26 ng m(-3)) were detected in early autumn samples. More expressed and defined RS-Hg peaks recorded in the spring potentially indicate their association with biological activity in the area. Those samples were also characterized by a higher water-soluble organic carbon content and a more abundant surface-active fraction, pointing to enhanced solubility and stabilization of RSS in the aqueous atmospheric phase.					; ciglenecki, irena/N-8792-2013; Frka, Sanja/JMP-7939-2023	Ciglenecki, Irena/0000-0002-1873-6193; Frka, Sanja/0000-0002-9018-6165														2073-4433				NOV	2019	10	11							674	10.3390/atmos10110674	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos10110674													WOS:000502272000036
J	Hudon, C; Armellin, A; Gagnon, P; Patoine, A				Hudon, Christiane; Armellin, Alain; Gagnon, Pierre; Patoine, Alain			Variations in water temperatures and levels in the St. Lawrence River (Qu,bec, Canada) and potential implications for three common fish species	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The implications for fish populations of long- (multi-decadal, 1919-2007), medium- (inter-annual) and short- (seasonal, daily) term variations in water temperatures and levels were examined in the St. Lawrence River (SLR). The effects of the seasonal thermal regime of the SLR and its tributaries on the thermal budgets of resident and migrating fish were contrasted. Over the 1919-2007 period, the mean annual water level in Montreal declined significantly; for a discharge of 8,000 m(3) s(-1), levels dropped steadily by about 3.6 cm year(-1) between 1955 and 1982, coinciding with the period of major shoreline alteration and channel excavation. Between 1960 and 2007, the annual water temperature of the SLR rose by 1.3A degrees C (0.027A degrees C year(-1)); none of the 10 coldest years and six of the 10 warmest years were observed since 1981. Temperature differences between the warmest and coolest years were greatest in spring and fall (by about 2.5A degrees C); fish growing season (> 5A degrees C) was longer by 5 weeks and represented 20% more degree-days for the warmest years. In comparison with its tributaries, SLR water was slower to warm up in the spring but remained warmer in the fall: fish migrating seasonally between water masses could thus enhance or reduce their thermal budgets by 1-2A degrees C daily. Northern pike recruitment years (year-class strength index [YCSI] values above the time series median) were best with June water levels > 4.9 m IGLD85 (International Great Lakes Datum of 1985), combined with June air temperatures > 18.6A degrees C. For yellow perch, water temperatures > 16.2A degrees C in June alone explained six out of the eight best recruitment years in the time series. Conversely, an episode of massive carp mortality in 2001 exemplifies the inherent risk of using shallow flooded habitats for spawning when rapidly dropping levels coincide with hot, sunny weather. The effects of water temperature and level, singly and in combination, thus appear to be critical variables in determining successful fish recruitment in shallow riparian areas-areas which constitute the most important yet the most elusive fish spawning and nursery habitats.

Movements of Wild Ruddy Shelducks in the Central Asian Flyway and Their Spatial Relationship to Outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1	VIRUSES-BASEL												Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 remains a serious concern for both poultry and human health. Wild waterfowl are considered to be the reservoir for low pathogenic avian influenza viruses; however, relatively little is known about their movement ecology in regions where HPAI H5N1 outbreaks regularly occur. We studied movements of the ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea), a wild migratory waterfowl species that was infected in the 2005 Qinghai Lake outbreak. We defined their migration with Brownian Bridge utilization distribution models and their breeding and wintering grounds with fixed kernel home ranges. We correlated their movements with HPAI H5N1 outbreaks, poultry density, land cover, and latitude in the Central Asian Flyway. Our Akaike Information Criterion analysis indicated that outbreaks were correlated with land cover, latitude, and poultry density. Although shelduck movements were included in the top two models, they were not a top parameter selected in AICc stepwise regression results. However, timing of outbreaks suggested that outbreaks in the flyway began during the winter in poultry with spillover to wild birds during the spring migration. Thus, studies of the movement ecology of wild birds in areas with persistent HPAI H5N1 outbreaks may contribute to understanding their role in transmission of this disease.

J	MUSKO, IB				MUSKO, IB			THE LIFE-HISTORY OF DIKEROGAMMARUS-HAEMOBAPHES (EICHW) (CRUSTACEA, AMPHIPODA) LIVING ON MACROPHYTES IN LAKE BALATON (HUNGARY)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Dikerogammarus haemobaphes appeared and spread in Lake Balaton in the 1950s. Today this species occurs in most of the lake's habitats and plays an important role as fish food. This study describes the life history of the amphipod, which lives on a submerged macrophyte, Myriophyllum spicatum, near the Tihany peninsula. Reproduction lasts from May to the end of August. The animals hatched in May-June reproduce in the same year, while the summer-autumn generation reproduces the next year. The life span is about one year. Fecundity is highest in June. The regression of brood sizes (E) on body length in mm (L) is: E = 0.16 L2.23 (r = 0.57) The largest biomass of the amphipod was found in November, the lowest at the end of July. In July 1986, the biomass of D. haemobaphes was estimated to 0.1 g animal dry weight/m2 (563 ind./m2) in the area covered by M. spicatum.																			0003-9136					APR	1993	127	2					227	238																WOS:A1993LG24300007
J	Yoshiyama, K; Nakajima, H				Yoshiyama, K; Nakajima, H			Catastrophic transition in vertical distributions of phytoplankton: Alternative equilibria in a water column	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												We showed a catastrophic transition between a surface maximum pattern and a subsurface maximum pattern of phytoplankton in a water column by a mathematical model considering the vertical distribution of phytoplankton and two resources, light and a limiting nutrient. In our model, we assumed that a water column consists of two layers: a complete mixing layer above a seasonal thermocline and an incomplete mixing layer below it. From numerical calculation of the model, we obtained that there are two stable vertical patterns of phytoplankton over a certain range of parameters of the model: a pattern having its maximum below the thermocline and another having its maximum above the thermocline. As other models having multiple stable equilibria, our model also exhibits a hysteresis effect and catastrophic transition when one of the parameters of the model changes continuously. These results indicate the possibility of the existence of alternative equilibria of vertical patterns of phytoplankton even if the trophic status and physical condition of the water column are similar. Moreover, the catastrophic transition between the steady states suggests one of the possible mechanisms of autumn algal blooms. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We examined intra- and interspecific variation in a key life-history trait - diapause - for two congeneric copepods (Eudiaptomus gracilis and Eudiaptomus graciloides) inhabiting three lakes in Northern Germany. Diapause has been hypothesized in both theoretical and empirical studies to be important in the coexistence of competing species. We found no diapause for E. gracilis whereas we documented two distinct periods of diapause in the life cycle of E. graciloides. In the latter species, diapausing eggs were produced in all three lakes during autumn, however, relative investment in diapausing eggs differed between lakes. Diapausing egg production was delayed or fewer females switched to making diapausing eggs in the more productive lakes relative to the less productive systems. In the sediments of all three lakes, viable diapausing eggs were found buried from the sediment-water interface down several centimeters in each lake, suggesting the presence of a long-lived egg bank. In addition, detailed population studies carried out on both species in one lake (Schohsee) revealed a second period of diapause in E. graciloides. After the diapausing eggs are produced in autumn, females accumulate lipids, reduce feeding and apparently over-winter in a state of active diapause. The prevalence of diapause in E. graciloides and lack of it in E. gracilis raises questions regarding the factors that shape the life-histories of these congeners, and the role that the life-history differences observed may play in their coexistence.																			0003-9136					OCT	2000	149	3					441	458																WOS:000165691200006
J	Ross, JL; Boon, PI; Ford, P; Hart, BT				Ross, JL; Boon, PI; Ford, P; Hart, BT			Detection and quantification with 16S rRNA probes of planktonic methylotrophic bacteria in a floodplain lake	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Two approaches employing 16S rRNA oligonucleotide probes, in situ hybridization combined with P-33-autoradiography and P-32-labeled slot-blot hybridizations on nitrocellulose filters, were used to enumerate methylotrophic bacteria in the water column of Ryans 1 Billabong, a small floodplain lake in northeastern Victoria, Australia. Methylotrophic bacterioplankton numbered 0.6-1.2 x 10(9) cells liter(-1) in the winter of 1994, and 0.8-5.5 x 10(9) cells liter(-1) in the summer of 1994-95. This was equivalent to 10-46% of total bacterioplankton cell counts, determined via epifluorescence microscopy. Methylotrophic bacteria were not detected in the water column of the nearby Kiewa River, and a set of laboratory controls indicated that the high abundance of methylotrophs in the billabong samples was not a methodological artifact. There was no change, with water depth, in total bacterioplankton or methylotroph abundance in winter, a result consistent with the water column being well mixed at this time of year (dissolved O-2 concentrations 5-7 mg liter(-1); dissolved methane concentrations < 60 mu g liter(-1), or < 5% methane saturation, at all depths). In summer the billabong became diurnally stratified (dissolved O-2 concentrations < 2 mg liter(-1) at water depths of > 45 cm; dissolved methane concentrations < 100 mu g liter(-1) at the surface, but > 500 mu g liter(-1) near the sediments) and there was a correspondingly marked increase in the abundance of total bacterioplankton and methylotrophs with depth. In situ hybridizations and slot-blot hybridizations both indicated that type II methylotrophs (detected with a probe specific for the 9-alpha subgroup of Proteobacteria) were markedly less abundant than were type I and X methylotrophs (detected with a probe specific for the 10-gamma subgroup of Proteobacteria).

Previous works focused on spatiotemporal characteristics of a region as a whole but left the influence of associated physical factors on sub-regions unexplored. Based on the precipitation data of 77 meteorological stations in the Poyang Lake basin (PYLB) from 1959 to 2013, we have investigated regional characteristics of summer precipitation in the PYLB by integrating the rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) analysis with hierarchical clustering algorithm (HCA). Then the long-term variability of summer precipitation in sub-regions of the PYLB and possible links with large-scale circulations was investigated using multiple trend analyses, wavelet analysis and correlation analysis. The results indicate that summer precipitation variations in the PYLB were of very striking regional characteristics. The PYLB was divided into three independent sub-regions based on two leading REOF modes and silhouette coefficient (SC). These sub-regions were located in northern PYLB (sub-region I), central PYLB (sub-region II), and southern PYLB (sub-region III). The summer precipitation in different sub-regions exhibited distinct variation trends and periodicities, which was associated with different factors. All sub-regions show no trends over the whole period 1959-2013, rather they show trends in different periods. Trends per decade in annual summer precipitation in sub-region I and sub-region II were consistent for all periods with different start and end years. The oscillations periods with 2-3 years were found in summer precipitation of all the three sub-regions. Summer precipitation in sub-region I was significantly positively correlated with the previous Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) event, but negatively correlated with East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM). While summer precipitation in sub-region II and sub-region III showed weak teleconnections with climate indices. All of the results of this study are conducive to further understand both the regional climate variations in the PYLB and response to circulation patterns variations.					; Xu, Ligang/K-2584-2013; Jiang, Mingliang/GXG-4039-2022; Fan, Hongxiang/AAC-7159-2022	Zhu, Hua/0000-0002-0464-5792; Fan, Hongxiang/0000-0001-7626-1344; Jiang, Mingliang/0000-0002-5027-2931; 														2073-4433				OCT	2020	11	10							1033	10.3390/atmos11101033	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos11101033													WOS:000584044500001
J	Mottola, G; Kristensen, T; Anttila, K				Mottola, Giovanna; Kristensen, Torstein; Anttila, Katja			Compromised thermal tolerance of cardiovascular capacity in upstream migrating Arctic char and brown trout-are hot summers threatening migrating salmonids?	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY												Heat waves are threatening fish around the world, leading sometimes to mass mortality events. One crucial function of fish failing in high temperatures is oxygen delivery capacity, i.e. cardiovascular function. For anadromous salmonids, increased temperature could be especially detrimental during upstream migration since they need efficiently working oxygen delivery system in order to cross the river rapids to reach upstream areas. The migration also occurs during summer and early autumn exposing salmonids to peak water temperatures, and in shallow rivers there is little availability for thermal refuges as compared to thermally stratified coastal and lake habitats. In order to shed light on the mechanisms underpinning the capacity of migrating fish to face high environmental temperatures, we applied a physiological and molecular approach measuring cardiovascular capacities of migrating and resident Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in Northern Norway. The maximum cardiovascular capacity of migrating fish was significantly lower compared to the resident conspecifics. The onset of cardiac impairment started only 2 degrees C higher than river temperature, meaning that even a small increase in water temperature may already compromise cardiac function. The migrating fish were also under significant cellular stress, expressing increased level of cardiac heat shock proteins. We consider these findings highly valuable when addressing climate change effect on migrating fish and encourage taking action in riverine habitat conservation policies. The significant differences in upper thermal tolerance of resident and migrating fish could also lead changes in population dynamics, which should be taken into account in future conservation plans.

J	Jensen, TC				Jensen, Thomas C.			Winter decrease of zooplankton abundance and biomass in subalpine oligotrophic Lake Atnsjoen (SE Norway)	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Despite the rapidly changing winter conditions in temperate ecosystems, little attention has been devoted to the effects of these changes on lake ecology. Few studies on the seasonal changes in abundance and biomass of the major groups of the metazooplankton community (i.e,. rotifers, cladocerans and copepods) in northern oligotrophic lakes include data from the ice-covered winter months. This study reports monthly variation in zooplankton abundance and biomass from June 2010 to October 2011, including winter, in an oligotrophic, subalpine lake in southeastern Norway (Lake Atnsjoen). Changes in rotifer, cladoceran, copepod, and total zooplankton abundances and biomass were related to seasonal variation in water temperature and phytoplankton biomass by means of ordination analysis. The zooplankton abundance and biomass were much lower in winter than during the open water season. However, an underice phytoplankton bloom occurred during the final winter months, when snow cover and ice thickness were reduced and (presumably) light penetration increased, leading to an increase in abundance of copepod nauplii. Winter zooplankton abundance was dominated by copepods and rotifers, while winter zooplankton biomass was dominated by copepods and cladocerans. Both phytoplankton and zooplankton had two biomass peaks in 2010 and one peak in 2011. Rotifers dominated zooplankton abundance with a peak in August and total zooplankton abundance followed a similar pattern. In contrast, cladocerans dominated zooplankton biomass with a peak in July and total zooplankton biomass also peaked at this time. Rotifer and total zooplankton abundance and rotifer biomass were most closely correlated to water temperature. However, cladoceran biomass and total biomass were most closely correlated with phytoplankton biomass, but also appeared to be dependent on other carbon sources. Estimates of non-phytoplankton particulate organic carbon indicated that this part of the carbon pool could be an additional food source for zooplankton particularly in early and mid-winter. The longer growing season in 2011 than in 2010, owing to earlier ice-off in 2011, may have contributed to higher phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass in 2011. With climate warming, this is an expected change in temperate lake ecosystems.

Geo- and biogeochemical processes in a heliothermal hypersaline lake	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Water chemical variations were investigated over three annual hydrologic cycles in hypersaline, heliothermal, meromictic Hot Lake in north-central Washington State, USA. The lake contains diverse biota with dramatic zonation related to salinity and redox state. Water samples were collected at 10-cm depth intervals through the shallow lake (2.4 m) during 2012-2014, with comprehensive monitoring performed in 2013. Inorganic salt species, dissolved carbon forms (DOC, DIC), oxygen, sulfide, and methane were analyzed in lake water samples. Depth sonde measurements of pH and temperature were also performed to track their seasonal variations. A bathymetric survey of the lake was conducted to enable lake water volume and solute inventory calculations. Sediment cores were collected at low water and analyzed by X-ray diffraction to investigate sediment mineralogy. The primary dissolved salt in Hot Lake water was Mg2+-SO42- whereas sediments were dominated by gypsum (CaSO4 center dot 2H(2)O). Lake water concentrations increased with depth, reaching saturation with epsomite (MgSO4 center dot 7H(2)O) that was exposed at lake bottom. At maximum volume in spring, Hot Lake exhibited a relatively dilute mixolimnion; a lower saline metalimnion with stratified oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthetic microbiological communities; and a stable, hypersaline monimolimnion, separated from above layers by a chemocline, containing high levels of sulfide and methane. The thickness of the mixolimnion regulates a heliothermal effect that creates temperatures in excess of 60 degrees C in the underlying metalimnion and monimolimnion. The mixolimnion was dynamic in volume and actively mixed. It displayed large pH variations, in-situ calcium carbonate precipitation, and large evaporative volume losses. The depletion of this layer by fall allowed deeper mixing into the metalimnion, more rapid heat exchange, and lower winter lake temperatures. Solubility calculations indicate seasonal biogenic and thermogenic aragonite precipitation in the mixolimnion and metalimnion, but the absence of calcareous sediments at depth suggests dissolution and recycling during winter months. Dissolved carbon concentrations [dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)] increased with depth, reaching similar to 0.04 mol/L at the metalimnion-monimolimnion boundary. DIC concentrations were seasonally variable in the mixolimnion and metalimnion, and were influenced by calcium carbonate precipitation. DOC concentrations mimicked those of conservative salts (e.g., Na+-Cl-) in the mixolimnion and metalimnion, but decreased in the monimolimnion where mass loss by anaerobic microbial processes is implied. Biogenic reduced solutes originating in monimolimnion (H2S and CH4) were biologically oxidized in the metalimnion as they were not observed in more shallow lake waters. Multi-year solute inventory calculations indicated that Hot Lake is a stable, albeit seasonally and annually dynamic feature, with inorganic solutes cycled between lake waters and sediments depending on annual recharge, temperature, and lake water dilution state. With its extreme geochemical and thermal regime, Hot Lake functions as analog of early earth and extraterrestrial life environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We focused on surface air temperature, precipitation, seasonal snow cover, mountain glaciers, permafrost, freshwater ice cover, lakes, streamflow, and biological system changes. TP is getting warmer and wetter, and air temperature has increased significantly, particularly since the 1980s. Most significant warming trends have occurred in the northern TP. Slight increases in precipitation have occurred over the entire TP with clear spatial variability. Intensification of surface air temperature is associated with variation in precipitation and decreases in snow cover depth, spatial extent, and persistence. Rising surface temperatures have caused recession of glaciers, permafrost thawing, and thickening of the active layers over the permafrost. Changing temperatures, precipitation, and other climate system components have also affected the TP biological system. In addition, elevation-dependent changes in air temperature, wind speed, and summer precipitation have occurred in the TP and its surroundings in the past three decades. Before projecting multifaceted interactions and process responses to future climate change, further quantitative analysis and understanding of the change mechanisms is required.

Glyptotendipes paripes Edwards and Chironomus decorus Johannsen in the reservoir, and G. paripes and C. crassicaudatus Malloch in the lake, were quantitatively important and emerged on a daily basis at 18.5.degree.-30.0.degree. C water temperatures. Trends of adult emergence of all species in relation to Julian day were inconsistent. Some significant autocorrelations and standard correlations existed, but all the correlation coefficient values were < 0.66. Oviposition in central Florida lakes probably takes place almost on a daily basis at 18.0.degree.-30.0.degree.

J	DEKKER, D				DEKKER, D			PEREGRINE FALCON AND MERLIN PREDATION ON SMALL SHOREBIRDS AND PASSERINES IN ALBERTA	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												This study describes and compares hunting techniques and predatory efficiency of peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus) and merlin (Falco columbarius) preying on small shorebirds and passerines in open agricultural lands around Beaverhills Lake, Alberta, during spring and fall, 1965-1987. Hunting methods were divided into four categories: (i) surprise attacks with less than six swoops at prey initially on the ground, (ii) short pursuits with less than six swoops at flying prey, (iii) persistent, long-range pursuits wiht more than six swoops, and (iv) other or unknonw methods. They made up, respectively, 73.9, 17.2, 2.5, and 6.4% of 647 hunts by peregrines, and 72.3, 16.1, 4.5, and 7.1% of 354 hunts by merlins. Persistent pursuits of prey were significantly more successful than surprise attacks by merlins (62.5 vs. 9.4%, P < 0.00001), but not by peregrines (18.8 vs. 8.8%, P = 0.40). I postulate that peregrines and merlins employ persistent hunting techniques only it surprise attacks are unproductive because of (i) lack of expertise of the falcon, (ii) scarcity of prey, (iii) unsuitable habitat, and (iv) effective early warning by flocking prey. Peregrines captured 50 shorebirds of 11 species, and 3 passerines of 2 species. Merlins captured 28 shorebirds of 8 species, and 16 passerines of 5 species. Adult male merlins were significantly more successful than immatures and adult females combined (38.7 vs. 9.1%, P < 0.00001). Adult peregrines were not significantly more successful than either spring or fall immatures (9.2 vs. 7.2 and 4.9%, P = 0.21, P = 0.24, respectively). Merlins were significantly more successful than peregrines in hunting small passerines (12.2 vs. 3.8%, P = 0.04), but not significantly more successful in hunting small shorebirds (12.6 vs. 8.8%, P = 0.10).																			0008-4301	1480-3283				APR	1988	66	4					925	928		10.1139/z88-136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z88-136													WOS:A1988N568000022
J	Goedkoop, W; Pettersson, K				Goedkoop, W; Pettersson, K			Seasonal changes in sediment phosphorus forms in relation to sedimentation and benthic bacterial biomass in Lake Erken	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Surficial sediment and sedimenting material were sampled during spring and summer 1991 in Lake Erken. Sediment was analyzed for redox potential, P concentrations and bacterial biomass. Sedimentation and chlorophyll a concentrations of sedimenting matter were determined. Additionally, different phosphorus forms in surficial sediment were quantified using sequential fractionation. The resulting dataset was used to study the effects of sedimentation events following phytoplankton blooms and benthic bacterial biomass on the size of the various phosphorus pools in the sediment. Sedimentation of spring diatoms caused a rapid increase in the NH4Cl- and NaOH-extractable P (NH4Cl-P and NaOH-rP) in the sediment. During sedimentation, NaOH-rP and NH4Cl-P increased within 3 days from 422 +/- 17 mu g g(-1) DW to 537 +/- 8.0 mu g g(-1) DW and from 113 +/- 13 mu g g(-1) DW to 186 +/- 26 mu g g(-1) DW, respectively. The NaOH-nrP (non-reactive P) fraction made up about 17% of Tot-P in sediment samples, whereas NaOH-rP and HCl-P made up 25% each. All P forms showed considerable seasonal variation. Significant relationships were found between bacterial biomass and the NaOH-nrP and NH4Cl-P fractions in the sediment, respectively. Also regressions of NaOH-nrP and NH4Cl-P versus the chlorophyll a concentration of sedimenting matter were highly significant. These regressions lend support to the conjecture that NaOH-nrP is a conservative measure of bacterial poly-P.

J	Bisping, SM; Alfermann, TJ; Strickland, PA				Bisping, Scott M.; Alfermann, Ted J.; Strickland, Patrick A.			Population Characteristics of Yellow Perch in Dead Lake, Florida	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												In Florida, the Yellow Perch Perca flavescens is known to exist only in the Apalachicola River watershed. We conducted a 2-y study (2015-2016) to assess population characteristics of Yellow Perch in Dead Lake, Florida. We also measured summertime (June-September 2016) water temperatures to identify temperature differences between two sections (West Arm Creek and the main pool) of Dead Lake. Using electrofishing, we collected 564 Yellow Perch ranging from 72 to 343 mm total length from West Arm Creek. An age sample showed Yellow Perch ranged in age from 0 to 6 y and strong year classes were produced in 2013 and 2015. High mean total length at age suggests Yellow Perch in Dead Lake are a fast-growing population, likely a result of limited abundance and a long growing season. This study showed low mean relative weight (Wr, 2015: 70; 2016: 67), which is similar to other southeastern populations. Stomach contents and diet analysis showed no differences between age groups, which suggests that Yellow Perch are opportunistic feeders. Dead Lake showed high water temperatures (>= 28 degrees C) during the summer months, but the spring-fed Stone Mill Creek may provide thermal refugia that allow fish to avoid stressful temperatures in the main pool of Dead Lake in summer. Limited awareness among anglers, coupled with low abundance and the fish's limited range in the state, likely contributes to the lack of exploitation of Yellow Perch in Florida.																			1944-687X					DEC	2019	10	2					296	303		10.3996/082018-JFWM-068	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/082018-JFWM-068													WOS:000503423500001

The succession consists of 1.15 m-thick organic-rich shales hosting abundant and diverse fossil specimens from terrestrial and marine origin, representing the Pennsylvanian-Permian of the Paran & aacute; Basin, southern Brazil. Most studies about the LSL focused on the paleontological content, whereas the depositional setting has been over debate, and the diagenetic history stands underexplored. Petrographic, organic and inorganic geochemical approaches were applied in the reconstruction of the organic matter sources, paleoenvironment and diagenetic evolution of the LSL. The Lagerst & auml;tte is composed of structureless to laminated mudstones, with increasing amounts of phytoclasts and siliciclastic grains upsection. Silica cement, biostructured organic matter and sphere-shaped microfossils occur at the lowermost level. SEM/EDS imaging reveals soft tissues, smectite flakes, framboidal pyrite, euhedral sanidine and authigenic chlorite rosettes. delta C-13(VPDB) values range between - 26.76 +/- 0.14 parts per thousand and - 24.39 +/- 0.13 parts per thousand, whereas kerogen type II predominates, and kerogen type III only occurs in the topmost level. Petrographic and geochemical data demonstrate mixed terrestrial and marine contributions of organic matter. Paleoredox proxies depict anoxic-dysoxic conditions, whereas paleosalinity proxies constrain brackish conditions (TS/TOC < 0.5). Limited stratigraphic and geographic distribution of the LSL, mixed fossil assemblages and geochemical signatures indicate accumulation in a restricted marine setting. Deglaciation-induced meltwaters caused seasonal inputs of nutrients and sporadic oxygen renewal during summer/spring periods. Conversely, winter periods experienced scarcer inflows, resulting in a shallow halocline, anoxia-euxinia and mass mortality events. Undeformed grains, immature kerogen, vitrinite reflectance (0.48-0.58 %), and peak temperatures (421-432 degrees C) demonstrate shallow burial, coherent with the immature thermal zone. Chlorite rosettes and euhedral sanidine precipitated during mesodiagenesis, after increasing burial depths. Coincidental distribution of microfossils, biostructured organic matter and eodiagenetic silica suggest bioinduced silicification, revealing a new taphonomic pathway to the LSL.					; Cardoso, Alexandre/JHU-4670-2023; Vecchia, Felipe/ABB-4846-2020; Weinschutz, Luiz/LZI-1619-2025	Schmidt, Jaques/0000-0002-0869-4532; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				FEB 1	2025	659								112661	10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112661	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112661		DEC 2024											WOS:001384890600001

It is generally believed that the vast majority of VOSCs are released from the ocean. However, due to the pervasive eutrophication and pollution of inland waters, the VOSC production and emission in rivers, lakes and reservoirs are attracting more attention. In this study, the temporal and spatial distributions of three VOSCs, including methanethiol, Dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide in Yangcheng Lake, a eutrophic shallow lake, are investigated monthly and seasonally. Results show that VOSCs are higher in summer and autumn, with the western region as a hotspot. Our results show a positive correlation between VOSC and phytoplankton biomass (p < 0.05). Interestingly, from algal phylum composition, all the phylum, except those with low biomass, played a positive effect on VOSCs' concentration. We did not find any specific phylum or species of cyanobacteria that contributed solely to the VOSCs. The water-air effluxes of Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) are estimated by a stagnant film model. The DMS effluxes from Yangcheng Lakes were higher than deep lakes and similar to the ocean, indicating that VOSCs, particularly DMS, in those eutrophic shallow lakes were non-negligible.

This was done by comparing the input of atmospheric deposition of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) and PCBs with the amounts exported to surface waters. Two types of deposition samplers were used, equipped with a glass fibre thimble and an Amberlite sampler respectively. The measured fluxes showed clear seasonality, with most of the input and export occurring during winter and spring flood, respectively. The mass balance calculations indicates that the boreal landscape is an effective sink for PCDD/Fs and PCBs, as 96.0-99.9 % of received bulk deposition was retained, suggesting that organic pollutants will continue to impact stream water in the region for an extended period of time.

This preliminary study aimed to investigate the short- and long-term effects of remedial dredging on metal contamination, dredging efficacy and ecological status of the Lower Passaic River. To accomplish this, pre- and post-dredging data were statistically analyzed and evaluated using geochemical indices. Short-term results showed effective heavy metal reduction although their concentrations became elevated in water column, increasing bioaccumulation risk in aquatic biota. On the long-term, metal concentrations increased in surface sediments. Ecological assessment revealed that Cu, Hg and Pb pose greater risks while Ag remained abundant despite dredging. Further investigation suggests that post-dredging residuals, surface runoff and sewage pollution may contribute significantly to recontamination and continued pollution. Depletion in longterm dredging efficacy from spring to summer suggest that season-influenced changes in temperature, algae growth and stormwater discharge may have played a role.					; Soetan, Oluwafemi/ADA-5523-2022	Soetan, Oluwafemi/0000-0002-6928-764X; 													0025-326X	1879-3363				NOV	2022	184								114212	10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.114212	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.114212		OCT 2022						36242799					WOS:000918597700007
J	Austin, JE; Buhl, DA				Austin, Jane E.; Buhl, Deborah A.			Nest Survival of American Coots Relative to Grazing, Burning, and Water Depths	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Water and emergent vegetation are key features influencing nest site selection and success for many marsh-nesting waterbirds. Wetland management practices such as grazing, burning, and water-level manipulations directly affect these features and can influence nest survival. We used model selection and before-after-control-impact approaches to evaluate the effects of water depth and four common land-management practices or treatments, i.e., summer grazing, fall grazing, fall burning, and idle (no active treatment) on nest survival of American coots (Fulica americana) nesting at Grays Lake, a large montane wetland in southeast Idaho. The best model included the variables year x treatment, and quadratic functions of date, water depth, and nest age; height of vegetation at the nest did not improve the best model. However, results from the before-after-control-impact analysis indicate that management practices affected nest success via vegetation and involved interactions of hydrology, residual vegetation, and habitat composition. Nest success in idled fields changed little between pre- and post-treatment periods, whereas nest success declined in fields that were grazed or burned, with the most dramatic declines the year following treatments. The importance of water depth may be amplified in this wetland system because of rapid water-level withdrawal during the nesting season. Water and land-use values for area ranchers, management for nesting waterbirds, and long-term wetland function are important considerations in management of water levels and vegetation.

J	Adamec, L				Adamec, Lubomir			Biological flora of Central Europe: Aldrovanda vesiculosa L	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												Aldrovanda vesiculosa L. (Droseraceae) is a very rare and critically endangered submerged aquatic carnivorous plant with snapping traps which grows in shallow, standing dystrophic waters such as: lakes, dam reservoirs, peaty fishponds, pools in peat bogs and fens, backwater pools and oxbows in floodplains and basins of large rivers. While it covers a vast territory of four continents in the Old World across various climatic zones, its recent natural fragmentary spread includes only around 50 sites worldwide following a marked population decline during the last 150 years. The major extant world sites occur in Ukraine, Poland, Romania and W Russia. The plant exhibits a marked physiological polarity along its linear shoot with rapid apical shoot growth. Flowering and especially seed-set are rare and stimulated by high temperatures, yet the plants propagate mainly vegetatively by branching. Seeds probably form a seed bank and colonise new sites by being transferred by water birds. All temperate and some (sub)tropical populations form winter buds (turions), which sink to the bottom in autumn and actively rise to the water surface in spring. The world population of Aldrovanda is genetically rather uniform which may be caused by at least one recent bottleneck followed by long-distance dispersal by water birds combined with the founder effect, low mutation rates and dominant asexual reproduction. Aldrovanda is stenotopic and although it is relatively tolerant of many individual ecological factors, it requires an optimal combination of many ecological habitat factors and even small changes in this combination can lead to its decline or extinction. The most important ecological requirements are: high CO2 concentration in the water ( > 0.1 mM), shallow water of at least 0.1 m, habitats free of dense stands of either submerged, free-floating or emergent plants or filamentous algae, a thick layer of slowly decomposable plant litter on the bottom and abundant zooplankton as prey. The main threats to its sites are water eutrophication and water level decline. The introduction of Aldrovanda to potentially suitable sites has become an efficient way to conserve its endangered world population in Switzerland, Poland, Czech Republic, The Netherlands, Australia and Japan.																			1433-8319					DEC	2018	35						8	21		10.1016/j.ppees.2018.10.001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ppees.2018.10.001													WOS:000450897200002
J	Smith, REH; Parrish, CC; Depew, DC; Ghadouani, A				Smith, Ralph E. H.; Parrish, Christopher C.; Depew, David C.; Ghadouani, Anas			Spatial patterns of seston concentration and biochemical composition between nearshore and offshore waters of a Great Lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The concentration and composition of seston were measured in the east basin of Lake Erie (U.S.A.-Canada) to determine whether the classical patterns of nearshore versus offshore zonation considered typical of large lakes have been altered by decades of change in nutrient loading and food web structure, and to test the possibility that food quality for seston consumers, as reflected in nutrient and lipid composition, may currently be diminished. Chlorophyll-a (chl-a), particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate P, total lipid (TL), lipid classes, fatty acids and major phytoplankton groups were compared between the nearshore (< 20 m) and offshore zones in spring and early summer. 2. Particulate organic carbon, chl-a and TL concentrations were lower nearshore than offshore, which is a reversal of the classical large lake pattern but consistent with other evidence from the Great Lakes that colonization by filter-feeding dreissenid mussels can cause seston depletion in relatively shallow waters. 3. Terrestrial and bacterial fatty acid markers were slightly higher in the nearshore than the offshore, but there was little difference in nutrient, taxonomic or biochemical composition between zones otherwise. This shows a small differential influence of terrestrial and detrital inputs, and a slight shift away from phytoplankton dominance of seston composition in the nearshore, but little difference in potential food quality of seston. 4. Microscope counts, phytoplankton fluorescence, and fatty acid composition indicated succession from diatom dominance in May to dominance by cryptophyte and chromophyte flagellates in June and July. Depletion of dissolved P and Si, increased contribution of storage lipids, and changes in fatty acid composition suggested a mild degree of nutrient deficiency during this spring to summer transition. 5. Total lipids were dominated by classes typical of pigments and membranes with only moderate amounts of neutral (storage) lipids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were abundant (especially the long chain omega-3 acids) and the POC : chl-a and POC : particulate P ratios indicated P sufficiency or slight P-deficiency. Despite concerns that some important consumers in the Great Lakes food web may be suffering from diminished food quality, these results point to a generally high seston food quality even with highly abundant mussels and incipient P deficiency in the east basin of Lake Erie.					; Smith, Ralph/F-3655-2010; Ghadouani, Anas/A-2568-2008	Depew, David/0000-0003-2759-6759; Ghadouani, Anas/0000-0002-1252-4851													0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2007	52	11					2196	2210		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01848.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01848.x													WOS:000250145600011

Our aim was to explore the spatial and temporal variation in water bug assemblages among soda pans at 3 temporal scales (years, seasons, and months). Data on 9005 individuals belonging to 18 species collected in 3 seasons per year for 4 years in 5 soda pans demonstrated large interannual and seasonal fluctuations of water bugs. Two water boatman species (Paracorixa concinna,Sigara lateralis) were dominant, and species composition varied little among soda pans, seasons, or years. Species richness and abundance were influenced by interactions among soda pans, year, and season and showed cyclic changes in dry years and serial changes in wet years. Richness and abundance were highest in 2000 when water levels were high in spring and early summer. Richness was also high but abundance was lowest in 2010, a year with extremely high precipitation after a dry year. Richness and abundance peaks (individual numbers up to 2100 m(-2)) occurred in late summer, suggesting that water bugs are important in the trophic network of soda pans. Our results suggest that weather-driven extreme fluctuations in soda pans determine the spatial and temporal variation of water bug assemblages, with cycles of local extinction and recolonization maintained by good dispersal ability.

Short-term effects of summer warming on caribou forage quality are mitigated by long-term warming	ECOSPHERE												Rapid Arctic climate change is leading to woody plant-dominated ecosystems with potential consequences for caribou foraging and nutritional ecology. While warming has been clearly linked to shrub expansion, the influence of higher temperatures on variables linked to the leaf-level quality of caribou forage is equivocal. Moreover, warming results in a complex set of ecosystem changes that operate on different timescales such as not only rapidly accelerating phenology, but also slowly increasing thaw depth and plant access to soil resources. Here, we compare changes in leaf nitrogen (N) concentration, digestibility, and protein-precipitating capacity (PPC) in short-term (i.e., <1-2 summers) and long-term (approximately 25 years) experimental warming plots with ambient temperature plots for three species commonly included in caribou summer diets: Salix pulchra (diamond-leaf willow), Betula nana (dwarf birch), and Eriophorum vaginatum (cottongrass). Short-term warming modestly decreased leaf N concentration in B. nana. Long-term and short-term warming slightly increased the digestibility of S. pulchra, but only short-term warming increased digestibility in B. nana. Greater dry matter digestibility in both shrubs occurred through reductions in the lignin and cutin quantity in plant cells. Long-term warming had no impact on PPC and equivocal impact on digestible protein of B. nana. Overall, we found short-term warming to be more impactful on forage quality than long-term warming at Toolik Lake, Alaska. Apart from a long-term warming reduction of approximately 13% in acid detergent lignin in S. pulchra and B. nana, other differences were only observed in the short-term warming plots. Hence, our results indicate acclimation of plants to long-term warming or possible negative feedback in the system to reduce warming effects. We suggest that warming summers may have a lesser effect on caribou forage than changes in winter precipitation or the influence of climate change on the abundance of critical species in the caribou diet.

Study reaches spanned 2nd- to 7th-order river segments. Habitats included headwater streams, main and secondary channels, backwaters, and isolated pools. Multiple linear regression analyses extracted elevation and azimuth (aspect) out of eight geographical and environmental variables to explain average daily temperature patterns among habitats. Azimuth and, to a lesser degree, slope, depth, velocity, and canopy were primary determinants of diel temperature amplitude and maximum rates of diel heating and cooling. Within lowland floodplain reaches, the relative influence of groundwater and surface water varied substantially among habitats. Thermal variation among habitats was greatest in lowland floodplain reaches (nearly 15 degreesC difference). In summer and autumn, variation between lowland floodplain aquatic habitats exceeded thermal variation observed in the main channel along the entire river corridor (120 km; 5-1100 m above sea level). Spatiotemporal variation in temperature was greatest in lower reaches owing to the interaction of water level and connectivity of isolated water bodies. Influence of groundwater and cool-water tributaries exemplified the importance of local factors (geomorphology and hydrology) superimposed on regional factors (climate and altitude) in determining large-scale thermal patterns.					; Tockner, Klement/G-9265-2011	Arscott, David/0000-0001-5689-2587; Tockner, Klement/0000-0002-0038-8151													0706-652X					DEC	2001	58	12					2359	2373		10.1139/cjfas-58-12-2359	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-58-12-2359													WOS:000172825400006

In the present paper, a model, which was used to extract the algae information from the water body of Taihu Like using MODIS data, was established based on the sensing index and image false color composite methods. Using this model, we studied the algae explosive growth formation process between March and May in 2007. Through the analysis of the temporal and spatial distribution features of the algae outbreak between the spring and summer seasons, an early warning method of algal blooms was proposed, that is, when the MODIS green index mainly concentrated in the range between 0. 6 and 0. 8, the water body of Taihu Lake can be considered to have been in the early alarming stage of algal blooms.

However, there is a lack of research on the seasonal variation in lake water microorganisms in cold environments. In this study, 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing was used to explore the microbial community and its influencing factors in Hulun Lake water during different seasons. The results showed that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the most important phyla in the microbial community of Hulun Lake, but they had significant seasonal differences in their distribution. In addition, significant seasonal differences were observed in the alpha diversity of microorganisms, with bacterial diversity being higher in winter than in summer. Changes in environmental variables were significantly correlated with changes in the microbial community, and the rapid changes in temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen are potentially the major factors influencing seasonal bacterial diversity trends. The findings of the present study enhance our understanding of the microbial communities in alpine lake ecosystems and are of great significance for the management and protection of lake ecosystems.

Insolation minima at about 3.9, 3.8 and 3.7 Ma, which were obliquity-related, may have triggered Milankovitch-type climatic oscillations characterized by orbital cycles (with periodic major Northern Hemisphere ice sheets). Intensification of these oscillations at about 2.8 Ma was probably connected to another decrease in insolation (i.e. another obliquity-related insolation minima), and seemingly triggered larger oscillations in the prevailing climatic regime of the late Pliocene and Pleistocene.

Vernal alfalfa was established on a low K Plano silt loam (Typic Argiudoll) soil and topdressed with O, 22,4 and 44.8 kg/ha of P in autumn of seeding year and with 0, 224, and 672 kg/ha of K as KCl each autumn. The harvest schedule was 3 cuts annually at 1st flower; a schedule widely recommended in the North Lake states (USA). No statistical significance was found for P levels nor for the P .times. K interaction; significance was found only for K levels. Maximum herbage yield was obtained with 224 kg/ha of K in the 1st harvest year, but with the 672 kg/ha of K rate in the 2nd harvest year. Herbage K and Cl percentages and amounts removed from the soil increased significantly each year with each increase in K applied. Herbage P and N percentages were decreased significantly with the 1st increment of K. Residual herbage yields showed dramatically the influence of K fertilization on winter survival. All alfalfa stands with no K fertilization were killed completely. Residual yields and stands increased with each increase in K applied. Yield increase over the control was significant only with the 2nd increment of K, while stands increased significantly with each increase in K, while stands increased significantly with each increase in K applied. These data continue to confirm that high levels of soil K are needed for stand survival as well as for high herbage yields.																			0010-3624	1532-2416					1979	10	3					531	543		10.1080/00103627909366916	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103627909366916													WOS:A1979GK61500004

Adaptation to changing water resources in the Ganges basin, northern India	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY												An ensemble of regional climate model (RCM) runs from the EU HighNoon project are used to project future air temperatures and precipitation on a 25 km grid for the Ganges basin in northern India, with a view to assessing impact of climate change on water resources and determining what multi-sector adaptation measures and policies might be adopted at different spatial scales. The RCM results suggest an increase in mean annual temperature, averaged over the Ganges basin, in the range 1-4 degrees C over the period from 2000 to 2050, using the SRES A1B forcing scenario. Projections of precipitation indicate that natural variability dominates the climate change signal and there is considerable uncertainty concerning change in regional annual mean precipitation by 2050. The RCMs do suggest an increase in annual mean precipitation in this region to 2050, but lack significant trend. Glaciers in headwater tributary basins of the Ganges appear to be continuing to decline but it is not clear whether meltwater runoff continues to increase. The predicted changes in precipitation and temperature will probably not lead to significant increase in water availability to 2050, but the timing of runoff from snowmelt will likely occur earlier in spring and summer. Water availability is subject to decadal variability, with much uncertainty in the contribution from climate change. Although global social-economic scenarios show trends to urbanization, locally these trends are less evident and in some districts rural population is increasing. Falling ground-water levels in the Ganges plain may prevent expansion of irrigated areas for food supply. Changes in socio-economic development in combination with projected changes in timing of runoff outside the monsoon period will make difficult choices for water managers. Because of the uncertainty in future water availability trends, decreasing vulnerability by augmenting resilience is the preferred way to adapt to climate change. Adaptive policies are required to increase society's capacity to adapt to both anticipated and unanticipated conditions. Integrated solutions are needed, consistent at various spatial scales, to assure robust and sustainable future use of resources. For water resources this is at the river basin scale. At present adaptation measures in India are planned at national and state level, not taking into account the physical boundaries of water systems. To increase resilience adaptation plans should be made locally specific. However, as it is expected that the partitioning of water over the different sectors and regions will be the biggest constraint, a consistent water use plan at catchment and river basin scale may be the best solution. A policy enabling such river basin planning is essential. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: On the basis of the predictive data on changes of water level and sediment in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River after the dam construction provided by the Yangtze River Committee on Water Conservancy. corresponding data were collected and analyzed. In order to understand the effects of changes of water level and sediment on Oncomelania hupensis, the intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum, field surveys and ecologically intimated experiments were done. The prevalence status and factors related to transmission were investigated by epidemiology, medical geography and public health. Results: Positive impact on control of schistosomiasis is that floods in the Yangtze River will occur less and will decrease the dispersal of snails and the chances of infection for humans and animals as well. Snail habitats' beach will be reduced in the flushed area along the Yangtze River. Exploitation of beach and elimination of snails will benefit from the beach's uplift in flushed area. The floods ahead of time in autumn will interfere with the development of snails. Negative impact is that the flushed beaches and migratory settlements at certain altitude may become snail habitats. So the reservoir area will be a potential transmission area of schistosomiasis due to dispersal of infectious resources and Oncomelania snails. The uprising of the water body level may cause the expending of the snail habitats in some places of Jianghan plain during the transition of spring to summer. The destruction of the embankments of the Dongting Lake will be put off by its delayed flush, which causes the beach in a situation of growing reed-grass or grass for a long time that benefits the reproduction of the snails. The chances for schistosome infection to humans and animals will be on the increase, because the water regression occurs ahead of time in the Dongting Lake beach in autumn. The distribution of snails will not be affected by the changes of water level in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River after the dam is built, but the flushed section in Anhui in the recent 80 years are suitable for the snails' development. The environmental changes due to dam construction will not obviously affect the development of snails and the transmission of schistosomiasis in the Poyang Lake area. Conclusion: The construction of the huge dam and the formation of the Three Gorge Reservoir on the Yangtze River may have both positive and negative impact on schistosomiasis transmission and control. Great effort must be made to decrease the negative impact to avoid or, at least, to decrease S. japonicum transmission. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This is also the case in shallow dimictic Lake Tegel, located in the city area of Berlin, Germany. Here, drinking water is produced via bank filtration and artificial groundwater recharge, and concurrently, a substantial anthropogenic load takes place by micro-pollutants from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The measured mean daily loads of 260 g d(-1) carbamazepine, 180 g d(-1) diclofenac and 60 g d(-1) sulfamethoxazole results in the highest so far reported concentrations from natural waters, which are used as a drinking water resource. In the present study the spatial horizontal and vertical distribution and elimination of these three pharmaceuticals are quantified with the help of high-resolution sampling in Lake Tegel and its entire major in- and outflows. Monthly mass balances are modelled and substance-specific zero-order elimination rates are derived. Diclofenac showed the strongest elimination and revealed a significant seasonality with 50 % elimination in winter, and 95 % in summer. Elimination of carbamazepine was about 40 %; sulfamethoxazole did not degrade at determinable rates. Based on a basic plug-flow approach, a pseudo first-order elimination rate for diclofenac in summer (0.058 d(-1), half-life 12 days) was calculated from horizontal concentration gradient. Apart from presenting the current state of pharmaceuticals pollution in Lake Tegel, results demonstrate the importance of lake-specific mechanisms, such as inflow-outflow balances and seasonal density stratification for the transport of micro-pollutants.

J	Rech, JA; Quade, J; Betancourt, JL				Rech, JA; Quade, J; Betancourt, JL			Late Quaternary paleohydrology of the central Atacama Desert (lat 22°-24°S), Chile	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												In northern Chile, precipitation in the High Andes (>3500 m) recharges groundwater systems that flow down the Pacific slope and feed large aquifers in the hyperarid Atacama Desert. Wetlands, which are often found along the base of the Andes, mark locations where the water table intersects the land surface. At these locations, paleo-wetland deposits, which are present as terraces between 3 and 20 m above modern wetlands, record past water-table heights along the Andean front and are used to reconstruct changes in groundwater discharge. Paleo-wetland deposits in the central Atacama Desert (lat 22degrees-24degreesS) record an episode (>15.4-9 ka) of high water tables followed by an episode (18-3 ka) of moderately high water tables. Elevated water tables result from increased groundwater discharge and ultimately from enhanced recharge in the Andes. The concordance of results from three separate hydrologic systems suggests that changes in groundwater discharge and recharge are regional and reflect climatic fluctuations. This interpretation is supported by close agreement with other paleoclimatic records in the region. The periods of greater groundwater discharge were separated by episodes (9-8 and 3-0 ka) of significant groundwater lowering and stream incision, implying greatly diminished discharge. The central Atacama and Andes (lat 22degrees24degreesS) receive precipitation mainly from moist air masses transported from the Amazon Basin by the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM). Increases in groundwater recharge are therefore thought to reflect an increase in the frequency and/or moisture content or SASM air masses crossing the Andes. Fluctuations in SASM precipitation have previously been linked to summer insolation in the Southern Hemisphere. The wettest period in the central Atacama (>15.4-9 ka), however, coincides with a minimum in austral-summer insolation at 10 ka, suggesting that regional summer insolation is not a dominant influence on the SASM. Instead, intensification of the SASM may be linked to extraregional forcings, such as the Walker Circulation.

Field experiments conducted in Lake Wawasee in 1995 and 1996 measured the response of shell growth of Dreissena polymorpha to environmental gradients. 2. Shell growth decreased with initial shell length in four mussel size classes ranging between 8 and 22 mm, and decreased with depth, with mussels in shallow water ( <4 m) having growth rates nearly twice those of mussels in deeper water (4-7 m). 3. Growth occurred early in the spring-summer period (May-Tune) with relatively little shell added later in the summer (July-September), and varied significantly among sites within Lake Wawasee, but not between the 2 years of this study. 4. Rank order of sites was consistent for both years implying that environmental conditions responsible for variation in shell growth were stable within Lake Wawasee. 5. Cage design did not have a significant effect on mussel shell growth nor did the distance of growth cages above the bottom (0.5-0.75 m above the bottom versus directly on the bottom). 6. This study demonstrates the sensitivity of adult mussel growth to subtle variation in environmental conditions occurring within and among lakes, with potential consequences for mussel population dynamics and community structure and function.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2000	45	4					443	451		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00641.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00641.x													WOS:000166523700006
J	Koue, J				Koue, Jinichi			EFFECTS OF STRONG WINDS ON THE BOTTOM LAYER DURING THE WEAK STRATIFICATION PERIOD IN LAKE BIWA, JAPAN br	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE												In recent years, a decrease in dissolved oxygen in the lake bottom has been observed in the northern part of Lake Biwa, the largest freshwater lake in Japan. The main physical controlling factor is considered to be changes in stratification, which are influenced by weather and climatic conditions. As atmospheric temperature increases, lake surface temperature rises, and stratification is formed. The strength of stratification has a significant impact on the transport of various material cycles, such as dissolved oxygen and nutrients, from the lake surface to the bottom layer. Therefore, in this study, the analysis of the effect of strong winds during the stratification collapse period (autumn) on the stratification structure of Lake Biwa was performed. Baseline simulations using actual meteorological data and experimental simulations using meteorological data with modified wind speed and direction were conducted. The numerical experiments showed that collapse of stratification was more likely to occur in autumn than in summer, and vertical mixing was enhanced. When strong winds blew more in one direction, vertical mixing was further enhanced when the duration of strong winds was longer during periods of weak stratification, as well as the results during the stratification period. When winds of the same magnitude as during the stratification period blew during periods of decreasing water temperature, a decrease in bottom water temperature was observed prior to the full-layer circulation in the following year. This suggested that strong winds during the decreasing temperature period had a strong influence on the water temperature environment next year.

This has caused a shift from mesotrophic to hypertrophic conditions, symptomized by harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CyanoHABs). The relationships between phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll a (Chla) and nutrients as total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were analyzed using historical data from 1992 to 2012 to link the response of CyanoHAB potential to long-term nutrient changes. Over the twenty year study period, annual mean Chla showed significantly positive correlations with both annual mean TN and TP (P < 0.001), reflecting a strong phytoplankton biomass response to changes in nutrient inputs to the lake. However, phytoplankton biomass responded slowly to annual changes in TN after 2002. There was not a well-defined or significant relationship between spring TN and summertime Chla. The loss of a significant fraction of spring N loading due to denitrification likely weakened this relationship. Bioavailability of both N and P during the summer plays a key role in sustaining cyanobacterial blooms. The frequency of occurrence of bloom level Chla (>20 mu g L-1) was compared to TN and TP to determine nutrient-bloom thresholds. A decline in bloom risk is expected if TN remains below 1.0 mg L-1 and TP below 0.08 mg L-1.					xu, hai/JEP-5422-2023; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013; Paerl, Hans/ACA-9911-2022														0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2017	787	1					229	242		10.1007/s10750-016-2967-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-016-2967-4													WOS:000390139200016
J	Schmieder, K; Werner, S; Bauer, HG				Schmieder, K; Werner, S; Bauer, HG			Submersed macrophytes as a food source for wintering waterbirds at Lake Constance	AQUATIC BOTANY												We investigated the relationship between Charophytes and herbivorous waterbirds in the littoral zone of Lake Constance by quantifying their seasonal dynamics. The waterfowl extensively consumed Charophyte vegetation in shallower areas (< 1 in water depth) at the beginning of the winter season, while deeper regions were only used in late winter. By the end of winter, the waterfowl had almost completely depleted the available Charophyte biomass down to a water depth of approximately 2 in (relative to average mean water level (AML)). Enclosure experiments revealed that senescence processes had a negligible influence on Charophytes biomass loss until early February. Coot, Red-crested Pochard and Pochard are the main avian Chara consumers in winter. Despite their great influence on biomass in winter, their influence on subsequent Charophyte regeneration is probably limited in Lake Constance, since Charophytes as typical pioneer species produce innumerable diaspores forming dense Charophyte meadows at a depth of between 1 and 4 in every year.

All materials controlled vegetation the 1st yr. They then accumulated sediments and wre invaded by rooted plants. The blankets could not be easily removed or cleaned in the lake. New blankets would have to be added each year to control macrophytes. The screens were easily removed. When cleaned each year, the screens prevented new growth in spring and eliminated growing plants in summer. Few plants grew back 1 to 2 mo. after removing the screens. Most benthos, however, were eliminated beneath the screens. For opening boat lanes across plant beds and controlling plants along shore, removable screens can be a useful technique.																			0146-6623						1983	21	2					73	77																WOS:A1983RP54400007

In eutrophic shallow lakes, the increased algal production may also augment the abundance of deposit-feeding tubificid worms and thereby sediment resuspension and non-algal turbidity. However, few studies have explored the effects of high N loading on this benthic process in eutrophic shallow lakes. Here, we conducted an outdoor mesocosm experiment in a summer-winter season (177 days) on the shore of subtropical Lake Taihu, China. Each mesocosm contained a 10 cm layer of lake sediment and 450 L of lake water. Nitrate was added weekly to three of the mesocosms, while another three functioned as controls. Our results showed that N addition significantly increased algal particles as water chlorophyll a (Chl-a) increased significantly following N addition. Moreover, significantly higher levels of inorganic suspended solids (ISS) were observed in the mesocosms with added N, indicating elevation of non-algal turbidity as well by the N addition. We attribute the latter to increased sediment resuspension as the abundance of tubificid worms was significantly higher in the N addition mesocosms. Accordingly, our study indicates that high N loading in subtropical shallow lakes may boost both algal and non-algal turbidity in part via benthic-pelagic coupling processes. Our results suggest that alleviation of eutrophication in shallow eutrophic lakes may require a strategic approach to adequately control both N and phosphorus.

Microbial Concentrations in Sand and their Effect on Beach Water in Door County, Wisconsin	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The seasonal variations and patterns of Escherichia coli in Wisconsin's coastal waters have been closely studied in recent years due to increased beach monitoring activities. Patterns of distribution of the indicator organism, E. coli, in the sand at these beaches are now being investigated as a source of E. coli to adjacent beach water. This project investigates the concentrations of E. coli in beach sand, and the relationship between these sand-microbe concentrations and concentrations of microbes in the corresponding beach water. Weekly sampling of upshore, swash, and submerged sand at six beaches provided numbers of the indicator bacteria in each beach's sand substrate for two consecutive summers. Overall concentrations of E. coli were highest in the swash sand of the beach, with the highest numbers seen in the summer months and lowest numbers in the winter months. Each location had very different concentrations of E. coli in the beach sand from 1,800 CFU/100 g to 21,670 CFU/100 g sand. Each location had a very different relationship between the indicator organism found in the beach sand and that,found in the beach water. These data suggest that sand may be a reservoir for E. coli at some locations, and another source of contamination that should be considered in beach monitoring programs. However, elevated levels of E. coli in beach sand were not universal and varied greatly from location to location.																			0380-1330					SEP	2008	34	3					524	534		10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[524:MCISAT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2008)34[524:MCISAT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000259885100012

Environmental and ecological conditions surrounding the production of large year classes of walleye (Sander vitreus) in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Saginaw Bay walleye population (Sander vitreus) has notfidly recoveredfron? a collapse that began in the 1940s and has been dependent on stocking with only limited natural reproduction. Beginning in 2003, and through at least 2005, reproductive success of walleye surged to unprecedented levels. The increase was concurrent with ecological changes in Lake Huron and we sought to quantitatively model which factors most influenced this new dynamic. We developed Ricker stock-recruitment models for both wild and stock fish and evaluated them with second-order Akaike's information criterion to find the best model. Independent variables included adult alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) abundance, spring water temperatures, chlorophyll a levels and total phosphorus levels. In all, 14 models were evaluated for production of wild age-0 walleyes and eight models for stocked age-0 walleyes. For wild walleyes, adult alewife abundance was the dominant factor, accounting for 58% of the variability in age-0 abundance. Production of wild age-0 fish increased when adult alewives were scarce. The only other plausible factor was spring water temperature. Predictably, alewife abundance was not important to stocked fish; instead temperature and adult walleye abundance were more significant variables. The surge in reproductive success for walleyes during 2003-2005 was most likely due to large declines in adult alewives in Lake Huron. While relatively strong year classes (age-1 and up) have been produced as a result of increased age-0 production during 2003-2005, the overall magnitude has not been as great as the initial age-0 abundance originally suggested. It appears that over-winter mortality is higher than in the past and may stem from higher predation or slower growth (lower condition for enduring winter thermal stress). From this it appears that low alewife abundance does not assure strong walleye year classes in Saginaw Bay but may be a prerequisite,for them.																			0380-1330					MAY	2007	33			1			118	132		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[118:EAECST]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[118:EAECST]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000247272000010
J	JONASSON, PM				JONASSON, PM			THE ECOSYSTEM OF THINGVALLAVATN - A SYNTHESIS	OIKOS												Thingvallavatn lies at 64-degrees-10'N and 21-degrees-10'W in the subarctic 30 to 40 km from the southwest coast of Iceland at 100.5 m a.s.l. Annual mean air temperature was 2.8-degrees-C for the period 1974-1988. The annual range at Thingvellir is 12.5-degrees-C. Mean annual precipitation on the lake itself is 1300-1400 mm. Global radiation is 313 x 10(7) kJ m-2 yr-1. The basin is formed by tectonic subsidence and glacial erosion, but has since the glacial recession been strongly modified by volcanic activity. The catchment area is characterized by lava flows, of which four entered the lake, and one dammed it. One eruption occurred within the lake. Fault movements have resulted in horizontal and vertical displacement. Soils around the lake are of aeolian origin, well drained, with a low content of clay and a mineral fraction consisting mainly of volcanic ash, susceptible to water and wind erosion. Vegetation is characterized by absence of trees. Contemporary woodland around the lake is mostly confined to protected areas. Plant communities of the open rangelands of the area are moss heath, dwarf shrub heath, graminoid heath and wetlands. The lake is 83 km2, with a mean depth of 34 m, and a maximum depth of 114 m. The catchment area is 1000 km2, of which 50% is postglacial lava. Interglacial lavas and subglacially formed mountains rising to 800-1100 m, glaciers and glacial deposits account for another 50%. The mean discharge of the last 50 yr is 100 m3 s-1. The precipitation, estimated at 2000-2500 mm yr-1 in the catchment area. is mostly percolated; hence the lake is 90% spring-fed. The main spring areas in the north show a constant temperature of 2.8-3.5-degrees-C. Warmer ground water (7.5-10.7-degrees-C) enters the lake in the southwest owing to the nearby Hengill geothermal area. The water level has been regulated since 1959. The lake is dimictic and the temperature commonly reaches 10-11-degrees-C in august with a gradient of 2-3-degrees-C through the thermocline. On an average, the ice-cover lasted 95 d during the period 1974 to 1990. The nutrients N, P and Si enter the lake at fluxes of 1.4, 0.8 and 240 mg m-2 yr-1. Phytoplankton production is N-limited. Two main energy pathways characterize the lake. The pelagic community is simple with few species (48 phytoplankton, three crustacean zooplankton and one fish species), while the benthic community is more complex with ca: 150 phytobenthic algae, ca. 60 zoobenthic and two fish species. The euphotic layer varies between 20 m in spring and 40 m in summer. Phytoplankton production is bimodal with a spring and early autumn peak of diatoms and a summer minimum of mainly Chrysophyceae. Mean annual production is 95 g C m-2 (4000 kJ m-2). Average biomass is 50 kJ m-2 resulting in an annual P/BBAR ratio of 64. Zooplankton biomass averages 50 kJ m-2 and net production amounts to 210 kJ m-2 yr-1 giving an annual P/BBAR ratio of 4.2. Net production of planktivorous arctic charr feeding mainly on zooplankton, but also on emerging benthic insects is 28 kJ m-2 yr-1 with an average biomass of 50 kJ m-2 and annual P/BBAR ratio of 0.54. The phytobenthic communities showed a distinct zonation with more algal zone in the stony littoral to 10 m depth with various fast growing herbivorous zoobenthos assemblages adapted. In the sublittoral from 10-25 m depth a Nitella opaca stand supports a small population of the filtrering Chironomus islandicus. The phytobenthos covers ca. 30% of total lake area. The profundal zone is dominated by the slow growing detritivorous Tubifex tubifex. Phytobenthos gross production in the littoral and sublittoral zones averages on a lakewide basis 2800 kJ m-1. Average biomass is 500 kJ m-2 with an annual P/BBAR ratio of 2.6. Zoobenthos (including micro- and meiofauna) production is 100 kJ m-2 yr-1. Annual P/BBAR ratio decreased from 3.6 in the littoral zone to 1.4 in the profundal zone. Three benthic morphs of arctic charr, and threespine stickleback, feed mainly on zoobenthos. Their annual production averaged 3.4 kJ m-2 yr-1 with an annual P/BBAR ratio of 0.43. Possible interactions between energy flow in the pelagic and benthic foodchains are pointed out.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				MAY-JUN	1992	64	1-2					405	434		10.2307/3545062	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3545062													WOS:A1992JG50900025
J	HORVATH, FJ; HUMMON, WD				HORVATH, FJ; HUMMON, WD			INFLUENCE OF MINE ACID ON PLANKTONIC ROTIFERS	OHIO JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												Planktonic rotifers were sampled in spring and summer from 2 lakes in southeastern Ohio [USA]. Unpolluted waters of Dow Lake were lower in sulfate and Fe and higher in pH, hardness and alkalinity than acid mine polluted waters of Lake Hope. Rotifers of Dow Lake exceeded those of Lake Hope in species number, numerical abundance, species diversity and faunal similarity among sample dates; similarity between lakes was negligible. Keratella cochlearis and Brachionus urceolaris, the most abundant rotifers in each of the respective lakes, both showed broad tolerances to pH. While B. urceolaris showed a large selective advantage at low pH, this was reduced and both species fared better at near-neutral pH. Neither species appeared sensitive to alternative pH conditions in preference tests.																			0030-0950						1980	80	3					104	107																WOS:A1980JT93900002

Based on a one-dimensional and two-dimensional model coupled hydrodynamic model, the spatial and temporal distributions of the Dongting Lake water level were compared with the ecological water level, which was assessed using a hydrological method, and the power generation of the Three Gorges Hydropower station under different scenarios was also analyzed. The results showed that the water supply effect of the falling in advance and falling at high water level scenarios on the Dongting Lake water level exhibited obvious spatial and temporal heterogeneity, but the effects were mainly concentrated in the northern part of eastern Dongting Lake, whereas limited effects were observed for the southern and western Dongting Lake. In scenario 1 (falling in advance), the water level at Chenglingji increased by 0.12 m on average and power generation was reduced by 0.30%. In scenario 3 (falling at a high water level), the water level at Chenglingji decreased by 0.09 m on average; and power generation increased by 0.28%.

J	George, DG				George, D. G.			The effect of nutrient enrichment and changes in the weather on the abundance of Daphnia in Esthwaite Water, Cumbria	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. A simple counting technique has been used to produce a long-term (19561991) record of the seasonal variations in the abundance of Daphnia in Esthwaite Water, a productive lake in the English Lake District. For most of this period, there was a progressive increase in the winter concentration of phosphorus and a gradual increase in the temperature of the lake. 2. The seasonal variations in the abundance of Daphnia followed the same pattern throughout the period with a strong cohort (C1) produced in early summer and a weaker cohort (C2) in late summer. 3. The main factors regulating the strength of the C1 cohort were the trophic status of the lake and the physical stability of the water column. The gradual decline in the strength of this cohort is attributed to the combined effects of enrichment and warming on the growth of the edible algae that follow the Asterionella decline. The timing of the Asterionella decline has advanced in recent years, but there has been no comparable change in the timing of the Daphnia maximum. 4. The only factors to have a significant effect on the strength of the C2 cohort were the stability of the water column and the depth of the thermocline. The Daphnia were never abundant when the lake was strongly stratified since these conditions favoured the growth of the cyanobacteria Microcystis and Aphanizomenon. 5. The ultimate factor regulating the strength of the C2 cohort was the year-to-year variations in the weather type that dominates the U. K. during the summer. Daphnia numbers were low when the synoptic situation was dominated by high pressure i. e. when there was a marked increase in the frequency of calm, anticyclonic days. 6. The results are discussed in relation to the climatic changes projected for the area at the end of the 21st century. The greatest uncertainties are those connected with mesoscale changes in the circulation of the atmosphere and the consequent shift in the trajectory of storms across the Atlantic.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				FEB	2012	57	2					360	372		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02704.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02704.x													WOS:000298786200010

Twelve monthly samples were collected which revealed one species of monogenean, Dactylogyrus extensus, and two species of cestode, Caryophyllaeus laticeps and Bothriocephalus acheilognathi. Abundance of D. extensus varied - highly significantly with month increasing from April to peak in May-July, followed by a sharp decrease thereafter. These changes followed the water temperature pattern and a significant positive correlation was found between parasite abundance and water temperature. Significant differences were also revealed in the abundance of C laticeps indicating a temperature-dependent response. Infection was not detected from July to October, most fish acquired parasites during the period December-February, and the parasite population showed a decline in spring until July when the infection disappeared. Of the three species only D. extensus showed a clear tendency of increase in infrapopulation size with host size. The distribution of infrapopulations of D. extensus varied highly significantly with the size class of fish, peaking in large size classes and the correlation of infrapopulation size and fish length was highly significant. A substantial peak in the abundance levels of this monogenean in mature fish was detected in spring and summer, related to spawning.

J	Johnson, JH; Chalupnicki, MA; Abbett, R				Johnson, James H.; Chalupnicki, Marc A.; Abbett, Ross			Diet Composition, Feeding Periodicity, and Prey Selection of Slimy Sculpin During Winter	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Slimy Sculpin Cottus cognatus is an important component of the benthic ichthyofauna of many lakes and streams in the northern latitudes of North America. Although considerable information exists on the feeding ecology of this species, there is essentially no information available on winter feeding. Consequently, we examined the winter feeding ecology of Slimy Sculpins in a central New York stream. Ephemeropterans (37.8%) and trichopterans (31.2%) were the primary prey taxa consumed in January. There was evidence of diel variation in diet composition, with ephemeropterans making up 24.1% of the diet at 0400 hours and 46.7% at 1600 hours and trichopterans contributing 22.7% at 1200 hours and 43.8% at 2000 hours. During winter, Slimy Sculpins selected chironomids (0.46) and trichopterans (0.43) and avoided coleopterans (-0.84) and nonchironomid dipterans (-0.67). Peak food consumption of Slimy Sculpins occurred at night. Winter feeding patterns of Slimy Sculpins in Grout Brook, a second-order tributary of Skaneateles Lake in central New York, contrasted sharply with observations from other studies carried out during other seasons. Our findings are a significant contribution on the winter feeding ecology of this important benthic species and illustrate the need for both diel and winter studies to fully understand life history characteristics.																			1944-687X					DEC	2017	8	2					611	617		10.3996/032017-JFWM-029	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/032017-JFWM-029													WOS:000418056300020
J	Hopp, U; Maier, G				Hopp, U; Maier, G			Survival and development of five species of cyclopoid copepods in relation to food supply: experiments with algal food in a flow-through system	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Cyclops spp. generally develop and grow during favourable food conditions in spring and undergo a diapause in summer, while Acanthocyclops robustus, Mesocyclops leuckarti and Thermocyclops crassus develop and grow in summer when they face poorer food conditions and more competition from Cladocera. Since nauplii are the bottleneck in copepod development, we tested the hypothesis that Cyclops abyssorum and C. vicinus nauplii have higher food requirements for survival and development than the nauplii of A. robustus, M. leuckarti and T. crassus. We also tested survivorship and development from hatching to adulthood. 2. Survivorship and development of the copepods was studied in a flow-through system using five concentrations of the phytoflagellate Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the range from 1 x 10(4) to 4.5 x 10(5) cells mL(-1) (approximately 0.5-22.5 mg C L-1). 3. Nauplii of both species of Cyclops died at intermediate to low (C. abyssorum) and low (C. vicinus) food concentrations, while nauplii of A. robustus, M. leuckarti and T. crassus survived at all concentrations. 4. The negative effects of low food concentration were also reflected in development. In C. abyssorum and C. vicinus, development duration increased at low food concentration while development was much less affected in A. robustus and T. crassus. Mesocyclops leuckarti was intermediate between Cyclops spp. and A. robustus/T. crassus, with an increase in development duration at the lowest food concentration. 5. Our results support the hypothesis that summer diapause in Cyclops spp. has developed as a strategy to avoid a food bottleneck for nauplii.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				SEP	2005	50	9					1454	1463		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01417.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01417.x													WOS:000231224500002

To understand the pollutant transport behaviors in Tieshangang Bay, we developed a combination model (MIKE 21 FM) of the hydrodynamic module and particle tracking module. Simulation results suggest that the water velocities in the west and east troughs (near the entrance of the bay) are distinctly higher than any other areas. Meanwhile, small semi-enclosed bays adjacent to the shoreline could affect local water flow patterns, thereby causing gyres within them. The residence time of pollutants in Tieshangang Bay is significantly affected by seasonal variations (i.e., the residence time of pollutants in Tieshangang Bay in winter is less than that in summer). The results of transport trajectory simulations reveal that the bay head is a slow flushing zone, while the entrance of the bay (west trough) can be identified as a fast flushing zone.

However, their accuracy needs thorough evaluation for effective regional application, particularly in areas with complex topography like the Poyang Lake Basin (PLB), China's largest freshwater lake. This study evaluated ERA5's accuracy in simulating near-surface air temperature and precipitation in the PLB, using data from 24 meteorological stations. Key metrics, such as the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) were applied across daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual scales. The results show that ERA5 performs well for daily mean temperature, with daily R values above 0.98 and RMSEs ranging from 0.95 degrees C to 3.11 degrees C. Its highest accuracy was in February and March, with R values exceeding 0.95, and seasonal trends were best captured in spring and autumn (R > 0.99). However, ERA5's performance for precipitation was less accurate, with daily R values between 0.578 and 0.687 and RMSEs between 8.58 mm and 11.10 mm. ERA5 consistently overestimated precipitation, particularly during 1980-2003. These findings highlight ERA5's strengths in temperature modeling and its limitations in precipitation, providing insights for identifying climate events and improving climate simulation in the PLB.					; Gao, Lu/E-2867-2014; You, Jiewen/MVW-0836-2025	YOU, Jiewen/0000-0002-6377-0104; Gao, Lu/0000-0003-1934-5802; YIN, Fangxu/0009-0004-5137-769X; CHEN, YING/0000-0001-8662-6466														2073-4441				NOV	2024	16	21							3123	10.3390/w16213123	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16213123													WOS:001352730300001

The waters are of evaporated Na + K-Cl and non-evaporated Ca + Mg-HCO3 types, with the more mineralized (electrical conductivity-EC of 13130 mu S/cm) Lobe spring inferred to result from interaction of circulating 49 degrees C waters with magmatic volatiles of the active Mt. Cameroon. Water mineralization in the other springs follows the order: Sabga A > Sabga B > Bambui B > Bambui A > Nyos Cave. But for the Nyos Cave spring, all other springs contain fluoride (up to 0.5-35.6 mg/l above WHO potable water upper limit). The Sabga spring contains arsenic (up to 1.3 mg/l above the WHO limits). The springs show low fractionation temperatures in the range of 19-43 degrees C. The Lobe and Sabga A springs are precipitating dolomite (CaMg(CO3)(2)), while the Nyos Cave, Bambui A, Bambui B and Sabga B springs precipitate trona ((Na3H(CO3)(2).H2O). Our data suggest a marine provenance for the carbonates, and point to a volcanic input for the Lobe, Nyos, Sabga A, and Bambui A springs. The latter springs are therefore proposed as proxies for monitoring volcanic activity for hazard mitigation along the CVL.

The effects of water chemistry and seasonal temperature variation on Candona rawsoni	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Reconstruction of lake paleochemistry from the isotope and trace-element composition of fossil ostracodes requires an understanding of geochemical variations induced by the seasonality of shell formation. Monthly field collections of live Candona rawsoni from two hyposaline lakes in the eastern Dakotas reveal large variations in delta(18)O values (2-5 parts per thousand) and Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios (up to 35%) among individual adults within the same assemblage. Because the measured variations in water chemistry were small, the amplitude of ostracode delta(18)O and Mg/Ca variations must result from seasonal temperature variation. Ostracode Sr/Ca ratios, which should be temperature independent, shows strong positive covariance with shell Mg/Ca. These results imply that Sr uptake in ostracode calcite increases with the Mg content of the shell. The partitioning coefficient for Mg, on the other hand, appears to decreases at high values of Mg/Ca in the host water. The geochemical variability in the field collections indicates that C. rawsoni populations are composed of multiple overlapping generations that attain maturity at different times. Many juveniles apparently undergo several molts in mid-summer and persist as penultimate instars (A-1) into the following spring. Geochemical analysis of late-instar juvenile C. rawsoni from lacustrine sedimentary records is likely to provide information on mid-summer conditions. Large numbers of fossil ostracodes should be analyzed from each stratigraphic interval to eliminate seasonal noise from the paleochemistry records of temperate-region lakes.

Because these life stages are an adaptation to overcome harsh conditions, survivability over time is assumed to be high. Brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) diapausing eggs (cysts) permit overwinter survival to initiate the population each spring. An experiment was designed to examine overwinter survival of brine shrimp cysts for 17 yr in Great Salt Lake (Utah, U.S.A.). Initial hatchability entering the winter (17.8-78.8%) and overwinter survivability (9.9-65.9%) of cysts varied dramatically among years. Better maternal nutrition increased initial hatchability. Overwinter survival of cysts decreased in part because some cysts hatch when it is too cold for the hatchlings to feed (0.8-39.4% among years), so they starve. However, overwinter cyst survival decreases the most with warmer waters in winter, and with better maternal nutrition, as both factors lead to diapause being easier to break. Annual variation in initial hatchability and survival is shown to be important to Great Salt Lake brine shrimp populations. Therefore, cryptobiotic life-stage ecology needs to be better understood, as these life stages may have highly variable hatchability and survivability with normal environmental stresses.

Ell., plants on the foredunes at Port Burwell Provincial Park along Lake Erie. In spring, a large number of seedlings were found on the drift-line (area of beach where detritis deposits are cast on shore by the waves) and a small number both on the lakeward (mid-beach) and landward (high-beach) ends of the drift-line. Plants growing on the mid-beach were larger and produced a significantly greater number of heavier seeds than those on the drift-line. However, during late fall and winter months, a large proportion of these seeds were moved by wind and wave action to the drift-line. Intraspecific competition was not a limiting factor on the mid-beach; however, on the drift-line, the number of seeds per plant decreased significantly with an increase in density of plants from about 1 to 140/m(2), suggesting that intraspecific competition may be an important limiting factor in seed production per plant. The mean mass per seed significantly declined over the growing season of S. helvola. There was a significant increase in mean seed mass with increasing pod size. Seeds in the centre of a pod were significantly heavier than those at the proximal and distal ends of a pod. Strophostyles helvola is able to flourish in the constantly shifting shoreline beach habitats along Lake Erie owing to two main factors. First, it is able to fully utilize the highly variable beach microhabitats and maintain high total reproductive output per square metre. Second, since burial in sand is a major recurrent event on sandy beaches, the high variability in seed mass will be of adaptive significance because seedlings from large seeds will not only be able to emerge from greater depths of burial in sand but also will have greater probability of survival under burial conditions.																			0008-4026					AUG	1996	74	8					1313	1321		10.1139/b96-159	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b96-159													WOS:A1996VE13600016

Based on hydroacoustic and gillnet surveys, there was considerable variation among lakes in temperatures occupied by lake trout during the summer. During the day, lake trout were concentrated at 4-8 degrees C in Lake 375, broadly distributed from 6 to 15 degrees C in Lake 442, and concentrated in the epilimnion at 19 degrees C in Lake 468. At night, lake trout in all lakes occupied epilimnetic waters at 19-20 degrees C. Lake trout inhabited highly oxygenated water, with 75-90% of fish at >6 mg dissolved oxygen.L-1 throughout the spring and summer in all three lakes. Light intensity did not affect lake trout distribution in Lake 468 but may have contributed to lake trout daytime descent into cool waters in Lakes 375 and 442. We suggest that previously assumed niche boundaries of lake trout do not adequately describe critical habitat for the species in small lakes, the same lakes that are likely most sensitive to erosion of such habitat.

J	Pope, RJ; Gordon, AM; Kaushik, NK				Pope, RJ; Gordon, AM; Kaushik, NK			Leaf litter colonization by invertebrates in the littoral zone of a small oligotrophic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The colonization of deciduous leaf litter by aquatic invertebrates was studied at Scott Lake in Algonquin Park, Ontario, Canada. Deciduous leaf packs were colonized after only 2 days submergence. The invertebrate community was dominated by chironomids (25-94% depending on sampling period), and to a lesser extent by oligochaetes, turbellarians, and mayflies. Collectors, such as the chironomids Dicrotendipes, Pseudochironomus, Paratanytarsus and Parakiefferiella were the dominant functional-feeding group suggesting that leaf litter is being used as habitat rather than a direct food source. Deciduous leaf litter lost a substantial amount of weight, due to leaching, after only 48 h submergence. Fall-shed beech (Fagus grandifolia) leaves decomposed more rapidly than fall-shed sugar maple (Acer saccharum) leaves with daily processing coefficients (k), determined using an exponential decay model, of 0.0058 and 0.0039, respectively. Conversely, conditioned maple leaves, defined as leaves remaining on the ground over winter, were processed faster than conditioned beech leaves, with coefficients of 0.0042 and 0.0014, respectively. It is speculated that inhibitory compounds have been leached from the maple leaves, allowing for faster leaf processing.																			0018-8158						1999	392	2					99	112		10.1023/A:1003537232319	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003537232319													WOS:000081035300002

Growing Fast or Being Steadfast?	FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY												A substantial number of Lemnaceae are invasive outside their natural distribution area. Lemna minuta is considered invasive in several European countries, where it can occur in the same habitat as invasive Azolla filiculoides and native Lemna minor. In this study the presence, abundance and growth rates of all three species were monitored across 24 natural ponds and in a series of mesocosms in order to explore the importance of species invasiveness and habitat invisibility. Field monitoring showed that the distribution of the three species of macrophytes is heterogeneous in space and time. However, the data show no association of nutrient or light levels with plant distribution. Indeed, using reciprocal transplanting experiments it was demonstrated that all species are able to grow in all ponds, even ponds where the species do not naturally occur. It is concluded that distribution of L. minor, L. minuta, and A. filiculoides is not limited by the prevailing physicochemical characteristics of the ponds during the summer period. Remarkably, in these experiments A. filiculoides displayed the highest RGR, and exerted a negative influence on growth rates and surface cover of L. minor and L. minuta. Despite such apparent invasiveness, A. filiculoides was relatively rare in the study area. Rather, the species most abundant was L. minor which has the lowest RGR under field conditions in summer. Therefore, this study shows that the invasiveness of the species during the summer months is not necessarily reflected in the actual distribution pattern in natural ponds. In fact, alien L. minuta and A. filiculoides are under-represented in the monitored area. It is concluded that the interaction of several factors, including growth under winter-conditions and/or dispersal after disturbances, is the major determinant of the abundance and heterogeneous distribution of L. minor, L. minuta, and A. filiculoides in the study area.					; Jansen, Marcel/MGV-1636-2025; Paolacci, Simona/AAB-4083-2020	Paolacci, Simona/0000-0003-0057-623X; Jansen, Marcel/0000-0003-2014-5859													2296-2646					JUN 14	2018	6								207	10.3389/fchem.2018.00207	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2018.00207								29963546					WOS:000435347300001

This study uses imagery from the recently launched Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite to investigate supraglacial lakes in West Greenland. A semi-automated algorithm is developed to detect surface lakes from Sentinel-1 images during the 2015 summer. A combined Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1 dataset, which has a comparable temporal resolution to MODIS (3 days vs. daily) but a higher spatial resolution (25-40 vs. 250-500 m), is then used together with a fully automated lake drainage detection algorithm. Rapid (< 4 days) and slow (> 4 days) drainages are investigated for both small (< 0.125 km(2), the minimum size detectable by MODIS) and large (>= 0.125 km(2)) lakes through the summer. Drainage events of small lakes occur at lower elevations (mean 159m), and slightly earlier (mean 4.5 days) in the melt season than those of large lakes. The analysis is extended manually into the early winter to calculate the dates and elevations of lake freeze-through more precisely than is possible with optical imagery (mean 30 August; 1,270m mean elevation). Finally, the Sentinel-1 imagery is used to detect subsurface lakes and, for the first time, their dates of appearance and freeze-through (mean 9 August and 7 October, respectively). These subsurface lakes occur at higher elevations than the surface lakes detected in this study (mean 1,593 and 1,185 m, respectively). Sentinel-1 imagery therefore provides great potential for tracking melting, water movement and freezing within both the firn zone and ablation area of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

The Obuki hot spring water discharges after mixing of magmatic gas with meteoric water and underground vapor-liquid separation. SO42- and H2S was formed by the disproportionation reaction of SO2 at around 220 degrees C. Tritium concentration indicated that the subsurface residence time of the Obuki hot spring water is 13-25 years.

Vertical Habitat Use by Adult Walleyes Conflicts with Expectations from Fishery-Independent Surveys	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Stock assessments of Walleyes Sander vitreus in Lake Erie rely on a combination of suspended and bottom overnight gill-net surveys to provide population and demographic information. However, the assumption that Walleyes undertake diel vertical migrations and become available to the suspended gill nets at night has never been validated. To understand how vertical habitat use affects the availability of Walleyes to fishery-independent surveys, we compared individual behaviors observed by means of acoustic depth telemetry tags (20 individuals; 2013-2016) with catches in paired suspended and bottom gill-net sets (273 paired sets; 2013-2016) used by management agencies. In contrast to our expectations and observations in other lakes, the mean depths for Walleyes most often occurred in the lower one-half to one-third of the water column, and at lake depths 15 m, Walleyes were found at shallower depths during stratified periods (i.e., summer) than during unstratified periods (autumn). They were also found at shallower depths in 2015 and 2016 than in 2013 and 2014. In paired autumn gill-net surveys, (1) the overall proportion of Walleye catch was nearly equal in suspended and bottom gill nets and (2) the proportion of the catch in suspended gill nets declined with fish length. The pattern of decline was dependent on how deep the suspended net was fished and the year in which the data were collected. These results provide evidence that the suspended gill-net surveys currently being used to assess Walleye demographics in Lake Erie are biased toward the capture small Walleyes, while bottom nets are biased toward the capture of large ones. Future telemetry investigations will be needed to understand whether these biases reflect differences in the depth of habitat between small and large Walleyes.					; Vandergoot, Christopher/JAO-1190-2023	Gutowsky, Lee/0000-0003-1244-9465; 													0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	2019	148	3					592	604		10.1002/tafs.10150	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10150													WOS:000468317200006
C	Casselman, JM		McGinn, NA		Casselman, JM			Effects of temperature, global extremes, and climate change on year-class production of warmwater, coolwater, and coldwater fishes in the Great Lakes Basin	FISHERIES IN A CHANGING CLIMATE	AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY SYMPOSIUM				Symposium on Fisheries in a Changing Climate	AUG 20-21, 2001	PHOENIX, AZ	Amer Fisheries Soc				Predicting the impact of global warming on fisheries necessitates understanding the effects of temperature, an important factor influencing year-class strength and production. For three decades, index sampling in eastern Lake Ontario has provided catch statistics and age data to assess changes in the status of fish species in relation to thermal tolerance. Summer and early winter inshore water temperatures have increased significantly, paralleling global warming and temperature extremes, particularly those associated with El Nino, La Nina, and volcanic eruptions of Mount Pinatubo and Agung. Global warming will substantially increase year-class strength of warmwater species, such as smallmouth bass Micropteru dolomieu, which is positively correlated with July-August temperatures (r(2) = 0.47); an additional increase of 1degreesC increases abundance by 2.5x; 2degreesC by 6.0x, and 3degreesC by 14.7x. Year-class strength of northern pike Esox lucius, a coolwater species, is curvilinearly associated with July-August temperatures (r(2) = 0.48); an increase of 1degreesC decreases year-class strength by 2.4x and 2degreesC by 17.9x. A similar curvilinear relation exists between May temperatures and recruitment of alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, an important coolwater forage species. For coldwater species such as lake trout Salvelinus namaycush, an increase in fall temperatures at spawning time has a major negative effect on year-class strength; an increase of 1degreesC decreases survival at hatch by 1.5x, 2degreesC by 2.4x, and 3degreesC by 20.1x. Global warming will significantly affect year-class strength and fish-community structure and dynamics in the Great Lakes Basin, substantially decreasing recruitment of coldwater and coolwater species and increasing relative recruitment of warmwater species, here for example, 2x with a PC increase and 3x with 2degreesC.																			0892-2284		1-888569-40-9				2002	32						39	59																WOS:000178304200004
J	Müller, H				Müller, H			Laboratory study of the life cycle of a freshwater strombidiid ciliate	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Sediment samples containing resting cysts of the planktonic ciliate Pelagostrombidium sp. were collected in October/November 2000 in Lake Mondsee, Austria, with sediment traps and stored at ca. 4degreesC in the dark. Within 6 mo, concentrations of viable cysts in these samples decreased to less than 4% of initial numbers, probably due to the combined effects of predation, infection and excystment. Spontaneous excystment at low temperatures was first observed in March 2001, when the cysts were ca. 4 mo old. Excystment of 2 to 5 mo old cysts could be triggered by a temperature shift from ca. 4 to 18degreesC in the presence of food algae. White light slightly enhanced this response. From excysted individuals, 12 non-clonal strains were established and maintained with cryptomonads as food. All strains produced cysts, which were first observed ca. 3 wk after excystment. Experiments with these laboratory cysts revealed that excystment could be triggered by a temperature stimulus in cysts older than 1 mo and occurred spontaneously at low temperatures in cysts older than 3 mo. The results of the present study suggest that cyst age and temperature are the main factors controlling excystment of Pelagostrombidium sp., and that the period of dormancy of this ciliate in sediments of temperate lakes generally does not exceed 6 mo. Cysts produced at the end of the growing season will excyst in early spring, whereas cysts formed in spring are likely to excyst in summer.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				SEP	2002	29	2					189	197		10.3354/ame029189	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame029189													WOS:000178397900008
J	Berard, A; Pelte, T; Druart, JC				Berard, A; Pelte, T; Druart, JC			Seasonal variations in the sensitivity of Lake Geneva phytoplankton community structure to atrazine	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Natural phytoplankton assemblages from Lake Geneva were cultivated in outdoor microcosms contaminated with 10 mu g/l of the PS II inhibitor herbicide, atrazine. The 12 experiments were performed in the spring and early and late summer. Physico-chemical parameters and the changes in the densities of algal species were followed. The algae in the phytoplankton community were inhibited, stimulated, or apparently unaffected by the herbicide. The growth of 3 species (Fragilaria cratonensis KITTON, Nitzschia sp. and Oscillatoria limnetica LEMMERMANN) was Stimulated by atrazine contamination in microcosms, but showed no such response in monoculture, whereas Chlorella vulgaris BEIJER, which was inhibited in the outdoor microcosm experiments, was also inhibited by the herbicide in laboratory monoculture. Atrazine influenced the interspecies interactions, which could explain the greater development of some phytoplanktonic species in the contaminated microcosms. Hence, the herbicide may act as a supplementary factor disturbing algal succession in lakes. The effect of atrazine on species development and community structure varied. The algal communities were most sensitive to restructuring by the PS II inhibitor herbicide in the clear water phase, whereas the robust spring algal communities were the least sensitive. Seasonal changes in environmental parameters, species composition and interactions may affect the response of algal communities to the toxicant. These interactions between herbicides and seasonal successions may reduce or increase the consequences of pollution in aquatic systems. This may be ecologically important, especially when the herbicide contamination from runoff also varies seasonally.

Anders; Nicolle, Alice; Berglund, Olof			Temperature and Resource Availability May Interactively Affect Over-Wintering Success of Juvenile Fish in a Changing Climate	PLOS ONE												The predicted global warming may affect freshwater systems at several organizational levels, from organism to ecosystem. Specifically, in temperate regions, the projected increase of winter temperatures may have important effects on the over-winter biology of a range of organisms and especially for fish and other ectothermic animals. However, temperature effects on organisms may be directed strongly by resource availability. Here, we investigated whether over-winter loss of biomass and lipid content of juvenile roach (Rutilus rutilus) was affected by the physiologically relatively small (2-5 degrees C) changes of winter temperatures predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), under both natural and experimental conditions. This was investigated in combination with the effects of food availability. Finally, we explored the potential for a correlation between lake temperature and resource levels for planktivorous fish, i.e., zooplankton biomass, during five consecutive winters in a south Swedish lake. We show that small increases in temperature (+2 degrees C) affected fish biomass loss in both presence and absence of food, but negatively and positively respectively. Temperature alone explained only a minor part of the variation when food availability was not taken into account. In contrast to other studies, lipid analyses of experimental fish suggest that critical somatic condition rather than critical lipid content determined starvation induced mortality. Our results illustrate the importance of considering not only changes in temperature when predicting organism response to climate change but also food-web interactions, such as resource availability and predation. However, as exemplified by our finding that zooplankton over-winter biomass in the lake was not related to over-winter temperature, this may not be a straightforward task.					; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022; Jonsson, Mikael/M-7449-2013; Jönsson, Mikael/M-7449-2013; Rodriguez Gil, Jose Luis/B-3479-2010; Nilsson, Anders/H-6836-2014	Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; Jonsson, Mikael/0000-0002-9799-6435; Rodriguez Gil, Jose Luis/0000-0001-9325-9131; Berglund, Olof/0000-0002-5785-0087; Nilsson, Anders/0000-0002-3541-9835													1932-6203					OCT 6	2011	6	10							e24022	10.1371/journal.pone.0024022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0024022								21998627					WOS:000295968700003
J	Tardif, J; Bergeron, Y				Tardif, J; Bergeron, Y			Ice-flood history reconstructed with tree-rings from the southern boreal forest limit, western Quebec	HOLOCENE												Historic ice-flood frequency and lake levers were reconstructed for the southern limit of the boreal forest in western Quebec by dendrochronological analyses of ice-scarred white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.) trees growing on the shore of Lake Duparquet. Results reveal a significant increase in major ice floods since the end of the 'Little Ice Age' and, in particular, since the beginning of this century. This rise was also not related to oversampling of younger scarred trees. In addition, time between white-cedar establishment and the first recorded scar has significantly decreased in the last 200 years, and this applies for trees occupying similar topographic conditions. White cedar's increased exposure, in the 150 years, to scarring strongly suggests that Lake Duparquet water levels at breakup are reaching higher elevations. This is supported by an approximate 100-cm rise in maximum ice-scar height since the end of the 'Little Ice Age'. Years leading to abundant ice scars are those with heavy winter and spring precipitation. Cold Novembers and rainy Aprils also favour major ice-flood episodes. Earlier spring melts could also favour pre-mature ice breakup; a situation that may cause higher-amplitude ice floods. Since the 'Little Ice Age', greater penetration of warm and humid air from the south resulting from a northward migration of the Arctic front may be responsible for the increasing major ice floods registered at Quebec's southern boreal forest limit.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				SEP	1997	7	3					291	300		10.1177/095968369700700305	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/095968369700700305													WOS:A1997YB59900005
J	Pérez-Arteaga, A; Gaston, KJ				Pérez-Arteaga, A; Gaston, KJ			Wildfowl population trends in Mexico, 1961-2000:: a basis for conservation planning	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												We analysed population trends of 24 wildfowl species in Mexico. Wildfowl numbers peaked during the early 1980s; lowest counts were recorded in 1997. Total wildfowl numbers (all species combined) and duck numbers (duck species combined) showed significant short-term (1981-2000) declines, while geese (goose species combined) showed a significant long-term (1961-2000) increase. Six wildfowl species suffered significant long-term declines, while four showed increases. During 1981-2000, 11 species declined, but none had significant increases. Redhead (Aythya americana), Mexican duck (Anas diazi), northern pintail (A. acuta) and black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) should be given high conservation priority because of the high proportions of their North American populations in Mexico. Declining numbers of the later two species should trigger further investigation into the possibility of assigning them legal protection status. Other species with apparent declines in numbers should also be more closely monitored. For setting hunting limits in the country, the population status of each species should be accounted for, as well as the condition of breeding populations the previous spring. Other species with poor data or combined counts should be targeted for basic population studies. We suggest that the mid-winter counts be expanded to cover non-surveyed areas and conducted every year to more precisely detect wildfowl population change. Integrated to a site-selection analysis, the information presented here call provide the basis for a wildfowl conservation strategy in Mexico. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results show that the influences of the winter NPO on the SAT over Eurasia and North America are sensitive to the definition of the NPO index. The impact of the winter NPO on the SAT variations over Eurasia (North America) is significant (insignificant) when the anticyclonic anomaly associated with the NPO index over the North Pacific midlatitudes shifts westward and pronounced northerly wind anomalies appear around Lake Baikal. By contrast, the impact of the winter NPO on the SAT variations over Eurasia (North America) is insignificant (significant) when the anticyclonic anomaly over the North Pacific related to the NPO index shifts eastward and the associated northerly wind anomalies to its eastern flank extend to North America. The present study suggests that the NPO definition should be taken into account when analyzing the impact of the winter NPO on Eurasian and North American SAT variations.					chen, Shangfeng/AAP-2223-2020														0256-1530	1861-9533				JUN	2018	35	6					702	712		10.1007/s00376-017-7111-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00376-017-7111-5													WOS:000429920200009

Regional-scale mapping of groundwater discharge zones using thermal satellite imagery	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Mapping groundwater discharge zones at broad spatial scales remains a challenge, particularly in data sparse regions. We applied a regional scale mapping approach based on thermal remote sensing to map discharge zones in a complex watershed with a broad diversity of geological materials, land cover and topographic variation situated within the Prairie Parkland of northern Alberta, Canada. We acquired winter thermal imagery from the USGS Landsat archive to demonstrate the utility of this data source for applications that can complement both scientific and management programs. We showed that the thermally determined potential discharge areas were corroborated with hydrological (spring locations) and chemical (conservative tracers of groundwater) data. This study demonstrates how thermal remote sensing can form part of a comprehensive mapping framework to investigate groundwater resources over broad spatial scales.

The samples include both reverse osmosis isolates from lakes in Scandinavia, Canada, and Germany, and IHSS fulvic and humic acids of aquatic and terrestrial origin. The quantum yields of O-1(2) formation (Phi(Delta)) obtained on laser excitation at 480 nm ranged between 0.06 ( HS1500) and 2.7% ( fulvic acid from soil, IHSS). In our study, a general trend towards higher Phi(Delta) in terrestrial HS was observed. The comparison of reverse osmosis isolates from surface waters collected during fall 1999 and spring 2000 from five Scandinavian sites yielded, in all cases, higher Phi(Delta) for the spring samples. For the aquatic sampling sites Hietajarvi and Birkenes, Phi(Delta) even exceeded values of 0.6%, which were found to be typical for terrestrial or soil water material. Investigation of the excitation wavelength dependence of Phi(Delta) in the spectral range 355 - 550 nm yielded different spectral shapes for aquatic HS and "non-aquatic" HS, respectively. On the basis of these excitation spectra, O-1(2) production rates were calculated for eight representative HS.					; Vogt, Rolf David/O-5282-2014	Paul, Andrea/0000-0003-2849-4754; Steinberg, Christian E.W./0000-0002-3132-8901; Vogt, Rolf David/0000-0001-8880-5177													1474-905X	1474-9092					2004	3	3					273	280		10.1039/b312146a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b312146a								14993944					WOS:000220543400008

Here, the distribution patterns and assembly mechanisms of bacter-ioplankton communities in the estuary areas of the Taihu Lake were investigated using high-throughput sequencing and multivariate statistical analyses. Our results showed obvious seasonal variations in bacter-ioplankton diversity and community composition, which had significant correlations with water temperature. Neutral and null models together revealed that stochastic processes (especially dispersal limitation) were the major processes in shaping the communities across different seasons. By contrast, heterogeneous selection in deterministic processes exhibited increased impacts on community assembly during summer and autumn, which was significantly related to the comprehensive water quality index (WQI) rather than any single factor. In this study, rare communities displayed more pronounced seasonal dynamics compared to abundant communities, likely due to their sensitivity towards environmental factors. Accordingly, the heterogeneous selection of deterministic processes largely shaped the rare communities. These results enriched our understanding of the assembly mechanisms of bacterioplankton communities in estuary areas and emphasized the specific co-occurrence patterns of abundant and rare communities.

J	Goyette, S; Fonseca, C; Truscello, L				Goyette, Stephane; Fonseca, Cedric; Truscello, Leonard			Assessment of nonlinear effects of a deep subgrid lake with an atmospheric single-column model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Some nonlinear aspects due to the coupling of a single column atmospheric model (SCM) with both a land-surface model (LSM) and a lake model has lately been published by Goyette in 2017. In this previous study, the surface type abruptly changed from land to an open water surface. This article further investigates the potential of this SCM to explore the nonlinear effects through the analysis of the impacts of fractional land and open water surfaces on the surface fluxes and variables, as well as on the atmospheric air temperature, specific humidity, and wind speed vertical profiles, with an application to deep Lake Geneva, Switzerland. It is shown that the coupling methodology depending on the surface type produced realistic and coherent results and indicated that the mean fluxes and other relevant quantities may not be simply averaged on the basis of the fractional area of the land and that of the open water. If Lake Geneva relative surface area is prescribed to its observed value with respect to the model grid-mesh size, the remaining being land surface, results showed maximum seasonal mean differences of 7.5 and 5.4 W.m(-2) for the latent and sensible heat flux in Autumn respectively, 1.6 degrees C, 0.8 g.kg(-1) for the screen-level air temperature and specific humidity in Autumn respectively, and 0.6 m.s(-1) for the anemometer-level windspeed in Winter with respect to the original land surface, owing to the different behaviour of the vertical turbulent transfer of heat, moisture and momentum but also to the different thermal and radiative characteristics of land and water surfaces.

Casual observations indicated that intraspecific kleptoparasitism was common throughout these flocks. Kleptoparasitic attacks mostly occurred shortly after a Common Coot surfaced with food and before it had ingested much of it. Attacked birds rarely resisted, and kleptoparasitic individuals had a success rate of 85% (n = 290), including cases when the victim managed to keep part of the food. Kleptoparasitic Common Coots used a mixed strategy, alternating between parasitism and self-feeding.

J	Williams, MA; Vondracek, B				Williams, Mary A.; Vondracek, Bruce			Spring distributions and relationships with land cover and hydrogeologic strata in a karst landscape in Winona County, Minnesota, USA	CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES												Karst aquifers are important groundwater resources, but are vulnerable to contamination due to relatively rapid subsurface transport. Springs, points where the landscape and water table intersect and cold groundwater discharges, link aquifer systems with land surfaces and water bodies. As such, in many regions, they are critical to the viability of lakes, streams and cold-water fish communities. An understanding of where springs are located is important to watershed, fishery and environmental management efforts in karst regions. To better understand spatial distribution of springs and as a potential method for identifying variables that characterize locations of springs for improved land and watershed management, a nearest-neighbor analysis and a discriminant function analysis (DFA) of springs were conducted in Winona County, Minnesota, USA, a karst landscape. Nearest-neighbor analysis examined the spatial spring distribution. Twenty-two variables describing the locations of springs were analyzed to ascertain their ability to discriminate correct aquifer unit or bedrock unit classification for each spring. Springs were clumped with the highest densities in the lowest elevations. Springs were correctly assigned to aquifer units and bedrock units with eight and 11 landscape variables, respectively. Forest land cover was the only land cover type contributing to spring discrimination. Consideration of upland human activities, particularly in forested areas, on spring discharge along with a better understanding of characteristics describing spring locations could lead to better management activities that locate and protect springs and their important contributions to regional ecohydrology.

Six experiments were conducted in the fall, a period that is characterized by thermocline deepening, erosion of the hypolimnion, and eventual introduction of high concentration of reduced substances into the epilimnion. An additional experiment was conducted in spring. In comparison to net O-2 evolution, the tracer-based methods severely underestimated primary productivity in the fall. This is indicated by unusually high NOP: (OP)-O-18 and NOP: (CP)-C-14 ratios (1-2.2 and 2-4, respectively). The latter is considerably different than the typical values of aquatic environments (similar to 1.4). In contrast to these ratios, the (OP)-O-18: (CP)-C-14 appears normal (1.6-2.9) and not significantly different from previous results in the lake. Ammonium was the major nitrogen source in the fall experiments, and there is no reason to assume that the cellular composition of phytoplankton was exceptional. It is therefore unlikely that the high NOP: (CP)-C-14 ratio represents genuine ratios of oxygen and carbon metabolism. We suggest that an explanation accounting for the high values of both NOP: (OP)-O-18 and NOP: (CP)-C-14 can be slow diffusion of the tracers in and out of phytoplankton cells.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JAN	2007	52	1					329	337		10.4319/lo.2007.52.1.0329	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2007.52.1.0329													WOS:000243795400029

We analyze the long-term evolution of ice conditions using historical data and recent observations from satellite altimetry and radiometry for 1992-2004 for northern, middle, and southern Baikal. These data show a recent (since the 1990s) tendency for colder winters, with earlier ice formation, later ice break-up, and ice duration increase. These observations are in agreement with the long-period cycles of air temperature variability (warming between the 1970s and 1990s, with a cooling phase afterwards). We then compare air temperature data from meteorological stations to ERA-40 reanalysis and suggest that ERA-40 data can be used to assess seasonal and interannual changes of air temperature for Lake Baikal. The ERA-40 data also indicate a recent tendency for colder winters and for warmer summers. We further analyze how the ice regime is influenced by air temperature and how this influence is affected by dynamic (wind field, currents) and other (bathymetry, precipitation, etc.) factors. We estimate the relationship between air temperature parameters and the timing of ice events (ice formation and fast ice duration) and show that air temperature has the strongest effect on the ice regime. Dynamic and other factors interfere with the thermal influence, resulting in a change of ice formation dates and ice duration compared to the relationship that takes into account only the influence of air temperature.					legresy, benoit/K-6673-2018; Kouraev, Alexei/A-4493-2014	Kouraev, Alexei/0000-0003-2013-1908													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2007	52	3					1268	1286		10.4319/lo.2007.52.3.1268	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2007.52.3.1268													WOS:000246690000033
J	Sass, GG; LaMarche, ST; Feiner, ZS				Sass, Greg G.; LaMarche, Samuel T.; Feiner, Zachary S.			Do angler catch and harvest rates differ between open water and ice anglers in Wisconsin?	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Understanding seasonal differences in species-specific vulnerabilities to recreational angling can be important for informing sustainable fisheries management practices, like fishing seasons or season-specific regulations. How-ever, comparisons of angler catch and harvest rates among seasons with disparate modes of fishing, like open water and ice angling in north-temperate lakes, are lacking. We used all available Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources point-intercept creel survey data during 1990-2020 to test for seasonal differences in the fisheries for five species targeted by open water and ice anglers in Wisconsin, USA, lakes (black crappie Pomoxis nigromaculatus, bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, northern pike Esox lucius, walleye Sander vitreus, yellow perch Perca flavescens). Specifically, we tested for: 1) species-specific differences in mean open water versus ice angling catch and harvest rates; 2) trends in species-specific mean open water versus ice angling catch and harvest rates during 1990-2020; and 3) monthly patterns in mean species-specific angler effort and catch rates. Mean angler catch rates of the five study species were significantly higher during the open water season and mostly temporally stable - only black crappie and bluegill open water catch rates and black crappie ice season catch rates signif-icantly increased during 1990-2020. Mean angler harvest rates were significantly higher in the open water season for black crappie, bluegill, and walleye. Harvest rates were significantly higher during the ice season for northern pike and did not differ between seasons for yellow perch. Harvest rates were mostly temporally stable across species, although harvest rates declined for bluegill ice fishing and yellow perch in both seasons. Species-specific angler effort and catch rates mostly corresponded with seasonal (spring/early summer) vulnerabilities of our study species, although higher winter effort and catch rate patterns for northern pike and yellow perch may suggest unique harvest preferences for those species. Our results suggest that ice angling should not be assumed to have a negligible influence on fish populations in north-temperate lakes, fisheries-dependent and-independent monitoring data should be jointly considered when assessing fish population status, research on the human dimensions of ice fisheries is critically needed, and angler knowledge of seasonal fish vulnerabilities are generally coupled with higher fish catch rates.

J	Dorcas, ME; Peterson, CR; Flint, MET				Dorcas, ME; Peterson, CR; Flint, MET			The thermal biology of digestion in rubber boas (Charina bottae): Physiology, behavior, and environmental constraints	PHYSIOLOGICAL ZOOLOGY												Coadaptation predicts a match between the thermal physiology and thermoregulatory behavior of reptiles. We tested this prediction by studying the digestive biology of rubber boas (Charina bottae). We measured the thermal dependence of gastric digestive rate and passage rate in rubber boas from 10 degrees C to 35 degrees C. We examined the effect of digestion on their thermal preference by measuring the temperatures of C. bottae in a thermal gradient before and after feeding. While the passage rates calculated from the body temperatures of digesting snakes were higher than the passage rates calculated from the body temperatures of nondigesting snakes, there was no difference in calculated digestive rates. These results indicate that the thermoregulatory behavior of C. bottae may be more tightly correlated with factors affecting passage rate than with digestive rate alone. Results of simulating the constraints of the thermal environment on the digestive biology of C. bottae showed that digestion would lake more than twice as long in the spring as in the summer. In addition, during the summer, snakes thermoregulating as digesting snakes would pass food 12% faster than those thermoregulating as nondigesting snakes, These results demonstrate how interpretation of laboratory studies can be improved when combined with measurements of appropriate environmental conditions.

J	NIEMINSKI, EC; FENHAUS, SL				NIEMINSKI, EC; FENHAUS, SL			PILOT-STUDY ON TREATMENT OF SURFACE-WATER FOR GROUNDWATER INJECTION	JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION												A groundwater recharge demonstration project sponsored by the US Bureau of Reclamation is being conducted by the Salt Lake County Water Conservancy District in Utah. Treated surface water will be injected in winter into the aquifer through injection wells and recovered through separate wells during the peak summer months. The conveyance capacity of the project will be 1,000 gpm (5.5 mil L/d). The water will have to meet drinking water criteria before it is injected. To satisfy this requirement, a pilot study, described in this article, was performed from February to June 1990 to determine the best technology for treating the water before injection. Results of jar tests indicated that optimum treatment can be achieved using alum, polymer, and potassium permanganate and that a dual-media filter outperformed a liquid filter bag. Disinfection with ultraviolet light was selected to be the last treatment prior to injection. On the basis of pilot-scale testing, a demonstration treatment plant was designed and built. The actual recharge demonstration project will begin in the winter of 1991-92. At the end of this three-year project, recommendations for a full-scale project will be made.

Thus, these springs may host phylogenetically novel microorganisms with potential use in biotechnology. With this hypothesis in mind, we examined the microbial composition of four thermal springs of the world-renowned spa town of Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad), Czechia, which differ in their temperature and chemical composition. Results Microbial profiling using 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed the presence of phylogenetically novel taxa at various taxonomic levels, spanning from genera to phyla. Many sequences belonged to novel classes within the phyla Hydrothermae, Altiarchaeota, Verrucomicrobia, and TA06. Cultivation-based methods employing oligotrophic media resulted in the isolation of 44 unique bacterial isolates. These include strains that withstand concentrations of up to 12% NaClw/v in cultivation media or survive a temperature of 100 degrees C, as well as hitherto uncultured bacterial species belonging to the genera Thermomonas, Paenibacillus, and Cellulomonas. These isolates harbored stress response genes that allow them to thrive in the extreme environment of thermal springs. Conclusions Our study is the first to analyze the overall microbial community composition of the renowned Karlovy Vary thermal springs. We provide insight into yet another level of uniqueness of these springs. In addition to their unique health benefits and cultural significance, we demonstrate that these springs harbor phylogenetically distinct microorganisms with unusual life strategies. Our findings open up avenues for future research with the promise of a deeper understanding of the metabolic potential of these microorganisms.

J	Wang, LC				Wang, Liang-Chi			Using Paleoecological Data to Inform the Conservation Strategy for Floristic Diversity and Isoetes taiwanensis in Northern Taiwan	DIVERSITY-BASEL												Paleoecological data can be used to inform nature conservation practice. Dream Lake (DL) is the best-preserved peat bog in the Tatun Volcanic Group of northern Taiwan. We analyzed continuous pollen and charcoal data from a well-dated sediment core from DL to reconstruct the changes in climate, lacustrine condition, and floristic diversity during the last 4500 cal BP. An absence of volcanic ash from all sediments indicates weak volcanic activity. Significant changes in lithology and pollen composition show that DL changed from a deep lake to a shallow peat bog from 3000 cal BP onwards. The palynological diversity index was negatively correlated with fire frequency. A substantial decline in Isoetes (quillwort) spores suggests increased vulnerability during the peat bog period. Natural terrestrialization will lower the mean water depth of DL below the minimum required for Isoetes taiwanensis survival within 300 years. Our findings indicate that winter precipitation driven by intense East Asian winter monsoons is the critical force determining the long-term variation in floristic diversity and abundance of I. taiwanensis. This long-term ecological history of DL, derived using paleoecological techniques, will be used to inform conservation practice in the Tatun Volcanic Group.

The snail recruits in January, lives for up to 21 months, is associated with all water plant species and is found in areas devoid of macroscopic plants. It is host to several trematode species. Avian schistosome infections appear in the spring when echinostome prevalence is low, and a decrease in schistosome prevalence may be correlated with an increase in echinostome prevalence during the summer. A multiple-kind lottery model analysis of parasite species richness implies that interspecific interactions may be occurring in the host snail during the months of December and January.																			0022-149X					DEC	1998	72	4					319	324		10.1017/S0022149X00016679	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022149X00016679								9858628					WOS:000077881300009

Effects of local climate and hydrological conditions on the thermal regime of a reservoir at Tropic of Cancer, in southern China	WATER RESEARCH												Thermal regime is strongly associated with hydrodynamics in water, and it plays an important role in the dynamics of water quality and ecosystem succession of stratified reservoirs. Changes in both climate and hydrological conditions can modify thermal regimes. Liuxihe Reservoir (23 degrees 45'50 '' N; 113 degrees 46'52 '' E) is a large, stratified and deep reservoir in Guangdong Province, located at the Tropic of Cancer of southern China. The reservoir is a warm monomictic water body with a long period of summer stratification and a short period of mixing in winter. The vertical distribution of suspended particulate material and nutrients are influenced strongly by the thermal structure and the associated flow fields. The hypolimnion becomes anoxic in the stratified period, increasing the release of nutrients from the bottom sediments. Fifty-one years of climate and reservoir operational observations are used here to show the marked changes in local climate and reservoir operational schemes. The data show increasing air temperature and more violent oscillations in inflow volumes in the last decade, while the inter-annual water level fluctuations tend to be more moderate. To quantify the effects of changes in climate and hydrological conditions on thermal structure, we used a numerical simulation model to create scenarios incorporating different air temperatures, inflow volumes, and water levels. The simulations indicate that water column stability, the duration of the mixing period, and surface and outflow temperatures are influenced by both natural factors and by anthropogenic factors such as climate change and reservoir operation schemes. Under continuous warming and more stable storage in recent years, the simulations indicate greater water column stability and increased duration of stratification, while irregular large discharge events may reduce stability and lead to early mixing in autumn. Our results strongly suggest that more attention should be focused on water quality in years of extreme climate variation and hydrological conditions, and selective withdrawal of deep water may provide an efficient means to reduce internal loading in warm years.

Samples were collected at 2 sites, Bahia Nueva and Bahia Camarones (Chubut, Argentina), and exposed to solar radiation for 4 to 6 h under 3 quality radiation treatments (i.e. PAR + UVR, 280-700 nm; PAR + UR-A, 320-700 nm; and PAR only, 400-700 nm), and under 6 to 8 levels of ambient irradiance (i.e. by using 0 to 5-7 layers of neutral density screens). Samples collected at Bahia Nueva had relatively high P-max values (similar to3-4 mug C (mug chl a)(-1) h(-1)) during the pre-bloorn period (i.e. late summer to late fall) and relatively low values (similar to1.5-2.5 mug C (mug chl a)(-1) h(-1)) during the post-bloom period (i.e. late spring to early summer); similar results were observed in samples collected at Bahia Camarones. The light saturation parameter E-k, on the other hand, did not show a clear pattern and values ranging from 50 to 400 mumol m(-2) s(-1) were observed throughout the study period. High P-max values were Significantly correlated with the concentration of large diatoms (R-2 = 0.6, p < 0.05), the taxonomic group that characterized the pre-bloom period. UVR significantly reduced P-max values (p < 0.05) during the pre-bloom but not during the post-bloom period. UVR also significantly affected E-k (p < 0.05) in all Bahia Camarones samples but only in some from Bahia Nueva. UV-A was responsible for the bulk of photosynthetic inhibition throughout the study period; the highest UV-A-induced integrated inhibition values in the water column were similar to16.5 and 7% for Bahia Nueva and Bahia Camarones, respectively. On the other hand, UV-B-induced photosynthetic inhibition reached maximum values of 2.3 and 3.9% for Bahia Nueva and Bahia Camarones, respectively. Since under certain environmental conditions P vs. E parameters can be significantly reduced by UVR, we suggest that remote sensing algorithms using these parameters should also consider the impact of UVR in their estimates of primary production.

J	Munroe, JS; Mickelson, DM				Munroe, JS; Mickelson, DM			Last Glacial Maximum equilibrium-line altitudes and paleoclimate, northern Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Nineteen former valley glaciers were reconstructed for their Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) extents in the northern Uinta Mountains, Utah, U.S.A. Mean equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) calculated by four methods (accumulation-area ratio, toe-headwall altitude ratio, lateral moraines and cirque floors) range from 3050 to 3300 in a.s.l. Modern mean summer temperatures (T-s) at the ELAs range from 8.7degrees to 11.2degreesC, while modern winter precipitation (P) ranges from 354 to 590 mm snow water equivalent (SWE). Based on the difference in elevation of mean ELAs across the range, LGM P values must have ranged from 940 to 3040 mm SWE, assuming the modern summer lapse rate was the same during the LGM. A T(s)depression of 5.5degreesC is required for these precipitation values to plot in the range of modern ELA values. The reconstructed increase in P at the western end of the range is 10 times the modern increase, reflecting the influence of pluvial Lake Bonneville. Assuming ELA depression (DeltaELA) resulted from this P increase and a uniform 5.5degreesC T-s decrease, the regional LGM DeltaELA was approximately 900 m.																			0022-1430	1727-5652					2002	48	161					257	266		10.3189/172756502781831331	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756502781831331													WOS:000179941700009

To elucidate the functional role of ciliates, we investigated variations in their functional traits during colonization. Our research revealed that ciliate colonization process differs significantly between spring and summer, mainly due to differences in water temperature and hydrological regime. The most pronounced influence of temperature-initiated differences was observed during the initial phase of colonization, during which faster colonization with different pioneer species, and more diverse and abundant ciliate community characterized the summer initial phase. Hydrological changes significantly affected periphytic communities during the intermediate and late phases, resulting in different patterns of the colonization process. Mitigation of suspended food particles during flooding periods led to a decrease in ciliate abundance and the dominance of mobile benthivore ciliates (raptorial and filter feeders), whilst during more stable periods of low water, sessile planktivores (filter feeders) that consume suspended particles, dominated. They are considered to be main representatives of periphytic ciliates in floodplain lakes, playing a significant role in the pelagic-benthic coupling. The results of the present study offer new insights into the ecology and functional role of periphytic ciliates in a floodplain ecosystems of temperate regions.

Cladocera (Crustacea: Branchiopoda) of Cat Tien National Park, South Vietnam	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Cladocera of Cat Tien National Park, South Vietnam, and the surrounding agricultural area, were surveyed during the spring of 2009 (onset of the wet season) and autumn 2010 (end of the wet season). The studied water bodies included two large lakes (Bau Sau and Bau Chim), small lakes and ponds, temporary pools, rivers and streams, as well as rice fields and ponds in an agricultural area beyond the boundaries of the National Park. Fifty three species of Cladocera were found, 18 of them new for Vietnam. Distribution and taxonomical status of the species are discussed. Of the recorded species, 58.5% (31) were found only in the National Park, 34% (18) both in the National Park and the agricultural area, and only 7.5% (4) exclusively in the agricultural area. Of the 20 species new for Vietnam, only one was found both in the National Park and the agricultural area, all others were found in the National Park only. Such a difference can be directly attributed to the loss of natural habitats (forest ponds and streams) in agricultural areas and to the pollution by pesticides. Our study shows the importance of surveys in pristine and protected areas, for the full evaluation of regional microcrustacean richness.

Seventy one percent of buzzard broods were positive for Frenkelia-like sporocysts. Prevalence increased with nestling age and number, and reached 100% at nest desertion. The prevalences of brain sarcosporidia (Frenkelia glareoli and F. microti) in rodents were higher in ecotones than in open habitats, in spring than in autumn, in heavier individuals, and on 2nd and 3rd day of trapping. These factors were significant although the overall prevalence was different in different host species (Clethrionomys glareolus, Microtus arvalis, Apodemus flavicollis, A. sylvaticus). The prevalences of muscle sarcosporidia in rodents and Sorex araneus were also positively influenced by habitat and host weight, while only for M. arvalis was the prevalence higher in spring. Host sex, locality and year did not show any effects on the prevalences. Besides two Frenkelia species, five Sarcocystis species were found (S. putorii, S. cernae, S. cf sebeki, and two undescribed species from C. glareolus and Sorex araneus). Natural infections of C. glareolus with E microti and of A. flavicollis with F glareoli are reported for the first time. Our study demonstrates that prevalences of brain and muscle sarcosporidians in small mammals are influenced by similar factors (intermediate host habitat and age) in different host-parasite combinations.

The organic composition of biofilms is regarded as the determining factor in the sorption mechanism of biolilm organic carbon fractions; however, its role is not well known. Here, the sorption of phenanthrene and ofloxacin was modeled with classic and emerging organic contaminants, respectively, by comparatively investigating nine type of freshwater biofilms cultured in a river, lake, and reservoir in spring, summer, and autumn. The chemical features of the nine biofilms were analyzed using elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance. Results showed that the freshwater biofilms were aliphatic-rich natural amorphous solid substances with O-containing functional groups, and their surface polarity was significantly lower than their bulk polarity. All the isotherms of phenanthrene and ofloxacin sorption by the biofilms were linear. The organic carbon-normalized partition coefficient values for phenanthrene and ofloxadn on the nine biofilms ranged from 91.9 to 364.2 L g(-1) and 32 to 43.2 L g(-1), respectively. The van der Waals interaction between a majority of aliphatic carbon (73.4%-83.9%) in biofilms and the two sorbates was much stronger than pi-pi interactions between a minority of aromatic carbon (12.7%-21.7%) and sorbates. The surface polarity of the biofilms regulated polar interactions induding the hydrogen bonding and electron donoracceptor interactions. Both the aliphatic carbon and surface polarity in the biofilms enhanced the sorption of phenanthrene and ofloxacin. The sorption characteristics and mechanisms of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and antibiotics on biofilms shown in our present and previous studies are different from those of other ubiquitous natural solid materials such as soils and sediments. This study provides insight into the importance of aliphatic carbon fractions of freshwater biofilms for the sorption of classic and emerging organic contaminants. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

J	PHILLIPS, EC				PHILLIPS, EC			COMPARISON OF THE ZOOPLANKTON OF A LAKE AND STREAM IN NORTHWEST ARKANSAS	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Zooplankters were sampled from Lake Fayetteville and the Illinois River from March 1992 through March 1993. Zooplankton densities were significantly greater in the lake habitat than in the stream. Mean annual density was 633 +/- 86/L in Lake Fayetteville, compared with 9 +/- l/L in the Illinois River. Significant seasonal differences in density were also observed. Maximum density was observed during fall, and minimum density during spring. There was also a significant two way interaction between habitat and season. This interaction indicated a much greater seasonal variation in zooplankton density in Lake Fayetteville than in the Illinois River. Depth distribution also was different between the lake and stream habitats. In Lake Fayetteville zooplankters were most abundant in the upper three meters of the water column, and abundance decreased significantly with water depth. The opposite was true of zooplankton abundance in the Illinois River. Plankters were most abundant nearest the bottom, and plankton density decreased significantly closer to the surface.																			0270-5060					DEC	1995	10	4					337	341		10.1080/02705060.1995.9663456	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1995.9663456													WOS:A1995TJ40400004

The occurrence frequency of cold surge is about one event per year and 60% of the total events occurred during the former period, before 1989. During the cold surge, the pressure pattern shows more dominant east-west dipole circulation pattern in the lower troposphere and the effect of upper level trough is stronger than normal cases. Temperature falling pattern over Korea shows that the pattern opposite to the temperature structure over Lake Baikal and temperature change has opposite signs between the low-middle level and upper level, with the boundary at 400 hPa. The analysis of heat source shows that atmospheric cooling by cold advection during the cold surge is balanced by adiabatic warming due to downward motion, indicating that the movement path of cold core is associated with that of heat sink. Therefore, the movement mechanism of the heat source and sink should be well known for understanding the maintenance mechanism of cold surge and predicting cold surges																			1225-6692	2287-4518				AUG	2005	26	6					560	572																WOS:000437559800010

Thus, comprehensive land use plans developed integrating water quality models would certainly provide better solutions for the sustainability of natural water resources. In this study, the inner bay of Fethiye, located along the south-west coast of Turkey, is selected as a case to identify the land use and water quality relationship. At six locations in the Bay, various physical and chemical parameters (e.g. temperature, density, salinity, pH, concentrations of dissolved oxygen, nitrite, nitrate and total dissolved solid) were monitored by monthly field and laboratory measurements for four months during summer and autumn seasons. The measured nitrite, nitrate and dissolved oxygen concentrations were then compared with the estimations of the water quality sub model of HYDROTAM-3D, which is an implicit baroclinic 3D numerical model developed to simulate hydrodynamics, transport processes and basic water quality parameters in coastal waters. The paper presents results on monitored water quality parameters and model estimations, and discusses the sea water quality of the inner bay of Fethiye emphasizing the impacts of land use patterns in the town.

J	TANAKA, Y				TANAKA, Y			ACTIVITIES AND PROPERTIES OF CELLULASE AND XYLANASE ASSOCIATED WITH PHRAGMITES LEAF-LITTER IN A SEAWATER LAKE	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The activities and properties of cellulases and xylanases associated with Phragmites communis leaves were followed during the course of their decomposition from autumn to summer in a seawater lake. Cellulases and xylanases of low optimum pH (4 or less) were detected on aerial dead leaves before submergence. These enzymes remained on the leaves immediately after submergence, but were replaced by enzymes with a higher optimum pH (about 5.5 to 6.5), the activity of which increased rapidly during the initial two weeks. The enzyme activities then declined with water temperature until about day 100, but gradually increased again thereafter. This successive change in enzyme activities closely correlated with that of the decomposition rates of cellulose and xylan. The molecular weight distribution of the cellulases and xylanases changed markedly in the latter half of the experimental period, which suggested a change in the flora of active decomposer microorganisms.																			0018-8158					JUN 28	1993	262	2					65	75		10.1007/BF00007507	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00007507													WOS:A1993LR63300001

In this study, inherent optical property (IOP)-centered algorithms were developed to estimate the concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chla, [mg/m(3)]) and suspended particulate matter (SPM, [g/m(3)]) and the Chla/SPM ratio (an indicator of the suspended particulate composition) of 118 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers (MLYHR) of China using Sentinel-3A/OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) data collected from August 2016 to July 2018. The mean Chla concentration and Chla/SPM ratio were high in summer and low in winter, while the mean SPM peaked in winter and decreased in summer. The 94 lakes in the Yangtze River basin had a higher mean Chla concentration (30.94 +/- 14.84) and Chla/SPM ratio (0.97 x 10(-3) +/- 0.60 x 10(-3)), but a lower mean SPM (44.87 +/- 12.61) than the 24 lakes in the Huai River basin (Chla: 27.35 +/- 12.18, Chla/SPM: 0.79 x 10(-3) +/- 0.48 x 10(-3), SPM: 47.31 +/- 13.40). Regarding the mean values of each lake, Chla and Chla/SPM ratio correlated well with temperature, whereas the wind speed and precipitation had little effect on the variations of suspended particulate matter. Moreover, shipping transportation and sand dredging activities affected the spatial distribution of Chla, SPM, and Chla/SPM in several large lakes (e.g., Lake Poyang and Lake Dongting). Chla/SPM related well with other proxies that express the suspended particulate composition, and had a significant correlation with the Chla-specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton at 443 nm (a(ph)*(443)). The remotely sensed concentration and composition of suspended particulate matter can provide a comprehensive reference for water quality monitoring and expand our knowledge of the trophic status of the lakes.

A 9,000 Year History of Seal Hunting on Lake Baikal, Siberia: The Zooarchaeology of Sagan-Zaba II	PLOS ONE												Sagan-Zaba II, a habitation site on the shore of Siberia's Lake Baikal, contains a record of seal hunting that spans much of the Holocene, making it one of the longest histories of seal use in North Asia. Zooarchaeological analyses of the 16,000 Baikal seal remains from this well-dated site clearly show that sealing began here at least 9000 calendar years ago. The use of these animals at Sagan-Zaba appears to have peaked in the Middle Holocene, when foragers used the site as a spring hunting and processing location for yearling and juvenile seals taken on the lake ice. After 4800 years ago, seal use declined at the site, while the relative importance of ungulate hunting and fishing increased. Pastoralists began occupying Sagan-Zaba at some point during the Late Holocene, and these groups too utilized the lake's seals. Domesticated animals are increasingly common after about 2000 years ago, a pattern seen elsewhere in the region, but spring and some summer hunting of seals was still occurring. This use of seals by prehistoric herders mirrors patterns of seal use among the region's historic and modern groups. Overall, the data presented in the paper demonstrate that Lake Baikal witnessed thousands of years of human use of aquatic resources.					; Goriunova, Olga/L-1252-2017; Novikov, Aleksey/L-1315-2017; Weber, Andrzej/F-9780-2016	Gorunova, Ol'ga/0000-0002-5159-0894; Novikov, Aleksei/0000-0001-8965-8957; 													1932-6203					MAY 26	2015	10	5							e0128314	10.1371/journal.pone.0128314	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0128314								26009890					WOS:000355183900222
J	Altahan, MF; Nower, M				Altahan, Mahmoud Fatehy; Nower, Mohamed			AutoGIS processing for site selection for solar pond development as efficient water treatment plants in Egypt	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												The increasing demand for renewable and environmentally friendly energy sources is a top priority for many countries around the world. It is obvious that renewable solar energy will help to meet most of the energy demand in the coming years. A solar pond is a huge Salt artificial Lake that serves as a solar energy collection system. However, site selection is a critical factor that affects the effectiveness and lifetime of a solar pond. Here, we present an innovative methodology for site selection based on three environmental factors, including direct solar irradiance (DNI), temperature, and wind speed. Our approach uses Python programming and clustering analysis with several libraries, including Pandas, Geopandas, Rasterio, Osgeo, and Sklearn, to analyse and process data collected over a 30-year period from NASA power. This method was applied to the geographic boundaries of Egypt, but the methods can be applied to any spatial context if the same dataset is available. The results show that Egypt has a potential land area of 500 km(2) suitable for solar ponds construction along the border with Sudan throughout the year, including 2000 km(2) in winter (between January and March), 800 km(2) in spring (between April and June), 900 km(2) in summer (between July and September), and the largest area of 3700 km(2) (between October and December), most of which is located in the south of the Eastern Desert and around the Nile River. Notably, the northwestern region, close to the Mediterranean Sea on the border with Libya, exhibits suitability for solar pond development, with consistent performance throughout the year. Our results provide an efficient way for GIS and data processing and could be useful for implementing new software to find the best location for solar ponds development. This could be beneficial for those interested in investing in renewable energy and using solar ponds as an efficient water treatment plant.

J	Vizzini, S; Mazzola, A				Vizzini, S; Mazzola, A			Seasonal variations in the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (13C/12C and 15N/14N) of primary producers and consumers in a western Mediterranean coastal lagoon	MARINE BIOLOGY												Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (C-13/C-12 and N-15/N-14) of primary producers and consumers were investigated seasonally throughout 1999, in order to describe the food web in a western Mediterranean coastal lagoon (Lake of Sabaudia, central Italy). Particulate organic matter and algal material (seagrass epiphytes and macroalgae) seem to constitute the main food sources for primary consumers (zooplankton and small benthic invertebrates, respectively) throughout the sampling year, while the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa appears to play a negligible trophic role. As regards the ichthyofauna, carbon stable isotopes differentiated between planktivore and benthivore fish species. However, a benthic-pelagic coupling seems to occur, with some fish of higher trophic levels feeding both on benthic and pelagic materials. Analysis of variance showed that the interaction between the three main factors (speciesxsizexseason) significantly affects the isotopic composition of fish, suggesting the presence of intra- and inter-specific resource partitioning. Wide seasonal variations in the isotopic composition were observed in organic matter sources, invertebrates and fish, with a general trend towards depleted values in winter and enriched values in summer. The winter depletion of organic matter sources may be due to several environmental factors and seems to be mirrored in the upper trophic levels. Primary producers and invertebrates are known to have shorter time-integrated isotopic signatures than vertebrates, yet fish also exhibited seasonal isotopic differences. We concluded that the examined fish species can assume a new muscle isotopic signature relatively quickly in response to changes in the isotopic composition of their diet and/or diet shifts.																			0025-3162					MAY	2003	142	5					1009	1018		10.1007/s00227-003-1027-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-003-1027-6													WOS:000183724000018

In recent years, increased numbers of coliform bacteria have been observed in these surface waters. In our monitoring study we analyzed two drinking water reservoirs (Klingenberg and Kleine Kinzig Reservoir) over a two-year period in 2018 and 2019. We detected high numbers of coliform bacteria up to 2.4 x 10(4) bacteria per 100 ml during summer months, representing an increase of four orders of magnitude compared to winter. Diversity decreased to one or two species that dominated the entire water body, namely Enterobacter asburiae and Lelliottia spp., depending on the reservoir. Interestingly, the same, very closely related strains have been found in several reservoirs from different regions. Fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli and enterococci could only be detected in low concentrations. Furthermore, fecal marker genes were not detected in the reservoir, indicating that high concentrations of coliform bacteria were not due to fecal contamination. Microbial community revealed Frankiales and Burkholderiales as dominant orders. Enterobacterales, however, only had a frequency of 0.04% within the microbial community, which is not significantly affected by the extreme change in coliform bacteria number. Redundancy analysis revealed water temperature, oxygen as well as nutrients and metals (phosphate, manganese) as factors affecting the dominant species. We conclude that this sudden increase of coliform bacteria is an autochthonic process that can be considered as a mass proliferation or "coliform bloom" within the reservoir. It is correlated to higher water temperatures in summer and is therefore expected to occur more frequently in the near future, challenging drinking water production. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												In Lake Constance, Eurasian bream Abramis brama (L.) spawn in very shallow littoral areas by the beginning of May. They attach their adhesive eggs to pebble and cobble substratum at <40 cm depth. Increasing water levels before spawning inundate bare substratum to which bream eggs may attach better than to deeper substratum covered by epilithon. Consequently, the water level increase prior to spawning should determine the amount of pristine spawning substratum available to bream and thus influence their breeding success. In order to test this hypothesis, the influence of hydrology and climate on the abundance of age-0 bream was combined with the results from field investigations on the egg survival and abundance of age-0 bream. A strong positive correlation between the mean water level increase during the spawning season of bream (April-May) and the abundance of juvenile bream was found. In contrast, the absolute water level during spawning and during the nursery stage in summer, the cumulative temperature during the egg, larval and juvenile stages and two North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices did not affect the abundance of juvenile bream. The field investigations confirmed that bream eggs attach better to and have higher survival rates on bare substratum than on substratum with epilithon cover. Accordingly, eggs within a spawning habitat of bream were most abundant between 10 and 20 cm depth, where the epilithon cover was lower than at depths exceeding 30 cm. The results of this study confirm an adverse influence of epilithon cover on the attachment and subsequent survival of bream eggs and emphasize the importance of spring inundations for the successful breeding of the bream.

J	Muluk, CB; Beklioglu, M				Muluk, CB; Beklioglu, M			Absence of typical diel vertical migration in Daphnia: varying role of water clarity, food, and dissolved oxygen in Lake Eymir, Turkey	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a complex and dynamic behaviour against predation because the reaction of migrating organisms to light intensity plays a primary role, but is modified by other factors. In the relatively shallow but thermally stratified Lake Eyrnir, Daphnia pulex de Geers utilized vertical refugia afforded by the hypolimnion during both day and night. Differences in general vulnerability to fish predation determined the differences in their mean residence depths (MRDs) of different population categories such as most conspicuous and vulnerable individuals of adult with eggs inhabited the deepest depth, whereas juveniles stayed close the thermocline. In late spring, profoundly high amplitude of displacement within the hypolimnion, probably due to the hypolimnion being well-lit and relatively well-oxygenated for the fish and rather unsafe for the large-sized daphnids, was recorded. Therefore, the large-sized daphnids daytime refuge was close to the bottom whereas at night they moved upward to benefit from warmer water temperature along with food availability in the presence of fish predation but still remained below the thermocline. In summer, the insignificant amplitude of the hypolimnetic, which later became epilimnetic, displacements were probably due to the near-anoxic condition found below the thermocline. This might have deterred the fish, thus providing a safer refuge for daphnids in the below thermocline, which afterwards became the above thermocline. Low oxygen availability was regarded as the summer proximate factor. The abundant food and warmer water conditions found in the below/above thermocline also accounted for absence of DVM in summer. Consequently, this study suggests that DVM by Daphnia is an adaptation that is plastic to changing environmental conditions.					beklioglu, meryem/ABA-1630-2020														0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR 15	2005	537						125	133		10.1007/s10750-004-2789-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-2789-7													WOS:000230589900013

Mixing of Rhone River water in Lake Geneva (Switzerland-France) inferred from stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope profiles	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Depth profiles were sampled at different locations throughout Lake Geneva on a monthly and seasonal basis over the course of 2 years and analysed for their stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions. The isotopic compositions indicate an isotopic stratification in the metalimnion during summer and fall. This is related to mixing of Rhone River water, which in summer is dominated by snow and glacier melt waters, and lake water, with the latter having a homogenous isotopic composition. The observed interflow layer is 7-15 m thick and can be traced by the distinct stable isotope composition of the water for about 55 km throughout the lake as well as into shallow bay regions. Depth of the interflow layer close to the Rhone River mouth is similar to those previously described based on echo-soundings and turbidity profiles of sediment dispersion. In contrast to previous descriptions of the interflow within Lake Geneva, the stable isotope compositions allow for direct, natural tracing of the Rhone River water even in cases where the turbidity and conductivity measurements do not indicate such an interflow. In addition, the method allows for a quantification of the Rhone River and lake water in the interflow with the fraction of Rhone River water within the interflow estimated to be up to 37% in summer. The isotopic composition further indicates different vertical mixing processes within the two lake basins of Lake Geneva, related to the density gradients and local stability within the water column. The method may be applicable to other lakes in catchments with large differences in the topography as water that originates from high altitudes or glaciers has a distinct oxygen and hydrogen isotope composition compared to other sources of water originating at lower altitudes and/or from direct precipitation over the lake. Stable isotope measurements thus improve the understanding of the circulation of water within the lake, which is fundamental for an evaluation of the water residence times, dissolved pollutant and nutrient transport as well as oxygenation.

The spatiotemporal distribution of historical malaria cases in Sweden: a climatic perspective	MALARIA JOURNAL												BackgroundUnderstanding of the impacts of climatic variability on human health remains poor despite a possibly increasing burden of vector-borne diseases under global warming. Numerous socioeconomic variables make such studies challenging during the modern period while studies of climate-disease relationships in historical times are constrained by a lack of long datasets. Previous studies have identified the occurrence of malaria vectors, and their dependence on climate variables, during historical times in northern Europe. Yet, malaria in Sweden in relation to climate variables is understudied and relationships have never been rigorously statistically established. This study seeks to examine the relationship between malaria and climate fluctuations, and to characterise the spatio-temporal variations at parish level during severe malaria years in Sweden 1749-1859.MethodsSymptom-based annual malaria case/death data were obtained from nationwide parish records and military hospital records in Stockholm. Pearson (r(p)) and Spearman's rank (r(s)) correlation analyses were conducted to evaluate inter-annual relationship between malaria data and long meteorological series. The climate response to larger malaria events was further explored by Superposed Epoch Analysis, and through Geographic Information Systems analysis to map spatial variations of malaria deaths.ResultsThe number of malaria deaths showed the most significant positive relationship with warm-season temperature of the preceding year. The strongest correlation was found between malaria deaths and the mean temperature of the preceding June-August (r(s) = 0.57, p < 0.01) during the 1756-1820 period. Only non-linear patterns can be found in response to precipitation variations. Most malaria hot-spots, during severe malaria years, concentrated in areas around big inland lakes and southern-most Sweden.ConclusionsUnusually warm and/or dry summers appear to have contributed to malaria epidemics due to both indoor winter transmission and the evidenced long incubation and relapse time of P. vivax, but the results also highlight the difficulties in modelling climate-malaria associations. The inter-annual spatial variation of malaria hot-spots further shows that malaria outbreaks were more pronounced in the southern-most region of Sweden in the first half of the nineteenth century compared to the second half of the eighteenth century.					; Ljungqvist, Fredrik/JCE-6614-2023; Linderholm, Hans/N-1020-2013; Castenbrandt, Helene/O-4270-2017	Ingholt, Mathias Molbak/0000-0003-4635-1765; Hesson, Jenny/0000-0003-2489-4400; Charpentier Ljungqvist, Fredrik/0000-0003-0220-3947; Hildebrandt, Franziska/0000-0002-2673-1704; Linderholm, Hans/0000-0002-1522-8919; ankarklev, carl-johan/0000-0003-3170-8493; Castenbrandt, Helene/0000-0002-6058-0575; Seftigen, Kristina/0000-0001-5555-5757; Chen, Tzu Tung/0000-0002-4587-2203														1475-2875				MAY 1	2021	20	1							212	10.1186/s12936-021-03744-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12936-021-03744-9								33933085					WOS:000658933200001

While much research in this field has been undertaken in marine environments, more recent studies have identified rivers as major conveyors of plastic pollution from terrestrial into marine systems. However, reports on the levels and composition of microplastic and microfiber contamination in rivers of the Canadian prairie region, specifically the South Saskatchewan River (SSR), are scarce, which leaves this vital source of water for societies and ecosystems in a vulnerable state. To fill this gap, we obtained samples from seven sites along the Saskatchewan portion of the SSR, as well as three stormwater retention ponds (SRP) in the city of Saskatoon during the spring, summer, and fall of 2020. We used optical and Raman microscopy to enumerate and characterize particles in these samples. Total levels of particles and fibers in all samples ranged from 32 to 116 particles m(-3). Most particles (approximately 77%) were natural fibers, while polymers accounted for the remaining 33%. Average microplastic levels were lower (3.18 & PLUSMN; 3 particles m(-3)) downstream of Lake Diefenbaker, a large reservoir on the SSR, compared to upstream (12.0 & PLUSMN; 9 particles m(-3)). Retention of microplastics in the reservoir could explain the lower mean microplastic concentration of 4.43 & PLUSMN; 3 particles m(-3) recorded in the SSR compared to mean concentrations of 26.2 & PLUSMN; 18 particles m(-3) reported in the North Saskatchewan River, which is not dammed. This study is among the first to describe microplastic and microfiber levels in the SSR and thereby helps improve our understanding of this pervasive environmental contaminant on the Canadian prairies.

Young and adult trout were trapped and marked in both streams. About 5000 fish spawn in the outlet between mid-March and June; about 22,000 spawn in the inlet between late April and July. Outlet young either enter the lake by late summer or overwinter in the stream and enter the lake next spring or summer. Most inlet young enter the lake in their 1st year. Return as adults, of fish which had been clipped while entering the lake as young, indicated that about 94% of fish originating from each end homed to their parent stream. Because of the large number of inlet spawners, about a quarter of the outlet spawners are strays which had hatched in the inlet. Recovery of marked fish, movement of adults within the lake, and experimental transfer of adults and young between streams, all indicate that inlet and outlet spawners do not differ genetically in their responses to current. The biological and applied significance of homing, and its possible mechanisms, are discussed.																									1959	16	5					695	719		10.1139/f59-051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f59-051													WOS:A1959WZ52100005

Thus, a rapid development of certain phytoplankton groups is favoured at the beginning of the austral summer as a direct effect of the higher availability of light and nutrients after the ice thaw. Inputs of allochthonous organic matter from microbial mats and moss carpets distributed across the catchment also enhance the abundance of heterotrophic bacterioplankton. Indeed, the bacterioplankton abundance and the availability of organic matter are correlated for each studied depth, revealing a possible differential use of the organic matter. Additionally, the availability and dynamics of different types of dissolved organic matter (autochthonous and allochthonous) may influence the diversity and abundance of the different bacterioplankton groups along the water column and throughout the summer, with a relative abundance of each group that differs between the surface and bottom waters. The study of DGGE patterns reveals the existence of changes in the abundance of different bacterial taxa during the summer and the different relative importance of each bacterial group at each depth. This result can also be related to the organic matter dynamics during the austral summer, as evidenced by the correlation between the concentration of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and abundance of bacterioplankton at each depth. Therefore, the regional temperature regime, which allows ice thaw of the lakes and their catchments during summer, plays a key role in the onset of biological processes and the length of the productive season throughout the austral summer.

The research was conducted in arid land of Lakes region in Turkey during 2006-2008 growing seasons. The experiment was set up as randomized complete block design with a split-plot design with 3 replications. Triticale cultivars were main plots, the nitrogen were subplots split within main plots. In the study, winter/alternative Triticale cultivars (Tacettinbey, Tatlicak-97 and Karma-2000) were used. Nitrogen was applied as conventional (2 equal amounts at the time of seed sowing and tillering stage) and late-season foliar N application (1/3 of was applied during sowing, 1/3 at the tillering stage and the rest was applied to foliar at postpollination growth stage). In the study, effects of late-season foliar N application on grain yield and protein content of triticale were observed. Grain yield and protein content of triticale in both years of the study were significantly affected by N application timing. The results showed that the grain yield and grain protein content were higher in late-season foliar N application than conventional N application in both years of the study. Among the cultivars, the highest grain yield and protein content was obtained from Tatlicak-97 (2720 kg ha(-1)) and Karma-2000 (13.1%) cultivars, respectively. The highest grain yield was determined from Tatlicak cultivar x late-season N interaction (2646, 2987 and 2815 kg ha(-1), respectively) in both years and average of years. The highest protein content was determined from Karma-2000 cultivar x late-season N interaction (13.8, 13.9 and 13.9%, respectively) in both years and average of years. Between grain yield and protein content was determined significant (p <= 0.01) and positive connection (r(2) = 0.451).																			1680-5593					MAR	2009	8	3					579	586																WOS:000263801600034
J	Khan, TA				Khan, TA			Limnology of four saline lakes in western Victoria, Australia - II. Biological parameters	LIMNOLOGICA												Major biological parameters of four permanent (Lake Colac, Modewarre, Bolac and Tooliorook), shallow and slightly saline lakes in the volcanic plains of western Victoria, Australia recorded bi-monthly between November 1999-September 2001 are described. Chlorophyll a concentration ranged from 3-29 mug l(-1) with peaks in autumn. Phytoplankton taxa recorded were diverse, with Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta being common. Cyanobacterial blooms were recorded mostly in summer. Zooplankton abundance in the lakes ranged from 12-368 individuals per litre. Rotifera dominated Lake Bolac, Copepoda dominated Lake Modewarre and they co-dominated Lake Colac and Tooliorook. Zooplankton interactions with phytoplankton suggest that simple predator-prey relationships cannot fully explain the trends exhibited and that a more complex model was acting to regulate algal biomass. A decline in the abundance of zooplankton in summer in Lake Modewarre was attributed to predation by high number of exotic larval carp at that time of the year. A total of 25 benthic macroinvertebrate taxa were recorded from Lake Colac, 30 from Modewarre, 22 from Bolac and 35 from Tooliorook. Twenty-one of the 45 taxa identified occurred in at least three lakes. Nine of the 12 taxa that occurred in only one lake were from Lake Tooliorook. Simpson's diversity index was low in Lake Bolac when compared to other three lakes. Lake Modewarre had more benthic individuals (3246 Ind m(-2)) than other three lakes (range 624-1397 Ind m(-2)). The combined contribution of Ostracoda, Amphipoda and Gastropoda dominated the benthos in all the lakes throughout the study period. Macroinvertebrate taxa richness was higher in the present study lakes than recorded from the lakes in the region. Frequency of sampling and number of sampling sites seemed more important in determining species richness than the size and shallowness of the lakes.																			0075-9511	1873-5851				DEC	2003	33	4					327	339		10.1016/S0075-9511(03)80027-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(03)80027-0													WOS:000188696500010

Here, we used the proxies of TOC, delta(13)Corg, delta N-15, and leaf wax n-alkane delta C-13 values (delta C-13(wax)) to reconstruct the lake conditions, which, in turn, revealed patterns in monsoonal changes during the Holocene. Two distinct patterns of proxy changes were identified in the sedimentary profile. A marked shift in the delta C-13(wax) value at similar to 9.2 ka (thousand years ago) suggests the abrupt disappearance of C-4 plants, signaling the enhancement of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Between 9.2 and 1.8 ka, a nearly pure C-3 terrestrial ecosystem was present, with the climax at ca 7-6 ka. After ca 3 ka, fewer tropical species and a reappearance of C-4 plants at 1.8 ka indicate a weakened EASM in the late Holocene. The TOC concentration and delta N-15 value proxies appear to be associated with lake aquatic production and upwelled nutrient supply and utilization, which are modulated by, and thus indicative of, the strength of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). The two EAWM records suggest a weakening trend from the early to late Holocene, with the most significant transition at similar to 6 ka; thus, the EAWM trend was broadly in-phase with that of the EASM. However, the marked EASM intensification at 9.2 ka occurred within the period of a strong EAWM between 10.5 and 6 ka and lagged the monsoonal enhancement as inferred from the Dongge Cave delta O-18 values. Our EASM records displays an overall arid-wet-arid pattern, which is in-phase with the hydrological variability in tropical Australia and anti-phase with that in the outer-tropical Andes. These phase relationships might be linked to changes in the thermal state of the tropical Pacific during the Holocene. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Avian botulism type E in waterbirds of Lake Michigan, 2010-2013	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												During 2010 to 2013, waterbird mortality surveillance programs used a shared protocol for shoreline walking surveys performed June to November at three areas in northern Lake Michigan. In 2010 and 2012, 1244 total carcasses (0.8 dead bird/km walked) and 2399 total carcasses (1.2 dead birds/km walked), respectively, were detected. Fewer carcasses were detected in 2011 (353 total carcasses, 0.2 dead bird/km walked) and 2013 (451 total carcasses, 0.3 dead bird/km walked). During 3 years, peak detection of carcasses occurred in October and involved primarily migratory diving and fish-eating birds, including long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis; 2010), common loons (Gavia immer; 2012), and red-breasted mergansers (Mergus serrator; 2013). In 2011, peak detection of carcasses occurred in August and consisted primarily of summer residents such as gulls (Larus spp.) and double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus). A subset of fresh carcasses was collected throughout each year of the study and tested for botulinum neurotoxin type E (BoNT/E). Sixty-one percent of carcasses (57/94) and 10 of 11 species collected throughout the sampling season tested positive for BoNT/E, suggesting avian botulism type E was a major cause of death for both resident and migratory birds in Lake Michigan. The variety of avian species affected by botulism type E throughout the summer and fall during all 4 years of coordinated surveillance also suggests multiple routes for bird exposure to BoNT/E in Lake Michigan.

Pollen in the gut of the fossil tadpole and other plant fossil records from this locality suggest that the regional vegetation around Enspel was characterised by mixed conifer and broadleaved forests with a prominent deciduous angiosperm component. Palaeoclimatic estimations indicate that the area endured a fully humid warm temperate climate with a hot to warm summer and a distinct temperature difference between seasons. The pollination period of potential modern analogues of the plant taxa discovered in the gut of the fossil tadpole hints that it was feeding on pollen floating on the water surface of the ancient Enspel Lake during late spring or earliest summer. Comparable analyses from the guts of extant pelobatid tadpoles have shown a broad spectrum of food remains, including whole/or parts of algae, protists, protozoans, macrophytes, rotifers, crustaceans, and pollen. It seems that living pelobatid tadpoles are indiscriminate and opportunistic feeders able to adapt and change their feeding behaviour according to the available food source. The time of origin and evolution of pollen feeding in tadpoles is obscure. Our discovery indicates that pelobatid tadpoles were already feeding on pollen in the late Oligocene, and the amount and purity of pollen filling the gut suggests intentional surface feeding.

The feasibility of satellite remote sensing and spatial interpolation to estimate cover crop biomass and nitrogen uptake in a small watershed	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION												The adoption of winter cover crops has been identified as one of the most effective best management practices to reduce nonpoint nitrogen (N) loss via subsurface drainage in a watershed in the midwestern Corn Belt. Understanding the variation of cover crop growth and N cycling is vital for watershed modeling efforts that simulate cover crop adoption. However, there is a dearth of watershed cover crop studies that describe the variation in cover crop growth and N cycling and compare the ability of spatial analytical methodologies to predict cover crop biomass and N uptake within diverse agronomic management practices and heterogeneous soil landscapes. Therefore, the objective of this study is to compare the feasibility of satellite remote sensing and spatial interpolation methods to predict cover crop biomass and N uptake in a small watershed (100 to 10,000 ha). This study was undertaken during 2015 to 2017 in the Lake Bloomington watershed (374 ha) in McLean County, Illinois. Within the small watershed, daikon radish (Raphanus sativus L.)/oats (Avena sativa L., R/O), annual ryegrass (Latium multillorunt)/daikon radish (A/R), and cereal rye (Secale cereale L.)/daikon radish (C/R), were adopted on 78% of row crop land area for both years. Strong linear relationships were observed between soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and triangular vegetation index (TVI) and cover crop biomass, (average R-2 of 0.77, 0.78, and 0.76, respectively) and N uptake (average R-2 of 0.68 for all three vegetation indices). Cover crop biomass and N uptake estimated by the SAVI method were 86% and 85%, 93% and 94%, and 107% and 98% of the ground observed value during 2016 spring, 2016 fall, and 2017 spring, respectively. Moreover, spatial pattern and different cover crop management fields in the study watershed were also captured by the SAVI method. Ordinary kriging (OK) and inverse distance weighting (IDW) showed similar mean cover crop biomass and N uptake values for fields with cover crops; however, both spatial interpolation methods showed lower prediction R-2 values than that of the SAVI method.The results of this study suggest that the combination of spatially accurate satellite imagery and limited ground sampling could be used for repeated small watershed assessment of cover crop growth. Furthermore, this can be used to understand cumulative cover crop impacts on soil and water quality in response to conservation practices and weather within a drainage basin.																			0022-4561	1941-3300				NOV-DEC	2018	73	6					682	692		10.2489/jswc.73.6.682	http://dx.doi.org/10.2489/jswc.73.6.682													WOS:000449284900010
J	Atkinson, M; Young, K				Atkinson, Michael; Young, Kevin			Shadowed by the corpse of war: Sport spectacles and the spirit of terrorism	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR THE SOCIOLOGY OF SPORT												Since the early 2000s, there has been a groundswell of research on terrorism and sports mega-events, including investigations into the impact of '9/11' on fear and risk management strategies at high profile sports events. In this article, we re-examine the case of the Salt Lake City Winter Games of 2002 around Baudrillard's (1995) concept of the 'non-event'. We compare the (largely British and North American) mass mediation and discursive framing of terrorism at the 2002 Games with subsequent discourses interwoven into accounts of terrorism, fear and security at the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens and the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin. Of principal interest is the global framing of sports mega-events as targets of terrorism and the ways in which such events become fabricated zones of risk. To understand why there is a lingering media construction of the sports mega-event as an imagined target (and, in many ways, pre-constructed victim) of terrorism, we draw centrally on Baudrillard's work (1995, 2001, 2002a, 2002b). Specifically, we employ Baudrillard's concepts of the hyperreal and the non-event as a means of exploring terrorism's relationship with sport, and the potential usage of such theoretical ideas in the sociology of sport and physical culture more broadly.																			1012-6902	1461-7218				JUN	2012	47	3			SI		286	306		10.1177/1012690211433452	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1012690211433452													WOS:000304699800003

Seemingly subtle variations in the duration of winter stratification can have major ecological effects by, for example, altering the vertical distribution of oxygen and nutrients in lakes. Yet, the influence of climate change on winter stratification has been largely unexplored. To fill this knowledge gap, here we used a lake-climate model ensemble to investigate changes in winter stratification from 1901 to 2099 across 12,242 representative lakes situated throughout the Northern Hemisphere. By the end of the 21 st century, winter stratification duration is projected to shorten by an average of 18.5-53.9 d under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6-8.5. Projected changes are faster in warmer geographical regions, in which 35-69% of lakes will no longer inversely stratify by 2070-2099 under RCPs 2.6-8.5. This shortening and loss of winter stratification will likely have numerous implications for lakes, including the misalignment of lifecycle events causing shifts in biodiversity.					; Tan, Zeli/G-7792-2018; Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/Y-6135-2019; Jansen, Joachim/IXN-4782-2023	Weyhenmeyer, Gesa/0000-0002-4013-2281; Jansen, Joachim/0000-0001-5965-7662; Tan, Zeli/0000-0001-5958-2584; La Fuente Pillco, Ruth Sofia/0000-0002-9665-672X; 														2378-2242				AUG	2022	7	4					302	311		10.1002/lol2.10231	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10231		DEC 2021											WOS:000728436600001

From 1990 to 1994, nitrogen and phosphorus were added to Lake NI (4.4 ha) at the arctic Long-Term Ecological Research site in Alaska. We used mark/recapture methods to determine the lake trout population size, size structure, recruitment, and individual growth from 1987 to 1999. Data were also collected on water chemistry and food availability. Fertilization resulted in increased pelagic primary productivity, chlorophyll a, turbidity, snail density, and hypoxia in summer and winter. Lake trout density was not affected by the manipulation however growth and average size increased. Recruitment was high initially, but declined throughout the fertilization. These results suggest that lake trout were affected through increased food availability and changes to the physical characteristics of the lake. During fertilization, hypoxia near the sediments may have killed over-wintering embryos and decreased habitat availability. Although lake trout responded strongly to increased nutrients, loss of recruitment might jeopardize lake trout persistence if arctic lakes undergo eutrophication.					; Bettez, Neil/I-5672-2012	Bettez, Neil/0000-0002-6859-8083; 													0018-8158					OCT 1	2005	548						51	66		10.1007/s10750-005-3620-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-3620-9													WOS:000232760900006

Climatic controls on travertine deposition in southern Tibet during the late Quaternary	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Large volumes of travertine deposits are preserved at hydrothermal spring sites on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Yet, most of these deposits are under-researched with respect to their diagenetic and depositional history and there is still very limited understanding of the tectonic and climatic influences on travertine precipitation in the arid high-altitude setting of Tibet. In this study, a detailed uranium-series dating campaign was carried out for the Qiusang travertine (similar to 4270 m above sea level), southern Tibet that has been previously dated back to 486 thousand years ago (ka). Based on 42 new Th-230/U ages, combined with geomorphological and sedimentological investigations, several travertine zones were identified and distinct travertine depositional phases constrained: 11.7-6.8 ka and similar to 13.4 ka (zone 1), 128-122 ka (zone 2),-193 ka (zone 3),similar to 292 ka and 324 ka (zone 4), > 317 ka (zone 5), ca. 415 to 470 ka (zone 6) and ca. 419 to 445 ka (zone 7). Comparison of these depositional phases with local and regional proxy records suggests that travertine accumulation at Qiusang occurred during main interglacials when monsoon precipitation peaked on the TP. This coincidence, together with a sensitive response of Tibetan hydrothermal spring activity to meteoric recharge, implies that climate controls the precipitation of large travertine volumes on orbital timescales on the plateau. We propose that (i) tectonic activity is of subor-dinate importance and influences travertine precipitation on the TP only episodically and on significantly shorter (i.e. centennial to millennial) timescales related to the recurrence rates of large earthquakes and that (ii) intensive monsoonal-driven groundwater recharge is required on top of tectonic activity for generating volu-metrically significant travertine accumulations. Because of the high precipitation rates typical for hydrothermal spring carbonates, we conclude that travertine deposits on the TP could be utilized as valuable high-resolution proxy records of peak monsoon conditions in the currently arid to semi-arid landscape.& nbsp;Furthermore, the Qiusang travertine zone 7 is terraced and the travertine layers adjusted to a paleo-riverbed elevation similar to 30 m above the current river, allowing us to constrain fluvial incision to-0.07 m/ka for the south -central sector of the TP since the Mid-Pleistocene. The abundant travertine occurrences in Tibet in combination with uranium-series dating can thus also provide detailed insights into earth surface dynamics and landscape evolution on the world highest plateau.

J	Kim, SJ; Sohngen, B; Sam, AG				Kim, Sei Jin; Sohngen, Brent; Sam, Abdoul G.			The implications of weather, nutrient prices, and other factors on nutrient concentrations in agricultural watersheds	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												This paper examines how nutrient prices, weather, and other factors influenced P outputs in agricultural watersheds using a detailed daily dataset of water quality observations over a 40-year period. Because policies have focused differentially on soluble P through federal permitting programs for point sources and sediments through federal subsidies for conservation, we examine sediment, particulate P and soluble P separately. A novel element of this study is the inclusion of farm fertilizer and output (i.e., com) prices, which affect agricultural sources of P in these watersheds. We do not find that sediment concentrations are influenced by P prices, but sediment has trended downward, and is seasonally lower in all months except February and March in the Maumee. In contrast, we find that soluble P concentrations are heavily influenced by P prices. They trended downward through 1995, but upwards since. While concerns about fall and winter P application have emerged, we do not find evidence that the distribution of soluble P concentrations shifted towards winter over time. Weather accounts for about 50% of the higher soluble P loadings in 1996-2011, but higher P prices in 2005-2011 lowered P concentrations relative to what they would have been. Other factors account for the remaining 50% of the increase in soluble P concentrations in 1996-2011. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ontogenetic trophic interactions and benthopelagic coupling in Lake Washington: Evidence from stable isotopes and diet analysis	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon and stomach content analysis were used to determine the trophic position and relative importance of benthic and pelagic pathways for different life stages and species of the major fishes and invertebrate prey in Lake Washington. Significant coupling of the benthic and pelagic pathways was evident in this complex food web across seasons and fish ontogenies. Among apex predators, cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii and northern pikeminnow Ptychocheilus oregonensis shifted ontogenetically from benthic omnivory to pelagic piscivory, whereas yellow perch Perca flavescens shifted from pelagic zooplanktivory to benthic piscivory. Apex predators continued to rely on benthic prey seasonally, particularly in winter and spring. Benthic pathways were less important to the current diets of apex predators than they were during the recovery from eutrophication in the 1970s. Surprisingly, the delta N-15 values for copepods during winter and for zooplanktivorous longfin smelt Spirinchus thaleichthys and threespine sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus were similar to those for top piscivores, whereas the significantly lower values for zooplanktivorous juvenile sockeye salmon O. nerka were more similar to expectations. Nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios of pelagic planktivores and invertebrates also varied seasonally. Mixing model results showed that stable isotopes and stomach contents were comparable for determining ontogenetic trends, but stable isotopes established these trends with many fewer samples and less variability and accurately portrayed ontogenetic trends when few stomach samples were available. However, stomach content analysis was critical in delineating seasonal trends in diets and for identifying specific prey species.

Nonetheless, knowledge of its redox geochemistry and mobility in sediments, especially those of eutrophic lakes, remains limited. In this study, we combined in situ high-resolution sampling and laboratory simulation experiments for monitoring soluble and labile V to reveal the mobilization mechanism of V in the sediment of Lake Taihu. The results showed that the concentration of soluble V (1.18-5.22 & mu;g L-1) exceeded the long-term ecotoxicology limitation proposed by the government of the Netherlands. The highest value appeared in summer (July to September), with an average concentration of 3.87 & mu;g L-1, which exceeded the short-term exposure limit. The remobilization of V in summer was caused by the combined effect of the reduction of Fe(hydr)oxides and dissolved organic matter (DOM) complexation, which accelerated the release of associated Fe-bound V and increased the solubility of DOM-V. Additionally, V showed high mobility in winter, owing to the species of V(III)/ V(IV) being oxidized to V(V) with higher solubility. It is noteworthy that the elevated remobilization of V in sediments increases the risk of V release from sediments, which poses the threat of water V pollution in Lake Taihu.					; Ding, Ding/F-8295-2011	Zhang, Lan/0009-0001-5609-9973; Wang, Yan/0000-0002-2240-7309													0043-1354	1879-2448				SEP 1	2023	243								120377	10.1016/j.watres.2023.120377	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2023.120377		JUL 2023						37516083					WOS:001051275200001
J	Sondergaard, M; Larsen, SE; Jorgensen, TB; Jeppesen, E				Sondergaard, Martin; Larsen, Soren E.; Jorgensen, Torben B.; Jeppesen, Erik			Using chlorophyll a and cyanobacteria in the ecological classification of lakes	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Phytoplankton is one of the four key biological quality elements to be used in the ecological classification of lakes in Europe according to the Water Framework Directive (WFD). Chlorophyll a (Chla) has so far been used as the main - and sometimes only - metric to define class boundaries. Chla is often a key metric for lake managers and is used to determine whether and how much action should be taken to reduce the external nutrient loading. In this paper we present the analyses of empirical relationships between nutrient (total phosphorus, TP, total nitrogen, TN) concentrations versus Chla and the proportion of cyanobacteria of total phytoplankton biomass based on data from 440 Danish lakes (1800 lake years). These data represent one eco-region sampled using standardised methodology, thereby minimising the heterogeneity often seen in large datasets. Sampling frequency is important for the precision by which Chla can be determined and the precision is always low with less than 15 summer measurements. As expected Chla was related significantly to TP, but the variability was high, with R-2 reaching only 0.47. 0.59 and 0.61 in shallow, stratified and siliceous lakes, respectively, based on summer averages. The correlation was strongest in late summer (R-2 up to 0.80) and weak in winter. Chla is also related to TN, but the correlation coefficients were low throughout the year, and in a multiple regression with TP included, TN only added little to the total variability. Similarly, the proportion of cyanobacteria increased significantly with TP, but the correlation was weak. Seasonal and yearly data from five lakes with relatively stable TP show considerable variations in Chla and cyanobacteria abundance during a 20-year monitoring period. It is concluded that despite clear nutrient phytoplankton relationships it will be difficult to define the proposed WFD ecological classes - particularly regarding cyanobacteria. To ensure a high degree of certainty for meeting a specific water quality threshold, lake managers must reduce the external phosphorus loading more strongly than expected from existing simple empirical external loading-inlake TP-Chla relationships.

Distribution of essential heavy metals in the aquatic ecosystem of Lake Manzala, Egypt	HELIYON												Lake Manzala is the largest and most productive lake of Egypt's northern coastal lakes and has socio-economic impacts. Pollution by heavy metals is the most significant type of pollution worldwide, particularly in Lake Manzala, which receives mixed discharges from densely populated areas. Water samples were collected at twelve sites around the lake in winter and summer of 2015. Samples of Eichhornia crassipes were collected in the winter, and Oreochromis niloticus samples were collected at two sites (8 and 10). V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn were analysed in these samples using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The average metal concentrations were below the internationally accepted upper permissible limits and are improved compared to those in previous studies. However, the metal concentrations at the eastern and southeastern sites were higher than the allowable limits due to multiple waste discharges. Pollution assessment using pollution risk indicators indicated low to moderate concentrations of metal enrichment in the sediment and biota of the lake, except at sites near the eastern and southeastern drains; these latter sites were considered to be hazardous and should be taken into account in the current development efforts of the lake. Complete removal of floating plants transported by drains is recommended.

Metolachlor was fairly stable in lake water in the dark, with <4% loss after 100 days. Sunlight photodegradation of metolachlor was faster than purely chemical degradation but was still a relatively slow process, with estimated near-surface half-lives in lake water of 22 calendar days in summer and 205 calendar days in winter at 40 degrees N latitude. In 5 mg/L solutions of dissolved organic matter, the estimated half-lives were 2-3 times longer, depending upon the season. Four dechlorinated photoproducts were identified in lake water, accounting, after 40 days of sunlight irradiation, for 18% of the metolachlor originally present. These products resulted from dechlorination, hydroxylation, dehydrochlorination with subsequent morpholine ring formation, and N-dealkylation.																			0021-8561	1520-5118				FEB	1994	42	2					406	412		10.1021/jf00038a032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00038a032													WOS:A1994MY99000032

The relationships between these parameters were explored using principal component analysis (PCA) and Pearson correlation analysis. The phytoplankton community was mainly dominated by the cyanobacterium Microcystis with higher cyanobacteria abundance during summer and autumn season. PCA and Pearson correlation results showed that water temperature and phosphate concentration were the most important variables accounting for cyanobacteria, Microcystis, and microcystin occurrence. Analysis of the toxins by high-performance liquid chromatography demonstrated the presence of two microcystin variants: microcystin-LR (MC-RR) and microcystin-ddRR (MC-ddRR) with total concentrations of the toxins in filtered samples from surface water ranging from 0.11 to 1.52 mu g MC-LR equiv L-1. The high concentrations of microcystin in the Nui Coc reservoir highlighted the potential risk for human health in the basin. Our study underlined the need for regular monitoring of cyanobacteria and toxins in lakes and reservoirs, which are used for drinking water supplies, not only in Vietnam but also in tropical countries.

The abundantly occurring species Lubomirskia baicalensis was used to study the seasonal silicatein metabolism; the spicules; of this species have an unusually thick axial filament, consisting of silicatein, which remains constant in diameter during their growth. In the course of maturation, the size of the silicic acid shell grows, until the final diameter of the spicules of about 8 pm is reached. The seasonal content of silicatein was assessed by use of antibodies raised against silicatein; they stained specifically the axial filaments. In addition we determined. by application of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system, that the proteinaceous content of the spicules. the silicatein, increases from spring to late summer by 8-fold. As molecular markers to quantify the seasonal changes in expression levels of genes coding for proteins/enzymes, the genes for the calumenin-like protein and the kinesin-related protein, were selected. The expression of calumenin-like gene, involved in the intracellular signaling, is highest during September, whereas the expression of the kinesin-related protein does not change during the annual course. These results suggest that the highest metabolic activity of L. baicalensis occurs in late summer (September), in parallel with the highest accumulation of silicatein, a structural protein/enzyme of the spicules.

The main objective of this work is to reconstruct the historical changes in vegetation types (C3-C4), and to constrain the driving force of C4 plant expansion over the last 13 Ma. The stable carbon isotope value of black carbon (delta C-13(BC)) shows a major shift since the Miocene-Pliocene boundary (similar to 5.3 Ma), suggesting significant expansion of C4 plants in broad areas of Central Asia, including the inland basins of northwestern China and the Loess Plateau. However, a decline in the content and MAR of black carbon reveals the absence of any link between fire and C4 plant expansion in Central Asia, due to the dramatic decrease in biomass under a drying regime. On a global scale, asynchronous expansion of C4 plants suggests that regional hydroclimatic change, rather than decline in CO2 concentration, was the most important factor to influence C4 expansion. We propose that the increased seasonality and the enhanced long-term aridity driven by the concurrent decline in winter westerly vapor, and increase in East Asian summer monsoon precipitation, were the main driving forces of C4 plant expansion in broad areas of Central Asia. Variations in winter westerly moisture have played a significant role in changes of regional climate and vegetation in Central Asia since the late Miocene. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The influence of carbon exchange of a large lake on regional tracer-transport inversions: results from Lake Superior	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Large lakes may constitute a significant component of regional surface-atmosphere fluxes, but few efforts have been made to quantify these fluxes. Tracer-transport inverse models that infer the CO2 flux from the atmospheric concentration typically assume that the influence from large lakes is negligible. CO2 observations from a tall tower in Wisconsin segregated by wind direction suggested a CO2 signature from Lake Superior. To further investigate this difference, source-receptor influence functions derived using a mesoscale transport model were applied and results revealed that air masses sampled by the tower have a transit time over the lake, primarily in winter when the total lake influence on the tower can exceed 20% of the total influence of the regional domain. When the influence functions were convolved with air-lake fluxes estimated from a physical-biogeochemical lake model, the overall total contribution of lake fluxes to the tall tower CO2 were mostly negligible, but potentially detectable in certain periods of fall and winter when lake carbon exchange can be strong and land carbon efflux weak. These findings suggest that large oligotrophic lakes would not significantly influence inverse models that incorporate tall tower CO2.

Movement ecology of diploid and triploid grass carp in a large reservoir and upstream tributaries	PLOS ONE												Grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella, is an herbivorous fish originally brought to North America from Asia in 1963 to control nuisance aquatic vegetation. Since their arrival, detrimental alterations to aquatic ecosystems have sometimes occurred in waterways where they were initially stocked and into which they have escaped. The movements of grass carp from lentic systems into tributaries required for spawning is poorly understood, and understanding environmental conditions associated with upstream migrations may aid in management of the species. We stocked 43 fertile diploid and 43 sterile triploid grass carp implanted with acoustic transmitters into Truman Reservoir, Missouri, USA between January 2017 and October 2018 to characterize movements during spring and summer when spawning conditions occur. Twenty fish (11 diploid/9 triploid) exhibited upstream migration behavior in the Osage River, a major tributary, in 2018 and 2019. Migration primarily occurred in April and May, during high discharge events associated with increasing river stage when water temperatures were between 15 and 28 degrees C. Observed migrations ranged from 3.0-108 river km in length, and six individuals were observed making multiple upstream migrations in one season. Eleven fish initiated upstream migrations while in the lentic main body of the reservoir. These findings provide some evidence for upstream migrations by diploid and triploid grass carp as well both lake and river residents. Evidence of similar upstream migration behavior by both diploid and triploid grass carp suggests that triploids may be suitable surrogates for diploids for study of movement ecology. Removal efforts in tributaries targeting periods of increasing river stage during spring may provide the best opportunity of encountering large concentrations of grass carp.					; Chapman, Duane/JOK-2415-2023; Hessler, Tyler/JRW-2434-2023	Byrne, Michael/0000-0002-9464-9534; Hessler, Tyler/0000-0001-5062-2340; 													1932-6203					MAR 8	2023	18	3							e0281128	10.1371/journal.pone.0281128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281128								36888641					WOS:000948775000063

The lake serves as a reservoir for surrounding rice cultivation, with two seasonal periods of water retention to keep ricefields flooded. Three persistent species, Planktothrix agardhii, Pseudanabaena galeata and Geitlerinema sp. maintained dominance throughout. Light intensity, N: P ratio and water residence times seem to be the environmental variables governing the population dynamics of these species. P. agardhii was dominant during spring, reaching its maximum numbers under high nutrient concentrations and increasing light intensity, temperature and water stagnation. The periodicity progressed towards Geitlerinema sp. dominance in summer, with low water renewal rates and phosphate depletion, and then to Ps. galeata in November-December during the second period of water stability. The cyanophyta succession pattern apparently differs from that observed in other European shallow eutrophic lakes.

Mortality was not common in wild ducks resting on the playas during good weather. However, when birds remained on the lakes for prolonged periods of time, such as during experimental trials and stormy weather, a heavy layer of salt precipitated on their feathers. Sodium toxicity was the cause of death for all experimental mallards housed on playa water and for 50% of the wild waterfowl found moribund or dead during the spring of 1995. Gross lesions included heavy salt precipitation on the feathers, ocular lens opacities, deeply congested brains, and dilated, thin-walled, fluid-filled cloacae. Microscopic lesions in the more severely affected birds included liquefaction of ocular lens cortex with lens fiber swelling and multifocal to diffuse ulcerative conjunctivitis with severe granulocytic inflammation, edema, and granulocytic vasculitis resulting in thrombosis. Inflammation similar to that seen in the conjunctiva occasionally involved the mucosa of the mouth, pharynx, nasal turbinates, cloaca, and bursa. Transcorneal movement of water in response to the hypersaline conditions on the playa lakes or direct contact with salt crystals could induce anterior segment dehydration of the aqueous humor and increased osmotic pressure on the lens, leading to cataract formation.

Their stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios were analyzed together with conventional examination of the gut contents of pond smelt. Temporal variations in isotope ratios were similar among the organisms other than benthic animals. The deltaN-15 values of diet for several animals in the pelagic food web were estimated, assuming a stepwise enrichment in N-15 with increasing trophic level. A calanoid copepod, Eodiaptomus japonicus, seemed to feed on the predominant phytoplankton, including Microcystis spp., while Microcystis did not seem to be important as an organic source for other zooplankton and pond smelt. The temporal variation of the isotope ratios of pond smelt was well explained by visual gut content analysis. It is suggested that intensive measurements of carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios of each species serve to effectively assess the yearly dynamics of the food web structure in eutrophic lakes where productivity and species composition of plankton change seasonally.																			0012-9658					APR	1994	75	3					835	846		10.2307/1941739	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1941739													WOS:A1994NE02900023

Verh, Internat. Verein. Limnol., 19, pp. 116-122.] by which vertical flux emanating from surface waters may be distinguished from resuspension flux, As a consequence, the quantity of both slow- and fast-falling particles could be resolved also in bottom-water samples. Among events recorded during three intensive field studies were (1) a surface water export event in early May 1995, whereby net vertical flux increased from around I to 2-5 g m(-2) d(-1); (2) friction velocities at 1.4 cm s(-1) causing a marked nepheloid layer, strained oxygenation and a characteristic high bacteria/chlorophyll ratio; (3) strong current-induced resuspension as the immediate response of a low-pressure passage around mid-summer 1994; and (4) a distinctly green and fresh pulse of phytoplankton arriving in less than 12 h in late August 1993, Results confirm previous observations of (1) strong benthic-pelagic coupling subject to event-controled pulses of surface water export; furthermore, (2) the confined nature of the nepheloid layer with a bimodal falling-velocity distribution showing on the one hand rapidly falling (at 10 m d(-1)) aggregates and on the other hand slower-falling (at < 1 m d(-1)) particles, the latter with a lower nitrogen content but both varying in concentration and presumably interacting through scavenging and fluff layer disaggregation; (3) how weather-controlled bottom currents regularly and easily entrain organic matter from the sediment-water interface. They also (4) suggest microbial activity in the BBL to be more associated with the slow-falling particles. Findings seem reconcilable with the notion of microbial benefits from staying suspended in the BBL rather than inside aggregates and the fluff layer. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

We used Sentinel 1 and 2 in single and double seasons (winter and summer) to classify a coastal UA in Rio Grande do Sul. The results show OBIA with greater potential, with accuracy greater than 80%.

The sampling sites were within 14 km of three landfills contaminated with PCBs. The atmospheric PCB concentrations varied with the atmospheric temperature; thus, there was a large seasonal component to the data. The vapor-phase PCB concentrations averaged 1.7-3.8 ng m-3 in the summer and 0.27-0.58 ng m-3 in the winter. Particulate-phase PCBs did not exhibit consistent changes with season; the concentrations averaged 0.04 ng m-3. The logarithm of the ratio of the PCB concentration in the vapor phase to that in the particulate phase was a linear function of reciprocal absolute temperature. Atmospheric PCB concentrations in Bloomington differed only by a factor of 2-3 compared to other areas in the Great Lakes region, indicating that the atmosphere may effectively disperse PCBs within short distances from sources.

However, how variation in the EASM, EAWM and Westerlies influences climate change in their transition zones in NW China remain unclear. Specifically, how these atmospheric systems interact during strong-weak phases variation over different timescales is still hotly debated. This study investigates four loess-paleosol sequences in the transition zone between EASM and Westerlies-influenced areas along the central Hexi Corridor of NW China, and presents 63 quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages to generate the most detailed chronology for any loess record within the Hexi Corridor. In combination with sedimentology, proxy indexes of magnetic pa-rameters (& chi;lf, & chi;fd, & chi;ARM/SIRM) and grain size of these loess-paleosol sequences, and TraCE-21 ka climatic modelling, the loess deposition and climatic changes at central Hexi Corridor regions over the past 25 ka are reconstructed. Our results indicate that: (1) loess deposition initiated by at least 25 ka at Hexi Corridor. Loess depositional rates decrease from late last glacial into the Holocene, with maximum accumulation rates (140-180 g/cm3/ka) occurring during the Last Glacial Maximum. Depositional hiatuses up to 8 ka are recognized in late Quaternary Hexi Corridor loess, which suggests that high-resolution chronologies are necessary for robust pa-leoclimatic reconstructions from loess records in the region. (2) Over glacial-interglacial cycles, climate in the Hexi Corridor demonstrates a cold-dry glacial and a warm-moist interglacial, consistent with moisture changes observed in the monsoonal Chinese Central Loess Plateau and Westerlies-dominated Central Asia. However, moisture in central Hexi Corridor increased from the early Holocene to mid-Holocene, with a wettest period at 8-7 ka, and followed by a relatively wet late Holocene. These changes are most consistent with the EASM-dominated Chinese Central Loess Plateau and suggests that Westerlies influence in the central Hexi Corridor is minor over at least the past 25 kyr. (3) EAWM intensities demonstrate an anti-phase relationship to EASM in-tensities over the past 25 kyr in the Hexi Corridor, with decreasing EAWM intensity into the early-mid Holocene and an increase into the late Holocene. (4). EASM precipitation variability in the Hexi Corridor appears to not to be a direct nor singular response to changes in 30 degrees N summer insolation. EASM lags insolation by 3 kyr during the Holocene, supporting the idea that high-latitude forcing through changes in ice volume, greenhouse gases, and/ or meltwater input to North Atlantic and Southern oceans can effectively modulate EASM intensity and critically influence Hexi Corridor paleoclimatic conditions.

Role of Various Groups in Metal Ion Binding	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY												The results of experimental studies of the potential complexing ability of dissolved organic matter (DOM) of surface water bodies with respect to Al3+, Fe3+, and Cu2+ ions are discussed. The concentrations of certain groups of natural organic substances, in particular, humic substances, carbohydrates, and protein-like compounds as the most probable complexing ligands, have been determined in water samples collected from the Kanev reservoir (upper section) and Lake Verbnoe (Kiev). The potential complexing capacity of DOM with respect to all bound metals has been estimated at 11.0-15.5 and 14.9-15.8 mu mol/L for the Kanev Reservoir and Lake Verbnoe, respectively, without appreciable seasonal changes. A significant part of metal ions are bound into complexes during the first day of the experiment (total duration 28 days), and the equilibrium state is achieved mainly within 7 days. Humic substances as the largest component of DOM contribute most to the complexation of metal ions. Participation of carbohydrates in metal binding also increases in the summer-autumn period. Cationic metal complexes with proteinaceous compounds are minor components. Seasonal variations in the metal ion binding by particular groups of DOM are also considered.					; Linnik, Peter/S-5725-2019; Zhezherya, Vladislav/AAK-5774-2020; osypenko, valentyna/AAK-8146-2020	Zhezherya, Vladyslav/0000-0002-1128-5270; Linnik, Peter/0000-0002-2144-4052; Osypenko, V.P./0009-0006-3100-4655; 													1070-3632	1608-3350				DEC	2020	90	13					2582	2592		10.1134/S1070363220130095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1070363220130095													WOS:000616320600007

The effect of water released from Alpine reservoirs for power generation was estimated in order to obtain a quasi-homogenous series of "natural flows". For the period prior to 1808, rocks emerging in rivers and lakes in the case of low water were used along with narrative evidence for assessing extreme events. 29 severe winter droughts are documented since 1540. Such events occurred after a succession of four months with below-average precipitation. A comparison with large-scale seasonal sea-level pressure (SLP) reconstructions revealed that they were often connected to persistent anticyclones centred over Western Europe. Severe winter droughts were relatively rare in the 20th century compared to the former period, which is due to increased winter temperature and precipitation.					; Luterbacher, Juerg/H-2408-2018	Luterbacher, Juerg/0000-0002-8569-0973; 													0262-6667	2150-3435				OCT	2006	51	5					966	985		10.1623/hysj.51.5.966	http://dx.doi.org/10.1623/hysj.51.5.966													WOS:000241055100015

Secretive marsh bird habitat associations in the Mississippi Flyway: a meta-analysis	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Secretive marsh birds, including rails and bitterns, have experienced widespread population declines due to the loss of wetland habitat on which they depend. Because of their cryptic behavior, secretive marsh birds are challenging to study and information on their habitat requirements is limited, especially across the full annual cycle. Quantifying habitat associations throughout the annual cycle and at broad geographic scales can advance a more comprehensive approach for secretive marsh bird conservation. The goal of this study was to quantitatively synthesize results from empirical studies that examined species-habitat relationships of secretive marsh birds in the North American Mississippi Flyway to identify general patterns and information gaps that can guide future management and conservation efforts. We performed a meta-analysis and incorporated results from 40 studies that quantitatively assessed habitat associations of American Bittern (Botaurus lentiginosus), Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis), King Rail (Rallus elegans), Sora (Porzana carolina), Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola), and Yellow Rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis). Most studies examined breeding season habitat, whereas only 13% reported on habitat use during migration and none during winter. At landscape scales, breeding marsh birds were positively associated with amount of wetlands, especially in the Great Lakes region, and negatively associated with amount of urban land cover, particularly for American Bittern. At the local scale, breeding marsh birds were positively associated with cattail coverage (Typha spp) and other robust emergent vegetation. Overall, marsh birds were negatively associated with woody wetland vegetation, although effects were weaker in the Prairie region and varied among species. During autumn migration, moistsoil vegetation coverage was important for rails in the lower Midwest. The habitat use patterns we identified across studies provide a general characterization of marsh bird breeding habitat to aid in landscape-level multi-species conservation efforts. Our study also highlights the immediate research needs for full annual cycle conservation of secretive marsh bird habitat in North America: specifically, information during winter and migration.					; McKellar, Ann/JEF-2803-2023	McKellar, Ann/0000-0002-7032-3759; 													1712-6568					DEC	2021	16	2							160212	10.5751/ACE-01924-160212	http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ACE-01924-160212													WOS:000739877700021

N2O flux from subtropical littoral wetlands remains unclear, especially under the current global warming environment. In the littoral zone of Lake Poyang, a simulated warming experiment was conducted to investigate N2O flux. Open-top chambers were used to raise temperature, and the static chamber-gas chromatograph method was used to measure N2O flux. Results showed that the littoral zone of Lake Poyang was an N2O source, with an average flux rate of 8.9 mu g N2O m(-2)h(-1). Warming significantly increased N2O emission (13.8 mu g N2O m(-2)h(-1)under warming treatment) by 54% compared to the control treatment. N2O flux in the spring growing season was also significantly higher than that of the autumn growing season. In addition, temperature was not significantly related to N2O flux, while soil moisture only explained about 7% of N2O variation. These results imply that N2O emission experiences positive feedback effect on the ongoing warming of the climate, and abiotic factors (e.g., soil temperature and soil moisture) were not main controls on N2O variation in this littoral wetland.

By means of double rate setting (normalization) for Sc, comparative (with Clarke values) analysis for clays was executed. With few exceptions, spectra of elements resistant to physical and chemical weathering in river suspension of modern Baikal silt and clays are similar to each other. Aeolian suspension (snow samples) over the Southern Water Area of Baikal Lake, on the whole differs from the others by lower normalized values of alkaline and alkaline-earth elements, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Zn, and by higher values of Cr, As, Pb, and Sb (anthropogenic influence). As far as spectra of rare and rare-earth elements are concerned, aeolian suspensions have relatively constant distribution spectrum. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Greenhouse gases emitting from hot springs take up an important part of the total flux contributed by the whole volcanic field. However, there remains no research on greenhouse gases flux estimation of hot springs in volcanic fields of China. A new apparatus named GL-103B digital bubble/liquid flowmeter is used to measure the gas fluxes of the Lake shoreline hot spring belt, Julong hot spring area, Jinjiang hot springs and 18daogou hot springs in changbaishan volcanic field. Combining with the previous studies on gas compositions, the total flux of greenhouse gases emitting from hot springs in Changbaishan volcanic field has been estimated. The results of greenhouse gases flux in this area, 6.9 x 10(4)t . a(-1) for CO2 and 428. 44t . a(-1) for CH4, could be compared to that of Pantelleria Island volcano in Sicily, Italy. As is revealed by this study, the digital bubble/liquid flowmeter could be considered as a suitable choice for greenhouse gases flux estimation of hot springs in volcanic fields.

Recent changes in abundance and cell size of pelagic diatoms in the North American Great Lakes	PHYTOTAXA												Changes in diatom abundance and cell size in Great Lakes phytoplankton collections were examined from two periods, 1996-1999 and 2007-2008. Trends indicate marked shifts in pelagic diatoms, including diatom total biovolume and cell density declines. Concurrent with these changes have been establishments of invasive species, water quality changes and longer stratification periods resulting from climate warming. No consistent change in cell sizes was observed in diatoms between the two periods in the Great Lakes basin as a whole, but lake- and taxon-specific changes were apparent. Cell size declines include centric and pennate diatoms in the spring in Lake Huron and pennate diatoms in the spring in Lake Superior. Increases in cell size occurred for centric diatoms in Lake Erie and pennate diatoms in the summer in lakes Michigan and Ontario. Some of the more dominant taxa exhibited lake-specific shifts. For instance, lightly-silicified diatoms such as Nitzschia increased in length in Lake Huron, possibly as an adaptation to climate warming and/or declining nutrient supplies. Difficulty in explaining the observed changes in cell sizes is acknowledged, but continued study of these trends is critical to understanding impacts on Great Lakes food webs.

Trends and current status of aluminum chemistry in Adirondack headwater streams 30 Years after the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT												Mobilization of toxic forms of aluminum (Al-i) have been one of the most harmful effects of acidic deposition on aquatic ecosystems. Large decreases in acidic deposition levels have resulted in decreases in Al-i concentrations in surface waters starting in the 1990s. However, recent studies indicate that fish communities are still being impaired by elevated Ali concentrations in streams, suggesting the need for a present-day assessment of the recovery status of Al chemistry in impacted regions such as the Adirondack region of New York, United States. Therefore, the recovery status of Al was assessed from long-term high-frequency monitoring of three Adirondack streams up through 2019, and multiple resampling of 127 headwater streams throughout the Adirondack region between 2004/2005 and 2018/2019. Results indicated that concentrations of Al-i have continued to decrease throughout the Adirondack region, but that harmful conditions still exist in a substantial number of streams during spring snowmelt. In the western Adirondack region, 35 percent of streams during spring snowmelt, (typically the most acidic period), and 10 percent of streams during summer were still experiencing harmful concentrations of Al-i (>1.0 mu mol L-1) in 2018/2019. In the less-impacted east-central Adirondack region, 10 percent of streams during snowmelt, and 4 percent of streams during summer were experiencing harmful Al-i concentrations in 2018. Temporal decreases in Al-i concentrations were due in part to a shift in speciation from Al-i to non-toxic organically complexed Al as dissolved organic carbon concentrations increased, which was also a response to decreasing acidic deposition. Increased availability of calcium resulting from acid-neutralization processes such as weathering also contributed to the decrease in Al-i over the past 5-8 years. The current low levels of acidic deposition may have begun to enhance recovery by increasing the effectiveness of ambient acid neutralization processes.

Grain-size measurements were conducted on 157-cm-long core ADM-C1 from the Andaman Sea; the core spanned the last 11.2 kyr BP. Four end-members (EMs) were unmixed using lognormal parametric end-member modeling. Genetic analyses of the grain-size EMs suggested the EM1 and EM2 may correlate with suspension in the upper layers and transportation in the benthic nepheloid layer, respectively, while the EM3 and EM4 were tied with deposition affected by monsoonal currents and sedimentation under extreme events, respectively. The EM3 was dominated by ISM intensity and transported by summer monsoon currents, with increase in the proportion of EM3 reflecting increasing ISM intensity, and vice versa. Variations in EM3 were used to define three stages of ISM evolution, as follows: (1) During 11.2-9.1 kyr BP, EM3 was relatively low, indicating a weak ISM; (2) during 9.1-4.5 kyr BP, EM3 increased substantially, indicating a strengthened ISM; (3) during 4.5-0 kyr BP, EM3 decreased gradually, suggesting a gradual weakening of the ISM. The Holocene ISM Maximum started at similar to 9.1 kyr BP rather than in the early Holocene, which may have been partly due to the slowdown of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) during the early Holocene that resulted in a decreased land-sea thermal contrast between the landmass and the Indian Ocean. An additional cause may have been the remnant Northern Hemisphere ice sheets that impeded the northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Seven relatively brief decreases in the ISM intensity (events 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) occurred at ca. 10.3, 9.7, 7.3, 5.7, 4.2, 2.4, and 0.8 kyr BP, respectively. They corresponded, within the age uncertainties, to the increased supplies of ice-rafted detritus to North Atlantic sediments, implying that changes in the ISM intensity on millennial scale were dominated by climatic processes in northern high latitudes.

HYDROBIOLOGIA												We investigated nine Pampean shallow lakes (Argentina) across a moisture gradient (mean annual precipitation 1,000-500 mm), under the framework of a network project of lake monitoring whose main objective was to analyse the responses of ecosystems to different stressors associated with human activities. We postulate that species bloom in different shallow lakes will be determined mainly by local optical features, nutrients and salinity. We analysed the phytoplankton structure during the warm season 2012-2013, identifying those species and functional groups that proliferate in the lakes. Most lakes showed high phytoplankton biomass, except a saline lake located in the driest part of the gradient and an inorganic turbid lake. In some lakes, cyanobacteria blooms occurred in summer, persisting until autumn. Small colonial cyanobacteria and small fast-growing chlorophytes were abundant in most turbid enriched and anthropogenically impacted systems. Lowest species and functional diversity occurred in the saline lake. Multivariate analysis indicated that the phytoplankton structure was mainly defined by conductivity, transparency and variables associated with the trophic state, also reflecting the importance of the geographical location. Our results evidenced the vulnerability of most shallow lakes in the region to water level fluctuations, eutrophication and canalization.					; Sánchez, María Laura/AAZ-1382-2021; Huber, Paula/AAA-7509-2021	Mancini, Miguel/0000-0002-9685-4435; O'Farrell, Ines/0000-0002-2236-2905; Schiaffino, Maria Romina/0000-0002-9383-2003; Huber, Paula/0000-0002-5411-7736; Sanchez, Maria Laura/0000-0001-5831-1811; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2015	752	1					47	64		10.1007/s10750-014-2007-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-2007-1													WOS:000352652500005

Reproductive condition and occurrence of intersex in bighead carp and silver carp in the Missouri River	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Little is known about the reproductive biology of the exotic bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix in the Missouri River. In order to fill this gap in understanding, herein is described the reproductive condition of these Asian carps. Evidence is presented which indicates that bighead and silver carp in the Missouri River have a protracted spawning period that extends from early spring through fall and some individual bighead and silver carp are spawning multiple times during a reproductive season. Although bighead and silver carps are successfully maturing and spawning in the Missouri River some reproductive abnormalities such as intersex, atresia, and sterility were observed. Knowledge of the reproductive activity of these invasive carps may be useful to resource managers tasked with their control.

J	Salmi, P; Malin, I; Salonen, K				Salmi, Pauliina; Malin, Ismo; Salonen, Kalevi			Pumping of epilimnetic water into hypolimnion improves oxygen but not necessarily nutrient conditions in a lake recovering from eutrophication	INLAND WATERS												To mitigate deep water oxygen depletion and its consequences, epilimnetic water was pumped into deep water of a eutrophic, 26 km(2) subbasin of Lake Vesijarvi, Finland. In winter, the mechanical mixing largely eliminated vertical differences in temperature, oxygen, and nutrients. Although ice cover prevented oxygen flux from the atmosphere, the high proportion of shallows in the basin with high oxygen concentration facilitated the avoidance of hypoxia by mixing. Despite the disappearance of anoxia in deep water, the volume-weighted mean concentrations of nutrients were not affected. In summer, the introduction of epilimnetic water into the hypolimnion improved oxygen conditions, but anoxia or hypoxia continued to develop. This condition favored the coexistence of nitrification and denitrification and, similar to winter, more than halved total and ammonium-nitrogen (NH4-N) concentrations in deep water. Despite the presence of nitrate or low concentration of oxygen, phosphorus concentrations continued to be high, and therefore deep water anoxia cannot have been the primary driver maintaining the basin in its eutrophic state. Consequently, in the management of Lake Vesijarvi, a major emphasis should be on external nutrient load and the leakage of nutrients from shallow sediments. A longer time series and attention to biological parameters is needed to determine the final outcome of pumping epilimnetic water into the hypolimnion.					; Salmi, Pauliina/AAM-4868-2020	Salmi, Pauliina/0000-0003-3247-2259; 													2044-2041	2044-205X					2014	4	4					425	434		10.5268/IW-4.4.631	http://dx.doi.org/10.5268/IW-4.4.631													WOS:000344015400009

Identification and characterization of alpine subglacial lakes using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR): Brady Glacier, Alaska, USA	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												The temporary storage and subsequent release of water at glacial margins can cause severe flooding in downstream areas and substantially impact glacier dynamics. Alpine subglacial lakes may not be identified until they become subaerially exposed or release a jokulhlaup. We use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to identify and characterize three dynamic alpine subglacial lakes of Brady Glacier, Alaska, USA. We quantify changes in vertical displacement of the glacier surface and lake volumes from September 1995 through March 1996 using European Remote-sensing Satellite-1/-2 (ERS-1/-2) tandem data. In the autumn, subsidence ranged from 4 to 26 cm d(-1) and the volume of water discharged ranged from 22 000 +/- 2000 to 243 000 +/- 14 000 m(3) d(-1). Subsidence and discharge rates declined significantly during the winter and continued at a lesser rate through March. Application of this technique may allow researchers to locate alpine subglacial lakes years or decades before they begin to release hazardous outburst floods and substantially impact glacier dynamics.

The anchor point for a series of 400 varves known to span the '8.2 kyr cold event' was derived from a combination of correlation analysis, Monte Carlo statistics and Bayesian age modelling. The GRIP and NorthGRIP ice-cores were matched to the same absolute time scale by comparing Be-10 data and tree-ring Delta C-14. The radiocarbon-based wiggle match, organic carbon measurements, mineral magnetic parameters and XRF data reconstruct a distinct period of enhanced erosion in Kalksjon's catchment between 8066+/-25 and 7920+/-25 cal. yr BP. Prior to human impact, the increased erosion in the boreal environment is assigned to increased winter precipitation in the form of snow, which caused spring meltwater discharge to intensify. Our results suggest that the abrupt onset of increased winter precipitation in west central Sweden started at least 50 years after the onset of the '8.2 kyr cold event' as defined by oxygen isotope data from Greenland. The study highlights the value of synchronized time scales in the reconstruction of abrupt climate changes based on proxy data.

T.; Sveinbjoernsson, Bjartmar			Continuous estimates of CO2 efflux from arctic and boreal soils during the snow-covered season in Alaska	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Soils in arctic and boreal ecosystems hold large stocks of soil carbon (C), which may be sensitive to changes in climate. Recent studies suggest that winter CO2 efflux from the subnivean environment may be an important component of annual C budgets in arctic and boreal ecosystems. The present study was designed to examine the seasonal patterns and magnitudes of winter CO2 efflux from arctic tussock tundra near Toolik Lake, Alaska, and upland boreal forest in Anchorage, Alaska. The seasonal pattern of winter CO2 efflux differed strongly between the two sites. Tussock tundra showed a prolonged period with very low flux rates between late December and mid-April. In contrast, rates of CO2 efflux were relatively high, but variable, throughout the winter at the boreal site. Estimates of C efflux for the snow-covered season were within the range of previous studies in tussock tundra (24 g C m(-2)) and upland boreal forest (75 g C m(-2)). A simple exponential model, using shallow soil temperatures, explained much of the variation in CO2 efflux from tussock tundra. In contrast, air temperature was an important secondary control on winter CO2 efflux from the boreal forest, suggesting that trees became active during prolonged winter thaws. Results of the study imply that warmer winters may increase rates of C efflux from high-latitude ecosystems. Changes in the depth or duration of snow cover will, however, modulate the relationship between air and soil temperatures and could amplify or dampen the effects of climate warming.					; Welker, Jeffrey/C-9493-2013	Sullivan, Patrick/0000-0002-8015-3036; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				OCT 28	2008	113	G4							G04009	10.1029/2008JG000715	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008JG000715													WOS:000260599600001
J	Shah, L; Arnillas, CA; Arhonditsis, GB				Shah, Lamees; Arnillas, Carlos Alberto; Arhonditsis, George			Characterizing temporal trends of meteorological extremes in Southern and Central Ontario, Canada	WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES												Forecasts of increased frequency of meteorological extremes have received considerable attention due to their potential impact on the integrity of biotic communities, stability of terrestrial and aquatic environments, availability of ecosystem services, and broader societal prosperity. Canada is projected to experience greater warming rates than many other regions of the world and changes in meteorological extremes are predicted to be variable across the country. In this context, our goal is to evaluate the long-term trends of extreme meteorological variables (air and dew point temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation) in southern and central Ontario (from 42?degrees N to 50?degrees N), while considering the role dynamics of large-scale atmospheric oscillations (El Nino-Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Arctic Oscillation, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation). Air temperature minima increased year-round, while temperature maxima mainly increased during the cooler months of the year. Consistent with recent evidence from the literature, our study identified an increase in the amount of atmospheric water since the 1950s, as shown by the rising trends in dew point temperature maxima and minima during winter and mid-summer/early-autumn, respectively. Likewise, we found a weak decline in the relative humidity during the warm season, and a more discernible declining trend during the cooler part of the year, which could be in turn reflective of the moderate change of temperature maxima and rising minima, respectively. Consistent with the broader evidence of a global terrestrial stilling, our analysis showed a declining occurrence of high wind-speed events across the entire study domain, and more frequent slow-wind speeds during both warm and cold periods of the year. Interestingly, a closer examination of temporal trends in calm wind frequency provides evidence of a recent reversal in the latter trend with diminishing prevalence of very calm wind conditions. We generally found a weakly increasing temporal trend with maximum total daily precipitation, but without a coherent spatial pattern within the broader study area. Our analysis showed that large-scale phenomena have a discernible signature mostly on air temperature and humidity variables, but had little impact on low relative humidity, high and low wind-speed, and precipitation variability. Given the modest impact of teleconnections on long-term temporal trends, our study concludes that the meteorological extremes are more directly influenced by regional and local heat and humidity balance processes rather than global-scale atmospheric circulation. The observed trends of air temperature, humidity, and wind speed extremes suggest a profound impact on the phenology of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and human experience of weather.

Water intake from a river and a neighboring urban area led to eutrophication and a strong cyanobacterial water bloom. Both the water intake and recreation were threatened due to the possible influence of cyanobacterial toxins. The lake was subjected to three sustainable restoration methods: aeration of sediment-water; iron addition to precipitate P, and; biomanipulation. The goal of our study was to determine the changes in the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton and chemical water variables during restoration measures. A comparison of the data obtained during this research with the pre-restoration data showed that, as a result of the treatments orthophosphates decreased, rarely exceeding 0.06 mg P.L-1, and cyanobacterial water blooms disappeared. Cyanobacteria were found in the lake but they were not abundant. Chrysophytes and diatoms were the most abundant in springtime of each year. Green algae, desmids and chrysophytes were particularly abundant in summer, while cryptophytes predominated in autumn. Algae from all these groups do not pose a threat to either recreation or water intake. The deep chlorophyll maximum occurring in summer at a depth of 5 m as a result of restoration confirms the lower trophic status of the lake, alluding to mesotrophic conditions.					; Gołdyn, Ryszard/J-1093-2018	Dondajewska-Pielka, Renata/0000-0002-6761-0669; Kozak, Anna/0000-0001-7448-0498; Goldyn, Ryszard/0000-0001-8325-5161; Kowalczewska-Madura, Katarzyna/0000-0003-0243-1085														2073-4441				SEP	2017	9	9							713	10.3390/w9090713	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9090713													WOS:000411567200086

(+)/(-)-alpha-HCH enantiomer ratios (ERs) in three streams entering Amituk Lake ranged from racemic values of 1.01 in snow to 0.36 in meltwater. Lower ERs were promoted by warmer temperatures and increased contact with stream substrates during low streamflows, especially biologically productive substrates. Most alpha-HCH degradation occurred during peak runoff when ERs were 0.95-0.80, rather than later in summer when ERs reached their minimum. Approximately 7% of alpha-HCH in the Amituk Lake basin was enantioselectively degraded prior to entering the lake. ERs within Amituk Lake are controlled by meltwater inputs rather than within lake degradation and dearly illustrate the riverine-like nature of high arctic lakes. Differences in lake alpha-HCH inventory from end of summer 1993 to spring 1994 indicate that from 33 to 61% of alpha-HCH within the lake may have been lost via nonenantioselective microbial degradation at a rate ranging from 0.48 to 1.13 y(-1).

Field data quantifying the magnitude, timing and pathways of P loss are required to develop and test solutions. This study quantifies annual and seasonal losses of dissolved (DRP) and total (TP) phosphorus in surface runoff and tile drainage from three reduced tillage fields (October 2011 to April 2013). The non-growing season (NGS, October to April) was a critical period, with 83 to 97% of annual combined [surface + tile] runoff; 84 to 100% of DRP loss; 67 to 98% of TP loss occurring in this time. Annual export (May 2012 to April 2013) ranged from 0332 to 0.419 kg TP/ha/yr and 0.034 to 0.096 kg DRP/ha/yr. Tile drainage contributed the majority of annual water export from fields (78 to 90%) whereas surface runoff contributed little (10 to 22%). Tiles exported 0.169 to 0.255 kg TP/ha/yr (40 to 77% of total TP load) and 0.017 to 0.023 kg DRP/ha/yr (19 to 67% of total DRP load). Thus, surface runoff, which primarily occurred during winter thaws, exported disproportionately more P relative to its contribution to flow. Phosphorus losses in tile drain effluent monitored over an additional NGS (October 2011 to April 2012) were elevated at two sites following the fall application of P. This study provides an improved understanding of edge-of-field P losses in humid, cold temperate regions that experience significant winter periods, and provides estimates of P loads from fields in which P conservation strategies are employed.

Chemically-based density stratification occurred routinely in the Seneca River downstream of the lake inflow, in response to a continuous chemically-based density difference between the 2 systems of 0.0015-0.0030 g/cm3. The persistence of the phenomenon, and the longitudinal range over which the river stratification occurred, depended on the velocity of river flow and the magnitude of the density gradient that bordered the upper river water and the lower released lake water. During the low flows common to summer the stratification extended .apprx. 14 km downstream to a dam, and 3 km upstream, of the lake outlet-river junction. Vertical mixing between the stratified layers increased as the flow in the Seneca River increased, and as the vertical density gradient decreased. A dimensionless group, .**GRAPHIC**. where: D = apparent vertical diffusion (m2/h), V = average velocity of the overlying river flow (m/h). .rho. = density at the interface between the stratified layers (g/cm3) and .DELTA..rho. .DELTA.z = density gradient between the stratified layers (g cm-3 m-1), was constant for summer low flow conditions for a 6.5 km length of the Seneca River, quantifying the interaction between vertical mixing and the included influences for that portion of the river. The occurrence of chemical stratification in the river had dramatic implications on the corresponding distribution of dissolved oxygen (DO). The isolation of the organically enriched lake water in the lower layer enhanced the depletion of DO there, which resulted in the development of substantial (> 4.0 mg/l) DO stratification downstream of the discharge from the lake during summer low flow periods.					; Schafran, Gary/D-3680-2016	Khalil, Magdy/0000-0002-5445-9437; 													0049-6979	1573-2932					1984	21	1-4					335	350		10.1007/BF00163634	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00163634													WOS:A1984SA81700029

Large forest fires in Canada and the relationship to global sea surface temperatures	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[ 1] Relationships between variations in peak Canadian forest fire season (JJA) severity and previous winter (DJF) global sea surface temperature (SST) variations are examined for the period 1953 to 1999. Coupled modes of variability between the seasonal severity rating (SSR) index and the previous winter global SSTs are analyzed using singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis. The robustness of the relationship is established by the Monte Carlo technique. The importance of the leading three SVD modes, accounting for approximately 90% of the squared covariance, to Canadian summer forest fire severity is identified. The first mode relates strongly to the global long-term trend, especially evident in the warming of the Southern Hemisphere oceans, and shows significant positive correlation in the forested regions of northwestern, western and central Canada, while southern B. C., the extreme northwest coastal regions of B. C. and Yukon, and the Great Lakes region are identified as having significant negative correlation. The second mode relates to the multidecadal variation of Atlantic SST (AMO) and shows highly significant negative correlation extending from the western NWT and Canadian Prairie Provinces across northern Ontario and Quebec. The third mode is related to Pacific Ocean processes and the interrelationship between El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and shows strong positive correlation in western Canada and negative correlation in the lower Great Lakes region of southern Ontario and southern Quebec. A 6-month lag relationship between Canadian forest fire variability and large-scale SSTs may provide the basis for developing long-range forecasting schemes for fire severity in Canada.

J	NORTON, RA; DINDAL, DL				NORTON, RA; DINDAL, DL			STRUCTURE OF MICROARTHROPOD COMMUNITY IN LAKE-ONTARIO BEACH DEBRIS	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												The microarthropod [arachnids and insects] community of the beach debris, or drift line, on the SE shore of Lake Ontario [New York, USA] was investigated during summer and fall of 1970 to determine the species composition and the influence of drift components and vertical location on community structure. Structural characteristics measured included the arthropod species and volume diversities, habitat diversity and 3-dimensional ordination. The drift line was composed principally of decaying fish (Alosa pseudoharangus Wilson), herbaceous plant fragments and driftwood. Some species were clearly associated with either the decomposing alewives or the plant debris; others were common to both. Alewife fauna had a lower average species diversity and arthropod volume diversity than that of the plant debris, although alewives supported a much greater arthropod saprovore volume until late fall; values for mixed debris were intermediate. Burial of drift materials by sand had a major effect on species composition, but little or no effect on species diversity or arthropod volume diversity. Species diversity, richness and equitability were not correlated with the diversity of components in the natural drift line. General comparisons showed the drift line community to be very dissimilar to that of nearby cottonwood leaf litter, which had a higher species diversity.																			0046-225X	1938-2936					1976	5	4					773	779		10.1093/ee/5.4.773	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/5.4.773													WOS:A1976CC86500040

Water and sediment samples were collected over four seasons, analyzed for heavy metals (Pb, Cu, Ni, Mn, Cd, and Zn), and assessed with an integrated water quality index (WQI) and a geoaccumulation index (I-geo). Results indicated that the maximum concentrations of all the metals in water and sediments occurred in winter and the minimum in summer. Assessment of the pollution indicated that the water was uncontaminated by heavy metals, but the sediments were slightly contaminated with Cu, Ni, Cd, and Zn. Therefore, the pollution of Cu, Ni, Cd, and Zn in the Tiaozi River Basin should be taken into account during the formation of regional management strategies for the water environment.

An idealized daily temperature curve was used to convert daily temperature records from 43 weather stations, taken throughout the twentieth and late nineteenth centuries, into an hourly dataset, which was then converted to units of winter chill. Besides exposing temporal trends in winter chill, the data could be spatially interpolated, yielding contiguous maps of typical winter chill in Germany around 2010, as well as chilling losses since 1950. Throughout Germany, winter chill varied between 1700 and 3000 Chilling Hours or 125 and 150 Chill Portions. The areas of highest winter chill were located in the northern parts of the country. For the whole of Germany, there were no significant temporal trends. The extent of interregional variation in winter chill depended on the chilling model used. While the Chilling Hours Model showed strong declines in winter chill for the areas around Dresden and Leipzig, as well as for the Lake Constance region, the Dynamic Model did not detect such dramatic changes. More than a decline in winter chill, increased heat during the winter months might become a challenge to German fruit growers. As already experienced during the extraordinarily warm winter of 2006/07, warm temperatures during the winter can cause fruit trees that fulfill their chilling requirements relatively early to bloom prematurely. This can then lead to elevated risk of frost damage and hamper the homogeneity of flowering.

Shoreline electrofishing was used to assess juvenile largemouth bass cohort dynamics from school dispersal through the yearling stage in Jordan Lake, North Carolina, 1987-1995. Measures of environmental conditions and dynamics of juvenile shad Dorosoma spp. were collected concurrently to assess their potential effects on cohort dynamics of juvenile largemouth bass. Abundance of age-0 largemouth bass at the time cohort mean lengths reached 50 mm varied significantly among years, as did growth rates and mortality from July through October. No environmental or shad effects on largemouth bass growth or mortality were detected. Overwinter mortality rates did not vary among years, despite a 50-mm difference among years in largemouth bass mean lengths going into late fall, and little evidence was found to indicate significant size-selective overwinter mortality. Despite significant differences in first-year growth rates and cohort mean lengths entering the first winter, mortality rates of young largemouth bass from school dispersal through the yearling stage did not differ among years, suggesting that variations in cohort dynamics did not act to override initial differences in relative year-class size.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAY	2000	129	3					716	726		10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<0716:FYCDAO>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2000)129<0716:FYCDAO>2.3.CO;2													WOS:000089076500007

The SLI values were significantly greater in populations sampled from contaminated waters than in those from less polluted areas; the highest values being observed for Rhine fish (3.5) and the lowest for Lake Braassem fish (1.5). Biochemical and histological observations suggested that the liver enlargement was mainly caused by hypertrophy. The liver growth was accompanied by elevated hepatic enzyme activities. Like most other liver parameters, the SLI showed seasonal variations with the highest values in winter and the lowest in spring. Over the past 3 yr a decrease of the relative liver weight of Rhine and Meuse fish in time was noted, which may have reflected the improvement of the cheical water quality of these rivers.

Sediment traps were deployed in four of the lakes to examine the relationship between decline in TP and sedimentation. Declines in TP and sedimentation of P were similar in magnitude when summed over the stratified season, and a positive correlation between TP decline and sedimentation rate was observed. Lakes possessing larger particles exhibited larger declines in particulate phosphorus (PP) than lakes with smaller plankton. Declines in TP were not significantly related to particle size, possibly because of the influence of spring concentrations of dissolved P, which quickly declined in all lakes in which they were observed. These results support the contention that sedimentation plays a major role in the decline in TP during stratification and that sedimentation is influenced by plankton community structure.

Here, we evaluated variation in net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide (CO2) across the Chequamegon Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study AmeriFlux core site cluster in the upper Great Lakes region of the USA from 1997 to 2020. The tower network included two mature hardwood forests with differing management regimes (US-WCr and US-Syv), two fen wetlands with varying levels of canopy sheltering and vegetation (US-Los and US-ALQ), and a very tall (400 m) landscape-level tower (US-PFa). Together, they provided over 70 site-years of observations. The 19-tower Chequamegon Heterogenous Ecosystem Energy-balance Study Enabled by a High-density Extensive Array of Detectors 2019 campaign centered around US-PFa provided additional information on the spatial variation of NEE. Decadal variability was present in all long-term sites, but cross-site coherence in interannual NEE in the earlier part of the record became weaker with time as non-climatic factors such as local disturbances likely dominated flux time series. Average decadal NEE at the tall tower transitioned from carbon source to sink to near neutral over 24 years. Respiration had a greater effect than photosynthesis on driving variations in NEE at all sites. Declining snowfall offset potential increases in assimilation from warmer springs, as less-insulated soils delayed start of spring green-up. Higher CO2 increased maximum net assimilation parameters but not total gross primary productivity. Stand-scale sites were larger net sinks than the landscape tower. Clustered, long-term carbon flux observations provide value for understanding the diverse links between carbon and climate and the challenges of upscaling these responses across space. Plain Language Summary The terrestrial biosphere features the largest global sources and sinks of atmospheric carbon. Changes in growing season length, disturbance frequency, human management, increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, amount and timing of precipitation, and warmer air temperature all influence the carbon cycle. Observations from the global eddy covariance flux tower network have been key for diagnosing these changes. However, data from most sites are limited in length. Here, we explore how multi-decadal carbon flux measurements from a cluster of flux towers in forests and wetlands in the upper Midwest USA respond to environmental change. Despite the proximity of the sites, year-to-year variation in carbon fluxes was rarely similar between sites. Surprisingly, warmer winters promoting earlier snowmelt led to later spring green-up because soil temperature was colder. Impacts of higher CO2 and warmer temperature on annual carbon fluxes were limited but did influence factors linking carbon flux sensitivity to climate. Differences in flux magnitudes from a very tall tower flux to the network show that the whole does not seem to be simply a sum of its measured parts. More elaborate approaches may be needed to understand the processes that control carbon fluxes across large landscapes.					; Paleri, Sreenath/AAY-8064-2020; Desai, Ankur/A-5899-2008; Stoy, Paul/D-3709-2011; Butterworth, Brian/AAP-2514-2021; Wiesner, Susanne/MTA-1135-2025; Muttaqin, Andi/AAE-3391-2021; Murphy, Bailey/KLY-9306-2024; Mineau, James/HNO-9114-2023	Butterworth, Brian/0000-0002-8457-5308; Murphy, Bailey/0000-0002-0399-5221; talib, ammara/0000-0003-3259-0220; Wiesner, Susanne/0000-0001-7232-0458; Richardson, Jessica/0000-0003-1532-4174; Mineau, James/0000-0002-2289-2252; Muttaqin, Andi/0000-0001-6373-1255; Desai, Ankur/0000-0002-5226-6041; Thom, Jonathan/0000-0002-1179-9511; Paleri, Sreenath/0000-0003-4435-6343; Koupaei-Abyazani, Nikaan/0000-0001-6982-230X; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				DEC	2022	127	12							e2022JG007014	10.1029/2022JG007014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JG007014								37502709					WOS:000924549000001
J	Segal, M; Kubesh, R				Segal, M; Kubesh, R			Inferring snow-breeze characteristics from frozen-lake breezes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												Thermally induced flows between snow and snow-free areas (snow breezes) are difficult to evaluate by direct observations. This note outlines the equivalence of the surface thermal flux over snow and that over frozen/near-frozen lakes and discusses the similarity of the related induced breezes. Surface observations for the frozen Lake Winnipeg and the near-frozen Lake Michigan were used to infer snow breezes. On synoptically unperturbed days during late winter and early spring, lake breezes were detected, and their characteristics are provided for several illustrative cases. Lake breezes with intensities as high as 6 m s(-1) and onshore penetration of at least 6 km were observed. It is suggested that in future projects, detailed observations along these lakes could provide indirect characterization of snow breezes.																			0894-8763					JUN	1996	35	6					1033	1039		10.1175/1520-0450(1996)035<1033:ISBCFF>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(1996)035<1033:ISBCFF>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1996UV41900020

Phosphorus-only fertilization rapidly initiates large nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria blooms in two oligotrophic lakes	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Two small, oligotrophic lakes at the IISD-Experimental Lakes Area in northwestern Ontario, Canada were fertilized weekly with only phosphorus (P) in the summer and early fall of 2019. The P fertilization rates were high enough (13.3 mu g l(-1) added weekly) to produce dense, month-long blooms of N-2-fixing Dolichospermum species in both lakes within 9-12 weeks after fertilization began, turning them visibly green without the addition of nitrogen. P-only fertilization increased average seasonal chlorophyll a concentrations and cyanobacteria biomass well above the pre-fertilization levels of 2017 and 2018. Nitrogen (N) content in the epilimnion of thermally stratified Lake 304 and the water column of shallow Lake 303 doubled and P storage in the water column temporarily increased during the blooms. These whole-lake fertilization experiments demonstrate that large cyanobacteria blooms can develop rapidly under high P loading without anthropogenic N inputs, suggesting that aggressive N control programs are unlikely to prevent bloom formation and that P controls should remain the cornerstone for cyanobacteria management.

On field investigation, heavy cyanobacterial blooms were visible in these impoundments and analysis of water samples showed the dominance of Microcystis spp. (probably Microcystis aeruginosa). Macroscopic lesions seen at necropsy and histopathological lesions were compatible with a diagnosis of cyanobacterial intoxication. Laboratory toxicity tests and assays also confirmed the presence of significant levels of microcystins in water from the two dams. These outbreaks occurred during the dry autumn and early winter seasons when water levels in these dams were dropping, and a common feature was that all the affected dams were supporting a large number of hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus amphibius). It is hypothesised that hippopotamus' urine and faeces, together with agitation of the sediments, significantly contributed to internal loading of phosphates and nitrogen - leading to eutrophication of the water in these impoundments and subsequent cyanobacterial blooms. A major cause for concern was that a number of white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) were amongst the victims of these bio-intoxication events. This publication discusses the eco-epidemiology and pathology of these clustered mortalities, as well as the management options considered and eventually used to address the problem.

Aims To describe the movements of Common Pochards Aythya ferina and Tufted Ducks Aythya fuligula during the wintering season in France and to investigate intrinsic and extrinsic factors potentially affecting the direction and distance of these movement. Methods Distances, directions and patterns/strategies of winter movements were assessed from a combination of encounter data: physical recaptures at the ringing site, re-sightings of individuals fitted with nasal saddles, and ring recoveries of dead individuals. Results Patterns of movements derived from multiple locations (i.e. successive re-sightings) of individuals could be assessed, showing that several 'strategies' may coexist in the same species (residency, exploitation of two wintering sites with or without return journey, and exploration of several sites). Individuals may use several sites more than 100 km apart during a given winter. Interestingly, directions of movements did not fit any previously observed pattern, especially in Common Pochards, whose movements tended to be biased towards the northeast at the beginning of the wintering season (October-November) whereas south or southwest movements were expected. Weather conditions in winter affected directions of movements in Common Pochards; eastwards movements towards ice-free Alpine lakes were more frequently observed during cold spells. Conclusion Overall, our results suggest that exchanges of birds between wetlands more than 100 km apart are rather common even though short-distance movements related to daily activities are dominant. Our study provides new insights into the potential origin of ducks suspected of spreading infectious diseases.

J	BOWERS, JA; VANDERPLOEG, HA				BOWERS, JA; VANDERPLOEG, HA			INSITU PREDATORY BEHAVIOR OF MYSIS-RELICTA IN LAKE-MICHIGAN	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Selectivity coefficients (W'') and predation rates on Lake Michigan zooplankton were determined for M. relicta during spring through fall using an in situ method. W'' values indicated the following ranked order of prey preference: Cladocera > copepod copepodites and copepod nauplii > adult diaptomids and cyclopoids. With few exceptions, W'' values for different prey categories remained fairly constant despite greatly changing relative abundances of prey. Predation rates and prey selectivity were similar in most cases to those determined in laboratory studies. Ingestion rates (percent dry body weight/day-1) were correlated to total prey biomass (r = 0.38) and to effective prey biomass( r = 0.85), where the weighting factors were overall mean selectivity coefficients for the different prey categories. Seasonally varying composition of prey caused much of the variation in ingestion rates among experiments. Feeding trials performed at the same depth with daytime and nighttime assemblages of zooplankton indicated that Cladocera may escape heavy Mysis predation at night by migrating from the metalimnetic-hypolimnetic interface into the epilimnion.

Over the past few years, the upstream part of this eutrophic waterbody has been invaded by Egeria densa. To define suitable methods for the management of this plant, a 1996 study focused on the morphometric characteristics of the reservoir, the quality of its water and sediments, the diversity of its vegetation and various aspects of colonisation by E. densa. Analyses of usage and pollution were also made, as well as a review of the techniques available to control the development of this species. Based on the results of this study, a management plan was put forward. Studies in 1997 and 1998 showed a significant decline in the level of colonisation. This was probably due to the substantial floods which uprooted submerged plants in winter, followed by massive ice formation during winter and warm temperatures in spring leading to a development of cyanobacteria which are detrimental to macrophytes. Monitoring the competition between E. densa and the cyanobacteria could lead to determination of the causes of the predominance of one or the other.																			0018-8158					NOV	1999	415						243	247		10.1023/A:1003864024365	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003864024365													WOS:000085019200034

The species and age composition of fish in the survey area was investigated by gillnet fishing and SCUBA-diving. In summer, the horizontal distribution of perch was patchy. Population density declined from east to west, and highest densities occurred in one shallow bay and close to ports and jetties at steeper shores. During daytime, perch stayed in the sublittoral zone between 3 and 15 m depth and between 2 and 6 m above the thermocline. Within this layer age classes were separated spatially: the relative number of young-of-the-year perch declined with depth whereas the relative number of adult perch (2+ and older) increased with depth. At dusk the fish migrated to the littoral zone, where they spent the night resting on the bottom. In winter, under almost homothermal conditions, perch of all ages were located between the 35 and 70 m depth contours, where they performed pronounced diel vertical migrations. They rested on, or close to, the bottom during daytime and ascended up to 20 m below the surface at night. During this season, horizontal distribution of perch was much more homogeneous than summer.

However, few studies address the influence of summer phytoplankton dynamics on microbial responses to DOC additions. We sampled natural plankton assemblages during two contrasting periods of summer in a high-altitude lake in the French Alps and subjected them to glucose and nutrient enrichments under two light conditions (dark or light) and two temperature conditions (10 degrees C or 18 degrees C). Our results indicate that glucose use by bacteria differs over the summer, depending on the availability of autochthonous DOC and the nutrient limitation. Glucose was consumed by bacteria more in early summer; however, biomass increased with glucose addition more in late summer than in early summer. This pattern arose from the greater availability of phytoplankton-derived DOC in late summer, reducing the need for alternative carbon sources in late summer, when phytoplankton biomass was high. Mixotrophic taxa were stimulated after glucose additions both in early summer and in late summer. We found greater competition between bacteria and phytoplankton in late summer after glucose addition, linked to the summer nutrient limitation pattern. Our study thus highlights a differential response depending on the timing of summer DOC inputs. The global changes forecast for the French Alps should increase heterotrophic and mixotrophic processes in planktonic communities of shallow high-altitude lakes with vegetated catchments. This experimental study provides insights that will be useful in predicting ecological trajectories and in refining predictions of sentinel lakes' responses to global changes.

Addressing the winter data gap will enhance our understanding of winter ecosystem function and of lake response to environmental change. Here, we describe a dataset generated by a multi-institutional winter sampling campaign across all five Laurentian Great Lakes and some of their connecting waters (the Great Lakes Winter Grab). The objective of Winter Grab was to characterize mid-winter limnological conditions in the Great Lakes using standard sample collection and analysis methods. Nineteen research groups sampled 49 locations varying widely in depth and trophic status, collecting a range of limnological data.

The Pearson cross-correlation and the principal component analysis were applied to test the potential correlation of phytoplankton with climate (mean winter and summer temperature), water (pH), environmental (land use - forest, agriculture and urban) and sediment (organic and carbonate matter) variables. The results show the dominance of Chlorophyta in Latvian lakes and ponds. Cyanobacteria were dominant in sites closer to human-populated and recreation centres, including urban and agricultural land-use areas. In more turbid and polluted environments, Chlorophyta thrive today. Charophyta dominated in forested areas. Although Chlorophyta dominate in present-day waterbodies, the rather high relative proportion of Cyanobacteria draws attention to a potential threat. As the cross-correlation results indicate a negative correlation between Cyanobacteria and mean winter temperatures, in warmer climates Cyanobacteria can overtake other phytoplankton. The results of this study can be further used in lake and pond management.

Features of Seasonal Changes in PAH Concentration in the Bottom Sediments of Southern Baikal in the Town of Baikal'sk Area	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY												The content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in 2020-2022 was determined for the bottom sediments from the coastal part of Southern Baikal in the zone subjected to the impact from the wastewater discharged by the former Baikal Pulp and Paper Mill (BPPM) using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection. For the first time, the seasonal changes of the PAH content in the Lake Baikal sediments were assessed. A multidirectional change in the average concentrations of low- and high-molecular-weight polyarenes in the sediments depending on the sampling season was shown. A characteristic feature of the seasonal change in the PAHs composition of the bottom sediments collected from the BPPM wastewater discharge site is the predominance of low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons (naphthalene, phenanthrene) in the spring sampling season (March) as compared to that of high-molecular-weight (5-6-ring) PAHs in the autumn season (September). The results obtained may be of practical interest for assessing the pollution levels for the bottom sediments in all kinds of water areas at different sampling times.

The assessment results based on water quality index (WQI) showed that the water quality in Lake Poyang was generally "moderate", according to the classification of the surface water quality standard (GB3838-2002) in China, but a deteriorating trend was observed at the interannual scale. Seasonally, the water quality was best in summer and worst in winter. Easily treated parameters generally determined the WQI value in the assessment, especially total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), while toxic metals and other parameters in Lake Poyang were generally at low and safe levels for drinking water. Water level (WL) has a net positive effect on water quality in Lake Poyang through dilution of environmental parameters, which in practice means TN. Consequently, local management agencies should pay more attention to nutrient concentrations during the monitoring schedule, as well as during the low-water periods which manifest a relatively bad water quality state, especially with the prevailing low WL observed recently in Lake Poyang.					陈, 雨薇/HKF-1175-2023; Wu, Zhaoshi/ABG-7886-2021; Lu, Zhang/F-8165-2018														2045-2322					DEC 21	2017	7								17999	10.1038/s41598-017-18285-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-18285-y								29269834					WOS:000418562100039

The model incorporates linkages between ozone and meteorology. It is specifically formulated to identify meteorological regimes conducive of high ozone levels and allow ozone behavior during these periods to be different from typical ozone behavior. The model is used to estimate or forecast spatial fields of O-3 conditional on observed (or forecasted) meteorology including temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed and direction. The model is successful at forecasting the onset of periods of high ozone levels, but more work is needed to also accurately identify departures from these periods. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Mainly vitellogenic females were found in August (winter), some ovulating in October (mid-spring) and with atretic oocytes in December (end of spring). In accordance with this, gonadosomatic index (GSI) and estradiol plasma levels showed maximum values in October (7.6 +/- 0.7%; 1631.7 +/- 256.1 pg/mL) and minimum values in December (1.2 +/- 0.3%; 230,33 +/- 8,74 pg/mL). Spermiating males were found during the whole spawning season and only arrested in December. The highest GSI values were recorded in October (4.6 +/- 0.2%) and for testosterone (T) in August (1113.2 +/- 503.8 pg/mL). Meanwhile, in December the minimum GSI and T plasma values (1.3 +/- 0.6%, 323.8 +/- 5.3 pg/mL) were observed. According to the Fourier fitted models, temperature explains more than 70% of the observed variation in GSI in both sexes. Moreover, the total GSI variation range was positively related to the total temperature range variation experienced during the reproductive seasons demonstrating the influence of this environmental variable on maturation intensity and dynamics.					; Colautti, Darío/AAV-4732-2020	BERASAIN, GUSTAVO EMILIO/0000-0003-2342-2540; Miranda, Leandro/0000-0002-8572-0677; Colautti, Dario/0000-0002-8896-4255													0028-8330	1175-8805				OCT 2	2022	56	4					667	681		10.1080/00288330.2021.1947328	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2021.1947328		JUL 2021											WOS:000670160400001
J	MOSS, B				MOSS, B			ECOLOGICAL HISTORY OF A MEDIEVAL MAN-MADE LAKE - HICKLING BROAD, NORFOLK, UNITED-KINGDOM	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Changes in Hickling Broad, since its creation in the 14th or 15th centuries by the flooding of peat diggings, were deduced from dating and analysis of a sediment core, historical information and current limnological studies. Until the 1930''s there was little major change. Increased agricultural land fertilization led to markedly increased organic sedimentation from the 1930''s onwards, due to increased growth of submerged macrophytes. Inorganic sedimentation increased concurrently as more powerful pumps were installed to help drain the adjacent fens and marshes. There was no evidence of increased plankton populations during this phase, but epiphytic diatom populations increased. In the mid-1960''s the current period of hypereutrophication began. Epiphytic diatom numbers increased markedly and in the early 1970''s the previous luxuriant macrophytes became sparse and the water became turbid with phytoplankton. These changes are attributable mainly to increases in the size of a roost of migratory black headed gulls Larus ridibundus L.) on the lake in autumn and winter.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1978	60	1					23	32		10.1007/BF00018684	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00018684													WOS:A1978FH24100004

Effects of Lake Surface Elevation on Shoreline-Spawning Lost River Suckers	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We analyzed remote detection data from PIT-tagged Lost River Suckers Deltistes luxatus at four shoreline spawning areas in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, to determine whether spawning of this endangered species was affected by low water levels. Our investigation was motivated by the observation that the surface elevation of the lake during the 2010 spawning season was the lowest in 38 years. Irrigation withdrawals in 2009 that were not replenished by subsequent winter-spring inflows caused a reduction in available shoreline spawning habitat in 2010. We compared metrics of skipped spawning, movement among spawning areas, and spawning duration across 8 years (2006-2013) that had contrasting spring water levels. Some aspects of sucker spawning were similar in all years, including few individuals straying from the shoreline areas to spawning locations in lake tributaries and consistent effects of increasing water temperatures on the accumulation of fish at the spawning areas. During the extreme low water year of 2010, 14% fewer female and 8% fewer male suckers joined the shoreline spawning aggregation than in the other years. Both males and females visited fewer spawning areas within Upper Klamath Lake in 2010 than in other years, and the median duration at spawning areas in 2010 was at least 36% shorter for females and 20% shorter for males relative to other years. Given the imperiled status of the species and the declining abundance of the population in Upper Klamath Lake, any reduction in spawning success and egg production could negatively impact recovery efforts. Our results indicate that lake surface elevations above 1,262.3-1,262.5 m would be unlikely to limit the number of spawning fish and overall egg production.

Contributions of external nutrient loading and internal cycling to cyanobacterial bloom dynamics in Lake Taihu, China: Implications for nutrient management	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CyanoHABs) are linked to increasing anthropogenic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) inputs. However, CyanoHABs in many large lakes continue despite extensive abatement efforts, mostly focused on external P loading. Internal nutrient cycling can modify nutrient availability and limitation; thus, understanding the relative importance of external vs. internal nutrient loading is essential for developing effective mitigation strategies for CyanoHABs. We estimated long-term nutrient budgets for Lake Taihu, China, from mass balance models using extensive monitoring of input and output nutrient data from 2005 to 2018 to quantify contributions from internal nutrient loading. The nutrient mass balance showed that 9% and 63% of annual external N and P inputs, respectively, were retained in the lake. Denitrification removed 54% of external N loading and can thus help explain rapid decreases in lake N concentrations and summer N limitation. Water column NH4+ regeneration can help sustain CyanoHABs over the short term and contributed 38-58% of potential NH4+ demand for summer-fall, Microcystis-dominated blooms. Internal P release contributed 23-90% of CyanoHABs P demand, although Taihu was a net P sink on an annual scale. Our results show that internal nutrient cycling helps sustain CyanoHABs in Taihu, despite reductions in external nutrient inputs. Furthermore, N is leaving the lake faster than P, thereby creating persistent N limitation. Therefore, parallel reductions in external N loading, along with P, will be most effective in reducing CyanoHABs and accelerate the recovery process in this and other large, shallow lakes.

The objective of this ongoing study was to isolate and identify the bacterial pathogen in Lake Ohrid, since the main fish species that populate this aquatic body belongs to the Salmonidae family. Salmo letnica and Salmo ohridanus are the main species where we have focused our analyses. These fish species not only are one of the main catches but also one of the main foods in the region around Lake Ohrid. Sampling was carried out during spring and autumn season in 2017. Material from liver and skin mucus from each sample was used for the inoculation of the TSA medium. The incubation period was between 5-7 days at 18 degrees C which was followed biochemical test. PCR was performed by using MIY primer (MIY1 5'-AGCCTCCACGCGCTCACAGC-3' and MIY2 5'-AAGAGGCCCCATAGTGTGGG-3'). All the data were analyzed with Sigma Plot 12.5.

This technique was used in situ during six sampling periods over one year in Lake Greifen. The DGT-labile species of Cu and Ni amounted to 15-25% of the total dissolved concentrations. Speciation by ligand-exchange/DPCSV indicated that Cu and Ni were predominantly organically complexed (>99%). Thus, the DGT-labile species for Cu and Ni were much more abundant than the free ionic and inorganic species determined by ligand-exchange/DPCSV The results can be explained by incomplete metal exchange of very strong complexes with the chelating resin in the DGT devices, metal exchange of less abundant weaker complexes, and by slow diffusion of exchangeable organic complexes. For Zn (36 to >90% DGT-labile) and Mn (50 to 100% DGT-labile), the results indicated that these metals are less strongly organically complexed. A larger fraction of Zn occurred in DGT-labile species in the hypolimnion than it did in the surface water, probably due to a larger concentration of strong ligands in the productive surface water. DGT-labile Cd-(0.01-0.02 nM) and Pb-species (0.03-0.06 nM) were detected at very low levels. The combination of measurements of dissolved and DGT-labile species showed a decrease of Cu, Zn, Cd and Mn concentration at 2.5 m from June to August, which was probably linked to intensive sedimentation of organic matter during summer stagnation. Mixing and oxygenation of the lake in winter-spring led to an increase in dissolved and DGT-labile Ni, Zn and Cd, whereas Mn decreased in the hypolimnion.

Mound springs in the arid Lake Eyre South region of South Australia: A new depositional tufa model and its controls	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												The mound springs of the Lake Eyre South region of South Australia are rare but prominent, dome-shaped accumulations of largely calcium carbonate deposited by artesian springs. Despite similar formations being found worldwide, few intensive studies of the formation and ongoing evolution of these structures exist. In this study, samples from a selection of active mound springs were subjected to petrological and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) techniques to gain insight into mound spring morphology. Additionally, microcosms containing three types of artificial substrate (marble, glass and copper) were placed within active mound spring environments to aid determination of the rate, spatial extent and the influence of microbial activity on carbonate precipitation. Finally, water samples from spring vents were analyzed for water quality and major ions. Carbonate deposits were interpreted to be largely plant or microbial tufa. From the microcosms, thrombolitic-textured micrite was deposited on only the marble and glass substrates and only within spring tails distal from vents. Precipitation rates from the microcosm experiment of between 0.15 and 1.6 kg m(-2) yr(-1) are similar to rates observed at cyanobacteria-associated, low-energy, carbonate depositing environments. These results suggest that tufa precipitation is linked to the development of extracellular polymeric substances. Conversely, it was interpreted that emergent spring water is calcite under-saturated based on water chemistry analyses and marble dissolution proximal to spring vents. A number of factors important to the formation of mound springs were determined; including the role of bio-mineralization and hydrophytes in mound construction and the implications for time-limited and spatially dynamic precipitation on spring flow.

The low summer discharge will coincide with the highest water demand for irrigation, and local and regional water shortages are expected to become more likely. One possible measure to adapt to these changes can be the extension of current uses of artificial reservoirs and natural lakes to the provision of water for the alleviation of water shortage. This study assesses the potential of reservoirs and natural lakes for the alleviation of water shortages in a nationwide analysis in Switzerland. To do so, we estimated water supply and demand under current and future conditions both under normal and extreme runoff regimes for 307 catchments. Water demand was assessed for various categories including drinking water, industrial use, artificial snow production, agriculture, ecological flow requirements, and hydropower production. The aggregated supply and demand estimates were used to derive water surplus/shortage estimates. These were then compared to the storage capacity of reservoirs and natural lakes within a catchment to determine the potential for alleviating summer water scarcity. Our results show that water shortage is expected mainly in the lowland region north of the Alps, and less in the Alps. In this lowland region, the potential of natural lakes for alleviating water scarcity is high. This potential is lower in the Alps where it is expected to increase or decrease under future conditions depending on the region of interest. Catchments with a high storage capacity can potentially contribute to the alleviation of water shortage downstream. We conclude that a spatial mismatch between water scarcity and storage availability exists since water stored in reservoirs on the southern side of the Alps is often not available for the use on the northern side.

Intercomparison, interpretation, and assessment of spring phenology in North America estimated from remote sensing for 1982-2006	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Shifts in the timing of spring phenology are a central feature of global change research. Long-term observations of plant phenology have been used to track vegetation responses to climate variability but are often limited to particular species and locations and may not represent synoptic patterns. Satellite remote sensing is instead used for continental to global monitoring. Although numerous methods exist to extract phenological timing, in particular start-of-spring (SOS), from time series of reflectance data, a comprehensive intercomparison and interpretation of SOS methods has not been conducted. Here, we assess 10 SOS methods for North America between 1982 and 2006. The techniques include consistent inputs from the 8 km Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer NDVIg dataset, independent data for snow cover, soil thaw, lake ice dynamics, spring streamflow timing, over 16 000 individual measurements of ground-based phenology, and two temperature-driven models of spring phenology. Compared with an ensemble of the 10 SOS methods, we found that individual methods differed in average day-of-year estimates by +/- 60 days and in standard deviation by +/- 20 days. The ability of the satellite methods to retrieve SOS estimates was highest in northern latitudes and lowest in arid, tropical, and Mediterranean ecoregions. The ordinal rank of SOS methods varied geographically, as did the relationships between SOS estimates and the cryospheric/hydrologic metrics. Compared with ground observations, SOS estimates were more related to the first leaf and first flowers expanding phenological stages. We found no evidence for time trends in spring arrival from ground- or model-based data; using an ensemble estimate from two methods that were more closely related to ground observations than other methods, SOS trends could be detected for only 12% of North America and were divided between trends towards both earlier and later spring.

A subsample of 676 trout, stratified by fish size and lake habitat, provided biological data. The entire population is presently derived from hatchery production, stocked at lengths of .apprx. 75-300 mm. Peak annulus formation occurs in March and April, followed by the period of maximum growth. Scale patterns illustrate a variable growing season. Maximum growth in length is in the first 3 yr of life; after that, males begin to grow faster than females. Males attained a greater age in the sample; i.e., the oldest male was 7 yr old compared to 6 yr for females. The Pyramid lake Lahontan cutthroat trout exhibit nearly isometric growth. The legal sport fishery removed < 20,000 adult fish in 1977 (> 380 mm); other decimating factors are poorly understood. No evidence of the following diseases or pathogens was found in the Pyramid Lake population, presuming a carrier incidence of 2% at the 95% confidence level: infectious pancreatic necrosis, infectious hematopoietic necrosis, viral hemorrhagic septicemia, bacterial kidney disease, enteric redmouth, furunculosis, whirling disease and blood fluke; 7 of 235 (.simeq. 3%) adults sampled at the Marble Bluff fishway were positive for furunculosis. Small trout feed primarily on zooplankton and benthic invertebrates; cutthroat trout > 300 mm are piscivorous, feeding almost exclusively on tui chub (Gila bicolor). The spawning migration of Pyramid Lake cutthroat trout to the Marble Bluff egg taking facility in spring 1976 and 1977 peaked in April and May. Females mature at 3 or 4 years (352-484 mm) and males mature at 2 or 3 yr (299-445 mm). Mean diameter of mature eggs is 4.51 mm; both ovum size and fecundity are a function of fish size. Fecundity ranges from 1241 to 7963 eggs, with a mean of 3815. Lahontan cutthroat trout comprise < 2% of the numerical relative abundance and < 7% of the total fish biomass. Distribution patterns vary on a seasonal basis, with maximum activity during late fall and winter. Management objectives are presented and recommendations are discussed.																			0017-3614						1983	43	1					1	29																WOS:A1983QK20300001

Impacts of extreme weather events on highly eutrophic marine ecosystem (Rogoznica. Lake, Adriatic coast)	CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH												Rogoznica Lake is highly eutrophic marine system located on the Eastern Adriatic coast (43 degrees 32'N, 15 degrees 58' E). Because of the relatively small size (10,276 m(2)) and depth (15 m) it experiences strong natural and indirect anthropogenic: influences. Dynamics within the lake is characterized by the extreme and highly variable environmental conditions (seasonal variations in salinity and temperature, water stratification and mixing, redox and euxinic conditions, concentrations of nutrients) which significantly influence the biology inside the lake. Due to the high phytoplankton activity, the upper part of the water column is well oxygenated, while hypoxia/anoxia usually occurs in the bottom layers. Anoxic part of the water column is characterized with high concentrations of sulfide (up to 5 mM) and nutrients (NH4+ up to 315 mu M; PO43- up to 53 mu M; SiO44- up to 680 mu M) indicating the pronounced remineralization of the allochthonous organic matter, produced in the surface waters. The mixolimnion varies significantly within a season feeling effects of the Adriatic atmospheric and ocean dynamics (temperature, wind, heat fluxes, rainfall) which all affect the vertical stability and possibly induce vertical mixing and/or turnover. Seasonal vertical mixing usually occurs during the autumn/winter upon the breakdown of the stratification, injecting oxygen-rich water from the surface into the deeper layers. Depending on the intensity and duration of the vertical dynamics (slower diffusion and/or faster turnover of the water layers) anoxic conditions could developed within the whole water column. Extreme weather events such as abrupt change in the air temperature accompanied with a strong wind and consequently heat flux are found to be a key triggering mechanism for the fast turnover, introducing a large amount of nutrients and sulfur species from deeper parts to the surface. Increased concentration of nutrients, especially ammonium, phosphate, and silicates persisting for several months after the mixing event, together with anoxic stress conditions, additionally influence already stressed ecosystem, hence shifting the community structure and food/web interactions in this marine system.

J	Yanase, W; Abe-Ouchi, A				Yanase, W.; Abe-Ouchi, A.			The LGM surface climate and atmospheric circulation over East Asia and the North Pacific in the PMIP2 coupled model simulations	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The surface conditions and atmospheric circulation over East Asia and the North Pacific during the last glacial maximum have been investigated using outputs from several coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model in the PMIP2 database. During the boreal summer, the weakening of the high pressure system over the North Pacific and less precipitation over East Asia are found in most models. The latter can be attributed to reduced moisture transport. During the boreal winter, an intensification of the Aleutian low and southward shift of the westerly jet stream in the upper troposphere are found in most models. Some of the results in the present study seem to be consistent with the paleoclimatic reconstructions in the previous studies: pollen and lake-status records suggest dry climate over East Asia during the last glacial maximum, and part of the dust record has a signal that the East Asian winter monsoon was more strong and the westerly jet stream in the upper troposphere was further south during the last glacial maximum than at the present day. This result confirms that a coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model is a promising tool to understand not only the global climate but also the regional climate in the past.

J	RICHEY, JE				RICHEY, JE			PATTERNS OF PHOSPHORUS SUPPLY AND UTILIZATION IN LAKE WASHINGTON AND FINDLEY LAKE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Patterns of P supply and utilization were investigated for 2 yr. In Lake Washington [Washington], the phytoplankton bloom began in Feb. or early March, reaching peaks of 2165 (1974) and 1885 mg C.cntdot.m-2 d[day]-1 (1975). Most of the P utilized was from phosphate accumulated in the water, resulting in depletions of soluble reactive P in the euphotic zone of 260-12 mg PO4-P.cntdot.m-2. Zooplankton excretion supplied phosphate during the later stages of the bloom and in summer. In Findley Lake, the blooms were of shorter duration and reached maxima of 400-711 mg C.cntdot.m-2.cntdot.d-1. Phosphate was supplied from fluvial inputs and zooplankton excretion, with little accumulation (10-50 mg PO4-P.cntdot.m-2). Comparison of the measured rate constants for turnover (ki) with the constants expected for photosynthesis (ke) showed P flux patterns. In Lake Washington, ki varied from < 0.05.cntdot.h-1 in winter to 5-10.cntdot.h-1 during summer stratification, while ke was comparable during prebloom and early-bloom periods and only about 0.1.cntdot.h-1 in summer. In Findley Lake, ki (2.9-5.3.cntdot.h-1) was always > ke (0.05.cntdot.h-1). Only after phosphate depletion did the usual pattern of rapid uptake and release occur. Nutrient addition and isotope partitioning experiments suggested that the divergence of ki and ke reflected a stressed physiological condition of the algae that prevented incorporation and promoted compensatory rapid turnover of phosphate.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1979	24	5					906	916		10.4319/lo.1979.24.5.0906	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1979.24.5.0906													WOS:A1979HN52000009

The present paper deals primarily with the various paleomonsoon records of the last 130,000 years in the southeast monsoon area. These records mainly come from the following three fields: (i) the historical, (ii) the geological, including loess-paleosol sequence, deserts, lakes, snowlines, timberlines, the phenomena of continental desertization and so on, and (iii) the biological, presented by vegetation a.d mammals. Among these records, the loess-paleosol sequence in the Loess Plateau reflects a climatic history characterized by alternation of two different climatic periods when the Asian winter monsoon and summer monsoon showed pronounced effects on environment, respectively.

Genera such as Dinobryon, Oscillatoria and Gymnodinium tended to be found at discrete depths whereas other genera such as Cryptomonas and Rhodomonas tended to be more uniformly distributed throughout the water column. The discrete depth distribution of some of these genera compared with the weak thermal stabilization of the area suggests depth selection and habitat preference within the algal community. Physical processes probably played a major role in regulating the timing and duration of vertical diatom pulses, and resuspension from the sediment played a major role as to the timing of the autumn growth. Vertical mixing in the nearshore zone was sufficient for some diatom genera such as Tabellaria to maintain populations throughout the summer. These mixing processes affect the stability of community structures and associations that develop within the water column. The role of physical processes and their potential effects on algal production in the Great Lakes is discussed.

J	Adams, SB; Frissell, CA				Adams, SB; Frissell, CA			Thermal habitat use and evidence of seasonal migration by rocky mountain tailed frogs, Ascaphus montanus, in Montana	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												All life stages of Rocky Mountain Tailed Frogs (Ascaphus montanus) occurred in a reach of Moore Creek, Montana, where water temperatures exceeded those previously reported for Ascaphus in the wild. However, relative density of Ascaphus in the warmest reach, immediately downstream of a lake outlet, was lower than in cooler reaches downstream. Although we observed larvae and frogs in water temperatures up to 21 degreesC, cold groundwater seeps contributed to a spatially complex thermal structure in the warmest stream reach. Frogs congregating near a cold seep and nesting in a groundwater-influenced site were likely using behavioral thermoregulation. At a stream weir in the warmest reach, we captured 32 Tailed Frogs moving downstream and none upstream, in September and October 1997. Because no migration was evident at five other weirs where summer water temperatures remained below 16 degreesC, we propose that the frogs moving through upper Moore Creek migrated seasonally to avoid the high temperatures. The mature frogs may spend summers in the small, cold lake inlet streams, moving downstream in the fall to overwinter. Behavioral studies would be necessary to determine the extent to which individuals limit their overall thermal exposure in such spatially complex environments. Migration in response to local, seasonally changing habitat suitability could explain the diverse, and apparently contradictory, movement patterns (or lack thereof) among Ascaphus populations reported in the literature. Future studies of Ascaphus movements could benefit by accounting for seasonal changes in habitat suitability and by quantifying in-stream movements.

Observation of the gut contents reflected a variety of feeding modes among fish species that consume a diverse assortment of prey, with limited dietary overlap. Basal food sources were distinguishable based on their delta C-13 isotopic signatures, and wide seasonal variations of isotope values were observed in the lake biota with a general trend towards enriched delta C-13 and delta N-15 values in summer and depleted values in winter. This pattern could be explained by a combination of environmental (e.g., irradiance and nutrient inputs) and biotic (e.g., availability of food sources and plasticity in prey item choice) features. We adopted a paired (gut contents and stable isotopes) approach to reconstruct diets that used known food items as end members in the isotopic mixing model analysis and diagrammed the food web structure of Lake Taihu describing the organic matter pathways from primary producers to predators of the upper trophic levels. Our surveys also corroborate the finding that phytoplankton were the most important primary source of organic matter for fauna within this macrophyte-dominated lake region, whereas macrophytes also made a sizeable contribution for several invertebrate and fish species, especially in winter.

J	Perlinger, JA; Tobias, DE; Morrow, PS; Doskey, PV				Perlinger, JA; Tobias, DE; Morrow, PS; Doskey, PV			Evaluation of novel techniques for measurement of air-water exchange of persistent bioaccumulative toxicants in Lake Superior	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												We report initial measurements of concentrations and net air-water exchange fluxes of target persistent bioaccumulative toxicants (PBTs) in Lake Superior utilizing techniques not previously applied for this purpose. Gaseous PBTs are collected in diffusion denuders containing sections of commercial chromatography columns and subsequently thermally extracted into the cooled injection inlet of a high-resolution gas chromatograph. The PBT sampling/analytical methods enable accurate determination of gas-phase PBT concentration and micrometeorological measurement of fluxes to be carried out. PBT fluxes are measured by the modified Bowen ratio technique in which sensible heat flux is related to PBT flux, with the assumption of identical transfer velocities of heat and PBTs between two heights in the atmospheric surface layer. Micrometeorological measurement of flux accounts for all sources of resistance to mass transfer, including atmospheric stability effects, surface films, waves, sea spray, and bubbles. The sensible heat flux, PBT concentration, and PBT flux measurements carried out in 14 2- or 3-h periods during seven sampling events in Lake Superior in summer and fall 2002 and spring 2003 demonstrate advantages under the constraints of the techniques. The uncertainty of the flux measurements was typically in the range from 1% to 160%. Gaseous concentrations of cc-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB) over Lake Superior were in the range from 6 to 170 and 12-95 pg/m(3), respectively. Fluxes out of Lake Superior were measurable in 75% of the cases in which a concentration gradient was measured, and were in the range from -0.17 to +0.064 ng/m(2)center dot h for alpha-HCH and from -0.60 to -0.093 ng/m(2)center dot h for HCB.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 1	2005	39	21					8411	8419		10.1021/es050899q	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es050899q								16294881					WOS:000233078000048

Responses of autumn-staging ducks and Coot Fulica atra to the Skjern River Valley wetland restoration project	WILDFOWL												Following 35 years of drainage and intensive arable tillage, the lower Skjern River in west Jutland, Denmark was re-engineered to a meandering riverbed and natural flooding regime to restore sediment and nutrient retention and reduce sedimentation and eutrophication of Ringkobing Fjord at its efflux. The creation of 22 km(2) of lakes, shallow wetlands and seasonally flooded grassland has attracted large numbers of autumn-staging waterbirds, including peaks of 8,800-19,700 individuals and more than three-quarters of a million bird-days per annum spent there by nine common freshwater duck species during 2002-2016. Over this period, annual numbers of bird-days have declined by 45-68% amongst Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Eurasian Wigeon Mareca penelope, Northern Pintail.A. acute: and Eurasian Coot Fulica aim, fluctuated without trend for Eurasian Teal A. crecca (hereafter Teal) and Gadwall M strepera and increased by 99-557% amongst Northern Shoveler Spatula clypeata, Common Pochard Ayt* ferina (hereafter Pochard), Tufted Duck A. fuligula and Common Goldeneye Bucephala clangula (hereafter Goldeneye). Despite these changes in species composition, there have been no overall declines in total bird-use of the site during 2002-2016. Regression models showed a positive relationship between annual numbers of bird-days for Teal and the mean autumn water depth (likely a response to the extent of shallow flooded grassland created by high water levels), as did those for the diving ducks (Pochard, 'Rifted Duck and Goldeneye), which benefited from the extent and depth of floodwaters. We lament the lack of environmental monitoring post-restoration on the lower Skjern River, which would have provided better information on how changes in food supply, abundance and accessibility affected the annual numbers of autumn-staging waterbirds at the site. Nevertheless, the site, which was formerly devoid of any waterbirds, has immediately become, and remained, one of Denmark's five most important freshwater wetlands for autumn-staging waterbirds with minimal management intervention, confirming the considerable potential for such restoration schemes.

HMs concentration in water, sediment and fish were significantly greater (P<0.01) during the winter season as compared to summer season. Significantly higher concentrations of HiMs were found in sediments as compared to water (P<0.05) and fish (P<0.05). Concentrations of Fe, Cu, Cr and Ni in sediments were significantly correlated (P<0.05) with concentrations of these HMs in water which shows that these HMs re-suspend from sediments into water. Similarly concentrations of HMs in water were significantly correlated (P<0.05) with their concentrations in fish which indicates accumulation of HMs from water in fish tissues through its gills and skin.					yassar, abderrahim/T-6705-2017														0030-9923					DEC	2013	45	6					1663	1668																WOS:000330012300025

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FEATURES IN CHILDREN WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA	WORLD OF MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY												Accomodations, meteorological dependence on moist weather and exacerbations in moist seasons (autumn and spring) by questioning of 125 children aged from 1 - 18 years with persistent and intermittent bronchial asthma combined with atopy or without it have been analyzed in the article. Living near open water (river, lake or pond) and in houses with high humidity or/and rooms covered with a mold has been taken into account. It has been found out that children with persistent asthma are more dependent on wet weather and more often live in places with high humidity such as damp rooms or houses located close to open water rather than children with intermittent asthma. Children with intermittent asthma develop attacks of the disease mainly in wet seasons; it corresponds to the same frequency of attacks in persistent asthma. More remarkable bronchial osmotic hyperreactivity has been detected in children with both intermittent and persistent bronchial asthma combined with atopy correlating with more often living in places with high humidity and often exacerbations in moist weather in children with atopic predisposition. Nonatopic children and children with intermittent bronchial asthma less likely lived in houses with high humidity.

In this study, we present methane oxidation estimates from three different lakes during summer and winter, using methods based on the transformation of added (CH4)-C-14, the fractionation of natural methane C-13, and the mass balance modeling of concentration gradients, All methods yielded similar results, including similar differences between lakes and seasons. Average methane oxidation rates varied from 0.25 to 81 mg of C m(-2) d(-1) and indicate that the three methods are comparable, although they to some extent take different processes into account. Critical issues as well as drawbacks and advantages with the used methods are thoroughly discussed. We conclude that methods using the stable isotope or mass balance modeling approach represent promising alternatives, particularly for studies focusing on ecosystem-scale carbon metabolism.					; Tranvik, Lars/H-2222-2011	Tranvik, Lars J./0000-0003-3509-8266; Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152													0013-936X					AUG 1	2002	36	15					3354	3361		10.1021/es010311p	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es010311p								12188365					WOS:000177242600043

We employed remote sensing and statistical tools to analyze datasets from both short-term (2017-2018) field investigations to explore seasonal patterns, and long-term (1988-2018) Landsat remote-sensing images to detect annual patterns of macrophyte distributions and study their responses to changes in climate, hydrology, and anthropogenic activities in a chain of water diversion lakes in eastern China. We found: 1) biomass and species richness of macrophytes peaked in summer with dominant species of submerged macrophytes Ceratophyllum demersum, Potamogeton pectinatus, and Potamogeton maackianus and floating macrophytes Trapa bispinosa, and non-native species Cabomba caroliniana spread in midstream Luoma Lake and Nansi Lake in summer, while Potamogeton crispus was dominant in all the lakes in spring; 2) water physicochemical parameters (chloride and water depth), lake characteristics (area and water storage), climate factors (air temperature and precipitation), and anthropogenic activities (commercial fishery and urban development) were significantly correlated to the seasonal distribution of macrophytes; 3) long-term data showed a significantly negative correlation between coverage of floating macrophytes and precipitation where the wettest year of 2003 had the lowest coverage of floating macrophytes; and 4) climate (air temperature) and hydrology (water level) were positively correlated with total macrophyte coverage, but human disturbance indexed by the gross domestic product was negatively driving long-term coverage of macrophytes. Our study has important implications for understanding the long-term succession of macrophytes under both natural and human stressors, and for future environmental management and ecological restoration of freshwater lakes.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				OCT 1	2022	319								115726	10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115726	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.115726		JUL 2022						35849931					WOS:000831076000004

Also, the connection between El Nio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and precipitation extremes is analyzed and possible causes for the connection are briefly discussed. Results indicate that (1) warming, characterized by a decreasing trend in frost days and a significant decrease of temperature extremes defined by lower temperature, in the Poyang Lake basin is observed. Temperature extremes, defined by higher temperature indices such as hot days, exhibit moderate changes with no significant trends. Moreover, warming occurs mainly in the northern part of the Poyang Lake basin; (2) precipitation changes are intensifying as reflected by increasing precipitation extremes. However, these changes are different from 1 month to another and the intensification is found mainly in winter and/or summer months; (3) the influence of ENSO on precipitation changes in the Poyang Lake basin is evident with a time lag of longer than 3 months. This should be due to the fact that higher sea surface temperature tends to trigger the occurrence of convective precipitation regimes. Results of this study are important for modeling the occurrence of precipitation extremes in a changing climate and regional climatic responses to global climate changes.

This increase has resulted in the newly discovered precipitation of gaylussite (Na2Ca(CO3)2 . 5H2O). Chemical modeling of the lake water using Pitzer equations suggests that gaylussite has been forming year round since about 1970 when the salinity first exceeded 80 parts per thousand, and that it was earlier forming intermittently at lower salinities in the winter shortly after diversion began, breaking down incongruently to aragonite during summers. Lake water appears to remain at a constant 9-fold supersaturation with aragonite at all salinities, perhaps buffered by monohydrocalcite which appears to be just at saturation for all salinities. Other saline lakes also appear to be buffered by monohydrocalcite.

J	Crosbie, ND; Teubner, K; Weisse, T				Crosbie, ND; Teubner, K; Weisse, T			Flow-cytometric mapping provides novel insights into the seasonal and vertical distributions of freshwater autotrophic picoplankton	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												This is the first study using flow cytometry to characterize the population dynamics of freshwater autotrophic picoplankton (APP) over a full seasonal cycle, the goal of which was to accurately quantify and qualify the natural APP populations in relation to major environmental parameters. In particular, we wanted to test current assumptions about the seasonal succession of prokaryotic and eukaryotic picoplankton cells, including the relationship between solitary picocyanobacteria and microcolonies. Using flow cytometry, we were able to efficiently characterize the abundances of 4 lake APP assemblages in Lake Mondsee, including that of a solitary picocyanobacterial population exhibiting high "side scatter" values. Such cells were not readily enumerated by epi-fluorescence microscopy. Unlike Lakes Constance and Maggiore, we found no evidence of a spring peak in solitary picocyanobacteria - we propose that the lack of a spring peak in Lake Mondsee was due to weak stratification in March-April and relatively deep vertical mixing. Since summer declines in the abundance of solitary picocyanobacteria were associated with extended periods of reduced light availability, it is likely that such declines were in part due to low relative growth rates, Finally, we argue that the formation of microcolonies by picocyanobacteria is unlikely to be a strategy for more efficient nutrient recycling (e.g. Stockner & Antia 1986). Rather, we suggest that microcolonies reach high concentrations in surface and near-surface waters due to the production of a photosynthate-rich mucilage resulting from active photosynthesis during periods of severe nutrient deficiency.					; Crosbie, Nicholas/T-5247-2019; Weisse, Thomas/HTQ-1404-2023; Teubner, Katrin/AAC-1224-2021	Teubner, Katrin/0000-0002-3699-2043; Weisse, Thomas/0000-0001-6103-6558; Crosbie, Nicholas/0000-0002-0319-4248; 													0948-3055	1616-1564				AUG 21	2003	33	1					53	66		10.3354/ame033053	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame033053													WOS:000185270500006

Ultra-small and abundant: Candidate phyla radiation bacteria are potential catalysts of carbon transformation in a thermokarst lake ecosystem	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												The candidate phyla radiation (CPR) is a diverse group of uncultured bacterial lineages with poorly understood metabolic functions. CPR bacteria can represent a large proportion of the total planktonic microbial community in subarctic thermokarst lakes, but their functional roles remain unexplored. We applied sequential water filtration and metagenomic shotgun sequencing to a peatland permafrost thaw lake, and found high proportions of CPR bacteria in both summer and winter (> 40% of 16S rRNA reads in the 0.02-0.22 mu m pore-size fraction). The metagenome-assembled genomes of CPR bacteria representatives showed capacities to degrade and ferment permafrost- and peatland-derived organic matter. Potential products of their metabolic activities included acetate, CO2, and hydrogen, implying a syntrophic relationship with other community members, including methanogens and methanotrophs. The results indicate biogeochemical interdependencies in organic matter utilization within thermokarst microbial communities, with CPR members playing a key intermediate role in carbon and methane cycling.

J	Palmer, A; Stich, HB; Maier, G				Palmer, A; Stich, HB; Maier, G			Distribution patterns and predation risk of the coexisting cladocerans Bythotrephes longimanus and Leptodora kindtii in a large lake -: Lake Constance	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The distributions of the coexisting, planktonic, predatory cladocerans Bythotrephes longimanus and Leptodora kindtii were studied at four different stations (Langenargen-Arbon, Fischbach-Uttwil, Bregenzer Bucht and Zeller See) of a great lake, Lake Constance. The stations Langenargen-Arbon and Fischbach-Uttwil are deep (> 200 m) with a high density of the coregonid fish Coregonus lavaretus, the stations Bregenzer Bucht and Zeller See are shallow (< 60 m) with lower densities of coregonid fish. B. longimanus was present in the pelagic zone from mid May to November at all stations. L. kindtii generally appeared slightly later in the year than B. longimanus. Peak abundances of B. longimanus with more than 5000 ind. m(-2) (Langenargen-Arbon) appeared in late spring. During summer, when predation pressure by fish is high, abundance of B. longimanus decreased gradually. In contrast, L. kindtii displayed maximum abundances with more than 18 000 ind. m(-2) (Zeller See) in summer. During the summer months, B. longimanus lived in greater depths than L. kindtii. Differences of vertical distribution between both species were most pronounced at the deep stations (Langenargen-Arbon, Fischbach-Uttwil). Analysis of stomachs of the planktivorous fish Coregonus lavaretus showed that B. longimanus was preferred by C. lavaretus over all other prey; Ivlev's selectivity index was 0.97-0.99. Due to this high positive selection for B. longimanus by coregonids, it is surprising that the cladoceran could maintain its existence since the first recordings in 1877. Spatial refuge or indigestible resting eggs may be the underlying mechanism for this phenomenon.																			0018-8158					JAN	2001	442	1-3					301	307		10.1023/A:1017530305884	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017530305884													WOS:000167924900029

In total 8 lysimeters were used. No clear relationship has been found between total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations, precipitation nor runoff. Percolation of subsoil water into lakes is highly seasonal, occurring primarily in spring and autumn. However, the total contribution of subsoil water into lakes is very limited. The annual estimated flux of TOC past the depth 15 cm. below the forest floor under conifers was up to 650 kg/ha. The total emission of TOC from the transitional humus-rich test site was higher by up to 10 times as compared with the sandy site. Hence, particular soils represent large stores of C, which, due to the local water table is not completely available for the adjacent lake. In the case of seepage lakes the flux of carbon does not reach into the lake directly. However, water exchange within deeper deposits is possible. The fluctuations of TOC concentration in a lake surface-layer are insignificant, which is caused by the long residence time of the lake as well by the small contribution of subsoil water into lake.																					1-85312-723-X				2004							103	110																WOS:000223515100010

Total and methyl mercury transformations and mass loadings within a wastewater treatment plant and the impact of the effluent discharge to an alkaline hypereutrophic lake	WATER RESEARCH												Concerns over the fate and bioaccumulation of mercury (Hg) inputs to Onondaga Lake, a hypereutrophic lake in central New York, prompted an investigation into the concentrations and fluxes of Hg discharge from the Onondaga County Metropolitan Wastewater Treatment Plant (METRO WWTP). Discharge of methyl Hg (MeHg) is of concern because it is the form of Hg that readily bioaccumulates along the aquatic food chain. This study incorporated clean protocols for sampling and Hg analysis to evaluate: seasonal patterns in the concentrations of total Hg (THg) and MeHg in the WWTP unit processes; the production of MeHg within the unit processes of the WWTP; the overall fate of THg and MeHg within the WWTP; and the relative impact of the Hg discharged from the WWTP to Onondaga Lake. Concentrations of THg (range: 80-860 ng/L) and MeHg (0.7-17 ng/L) in raw sewage were highly variable, with higher concentrations observed in the summer months. The dynamics of THg though the WWTP were correlated with total suspended solids (TSS). As a result, the majority of the THg removal (55%) occurred during primary treatment. Overall, about 92% of the THg entering the plant was removed as sludge, with volatilization likely a minor component of the overall Hg budget. The transformation of MeHg through the plant differed from THg in that MeHg was not correlated with TSS, and displayed strong seasonal differences between winter (November to April) and summer (May-October) months. During the summer months, substantial net methylation occurred in the activated sludge secondary treatment, resulting in higher MeHg concentrations in secondary effluent. Net demethylation was the dominant mechanism during tertiary treatment, resulting in removal of substantial MeHg from the secondary effluent. The overall MeHg removal efficiency through the plant was about 70% with more efficient removal during summer months. Sediment trap collections made below the epilimnion of Onondaga Lake indicated average deposition rates of 12 mu g/m(2)-day for THg and 0.33 mu g/m(2)-day for MeHg. These deposition rates are more than an order of magnitude higher than the thermocline area normalized external loads from METRO effluent (0.85 mu g/m(2)-day for THg, 0.05 mu g/m(2)-day for MeHg). Our findings indicate that the impact of the discharge from METRO is relatively small, contributing about 10-15% of Hg to the total gross Hg input to the hypolimnion of the lake.

In Ace Lake, a stratified marine-derived system in the Vestfold Hills of East Antarctica, a Chlorobium species of green sulphur bacteria (GSB) is the dominant phototroph, although its seasonal abundance changes more than 100-fold. Here, we analysed 413 Gb of Antarctic metagenome data including 59 Chlorobium metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from Ace Lake and nearby stratified marine basins to determine how genome variation and population structure across a 7-year period impacted ecosystem function. Results: A single species, Candidatus Chlorobium antarcticum (most similar to Chlorobium phaeovibrioides DSM265) prevails in all three aquatic systems and harbours very little genomic variation (>= 99% average nucleotide identity). A notable feature of variation that did exist related to the genomic capacity to biosynthesize cobalamin. The abundance of phylotypes with this capacity changed seasonally similar to 2-fold, consistent with the population balancing the value of a bolstered photosynthetic capacity in summer against an energetic cost in winter. The very high GSB concentration (> 10(8) cells ml(-1) in Ace Lake) and seasonal cycle of cell lysis likely make Ca. Chlorobium antarcticum a major provider of cobalamin to the food web. Analysis of Ca. Chlorobium antarcticum viruses revealed the species to be infected by generalist (rather than specialist) viruses with a broad host range (e.g., infecting Gammaproteobacteria) that were present in diverse Antarctic lakes. The marked seasonal decrease in Ca. Chlorobium antarcticum abundance may restrict specialist viruses from establishing effective lifecycles, whereas generalist viruses may augment their proliferation using other hosts. Conclusion: The factors shaping Antarctic microbial communities are gradually being defined. In addition to the cold, the annual variation in sunlight hours dictates which phototrophic species can grow and the extent to which they contribute to ecosystem processes. The Chlorobium population studied was inferred to provide cobalamin, in addition to carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulphur cycling, as critical ecosystem services. The specific Antarctic environmental factors and major ecosystem benefits afforded by this GSB likely explain why such a coherent population structure has developed in this Chlorobium species.

J	Batina, MC; Reese, CA				Batina, Matthew C.; Reese, Carl A.			A Holocene pollen record recovered from a guano deposit: Round Spring Cavern, Missouri, USA	BOREAS												Bat guano deposits have been the subject of relatively few palynological studies. The studies to date have focused on the most modern samples only, and therefore the full potential of bat guano as an archive for fossil pollen analysis remains unknown. In this paper we report the results of pollen analysis on an 88-cm vertical profile of fossil bat guano from Round Spring Cavern, Missouri. Four AMS radiocarbon dates were in sequence and showed that the guano pile was active between 8155 and approximately 550 cal. yr BP. Pollen is well preserved throughout the profile, with most samples containing less than 10% indeterminable pollen. Wind-pollinated taxa are better represented than insect-pollinated taxa, and pollen concentrations range from 842 to 371 660 grains cm-3. As expected, the dominant vegetation types represented by the pollen assemblage are oak and pine, in accordance with the region's oak-hickory-pine forest. However, there are discrepancies between the guano pollen record and the results of a lake pollen study conducted in southern Missouri. We propose several possible factors that may be influencing the guano pollen record and provide direction for further investigation into the palaeoecological potential of bat guano.																			0300-9483						2011	40	2					332	341		10.1111/j.1502-3885.2010.00186.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1502-3885.2010.00186.x													WOS:000288759400009

First lacustrine varve chronologies from Mexico: impact of droughts, ENSO and human activity since AD 1840 as recorded in maar sediments from Valle de Santiago	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We present varve chronologies for sediments from two maar lakes in the Valle de Santiago region (Central Mexico): Hoya La Alberca (AD 1852-1973) and Hoya Rincn de Parangueo (AD 1839-1943). These are the first varve chronologies for Mexican lakes. The varved sections were anchored with tephras from Colima (1913) and Paricutin (1943/1944) and Pb-210 ages. We compare the sequences using the thickness of seasonal laminae and element counts (Al, Si, S, Cl, K, Ti, Mn, Fe, and Sr) determined by micro X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. The formation of the varve sublaminae is attributed to the strongly seasonal climate regime. Limited rainfall and high evaporation rates in winter and spring induce precipitation of carbonates (high Ca, Sr) enriched in C-13 and O-18, whereas rainfall in summer increases organic and clastic input (plagioclase, quartz) with high counts of lithogenic elements (K, Al, Ti, and Si). Eolian input of Ti occurs also in the dry season. Moving correlations (5-yr windows) of the Ca and Ti counts show similar development in both sequences until the 1930s. Positive correlations indicate mixing of allochthonous Ti and autochthonous Ca, while negative correlations indicate their separation in sublaminae. Negative excursions in the correlations correspond with historic and reconstructed droughts, El Nio events, and positive SST anomalies. Based on our data, droughts (3-7 year duration) were severe and centred around the following years: the early 1850s, 1865, 1880, 1895, 1905, 1915 and the late 1920s with continuation into the 1930s. The latter dry period brought both lake systems into a critical state making them susceptible to further drying. Groundwater overexploitation due to the expansion of irrigation agriculture in the region after 1940 induced the transition from calcite to aragonite precipitation in Alberca and halite infiltration in Rincn. The proxy data indicate a faster response to increased evaporation for Rincn, the lake with the larger maar dimensions, solar radiation receipt and higher conductivity, whereas the smaller, steeper Alberca maar responded rapidly to increased precipitation.

J	Biro, PA; Post, JR; Abrahams, MV				Biro, PA; Post, JR; Abrahams, MV			Ontogeny of energy allocation reveals selective pressure promoting risk-taking behaviour in young fish cohorts	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Given limited food, prey fishes in a temperate climate must take risks to acquire sufficient reserves for winter and/or to outgrow vulnerability to predation. However, how can we distinguish which selective pressure promotes risk-taking when larger body size is always beneficial? To address this question, we examined patterns of energy allocation in populations of age-0 trout to determine if greater risk-taking corresponds with energy allocation to lipids or to somatic growth. Trout achieved maximum growth rates in all lakes and allocated nearly all of their acquired energy to somatic growth when small in early summer. However, trout in low-food lakes took greater risks to achieve this maximal growth, and therefore incurred high mortality. By late summer, age-0 trout allocated considerable energy to lipids and used previously risky habitats in all lakes. These results indicate that: (i) the size-dependent risk of predation (which is independent of behaviour) promotes risk-taking behaviour of age-0 trout to increase growth and minimize time spent in vulnerable sizes; and (ii) the physiology of energy allocation and behaviour interact to mediate growth/mortality trade-offs for young animals at risk of predation and starvation.

Effects of changes in nutrient loading and composition on hypoxia dynamics and internal nutrient cycling of a stratified coastal lagoon	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The effects of changes in catchment nutrient loading and composition on the phytoplankton dynamics, development of hypoxia and internal nutrient dynamics in a stratified coastal lagoon system (the Gippsland Lakes) were investigated using a 3-D coupled hydrodynamic biogeochemical water quality model. The study showed that primary production was equally sensitive to changed dissolved inorganic and particulate organic nitrogen loads, highlighting the need for a better understanding of particulate organic matter bioavailability. Stratification and sediment carbon enrichment were the main drivers for the hypoxia and subsequent sediment phosphorus release in Lake King. High primary production stimulated by large nitrogen loading brought on by a winter flood contributed almost all the sediment carbon deposition (as opposed to catchment loads), which was ultimately responsible for summer bottom-water hypoxia. Interestingly, internal recycling of phosphorus was more sensitive to changed nitrogen loads than total phosphorus loads, highlighting the potential importance of nitrogen loads exerting a control over systems that become phosphorus limited (such as during summer nitrogen-fixing blooms of cyanobacteria). Therefore, the current study highlighted the need to reduce both total nitrogen and total phosphorus for water quality improvement in estuarine systems.

EXTENDED MOLTING AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF CLIMATE WARMING IS THE MAIN REASON FOR THE EMERGENCE OF THE BAIKAL SEAL (PUSA SIBIRICA, PINNIPEDIA) TO COASTAL ROOKERIES	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												An analysis of the video films taken at a Baikal seal rookery in 2011-2021 on the Long Island, Ushkany Islands, northern Lake Baikal, showed that the total number and time of the emergence of animals on the shore were determined by the time of the disappearance of ice in the northern part of the lake. Yet, regardless of the ice regime, a significant part of the animals (up to 80%) leaving land continued molting. At the same time, the nature of molting (its topology) was disturbed in the vast majority of cases, molting being diffuse in character, often with elements of pathological manifestations. The number of molting individuals (in %) decreased by autumn, but still remained large, even though such dynamics were observed not every year. Incomplete molting did not interfere with animals' fattening, as most seals were well or very well fed (especially by autumn), with individuals leaving the rookery immediately after the disappearance of ice also being well fat. At the same time, animals in coastal haulouts showed pathologies of the skin and hairline annually, the occurrence of which was probably associated, among other things, with abnormal molting. A large number of animals seem to leave for wintering with an incomplete molt, with their further fate being unknown. The data obtained indicate that disturbing the dormancy of molting seals on rookeries is inadmissible, since the excessive factor of disturbance (observed at the rookery at the present time) can play significant negative roles through affecting the physical condition (health) of animals.

Predictors of visitors' climate-related coping behaviors in a nature-based tourism destination	JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Climate change affects the supply of nature-based tourism opportunities as well as the demand visitors place on those opportunities. Climate-induced changes in visitor demand, specifically climate-related coping behaviors (e.g., seeking safer recreation sites, changing trip timing, using weather forecasts to plan trips), are influenced by multiple factors such as season of visit, specific visitor attributes, and general climate change beliefs and concern. Understanding the relationships between visitor characteristics and coping behaviors within the context of a changing climate will help recreation managers and tourism providers anticipate shifts in demand and adapt strategically. In this study, we present results from a series of binary logistic regression models of summer and winter visitor survey data to examine climate-related coping behaviors within a regional nature-based tourism area (the North Shore region of Lake Superior in Minnesota). Findings reveal that winter recreationists, younger visitors, and visitors who are concerned about climate change, are most inclined to use behavioral coping in response to changing climate and environmental conditions. Specifically, we found that winter season recreationists are much more likely to report having experienced a past climate-related impact, and that weather information, alternative gear, and flexibility in timing their trips are important in overcoming these constraints. Further, younger visitors were more likely to use informational (weather forecast) coping, site substitution, and activity substitution to respond to climate-related impacts. This study expands upon climate-related recreation and tourism research by documenting how recreationists' informational, spatial, and temporal coping behaviors vary across visitor characteristics. Further research is needed to determine if the behavioral coping preferences and patterns found in this study emerge across diverse contexts. However, our findings here can help managers begin to strategically plan and collaborate to maintain destination-level attractiveness to visitors despite changing environmental conditions. Management implications: Understanding how visitors respond to environmental changes is important in sustaining 'weather-resistant' visitor flows. In anticipation of on-site disruptions and future demand shifts, regional partnerships within nature-based destinations may mitigate reductions in visitor demand and accommodate shifting patterns in visitor flows. For example, recreation managers and tourism providers could identify and jointly market alternative recreation opportunities when conditions are not conducive to participating in desired activities, as well as develop a networked approach for communicating weather and site safety information.					; Smith, Jordan/AAR-9126-2021; Larson, Lincoln/AEM-4354-2022	Seekamp, Erin/0000-0001-5082-1921; McCreary, Allie/0000-0003-2332-3999; Larson, Lincoln/0000-0001-9591-1269; Davenport, Mae/0000-0002-8242-5074													2213-0780	2213-0799				JUN	2019	26						23	33		10.1016/j.jort.2019.03.005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jort.2019.03.005													WOS:000468797300003

In 2001, 2004 and 2007 high volume high-Cl lake may be related to reactivation of high discharge (>10 kg/s) saline near-neutral water from the Soap Pool boiling springs into the lake, a few months (similar to January) after the end of the rainy season (June-October). The peak lake volume occurred in March 2007 (similar to 6 x 10(5) m(3)). Agua Tibia 2 thermal springs discharge near the foot of the SW dome but their chemistry suggests a lower temperature regime, an enhanced water-rock interaction and basement contribution (evaporites and carbonates), anhydrite leaching from the 1982 pyroclastic deposits, rather than dome activity. New suggestions of crater lake seepage are evidenced by the Agua Caliente thermal springs. Existing models on the "crater lake-Soap Pool spring" and the deep hydrothermal system are discussed. Chemical changes in the deep geothermal aquifer feeding the thermal springs may predict dome rise. Future volcanic surveillance should focus on spring chemistry variations, as well as crater lake monitoring.					; Rouwet, Dmitri/ABC-5920-2020; Mora, Ricardo/AAJ-3741-2021; Cassidy, Michael/HKV-2534-2023; Bellomo, Sergio/AAC-5798-2020; Jutzeler, Martin/D-2090-2012	Bernard-Romero, Ruben/0000-0001-5387-2214; Mazot, Agnes/0000-0002-4419-5618; Cassidy, Michael/0000-0002-0658-2641; Brusca, Lorenzo/0000-0002-6570-9673; Bellomo, Sergio/0000-0002-8226-8312; Inguaggiato, Salvatore/0000-0003-3726-9946; Jutzeler, Martin/0000-0002-3720-6315													0016-7169					JAN-MAR	2009	48	1					55	72																WOS:000263907200005
J	Salusso, MM; Moraña, LB				Monica Salusso, Maria; Beatriz Morana, Liliana			Structure and composition of phytoplankton from Mina Pirquitas, Jujuy, Argentina	REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD												Mining activities produce extreme environmental conditions in aquatic systems because they tend to contain unusually high concentrations of heavy metals as their solubility increases markedly while pH decreases. In the Andean region of Jujuy province at 4,200 m asl, the exorheic system of Orosmayo River (Ajedrez) is affected by the extraction of silver in Mina Pirquitas. The structure and composition of phytoplankton in 5 tributaries was evaluated by sampling in Autumn and Spring for the 2011-2013 period, using standard techniques. Phytoplankton abundance was higher in the rainy season, especially in March, 2011 in all sites, with a maximum of 828 ind.ml(-1) in Ajedrez River. The physicochemical data revealed acidic conditions in the River Pircas (pH between 2.6 and 3.9) with high concentrations of Al3+, and Fe3+. This site showed lower density values (176 ind.ml(-1)), diversity (2.67) and species richness (average 11). Diatoms were affected by the pH in the River Pircas, because their percentage of representation was low (18.48%), with a predominance of green algae (52%), mainly represented by phytoflagellates (Chlamydomonas, Dunaliella) and filaments (Klebsormidium, Spirogyra, Zygogonium, Ulothrix), among others.

We present a robust, portable device that measures detailed temperature-depth profiles of the near-surface sediments in less than 1 h. Test campaigns in the Canadian Arctic and on Svalbard have demonstrated its utility in a range of environments during winter and summer.

J	Borowiak, M; Borowiak, D; Nowinski, K				Borowiak, Magdalena; Borowiak, Dariusz; Nowinski, Kamil			Spatial Differentiation and Multiannual Dynamics of Water Conductivity in Lakes of the Suwaki Landscape Park	WATER												Water conductivity in 23 lakes of the Suwaki Landscape Park (SLP) was tested in the years 2012-2014. Conductivity profiles were made at the deepest place every two months between spring and autumn water mixing. The collected measurement data, supplemented with historical data, were used to identify factors that shape the spatial variability of water conductivity and to reconstruct its multiannual changes. The range of variability of the mean conductivity of surface water of the SLP lakes ranged from 178 to 522 mu S cm(-1). The strong negative relationship between conductivity and lake elevation (R = 0.816, p < 0.000) suggests that in the territorially compact complex of the SLP lakes, conductivity is a consequence of the location of the lake in the catchment, which, in turn, affects the structure of its water supply. However, the physical and environmental parameters of the catchment and morphometric parameters of lake basins are of secondary importance. In dimictic lakes and in those showing signs of "spring meromixis", the magnitude of conductivity differences in the water column is determined by the lakes' susceptibility to wind mixing expressed by the exposure index value. The developed climate models have also shown that conductivity, an indicator of water quality, is very sensitive to climate change. The analysis of the reconstructed chronological conductivity sequences shows that the deterioration of the quality of the waters of the SLP lakes first occurred at the beginning of the 21st century and a clear increasing trend has been maintained over the last decade.					; Nowinski, Kamil/HPC-1462-2023; Nowiński, Kamil/HPC-1462-2023	Borowiak, Dariusz/0000-0002-3823-1176; Nowinski, Kamil/0000-0003-1133-6901; Borowiak, Magdalena Agnieszka/0000-0003-1402-8787														2073-4441				MAY	2020	12	5							1277	10.3390/w12051277	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12051277													WOS:000555915200056

Isotopic signatures from 1976 to 2015 were strongly linked to antecedent winter minimum temperatures (T-min), Lake Superior peak ice cover, and regional to continental-scale atmospheric winter pressure variability including the North American Dipole. The immense thermal inertia of Lake Superior underlies the unique connection between winter conditions and tree-ring Delta C-13 and delta O-18 signals from the following growing season in trees located near the lake. By combining these signals, we demonstrate feasibility to reconstruct variability in T-min, ice cover, and continental-scale atmospheric circulation patterns (r> 0.65, P <0.001).

A total of 157 897 individuals of 23 species (bleak Alburnus alburnus not included) were captured in the fish ladder. The dominant species captured, in order of abundance, were bleak (not counted), roach Rutilus rutilus (87.7%), silver bream Abramis bjoerkna (4.3%) and European chub Leuciscus cephalus (2.0%). Non-rheophilic species accounted for around 93.4% of the total. Most seasonal movements of cyprinid fishes are observed in spring and are reproductive migrations. Roach, Eurasian dace Leuciscus leuciscus, silver bream, nase Chondrostoma nasus, and European chub of indeterminate sex begin migrating in mid-March and continue as long as the water temperature is between 10 and 15 degrees C. Movements of mature European chub, bream Abr amis brama, and barbel Barbus barbus begin in mid-May, when water temperature reaches 13-15 degrees C. Salmonids migrate in May-June and autumn. While sea sonal periodicity of migration is clearly associated with water temperature, circadian variations are dependent on luminosity.																					0-85238-253-7				1998							69	84																WOS:000089018500006

No seasonal pattern in prevalence, intensity, and abundance of parasites in trout and sculpin was determined. However a seasonal pattern in the length and percent gravid E. salvelini in brook trout suggests that recruitment of this parasite occurs during late summer and early fall. During this time the procercoid in the copepod intermediate host is expected to be available in the environment for fish to recruit, but a total of 6,399 copepods was not infected. Gravid worms were not found in slimy sculpin, suggesting it is a paratenic or dead-end host. Detailed studies on the biology of parasites may be more indicative of seasonal transmission patterns than studies that only measure prevalence, abundance, and intensity.					; Hernandez, Alexander/E-8705-2010	Hernandez, Alexander/0000-0001-8708-3774; 													0022-3395	1937-2345				DEC	1998	84	6					1119	1123		10.2307/3284659	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3284659								9920300					WOS:000078087700011

Finely-laminated lake sediments, dated at 8.5-6.7 cal kyr B.P., were examined in terms of lithology, geochemistry, microfossils (diatom, pollen) and magnetic susceptibility. Based on the inferred geographical derivation of pollen, the environmental affiliation of diatom taxa and geochemistry of lake sediments, wind trajectories were distinguished, related to two main atmospheric circulation phases. During the earlier phase (8.50-7.83 cal kyr B.P.) there were northwestern wind trajectories followed by southern ones and during the later phase (7.83-6.70 cal kyr B.P.), the northern winds were followed by northwestern and southern ones. Northwestern and northern winds brought winter rainfall and caused water turbulence in the lake, and the southern winds were associated with regional aridification. This scenario of atmospheric circulation in northeastern Africa extends significantly our understanding of key modes of climatic variability and wind trajectories in the Early to Middle Holocene (Greenlandian to Northgrippian) transition.					; Marks, Leszek/F-2981-2013; Qianli, Sun/GYU-4636-2022; Chen, Zhong Yuan/JRW-5575-2023; Majecka, Aleksandra/AAC-7974-2020; Marks, Leszek/ABF-3641-2020; Zalat, Abdelfattah/AIB-3384-2022; Salem, Alaa/NTR-3220-2025	Salem, Alaa/0000-0003-3185-5194; Marks, Leszek/0000-0002-4507-1828; Welc, Fabian/0000-0001-6122-1884; Szymanek, Marcin/0000-0002-6033-8025; Nitychoruk, Jerzy/0000-0002-8469-346X; Majecka, Aleksandra/0000-0002-3911-3155; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				AUG 15	2019	528						120	132		10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.04.032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.04.032													WOS:000472123900009

Flooding in the Nechako River Basin of Canada: A random forest modeling approach to flood analysis in a regulated reservoir system	CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL												Flooding events can have significant impacts, in terms of both loss of life and property damage. Analyzing floods to understand their processes and patterns improves our ability to predict when floods will occur. Under changing climate conditions, this will become even more important. The utility of an alternative approach to conventional flood analysis was investigated in a regulated river system with a reservoir, the Nechako River Basin located in British Columbia, Canada. Using the 1955-2008 daily discharge measured on the Nechako River discharge and its major tributaries, a random forest model was constructed to evaluate the relative importance of contributing discharges to the main stem during significant flood events in the downstream community of Prince George. Discharges from the unregulated Stellako and Nautley Rivers were found to be the most important variables during a spring flood. Conversely, during a winter flood, the regulated Skins Lake Spillway and the Kemano Powerhouse discharges were found to be the most important variables in the model. During periods of no flood, the main stem Nechako River at Isle Pierre discharge was the most important. This work provides a novel source of evidence that flow regulation on the Nechako River is an important indicator of downstream winter flood conditions in Prince George, potentially exacerbating ice jams and/or causing significant property damage and economic losses.

The leaves of many floating macrophytes have characteristics of both terrestrial plants and submerged macrophytes, because, in general, their upper and lower surfaces are exposed to air and water, respectively. However, little is known about the biofilms attached to floating plants. We investigated biofilms attached to the leaves, stems and roots of the floating plants Nymphoides peltata (in summer and winter) and Trapa natans (in summer) in the Gonghu Bay of Lake Taihu. Bacteria and algae were major components of the biofilm on the leaves of the two species of plants. In addition, 454 pyrosequencing analysis of bacterial 16S rRNA genes revealed that Proteobacteria was the dominant phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. Cluster analysis showed that bacterial communities from the same plant source were clustered into the same group. A total of 677 genera were detected, and 47 genera were shared by all samples. Nitrifiers, including Nitrosomonas, Nitrosococcus and Nitrospira were detected in this study. Seven denitrifying genes (napA, napG, nirS, nirK, cnorB, qnorB and nosZ) were used to detect the abundance of denitrifiers. Genes nirK, nirS cnorB and nosZ were the four most abundant genes in all samples. Our results demonstrated that cultivation of floating plants in water column could enlarge the area for biofilm growth, and biofilms might play an important role in denitrification in eutrophic water.					zhang, shijie/HGF-0836-2022; Wang, Chao/GXF-8353-2022; wang, pei/MTG-1182-2025														1932-6203					NOV 13	2018	13	11							e0207443	10.1371/journal.pone.0207443	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207443								30422988					WOS:000450070100007

In situ incubations were performed in eight acrylic tubes lowered underneath the ice cover for 1-4 months. In the lake, production of phytoplankton (0.03-0.33 mu g C l(-1) day(-1)) was lower than that of bacteria (0.2-2.3 mu g C l(-1) day(-1)) from the end of January to mid-April. Later in spring, the light conditions improved due to the disappearance of snow and finally ice itself, and primary production was revived. The importance of light as the factor controlling primary production in winter was confirmed in laboratory experiments where additions of phosphorus and DOM did not enhance the primary production. These same enrichments resulted in higher growth rates and production of bacteria. However, bacterioplankton was simultaneously controlled by heterotrophic flagellates, as in the laboratory experiments the exclusion of flagellates always resulted in higher yields of bacteria of increased cell size. There was also some evidence that. the quality of substrates is of importance for microbial activities. The importance of temperature was highlighted with the significant correlation (r(2) = 0.59) between bacterial production and temperature within the range 0.6-2.1 degrees C. Thus, on the boreal zone the possible warming of climate may lead to enhanced microbial activities in winter, but under unchanged light conditions no effects on primary production will be expected.

J	Forbes, AC; Lamoureux, SF				Forbes, AC; Lamoureux, SF			Climatic controls on streamflow and suspended sediment transport in three large middle arctic catchments, Boothia Peninsula, Nunavut, Canada	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Streamflow, suspended sediment transport. and meteorological variables were measured during two field seasons in order to determine the climatic controls on daily discharge and suspended sediment load for three large middle arctic catchments, Substantive suspended sediment transfer only occurred during the short-lived nival peak. and the duration of the peak appears to be broadly scaled with interannual catchment snow water equivalence (SWE). Thermal energy was critical in generating streamflow and suspended sediment transfer, but only until watershed snowpack had been exhausted. Thus, total annual suspended sediment load in this environment is ultimately a function of total discharge through SWE rather than melt energy. Specific sediment yields were some of the lowest recorded in the arctic, ranging between 0.2 and 1.9 t km (2.)a (1). This study demonstrates the sensitivity middle arctic watersheds to both winter snowpack and spring thermal conditions and provides a basis for understanding the hydrological impact of future climate changes.																			1523-0430	1938-4246				AUG	2005	37	3					304	315		10.1657/1523-0430(2005)037[0304:CCOSAS]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1657/1523-0430(2005)037[0304:CCOSAS]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000231886800005

(2007a) proposed its eolian source from the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) and applied it as a proxy for Asian winter monsoon. We performed a comprehensive study on Ti-carrying minerals and Ti fluxes in lake sediments, wall rocks, and loess from the CLP. Here we show that the chemical compositions and morphological features of magnetite, the most important Ti carrier in HGY surface sediments, are identical to those in wall rocks around the lake, but substantially different from those in CLP loess samples. Our calculated modern eolian Ti flux from the CLP is negligible compared to the average total Ti flux to HGY, and Ti flux from catchment erosion can provide enough Ti, indicating Ti in HGY sediment are predominantly from wall rock erosion. Inverse correlation between total organic carbon (TOC) (vegetation density) and Ti/Ca ratio (terrestrial input) in the Holocene suggests monsoon-induced vegetation density predominates over runoff in controlling Ti input to HGY. S-ratio represents TOC directly mediated reductive diagenesis of iron oxides (magnetite preservation), rather than anoxic/oxic condition at the bottom water induced by winter monsoon. Our record shows a decreased vegetation density, increased Ti input and weakened reductive diagenesis through the Holocene driven by a weakened summer monsoon.					; wu, xudong/KGL-1857-2024	Shen, Ji/0000-0001-9143-5648; Dong, Hailiang/0000-0002-7468-1350; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				NOV 16	2013	40	21					5757	5763		10.1002/grl.50740	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/grl.50740													WOS:000327810800035

Here, newly identified PFAS were investigated in wild sporting fish from boreal freshwater ecosystems (back-ground sites, 2013-2014 summer seasons), compared to fish impacted by a major AFFF release (summer 2013 and autumn 2014). Different freshwater wild sporting fish species (Esox lucius, Esox masquinongy, Micropterus dolomieu, Sander vitreus, Perca flavescens, and Semotilus corporalis, n = 74) were collected from 13 ecosystems (lakes, reservoirs, and rivers) across Eastern Canada. Of 29 quantitative PFAS, 15 compounds were detected in fish from background sites, including perfluorocarboxylates (C-6,C-8-14), perfluoroalkane sulfonates (C-6,C-8,C-10), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA), 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTSA), 7:3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (7:3 FTCA), and a zwitterionic PFAS-perfluorooctane sulfonamidoalkyl betaine (PFOSB). To our knowledge, this is the first report of PFOSB in biota. It is also one of the first reports of anionic fluorotelomers (6:2 FTSA, 7:3 FTCA, 9:3 FTCA) in wildlife from background sites. Long-chain fluorotelomer sulfonamidoalkyl betaines (e.g., 8:2 and 10:2 FTAB), fluorotelomer betaines (e.g., 9:3 and 9:1:2 FTB), and fluorotelomer sulfone propanoic acids (e.g., 8:2 FT(SO2)-PA, 10:2 FT(SO2)-PA)) were solely prevalent (up to 97% of summed suspect PFAS) in Smallmouth Bass (M. dolomieu) from the AFFF-impacted site. Perfluorobutane sulfonamide (FBSA), perfluorohexane sulfonamide (FHxSA), 6:2 FTSA and 7:3 FTCA were detected in at least one Smallmouth Bass sample both at the AFFF-impacted and background sites. According to the estimated chronic daily intake and current tolerable daily intake suggested by national agencies, the observed PFOS levels would not pose a health risk to anglers who might consume these wild-caught fish.

J	Krivtsov, V; Sigee, D; Bellinger, E				Krivtsov, V; Sigee, D; Bellinger, E			Elemental concentrations and correlations in winter micropopulations of Stephanodiscus rotula: an autecological study over a period of cell size reduction and restoration	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The population of Stephanodiscus rotula in a temperate eutrophic lake was studied over a 2 month period (January to early March). Although during the study period nutrient concentrations in the lake water remained far in excess of phytoplankton requirements, no notable increase in chlorophyll levels was recorded. This suggests that algae were limited by shortage of light and low temperatures. Frequency distribution analysis of cell diameters showed a dramatic size reduction at the end of winter, followed by restoration of higher values by early spring. Electron probe X-ray microanalysis spectra from Stephanodiscus cells routinely showed peaks of Ca, K, Si, P, S, Fe. Al, Mn, Mg, Na and Cl, with substantial variation in elemental concentrations both between and within samples. End-of-winter reduction in the cell size coincided with a considerable depletion of intracellular chemical levels of Si, P, Cl and K and could be related to the concurrent decrease in dissolved organic C and increase in intracellular Al. Correlation and factor analysis of intracellular elemental concentrations showed that statistical elemental associations within Stephanodiscus cells were mainly determined by three factors, with P, Cl, Si and K showing higher loadings on the first, Ca, Mn and S on the second, and Fe, Ca and Al on the third factor. Significant correlations among the elements of the first association may indicate the importance of P (ATP), K (through involvement in P metabolism) and Cl (possibly charge balance) in the active Si uptake during the study period.

The regulation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) has been argued to be a cause of the depletion of the lake by previous studies. However, over the past few decades, the lake's surface water dynamic has remained poorly characterized, especially before the regulation of the TGD (2003). By calculating the inundation frequency with an index- and pixel-based water detection algorithm on Google Earth Engine (GEE), this study explored the spatial-temporal variation of the lake during 1988-2016 and compared the differences in Poyang Lake's water body between the pre- and post-TGD periods. The year-long water body area of the lake has shown a significant decreasing trend over the past 29 years and has shifted to a smaller regime since 2006. The inundation frequency of the lake has also generally decreased since 2003, particularly at the central part of the lake, and the effects of this trend have been most severe in the spring and autumn seasons. The lake's area has shown significant correlation with the precipitation of the Poyang Lake Basin on an inner-annual scale. The drivers of and relevant factors relating to the inter-annual variation of the lake's surface water should be further investigated in the future.					; Zhao, Bin/I-3651-2013; Wang, Xinxin/ABD-5736-2020; Xiao, Xiangming/ABS-9360-2022	Wang, Xinxin/0000-0001-8013-3660; Zhao, Bin/0000-0002-3530-2469; Wang, Yingbing/0000-0003-1955-9704; Xiao, Xiangming/0000-0003-0956-7428; 														2072-4292				FEB 1	2019	11	3							313	10.3390/rs11030313	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11030313													WOS:000459944400101

This paper reviews the latest development in multidisciplinary TP research associated with this warming. The rapid warming facilitates intense and broad glacier melt over most of the TP, although some glaciers in the northwest are advancing. By heating the atmosphere and reducing snow/ice albedo, aerosols also contribute to the glaciers melting. Glacier melt is accompanied by lake expansion and intensification of the water cycle over the TP. Precipitation has increased over the eastern and northwestern TP. Meanwhile, the TP is greening and most regions are experiencing advancing phenological trends, although over the southwest there is a spring phenological delay mainly in response to the recent decline in spring precipitation. Atmospheric and terrestrial thermal and dynamical processes over the TP affect the Asian monsoon at different scales. Recent evidence indicates substantial roles that mesoscale convective systems play in the TP's precipitation as well as an association between soil moisture anomalies in the TP and the Indian monsoon. Moreover, an increase in geohazard events has been associated with recent environmental changes, some of which have had catastrophic consequences caused by glacial lake outbursts and landslides. Active debris flows are growing in both frequency of occurrences and spatial scale. Meanwhile, new types of disasters, such as the twin ice avalanches in Ali in 2016, are now appearing in the region. Adaptation and mitigation measures should be taken to help societies' preparation for future environmental challenges. Some key issues for future TP studies are also discussed.					liang, shunlin/C-2809-2015; qian, yun/E-1845-2011; Dozier, Jeff/B-7364-2009; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011; Sheng, Yongwei/HNP-7933-2023; lettenmaier, dennis/T-3088-2017; zhang, fan/E-2398-2018; Yang, Kun/G-8390-2011; Su, Z./D-4383-2009; SINGH, VIJAY/ACV-1417-2022; xue, yongkang/M-6756-2018; Zhang, Fan/E-2398-2018; Kang, Shichang/I-6830-2018; Guo, WD/G-4592-2010; Chen, Fei/JZC-6314-2024; Dozier, Jeff/AAL-4783-2021; Chen, Deliang/A-5107-2013; Ma, Yaoming/AAA-3248-2021; Ueno, Kenichi/B-3154-2014; Zhang, Renhe/AAA-6301-2020; Koike, Toshio/AAC-8548-2020; Wang, Weicai/GYA-1422-2022; Shen, Samuel/Q-2588-2018; Lau, William/E-1510-2012; Liu, Yimin/AAZ-7419-2020; Wang, Lei/B-3113-2019	Cui, Peng/0000-0002-3973-5966; Dozier, Jeff/0000-0001-8542-431X; Chen, Fei/0000-0003-2573-3828; Chen, Fahu/0000-0002-8874-1035; zhang, fan/0000-0002-6714-9534; Yang, Kun/0000-0002-0809-2371; xue, yongkang/0000-0002-6169-9631; Kang, Shichang/0000-0003-2115-9005; Wang, Weicai/0000-0003-1352-6303; Zhang, Renhe/0000-0001-7750-8679; Shen, Samuel/0000-0002-4535-4684; Ueno, Kenichi/0000-0002-6612-4984; Su, Zhongbo/0000-0003-2096-1733; 													0003-0007	1520-0477				MAR	2019	100	3					423	444		10.1175/BAMS-D-17-0057.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-17-0057.1													WOS:000468039100006

Fecundity, age and growth, and diet of Fundulus diaphanus (banded killifish) in Presque Isle Bay, Lake Erie	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Fundulus diaphanus (banded killifish) were the most abundant fish collected in the shallow water areas of Presque Isle Bay, making up 86% of fish collected. Peak spawning dates based on gonadosomatic index and ovary observations were July 9, 2003 and July 18, 2004. Females became Sexually mature at age 1. During 2004, the majority of spawning occurred over a 20-day period between July 9 and July 29. Total fecundity increased with both size and age, and the mean total number of eggs produced was 526 +/- 37 at age 1 (67 mm +/- 1.8), 744 +/- 38 at age 2(79 mm +/- 2.4), and 1062 +/- 43 at age 3 (93 mm 4. 1). Based on comparison of the total number of eggs and number of eggs with yolk contained within ovaries, three clutches of eggs may be released during each spawning season. Diets were similar between summer and fall; banded killifish fed almost exclusively on cladocerans and benthic macroinvertebrates.																			1092-6194	1938-5307					2007	14	2					269	278		10.1656/1092-6194(2007)14[269:FAAGAD]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/1092-6194(2007)14[269:FAAGAD]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000247628300008

Based on an observation network of five sampling sections on the trunk stream and four on the tributaries along the Weihe River (the largest tributary of the Yellow River), the interannual and seasonal variations in ammonium nitrogen concentration of river water during 2005-2015 are analyzed. The annual mean concentrations generally increase downstream, and the concentration after 2011 is much lower than that before 2011. Seasonality of ammonium nitrogen concentration is observed along the Weihe River, especially on the trunk stream. The interannual and seasonal patterns of ammonium nitrogen concentration are jointly influenced by the anthropogenic and natural factors. The decreasing concentration is related to the strict policy on water pollution control in the recent years, and the seasonal variation in concentration is influenced by the high flow in summer months and low flow in winter months.

Temperature seasonality control on modern halite layers in the Dead Sea: In situ observations	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Layered halite sequences are found in deep basins throughout the geological record. However, analogs for such sequences are commonly studied in shallow environments. Here, we studied active precipitation of halite layers from the only modern analog for deep, halite-precipitating basins, the hypersaline Dead Sea. In situ observations in the Dead Sea link seasonal thermohaline stratification, halite saturation, and the characteristics of the actively forming halite layers. The spatiotemporal evolution of halite precipitation in the Dead Sea was characterized by means of monthly observations of (1) lake thermohaline stratification (temperature, salinity, and density), (2) degree of halite saturation, and (3) textural evolution of the active halite deposits. We present the observed relationships between the textural characteristics of layered halite deposits (i.e., grain size, consolidation, and roughness) and the degree of saturation, which in turn reflects the limnology and hydroclimatology. The lake floor is divided into two principal environments: a deep, hypolimnetic lake floor and a shallow, epilimnetic lake floor. In the deeper hypolimnetic lake floor, halite continuously precipitates with seasonal variations: (1) During summer, consolidated coarse halite crystals form rough surfaces under slight supersaturation. (2) During winter, unconsolidated, fine halite crystals form smooth lake floor deposits under high supersaturation. These observations support interpretations of the seasonal alternation of halite crystallization mechanisms. The shallow epilimnetic lake floor is highly influenced by the seasonal temperature variations, and by intensive summer dissolution of part of the previous year's halite deposit, which results in thin sequences with annual unconformities. This emphasizes the control of temperature seasonality on the characteristics of the precipitated halite layers. In addition, precipitation of halite on the hypolimnetic floor, at the expense of the dissolution of the epilimnetic floor, results in lateral focusing and thickening of halite deposits in the deeper part of the basin and thinning of the deposits in shallow marginal basins.

The weed has subsequently expanded its range significantly within the upper and middle lake but, as of 2010, has not been recorded in the large lower lake. In Lough Corrib the temporal growth pattern exhibited by L. major is at variance with that displayed in its country of origin. In southern Africa the plant grows most vigorously in summer, whereas in Corrib it achieves its best vegetative expression during the colder and darker winter months. This temporal growth pattern significantly influences practical weed control programmes, as it has proved to be far more efficient to cut and harvest L. major stands when the stems are erect and buoyant, even if it does mean that cutting operations must be conducted during the more inclement winter months. A combination of traditional and innovative weed control methods are used to control L. major in the lake. These include manual removal using scuba divers, mechanical cutting and harvesting, chemical control and light exclusion using a natural jute matting material. In 2008 L. major occupied c. 92ha of lake bed, while some 8,500ha is deemed to be suitable for its establishment and growth. Control work to date has reduced the area of lake occupied by this aggressive weed to c. 35.9ha.

Factors affecting bottom trawl catches: Implications for monitoring the fishes of Lake Superior	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												An annual daytime bottom trawl survey of the Lake Superior fish community designed in 1978 does not adequately assess the entire community. Whereas recent studies have recommended that pelagic species be surveyed with a combination of acoustic and midwater trawling methods (AC-MT), we used bottom trawling to study the effects of depth, diel period, and season on biomass estimates and the sizes of bottom-oriented species. Day and night bottom trawl samples were collected within 48 h at three depths (30, 60, and 120 in) at a Lake Superior site during eight sampling periods that included two seasons each year (early summer and late summer to early fall) for 2 years (2004 and 2005). Depth significantly affected the biomass of seven of the eight species analyzed, while diel period affected the biomass of six species. For most species, average biomass levels were higher at night. The effect of season on biomass was comparatively low (three species were significantly affected). Depth significantly affected the sizes of six bottom-oriented species, as the average length of most species increased with depth. The effects of diel period (three species) and season (one species) on average length were comparatively small. By adding night bottom trawl samples to night AC-MT collections, the entire fish community of Lake Superior can be monitored with a single lakewide survey employing multiple gears. The establishment of offshore sampling (i.e., where depths exceed 80 in) will provide estimates of deepwater species that have been largely undersampled by the 1978-designed survey.

Fish density declined in the early 1990s with sharp declines in abundance of spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius), trout-perch (Percopsis omiscomaycus), and johnny darter (Etheostoma nigrum) occurring in 1993 to 1995. Rising numbers of piscivores, walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) and double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus), increased predation pressure, presumably acting in concert with oligotrophication to lower fish density, particularly after 1991 when large numbers of adult alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) no longer migrated to the northeast basin in spring. Annual mortality, of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) from age 2 to 5 rose from 33% in 1980-83 to 65% in 1992-95 and was positively related to piscivore numbers (P = 0.01, r = 0.96, n = 5). Annual mortality of yellow perch from age 0 to 2 also peaked in 1992-95. Abundance of yellow perch YOY in fall varied 40 fold and was not related to water warming in spring (P = 0.45, r = -0.19, n = 18) but was negatively related to the abundance of adult alewives in spring (P = 0.04, r = -0.49, n = 18). Although yellow perch produced moderate to strong year classes each year during 1991-95, stock size failed to increase because of rapidly accelerating mortality. Fully 85% of the variation in mean length of yellow perch YOY was explained by a multiple regression model which included YOY abundance, mean total phosphorus, and cumulative degree days > 13.5 degreesC (P < 0.01, n = 15). Abundance of white perch (Morone americana) YOY varied nearly 200 fold and was not related to water warming or spring alewife abundance (P > 0.15). Variation in mean length of white perch YOY was related to cumulative degree days > 15 degreesC (P < 0.01, r = 0.69).																			0380-1330						2001	27	3					367	383		10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70652-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(01)70652-1													WOS:000171416600012

The aim of the present study was to establish the structure of psammic rotifer communities including their diversity and quantitative parameters. A total of 41 rotifer taxa were found in hydro-, hygro-, and euarenal zones of eutrophic Lake Vrtsjarv and mesotrophic Lake Saadjarv during the study carried out in Estonia in 2008, including 11 rotifer species new to Estonia. In L. Vrtsjarv, the predominant rotifer taxa were Bdelloidea and Lecane psammophila. L. psammophila dominated in July and August and bdelloids prevailed in the rest of the year. In L. Saadjarv, the most abundant taxa were Lepadella ovalis, Keratella hiemalis, and Cephalodella megalocephala. The psammic rotifer community of L. Saadjarv proved to be more diverse than that of L. Vrtsjarv. Microphagous rotifers were dominant in L. Vrtsjarv. Raptorial feeders dominated in L. Saadjarv in summer and autumn and were more abundant at sites with coarser sand and low plant density.

Here, we investigated the response of phytoplankton and zooplankton to a large-scale 2015-built aquatic macrophyte enclosure (AME, 200,000 m2) screened of by a PVC net in Baima Lake, a eutrophic lake, from spring to autumn of 2019. AME significantly improved water quality by increasing water transparency, and reducing total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chlorophyll-a content during the growing season. AME significantly decreased phytoplankton abundance and biomass and marginally increased zooplankton abundance and biomass. Phytoplankton and zooplankton communities were closely related to environmental factors, such as water temperature, conductivity, total phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand, and chlorophyll-a inside and outside the AME. The zooplankton:phytoplankton biomass ratio inside was slightly higher than outside the AME. Zooplankton and phytoplankton biomass were significantly positively correlated inside and outside the AME, as were chlorophyll-a and total phosphorus. We found phosphorus to be a key factor limiting primary productivity in Baima Lake, and that bottom-up effects were the main driver to control phytoplankton in the AME. Using aquatic macrophytes to reduce nutrient loads is an effective way to manage eutrophication in Baima Lake.					zhang, chen/JES-0371-2023	Tian, Xingjun/0000-0002-0251-2582; Cai, Sulin/0000-0003-3205-9640													0075-9511	1873-5851				SEP	2021	90								125907	10.1016/j.limno.2021.125907	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.limno.2021.125907		AUG 2021											WOS:000691479600007

Phosphorus retention and transformation in a dammed reservoir of the Thames River, Ontario: Impacts on phosphorus load and speciation	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Extensive efforts are underway to reduce phosphorus (P) export from the Lake Erie watershed. On the Canadian side, the Thames River is the largest tributary source of P to Lake Erie's western basin. However, the role of dams in retaining and modifying riverine P loading to the lake has not been comprehensively evaluated. We assessed whether Fanshawe Reservoir, the largest dam reservoir on the Thames River, acts as a source or sink of P, using year-round discharge and water chemistry data collected in 2018 and 2019. We also determined how in-reservoir processes alter P speciation by comparing the dissolved reactive P to total P ratio (DRP:TP) in upstream and downstream loads. Annually, Fanshawe Reservoir was a net sink for P, retaining 25% (36 tonnes) and 47% (91 tonnes) of TP in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Seasonally, the reservoir oscillated between a source and sink of P. Net P release occurred during the spring of 2018 and the summers of 2018 and 2019, driven by internal P loading and hypolimnetic discharge from the dam. The reservoir did not exert a strong influence on DRP:TP annually, but ratio increases occurred during both summers, concurrent with water column stratification. Our analysis demonstrates that Fanshawe Reservoir is not only an important P sink on the Thames River, but also modulates the timing and speciation of P loads. We therefore propose that the potential of using existing dam reservoirs to attenuate downstream P loads should be more thoroughly explored alongside source based P mitigation strategies.

J	Hutorowicz, A; Pasztaleniec, A				Hutorowicz, Andrzej; Pasztaleniec, Agnieszka			Uncertainty in phytoplankton-based lake ecological status classification: Implications of sampling frequency and metric simplification	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												We examined the influence of sampling frequency and the elimination of selected metrics from the Phytoplankton Multimetric for Polish Lakes (PMPL index) on lake ecological status classification. The effect of sampling frequency was analysed by calculating the official PMPL index using data from four sampling periods (848 lake-years; 478 Polish lakes), and compared the Pmpl-based classification to that assessed from PMPL variants calculated using one, two and three sampling periods. The effect of metric elimination was analysed by comparing the official three-metric PMPL classification with two variants, a one-metric PMPL including only the concentration of chlorophyll-a and a two-metric variant including total phytoplankton biomass and summer cyanobacterial biomass. Correlation strength between the official PMPL and simplified variants weakened by reducing sampling frequency but varied by period combinations. Uncertainty of ecological status classification increased in both simplification types but it was greatest when using the one-metric (chlorophyll-a based) variant. Sampling reduction from four to three periods resulted in 0.5-6.5% of lakes being over- or underclassified (total lake-year misclassification: 3.7-6.7%). Highest uncertainty of classification to at least good status occurred when the spring sampling period was excluded (6.5%). The risk of misclassification increased to 4.2-14.9% when two sampling periods were used. When classification was based only on a one-period (late summer) PMPL, 12.1% of lake-years were misclassified to at least good and 9.3% to below-good ecological status. The risk of misclassification to at least good ecological status was 2% when the two-metric (biomassbased) PMPL index was used and 28.9% when the one-metric (chlorophyll-a based) was used. Lowest misclassification error (0.5%-5.2%) occurred when a three-period (spring-August-October), three-metric PMPL index was used, but as this 5.2% would result in substantial status under-classification, we recommend further research to possibly optimize a three-period PMPL variant to reduce the costs of lake ecological monitoring in Poland.					; Hutorowicz, Andrzej/O-5061-2019; Pasztaleniec, Agnieszka/AAO-9883-2021	Hutorowicz, Andrzej/0000-0002-2976-1079; Pasztaleniec, Agnieszka/0000-0001-5857-1189; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				AUG	2021	127								107754	10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107754	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107754		MAY 2021											WOS:000659185700006

We injected liquid oxygen into one basin, leaving the second, untreated basin as a reference. Oxygenation resulted in an expansion of hypolimnetic habitat in the treated basin; during periods of summer stratification, cisco occupied water strate 2-6 m deeper in the hypolimnion of the treated basin than in the reference basin. Cisco in Amisk Lake avoid water with dissolved oxygen concentrations [D0]<1.3mg/L. In 1989-1991, [DO] remained above this avoidance concentration throughout summer in the treated basin, but fell below it by mid-August in the reference basin. Mean (+/- SE) cisco densities in the treated basin increased from 579.4 +/- 133.6 fish/ha in 1989, to 3439 +/- 640.2 fish/ha in 1991; densities also increased in the reference basin over the same period, but to a lesser extent, from 249.6 +/- 46.9 to 779.3 +/- 309.4 fish/ha. Corresponding mean (+/- SE) biomasses increased from 143.4 +/- 7.2 to 523.7 +/- 73.7 kg/ha, and from 58.1 +/- 10.3 to 146.9 +/- 53.8 kg/ha in the treated and reference basins, respectively. Recruitment of a strong year-class in 1990 contributed to increases in density and biomass in both basins; however, monthly variations in density and biomass of cisco in the two basins suggest that cisco in the reference basin moved into the treated basin as summer progressed. The greater density and biomass in the treated basin compared with the reference basin may, therefore, be a behaviourial response to a better aerated hypolimnetic habitat in the treated asin than in the reference basin.

J	Bahnwart, M; Hübener, T; Schubert, H				Bahnwart, M; Hübener, T; Schubert, H			Downstream changes in phytoplankton composition and biomass in a lowland river-lake system (Warnow River, Germany)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												To determine longitudinal changes in phytoplankton composition and biomass in the Warnow River (Germany), single water parcels were followed during their downstream transport in August and October 1996 and April 1997. In summer, the phytoplankton assemblage was dominated by centric diatom and cyanobacteria species. Stephanodiscus hantzschii, Pseudanabaena limnetica, Planktothrix agardhii and Aulacoseira granulata var. angustissima were the most frequent species. In autumn, small centric diatoms dominated the whole river course. Irrespective of the season, in the fluvial lakes of the upper river, a substantial increase of phytoplankton biomass was observed. Shallow upstream river stretches were associated with large biomass losses. In the deep, slow flowing lower regions, total biomass remained constant. Longitudinal changes in biomass reflected downstream variations in flow velocity and river morphology. Cyanobacteria, cryptophytes and diatom species were subjected to large biomass losses along fast flowing, shallow river sections, whereas chlorophytes were favoured. Diatoms and cryptophytes benefited from low flow velocity and increased water depth in the downstream river. Changes in water depth and flow velocity have been found as key factors that cause the longitudinal differences in phytoplankton composition and biomass in small rivers.																			0018-8158						1998	391	1-3					99	111		10.1023/A:1003558209411	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003558209411													WOS:000081003200009
J	Tinner, W; Kaltenrieder, P				Tinner, W; Kaltenrieder, P			Rapid responses of high-mountain vegetation to early Holocene environmental changes in the Swiss Alps	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 The Early Holocene sediment of a lake at tree line (Gouille Rion, 2343 m a.s.l.) in the Swiss Central Alps was sampled for plant macrofossils. Thin (0.5 cm) slices, representing time intervals of c. 50 years each from 11 800 to 7800 cal. year bp, were analysed and the data compared with independent palaeoclimatic proxies to study vegetational responses to environmental change. 2 Alpine plant communities (e.g. with Salix herbacea) were established at 11 600-11 500 cal. year bp, when oxygen-isotope records showed that temperatures increased by c. 3-4 degrees C within decades. Larix decidua trees reached the site at c. 11 350 cal. year bp, probably in response to further warming by 1-2 degrees C. Forests dominated by L. decidua persisted until 9600 cal. year bp, when Pinus cembra became more important. 3 The dominance of Larix decidua for two millennia is explained by dry summer conditions, and possibly low winter temperatures, which favoured it over the late-successional Pinus cembra. Environmental conditions were a result of variations in the earth's orbit, leading to a maximum of summer and a minimum of winter solar radiation. Other heliophilous and drought-adapted species, such as Dryas octopetala and Juniperus nana, could persist in the open L. decidua forests, but were out-competed when the shade-tolerant P. cembra expanded. 4 The relative importance of Larix decidua decreased during periods of diminished solar radiation at 11 100, 10 100 and 9400 cal. year bp. Stable concentrations of L. decidua indicate that these percentage oscillations were caused by temporary increases of Pinus cembra, Dryas octopetala and Juniperus nana that can be explained by increases in moisture and/or decreases in summer temperature. 5 The final collapse of Larix decidua at 8400 cal. year bp was possibly related to abrupt climatic cooling as a consequence of a large meltwater input to the North Atlantic. Similarly, the temporary exclusion of Pinus cembra from tree line at 10 600-10 200 cal. year bp may be related to slowing down of thermohaline circulation at 10 700-10 300 cal. year bp. 6 Our results show that tree line vegetation was in dynamic equilibrium with climate, even during periods of extraordinarily rapid climatic change. They also imply that forecasted global warming may trigger rapid upslope movements of the tree line of up to 800 m within a few decades or centuries at most, probably inducing large-scale displacements of plant species as well as irrecoverable biodiversity losses.					; Tinner, Willy/F-6727-2013	Boltshauser-Kaltenrieder, Petra/0000-0001-7079-6284; Tinner, Willy/0000-0001-7352-0144													0022-0477	1365-2745				OCT	2005	93	5					936	947		10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01023.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01023.x													WOS:000231737000008

Lake Diefenbaker (LD), a large mesotrophic reservoir on the Canadian Prairies, receives approximate to 98% of its inflow from the South Saskatchewan River (SSR). The SSR annual flow volume largely varies with precipitation and temperature in the Rocky Mountains. The SSR basin has experienced multiple years of hydrological drought. To test the hypothesis that periods of lower inflows are related to increased algal biomass in LD, summer chlorophyll-a was related to hydrologic variables (IR, WL and WRT). A 31-year period of hydrologic data and estimated chlorophyll-a (i.e. derived from Landsat imagery) was examined. Summer chlorophyll-a ranged from 3.8 to 7.6g/L, and late spring and early summer IR, WL and WRT were 117-1061 m(3)/s, 550.7-556.2m and 0.3-2.1years, respectively. Chlorophyll-a increased as WL decreased in LD (R-adj(2) = 0.30, P=0.00081). This inverse relationship may be a function of light penetration and internal nutrient loading. Chlorophyll-a had a weak, inverse relationship with IR (R-adj(2) = 0.12, P=0.0315) that was likely driven by an extreme high-flow event. Chlorophyll-a was not significantly related to WRT (R-adj(2) = 0.06, P=0.1), which may be due to the limited variability in WRT and the size of LD. It was hypothesized that a water volume reduction exceeding 25%, caused by water abstraction or drought, or both, may support greater algal biomass in LD. Such reductions are unusual in the historical record, but will likely become more common with frequent drought together with water abstraction in the SSR basin as the Prairies continue to warm.					; hudson, jeff/G-6171-2012; Davies, John-Mark/ABK-5960-2022	Hudson, Jeffrey/0000-0002-0256-3240; Hunter, Kristine/0000-0002-0744-999X; , Oghenemise/0000-0002-8251-8166													0701-1784	1918-1817				JAN 2	2019	44	1					79	89		10.1080/07011784.2018.1531064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07011784.2018.1531064													WOS:000460738900001

The study was carried out from June 1975-Sept. 1976. During this period at a location 4 km offshore the currents generally flowed parallel to the shore with average speeds of 12 cm/s at 3 m and 5 cm/s at 1 m above lake bottom. The dominant periodic component of the velocity field was the 1st longitudinal mode of Lake Erie which had a period of approximately 14 h. During the study currents were generally uniform over the entire study area. Changes in the local winds usually affected the established flow pattern but only after a lag time. A well-expressed thermocline was observed during the summer season at 1 and 3 m above lake bottom at a lake depth of 15-20 m. The depth of the thermocline often fluctuated due to slight variations in the wind field. Transmissivity profiles followed the temperature profile closely, transmittance decreasing with depth. Values as high as 39% were observed at the surface during the summer, decreasing to zero during the winter. The general wind flow was towards the northeast during most months. The meteorological data indicated that the site was typical of a near shore environment, being generally 1.degree.-2.degree. C cooler than farther inland.																			0030-0950						1983	83	5					225	240																WOS:A1983SB14500002

In this study, we present a similar to 9.4 ka black carbon mass sedimentation rate (BCMSR) record from Lake Ximenglongtan (XMLT), southwestern China, to elucidate the Holocene fire regime and its linkages to climatic conditions. The results indicate that the regional fire activity was low during the early Holocene (before 7.6 cal ka BP), increased notably at 7.6 cal ka BP, and continued to increase gradually during the mid- to late Holocene until 2.2 ka. The episodes of higher fire occurrence reflected by higher BCMSR over the last 2.2 ka might be more likely related to the intensified human activities. The cool and humid climate during the early Holocene limited the spread of fire, while warming and drying at similar to 7.6 cal ka BP triggered higher fire occurrence. Instead of temperature, changes in precipitation dominated fire regime variation during the mid- to late Holocene. On millennial timescales, we suggest that Holocene fire variability has been predominantly controlled by the combined effects of Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer and winter insolation that influenced monsoonal precipitation and fire season temperature, respectively. Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events may also have affected fire incidence through influencing monsoon intensity.					sun, weiwei/GQG-8925-2022; Shulmeister, James/J-2859-2015; Chang, Jie/R-2763-2016; shulmeister, james/J-2859-2015	shulmeister, james/0000-0001-5863-9462													0033-5894	1096-0287				JAN	2020	93	1					243	254		10.1017/qua.2019.57	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/qua.2019.57													WOS:000506951900014
J	Kilinc, S; Moss, B				Kilinc, S; Moss, B			Whitemere, a lake that defies some conventions about nutrients	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Whitemere, a kettle-hole lake in north-west England (z(m),14 m, area 22.5 ha) has extremely high maximal concentrations (around 1 mg L-1) of total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and comparatively low maximal concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (<0.5 mg N L-1). Bioassays indicate that its phytoplankton, is nitrogen limited, and it has surface blue-green algal blooms in summer. Palaeoecological investigations have shown that high populations of cyanophytes occurred more than 6000 years ago, even before human settlement of the catchment. 2. The reasons for this combination of features are not immediately clear. This paper attempts to distinguish between two hypotheses: that the high phosphorus concentrations arise from input of phosphate-rich groundwater; and that the high phosphorus concentrations arise from concentration and recycling mechanisms within the lake. 3. The lake is entirely fed by ground water, direct rainfall and surface sheet flow. The concentrations of phosphorus in the ground water are much lower than in the lake water. The lake is stratified and has high phosphorus concentrations in the anaerobic hypolimnion in summer as a result of substantial release from the sediment. Vertical turbulence in the relatively weakly stratified water column may transfer substantial amounts to the epilimnion. There is also substantial phosphorus release from the sediments under the aerobic epilimnion. 4. There is little outflow of water and phosphorus. Most of the phosphorus is returned to the sediment under winter isothermal conditions, to be released again the following summer. The lake has probably maintained these mechanisms for millennia. Recent eutrophication is likely to have been driven by nitrogen inputs from greater intensification of agriculture in the catchment.																			0046-5070					FEB	2002	47	2					207	218		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00797.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00797.x													WOS:000173825000004

We employ an idealized age tracer and biogeochemical tracers in a realistically configured numerical model of Lake Superior to characterize its ventilation and dissolved O-2 cycle. Our results indicate that Lake Superior is preferentially ventilated over rough bathymetry and that spring overturning following a very cold winter does not completely ventilate the lake interior. While this is unexpected for a dimictic lake, no part of the lake remains isolated from the atmosphere for more than 300 days. Our results also show that Lake Superior's oxygen cycle is dominated by solubility changes; as a result, the expected relationship between biological consumption of dissolved O2 and ventilation age does not manifest.

In a decomposition experiment, seston released >60% of their total phosphorus during similar to 50 days incubation, although seston collected during summer contained more phosphorus and released it over a longer period compared to seston collected during spring. Seston decomposition increased concentrations of potentially bioavailable polyphosphate and phosphodiesters, but also promoted the formation of refractory phosphorus forms that might be buried permanently in the sediment. Combining these results with in situ measurements of phosphorus concentrations in lake water and sediment traps revealed that the release from settling seston plays only a minor role in the accumulation of phosphorus in the hypolimnion of Lake Nordborg.					; Turner, Benjamin/E-5940-2011	Egemose, Sara/0000-0001-7356-9095; Turner, Benjamin/0000-0002-6585-0722													1464-0325					MAR	2012	14	3					1098	1106		10.1039/c2em10883f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2em10883f								22344567					WOS:000300875100040

Quantification of C uptake in subarctic birch forest after setback by an extreme insect outbreak	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												The carbon dynamics of northern natural ecosystems contribute significantly to the global carbon balance. Periodic disturbances to these dynamics include insect herbivory. Larvae of autumn and winter moths (Epirrita autumnata and Operophtera brumata) defoliate mountain birch (Betula pubescens) forests in northern Scandinavia cyclically every 9-10 years and occasionally (50-150 years) extreme population densities can threaten ecosystem stability. Here we report impacts on C balance following a 2004 outbreak where a widespread area of Lake Tornetrask catchment was severely defoliated. We show that in the growing season of 2004 the forest was a much smaller net sink of C than in a reference year, most likely due to lower gross photosynthesis. Ecosystem respiration in 2004 was smaller and less sensitive to air temperature at nighttime relative to 2006. The difference in growing season uptake between an insect affected and non-affected year over the 316 km(2) area is in the order of 29 x 10(3) tonnes C equal to a reduction of the sink strength by 89%.

J	Cooper, MC; O'Sullivan, PE				Cooper, MC; O'Sullivan, PE			The laminated sediments of Loch Ness, Scotland: Preliminary report on the construction of a chronology of sedimentation and its potential use in assessing Holocene climatic variability	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY					1st Limno-Geological Congress on Research and Methods in Methods in Ancient and Modern Lacustrine Basins	AUG 21-25, 1995	COPENHAGEN, DENMARK					Two sediment cores, ca. 6 m long, have been recovered from the north basin of Loch Ness, Scotland. Each consists of ca. 4.5 m of laminated gyttja, terminating in a basal grey, unlaminated clay. A suite of three C-14 AMS dates have been obtained, and place the base of the gyttja at ca. 9500 yr B.P. Investigations into the structure, composition and formation of the laminae are in progress. Analysis by Backscatter Scanning Electron Microscopy (BSEM) has demonstrated that they consist of couplets comprising dark, clay-rich sediments thought to be deposited from spring to autumn, and pale, silt-rich layers believed to represent sedimentation through winter. The laminae are thus thought to record incidence and intensity of streamflow into the Loch over the past nine millennia, and thus illustrate environmental change over the region for most of the Holocene. X-ray densitometry has been utilised in order to count the laminations and test the hypothesis that they are varves. It has, however, proved difficult to obtain a continuous sequence of countable laminations, although it has been possible to construct a fragmented, floating chronology which indicates that the hypothesis may be correct. Examination of lamination thickness reveals that although the average rate of sedimentation throughout the time periods studied seems to have remained fairly constant, significant variations have occurred. As Loch Ness is located on the northwest oceanic fringe of Europe, any climatic signal which the laminations contain will be closely related to even larger scale events over and within the North Atlantic Ocean, which is a major controller of global climate. Preliminary statistical investigation of sequences of laminae is being carried out in order to search for periodicity of sedimentation which may then be related to appropriate climatic indices.

J	Gao, Y; Chen, D; Wang, T				Gao, Ya; Chen, Dong; Wang, Tao			Interannual-Interdecadal Variability of Extreme Low Temperature in North Asia and Its Driving Mechanisms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												To investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics and its impact of winter extreme low temperature in North Asia, the extreme cold days index (TX10p) is used in this study. The first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) mode of extreme cold days in North Asia exhibits a consistent distribution centered on Lake Baikal, primarily showing interannual variability. It is influenced by two key factors: snow cover in the previous autumn and the Arctic Oscillation (AO) in the wintertime, modulated by the land-atmosphere. Specifically, the previous autumn snow cover can affect the strength of mid-high latitude troughs and ridges by adjusting the meridional temperature gradient and the strength of the westerly wind, thereby influencing cold waves. Meanwhile, the winter AO can modulate the southward movement of polar cold air by adjusting the strength of the polar vortex, ultimately impacting the frequency of extreme cold days in North Asia. The second EOF mode of the extreme cold days in North Asia displays a northeast-southwest dipole distribution bounded by Lake Baikal, mainly showing an interdecadal transition. Temporally, before 2000, the pattern featured more cold days in the northeast and less in the southwest, with the opposite trend in the later period. Spatially, the spatial distribution also has a corresponding interdecadal change around 2000. The northeast-southwest boundary of the dipole pattern shifted from around 50 degrees N in the early period to approximately 60 degrees N in the later period, reflecting an expansion of the southwest region. The interdecadal change characteristics of the second mode are mainly modulated by the combined effects of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Under the synergistic changes of the AMO and PDO phases, the sea surface temperatures of the Pacific and Atlantic can influence the strength of the polar vortex, thereby affecting the north-south gradient in the mid to high latitudes, and the strengths of westerlies and troughs and ridges, ultimately being conducive or not conducive to the southward movement of cold air. In addition, shifts in the PDO phase impact the strength and position of the Aleutian Low, which alters the East Asian trough and contributes to the north-south displacement of the EOF2 mode's spatial pattern.																			0899-8418	1097-0088				SEP	2025	45	11								10.1002/joc.8928	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.8928		JUN 2025											WOS:001506920000001

Contrasting soil temperature regimes in peatlands of the discontinuous permafrost zone (Western Siberia)	GEODERMA												Carbon cycling in permafrost peatlands is strongly influenced by both hydrology and temperature and is closely linked to microtopography. In this study, we assessed soil temperature regimes in the sporadic permafrost zone of Western Siberia, one of the most climate-sensitive regions currently undergoing dramatic changes. Based on topographic mapping, photogrammetry, soil, vegetation and thermometric observations, we related the soil thermal regimes of the dominant peatland's landforms to snow cover, water pathways, peat thickness and ground vegetation. In flat-mound peatland complex, thick peat deposits and convex forms (local elevations) induced a small accumulation of snow in winter, which led to coldest temperatures on the peat plateaus. The peat plateau soils with a thin peat layer and similar lichen-shrub vegetation had three time thicker active layer. Soils in adjacent sedge-Sphagnum fens remained noticeably cooler in summer but warmer in winter due to the insulating effect of thick snow cover. In contrast, soils in drained basins of thermokarst lakes froze to a shallower depth due to the absence of peat and the efficient insulation provided by thick snow retained on tall sedges. Overall, even within a small peatland complex in Western Siberia, soil temperature regimes can vary significantly over just a few hundred meters, resembling differences typically observed across distinct climatic zones. With ongoing climate warming, the active layer thickness is expected to increase, leading to a greater accumulation of suprapermafrost water, with maximum expansion occurring in the peripheral zones of the peatland.

Lake dissolved inorganic carbon and dissolved oxygen: Changing drivers from days to decades	ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS												Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved oxygen (DO) are commonly measured to compute metabolism of aquatic ecosystems. However, concentrations of DIC and DO depend on many factors in addition to ecosystem metabolism, such as water temperature, gas exchange with the atmosphere, abiotic chemical reactions, and inputs in precipitation, groundwater, and surface water. We used 20-year time series from seven lakes to understand how DIC and DO concentrations are controlled as a function of time scale. Diel cycles of both solutes are controlled primarily by metabolism, exchange with the atmosphere, and temperature. At seasonal and annual scales, metabolism is important, but physical processes associated with spring and autumn mixing, as well as solute loading from the watershed, have comparably large effects. At decadal scales, effects of metabolism are negligible. Controls of the two solutes diverge, with variance in DIC explained largely by solute inputs and variance in DO explained largely by water temperature. Like other indicators in many ecosystems, variability of DIC and DO is strongly scale dependent and associated with different drivers depending on the time scale of the analysis.

J	Twomey, L; John, J				Twomey, L; John, J			Effects of rainfall and salt-wedge movement on phytoplankton succession in the Swan-Canning Estuary, Western Australia	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Annual data sets, from 1980-81 and 1994-95, provide evidence that inter-annual differences in the seasonal succession of phytoplankton in the Swan River Estuary can be attributed to rainfall and salt-wedge movement. The distribution and succession of phytoplankton are influenced by seasonal variation of rainfall and its subsequent effect on the spatial distribution of salinity. The longer duration of rainfall in 1980-81 compared with 1994-95 effectively restricted the movement of the salt-water wedge, thereby delaying the progression of marine phytoplankton into the estuary. There was little difference in the phytoplankton composition and biomass in the lower estuary, while the upper estuary appeared to have more blooms of dinoflagellates in the summer and autumn of 1994-95 compared with 1980-81. The intensity and duration of rainfall appeared to affect the availability of soluble nutrients. Although there was no significant difference in phytoplankton biomass between the two periods, it was likely that the high phytoplankton biomass in the upper estuary in 1994-95 was due to availability of more soluble nutrients from internal recycling processes at the sediment/water interface.

J	Zhang, X; Wu, BY; Ding, SY				Zhang, Xiang; Wu, Bingyi; Ding, Shuoyi			Combined effects of La Nina events and Arctic tropospheric warming on the winter North Pacific storm track	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												This study investigates the dominant characteristics of winter Arctic tropospheric thickness (1000-200 hPa), the variations of winter atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere, and the related winter North Pacific storm track (NPST) variabilities during 1979-2018 under the combined effects of the La Nina events with different periods of Arctic tropospheric thermal conditions. Results show that the leading mode (42.7%) exhibits prominent warm anomalies centered on Greenland and Baffin Bay. The winter Arctic tropospheric thickness experienced a phase shift from a cold period of the Arctic tropospheric temperature in 1979-1999 to the warm period after 2000. During the La Nina events with Arctic tropospheric warm anomalies, a wave train is shown in the mid-high latitudes with alternative anticyclonic, cyclonic, and anticyclonic anomalies over the Ural Mountains, Lake Baikal, and North Pacific, respectively. This atmospheric circulation pattern not only intensifies the linkage between the Arctic and mid-low latitudes but also induces the winter NPST shifting poleward. The possible physical mechanism is attributed to the large-scale circulation change and the local baroclinic energy conversion (BCEC). The enhanced anticyclonic anomaly in the North Pacific alters the climatological mean flow, further influencing the local BCEC through the interaction between the mean flow and eddies. The significantly robust BCEC over the North Pacific possibly induces the poleward shift of winter NPST during the La Nina events under the warm period.

The submarine speed was about 0.5 m s(-1). In addition to the temperatures, the pressure, orientation, and tilt were recorded at frequencies of at least 10 Hz. Observations were made on a vertical scale of 0.1 to 2.5 m and on a horizontal scale from 0.5 m to 1 km. Examples of the data are presented. During the summer, evidence was found of internal waves and of extensive layers of low vertical temperature gradient, with vertical and horizontal scales of 0.5 m and 0.5 km, respectively; within this gradient, the temperature changed monotonically in the horizontal. During periods favoring convection, in the winter, when air temperatures were about 7 degrees C below the surface-water temperature, convectively unstable regions, typically of 5-m horizontal scale, were observed in the mixed layer. These appeared to be convective plumes. These winter measurements also included observations of a layer of cold water that was adjacent to the sloping boundary of the lake. This was identified as being a plume of dense cold water with thickness on the order of 10 m, which was driven by surface cooling, and consequent more rapid temperature decrease, in the shallow nearshore water. On meeting the thermocline at a depth of about 100 m, this plume spread horizontally and formed an intrusion some 30 m thick.

Sensitivity of lake thermal and mixing dynamics to climate change	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Warming-induced changes in lake thermal and mixing regimes present risks to water quality and ecosystem services provided by U.S. lakes and reservoirs. Modulation of responses by different physical and hydroclimatic settings are not well understood. We explore the potential effects of climate change on 27 lake "archetypes" representative of a range of lakes and reservoirs occurring throughout the U.S. Archetypes are based on different combinations of depth, surface area, and water clarity. LISSS, a one-dimensional dynamic thermal simulation model, is applied to assess lake response to multiple mid-21st century change scenarios applied to nine baseline climate series from different hydroclimatic regions of the U.S. Results show surface water temperature increases of about 77 % of increase in average air temperature change. Bottom temperature changes are less (around 30 %) for deep lakes and in regions that maintain mid-winter air temperatures below freezing. Significant decreases in length of ice cover are projected, and the extent and strength of stratification will increase throughout the U.S., with systematic differences associated with depth, surface area, and clarity. These projected responses suggest a range of future challenges that lake managers are likely to face. Changes in thermal and mixing dynamics suggest increased risk of summer hypoxic conditions and cyanobacterial blooms. Increased water temperatures above the summer thermocline could be a problem for cold water fisheries management in many lakes. Climate-induced changes in water balance and mass inputs of nutrients may further exacerbate the vulnerability of lakes to climate change.

Diverse sulfate-and sulfur intermediate-reducing bacteria contributing to annually expanding water anoxia in an oil sands pit lake	JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS												Acidification and dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion in mining-affected water bodies are global environmental challenges associated with the oxidation of reduced S species (Sreduced), including sulfide and sulfur oxidation intermediate compounds (SOI). The recent detection of diverse SOI species in tailings impoundments and pit lakes highlights overlooked risks from microbial S cycling, that are difficult to geochemically quantify due to rapid Sreduced turnover. This study characterizes sulfur-reducing bacteria (SRB; capable of sulfate and/or SOI reduction), in Base Mine Lake (BML), the first oil sands tailings reclamation end pit lake. Integrating field physicochemical, geochemical, 16S rRNA sequencing, and metagenomic results, we identified seasonal and DOdependent variations in SRB communities that were associated with the spring-summer physicochemical and [Sreduced] changes. Specifically, late summer stratified BML water column evidenced DO-dependent SRB zonation, initiating with strictly anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria in bottom anoxic waters, and SRB SOI-reduction/ disproportionation processes extending S impacts into the suboxic regions. The identification of SRB communities with diverse S reduction/disproportionation capabilities reveal the escalating environmental implications of annually recurrent and expanding sulfur cycling to BML water DO persistence. Findings here inform future oil sands tailings reclamation regulatory assessment, and provide essential insights for S biogeochemical cycling and outcomes in mining-impacted water contexts.

Maarsseveen) two co-occurring Daphnia species, Daphnia pulicaria and Daphnia galeata x hyalina performed distinct vertical migration behaviour during summer which is induced by a high fish biomass of young perch. During late spring and summer, D. galeata x hyalina exhibits diel vertical migration, whereas D. pulicaria is staying down day and night in the hypolimnion. This difference in migration behaviour results in contrasting predation mortalities caused by fish, low for D. pulicaria and relatively high for D. galeata X hyalina. In the present study, we measured in the laboratory the effects of fish released infochemicals on five life history traits in four genetically distinct D. galeata X hyalina and three genetically distinct D. pulicaria clones collected during summer at day-time from the hypolimnion. We tested the hypothesis that the species which behaviour is providing the best protection against fish predation (i.e. D. pulicaria) is less protected by life history traits induced by fish released infochemicals than the species which by its behaviour is less well protected against fish predation (i.e. D. galeata x hyalina). Our results show that D. galeata x hyalina responded in three out of five traits differently to fish infochemicals than D. pulicaria. In all these three traits D. galeata x hyalina responded significantly to fish-released infochemicals, whereas D. pulicaria did not show any significant response at all. We conclude that in D. pulicaria behavioural defences trade-off against life history defences.					van Donk, Ellen/B-7272-2008	van Donk, Ellen/0000-0003-3279-4936													0003-9136					SEP	2006	167	1-4					89	100		10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0167-0089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0167-0089													WOS:000241402800007

Nonetheless, the effect of warming on primary producers is poorly understood, especially periphyton production, which is affected both directly and indirectly by temperature-sensitive top-down and bottom-up controls. Here, we study the impact of warming on gross primary production in experimental ecosystems with near-realistic foodwebs during spring and early summer. We used indoor mesocosms following a temperate temperature regime (control) and a warmed (+4 degrees C) treatment to measure biomass and production of phytoplankton and periphyton. The mesocosms' primary production was dominated by periphyton (>82%) during the studied period (April-June). Until May, periphyton production and biomass were significantly higher in the warm treatment (up to 98% greater biomass compared to the control) due to direct temperature effects on growth and indirect effects resulting from higher sediment phosphorus release. Subsequently, enhanced grazer abundances seem to have counteracted the positive temperature effect causing a decline in periphyton biomass and production in June. We thus show, within our studied period, seasonally distinct effects of warming on periphyton, which can significantly affect overall ecosystem primary production and functioning.

The study of the entire Holocene allows us to determine the significant climate shift that occurred during the middle-to-late Holocene transition. The highest occurrence of deciduous forest in the Padul area from similar to 9.5 to 7.6 cal kyr BP represents the Holocene humidity optimum probably due to enhanced winter precipitation during a phase of highest seasonal anomaly and maximum summer insolation. Locally, insolation maxima induced high evaporation, counterbalancing the effect of relatively high precipitation, and triggered very low water table in Padul and the deposition of peat sediments. A transitional environmental change towards more regional aridity occurred from similar to 7.6 to 4.7 cal kyr BP and then aridification enhanced in the late Holocene most likely related to decreasing summer insolation. This translated into higher water levels and a sedimentary change at similar to 4.7 cal kyr BP in the Padul wetland, probably related to reduced evaporation during summer in response to decreased in seasonality. Millennial-scale variability is superimposed on the Holocene long-term trends. The Mediterranean forest regional climate proxy studied here shows significant cold-arid events around similar to 9.6, 8.5, 7.5, 6.5 and 5.4 cal kyr BP with cyclical periodicities (similar to 1100 and 2100 yr) during the early and middle Holocene. A change is observed in the periodicity of these cold-arid events towards similar to 1430 yr in the late Holocene, with forest declines around similar to 4.7-4, 2.7 and 1.3 cal kyr BP. The comparison between the Padul-15-05 data with published North Atlantic and Mediterranean paleoclimate records suggests common triggers for the observed climate variability, with the early and middle Holocene forest declines at least partially controlled by external forcing (i.e. solar activity) and the late Holocene variability associated with internal mechanisms (oceanic-atmospheric).

J	LAW, BS				LAW, BS			CLIMATIC LIMITATION OF THE SOUTHERN DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMMON BLOSSOM BAT SYCONYCTERIS-AUSTRALIS IN NEW-SOUTH-WALES	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												This study investigates the importance of climate as a factor influencing the southern distributional limit of the common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis). Using the climatic predictive model BIOCLIM and 73 locality records, S, australis was predicted to have a coastal distribution in eastern Australia, where winter temperatures are relatively warm and moist conditions prevail throughout the year. The actual southern limit of S, australis, determined by mist-netting suitable habitats, was found to be at Booti-Booti(32 degrees 19'S 152 degrees 31'E) on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. BIOCLIM predicted the southerly limit of S, australis to be 150-200 km further south of their actual limit. Booti-Booti was occupied at relatively low levels of abundance year round, while the abundance of S, australis at a site 50 km to the north was much greater, fluctuating with changes in Banksia flower numbers. Seasonal range extensions beyond Booti-Booti were not detected, despite the availability of apparently suitable habitat at Myall Lakes only 20-35 km further south. Metabolic costs of S. australis at Booti-Booti were estimated to exceed basal metabolic rate (BMR) by 4.5 times, well above the physiologically predicted limit of 2.5 times BMR. These results, together with the lack of range extensions and the close correspondence of BIOCLIM'S predicted southern limit of S. australis with their actual limit, suggest that the bat's southern distribution is limited by cold, wet winters and dry summers.					; Law, Brad/IAQ-8054-2023	Law, Bradley/0000-0002-3991-3865; 													0307-692X					DEC	1994	19	4					366	374		10.1111/j.1442-9993.1994.tb00502.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.1994.tb00502.x													WOS:A1994PW47000002

The results show that bacteria and phytoplankton displayed almost opposite seasonal and spatial distributions. Bacterial abundances were at their annual high in the late summer and early fall when chlorophyll concentrations and primary productivity were at a seasonal low and nutrient concentrations were at their annual nadir. These results indicate that bacterial populations were not highly stimulated by the presence of algae or algal extracellular excretions. However, a complete separation of bacterial and algal dynamics was difficult because of the ecological overlap between microalgae (less than 3 .mu. in diameter) and bacterioplankton. Analysis of bacterial abundance, chlorophyll concentration, and glucose uptake by size fractions showed that Lake Michigan has an abundant crop of microalgae. These microalgae were difficult to separate from the bacterioplankton. The glucose uptake data by size class suggested a significant portion of dark heterotrophy was conducted by algae.																			0380-1330						1986	12	1					52	62		10.1016/S0380-1330(86)71699-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(86)71699-7													WOS:A1986A507400006

Experiments ran for 5 d and were repeated in autumn and spring at Lake Illawarra, a coastal lagoon in New South Wales, Australia. Experiments consisted of 2 orthogonal treatments, addition/non-addition of nutrients and presence/absence of jellyfish, and were designed to determine how bottom-up (i.e. addition of nutrients) and top-down (i.e. predation by jellyfish) processes influence planktonic assemblages, both independently and in combination. During both experiments, nutrients stimulated primary production and caused changes in phytoplankton assemblages. Nutrients also stimulated production of large tintinnids, suggesting that bottom-up processes may influence 2 trophic levels. Mesozooplankton were consistently depleted in mesocosms containing jellyfish. Jellyfish also caused changes in microzooplankton assemblages, indicating that top-down processes also cascade to at least 2 trophic levels. In mesocosms to which both nutrients and jellyfish were added during spring, concentrations of the red-tide forming, heterotrophic dinoflagellate Noctiluca scintillans were 20 times greater than in mesocosms to which nutrients were added alone. We hypothesize that addition of nutrients stimulated production of centric diatoms, the main prey of N. scintillans, but that a bloom of N. scintillans only formed when jellyfish were also present because jellyfish grazed on populations of herbivorous mesozooplankton (particularly the calanoid copepod Gladioferens), which generally out-competed N. scintillans for diatom prey. These data provide the first empirical evidence linking jellyfish to the formation of red tides.

J	Brinkmann, WAR				Brinkmann, WAR			Modification of a correlation-based circulation pattern classification to reduce within-type variability of temperature and precipitation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												When a correlation-based circulation pattern classification was applied to daily 700 hPa heights for 25 summer seasons, and the circulation types were related to surface temperature and precipitation for the Lake Superior basin, within-type variability was found to be high. Regarding temperature, the difference between warm and cold days of a type is a positive height anomaly centred to the east of the lake, which is very similar to the height anomaly for winter temperatures identified ill an earlier study. The difference between wet and dry days of a type is a pattern quite unlike that for temperature. It is a dipole pattern consisting of a negative anomaly to the northwest of the lake and a positive anomaly to the east and southeast. These small-scale circulation components were missed by the correlation-based classification because they are much smaller than the differences in height between circulation types. Regression models, relating monthly mean temperature anomalies to circulation type frequencies, produced results comparable to those obtained for winter temperature. For precipitation, the variance explained by the regression models is only half that obtained for temperature. Two approaches were used to reduce within-type variability and to improve the regression results: the division of the first few circulation types into warm/cold and wet/dry subtypes on the basis of differences in 700 hPa vorticity tan approach introduced in the earlier paper), and a modified correlation-based circulation pattern classification. The modification consisted of raising the correlation threshold for a few selected grid-points to capture the small-scale circulation component and also, of lowering the threshold for the comparison between maps and map sectors in order to minimize the number of unclassified days. Of the two approaches used to reduce within-type variability, the modified classification scheme produced superior results. In particular, the variance in precipitation explained by the regression models is about 30% higher than that achieved using vorticity to create subtypes.

Variations in the average value of the vertical attenuation coefficient with time were closely related to variations in biomass. Inspection of the depth distribution of the natural logarithms of light intensity reveals several straight-line segments. These correspond to zones with differing phytoplankton densities. During the spring bloom and the late summer phytoplankton maximum the biomass development can be followed in detail by interpreting the light-depth curves. The vertical attenuation coefficient Kd (PAR) is influenced considerably by chlorophyll a; nonchlorophyll-related organic and inorganic suspensoids also seem to be of some importance during periods of low productivity.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1985	30	2					299	310		10.4319/lo.1985.30.2.0299	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1985.30.2.0299													WOS:A1985AGF8500005

The estimation of the HABs community responses to diel changes in the nutrients while characterizing the ecosystem growth limiting factors, is key to prudent watershed management. The present study investigated the short-term variabilities in autumn cyanobacterial responses to the external nutrient inputs into the Pengxi River using the nutrient addition bioassay approach. Results reveal phytoplankton community structure dominated by the cyanobacteria: Anabaena and Aphanizomenon spp. (relative abundance = 46.20% equilibrium abundance), followed by the diatoms, out of which Lindayia bodaniica, are preponderant. Nutrient enrichment triggered strong variabilities in dominance and successions among the cyanobacterial group, with maximum dominance (76.34%) exhibited by the Aphanizomenon sp. upon NH4 addition. Fe enrichment led to the succession of cyanobacteria, Leptolyngbya tenuis, which was below the detectable limit in the control, indicating the role of Fe in its proliferation. Studies on nutrient limitation demonstrated P/NH4 co-limited ecosystem, with P as the primary and NH4, a secondary limiting factor. The nitrate preference index (NO3 RPI = 0.991) shows a high preference for NH4 while NO3 constitutes the bulk of the ecosystem TN. Considering the elevated NO3 concentration, we posit that a shift in the phytoplankton community structure from cyanobacteria to diatoms dominated ecosystem, is expected following Fe depletion and a further stretch on the current ecosystem NH4 limitation. The study provides useful and first-ever insights for nutrient reduction in the middle Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) before the onset of the heavy HABs during spring in the Pengxi River.

Movements, recapture rate and length increment of tagged pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) - a basis for management in large lakes	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Movements, site fidelity, exploitation rate and total length (TL) increment of pikeperch, Sander lucioperca L., were studied by tagging 3977 pikeperch, of 334mm mean TL, in Lake Malaren in 1994. Fish were recaptured in gillnets, trap nets and to a lesser extent with rod and line. Total recapture rate was 30.4%, with 50% of the recaptures made within 8.4km of the release site. Movements were restricted during summer, whereas movements from shallow to deeper basins were frequent in autumn. The yearly TL increment was estimated at 99mm for fish 300mm long at release and 42mm for fish of 400mm at release. The results have direct implications for future management, as the mortality of undersized fish in the fishery; the strong site fidelity and fast growth indicate that fishery closures may be an effective measure to attain a larger stock of fish above the size limit.																			0969-997X	1365-2400				DEC	2015	22	6					450	457		10.1111/fme.12143	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.12143													WOS:000365718900002

This study explored the zonal differences of summer precipitation in Northeast Asia at orbital timescales during the Holocene by comparing proxy records with simulation results. At orbital timescales, there was generally an east-west antiphasing of summer precipitation in Northeast Asia during the Holocene. Model-proxy comparison revealed that the driest interval occurred during the late Holocene in western Northeast Asia and during the early to middle Holocene in eastern Northeast Asia. Changes of summer precipitation in western Northeast Asia were mainly influenced by precession-driven EASM circulation. On the one hand, a weaker EASM circulation during the late Holocene weakened water vapor transport from the North Pacific Ocean to Northeast Asia, and on the other hand it was associated with anomalous downward motions in western Northeast Asia. Both factors were in favor of a reduction of summer precipitation in western Northeast Asia during the late Holocene. In contrast, anomalous downward motions prevailed in eastern Northeast Asia during the early to middle Holocene, which were probably related to stronger western Pacific subtropical high and weaker westerlies. The effect of the anomalous downward motions overwhelmed the enhanced water vapor transport, leading to a dry climate in this area from the early to middle Holocene. This study suggests that special care should be taken when discussing the meridional shift of the Holocene climatic optimum in the EASM region due to the zonal precipitation contrast.

The Indus River located in Western Himalaya is previously unexplored in respect of the variation in water isotopic composition with elevation. In this study, water samples (n = 96) were collected from mainstream, tributaries, streams, glaciers, groundwater, lakes, hot springs, and pond water during the summer season. Results showed that delta O-18 signatures of the mainstream, tributaries and groundwater range from -15.1 parts per thousand to -12.3 parts per thousand, -16.5 parts per thousand to -12 parts per thousand, -13.8 parts per thousand to -12 parts per thousand, with a mean value of -13.6 parts per thousand, -14.7 parts per thousand, -12.8 parts per thousand, respectively. There was a northward rise in delta O-18 by 1.30 parts per thousand per degree of latitude in the tributary waters. The d-excess and delta O-18 values suggested that the key source of moisture in the studied river basin was mainly from westerlies and southwest monsoons. Thus, regional moisture recycling and subcloud evaporation contributed little in supplying moisture to the precipitation. The isotopic signature (delta O-18) of the tributary stream and its surrounding regions conformed to a best-fit second-order polynomial relationship between delta O-18 and elevation over 3500 masl. Moreover, an delta O-18 elevation slope of -2 parts per thousand/km is also established in this study area. This isotope-elevation relationship will be highly useful and can be applied to the Indus River and other Himalayan rivers for paleoelevation reconstruction.

Temperate lakes always experience seasonal ice cover in winter, but the influences of emergent macrophytes decomposition on water quality have rarely been examined under ice. Here, we conducted an incubation experiment to investigate winter decomposition of two common emergent macrophytes species (Typha orientalisandPhragmites australis) and its influences on water quality in the Hengshui Lake, North China. Mesocosms simulating a lake ice regime were incubated in the field for 120 days in winter and were treated with and without plant material addition. Water quality was monitored through dissolved oxygen (DO), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N). We found that both species were significantly decomposed in winter and that the majority of mass loss occurred in the first 10 days of decomposition when the water surface of mesocosms were already frozen. The concentrations of DO rapidly dropped to values close to zero after plant material submergence. At the end of incubation, the concentrations of DOC, TN, and NO3-N in the mesocosms with plant material addition were significantly higher than initial concentrations. In contrast, the concentrations of DOC, TN, TP, NO3-N, and NH4-N in the mesocosms without plant material addition were equal to or less than initial concentrations. Our research suggests that winter decomposition of emergent macrophytes produces negative influences on water quality under ice that lasts for the whole winter.					; Zhang, Manyin/AAK-5171-2020; Pan, Xu/W-1607-2017	LI, WEI/0000-0002-2133-9287; Lei, Yinru/0000-0003-4728-1308; Zhang, Man-Yin/0000-0003-2771-5869														2073-4441				SEP	2020	12	9							2640	10.3390/w12092640	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12092640													WOS:000580793100001
J	Chen, JM; Cihlar, J				Chen, JM; Cihlar, J			Retrieving leaf area index of boreal conifer forests using landsat TM images	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Vegetation Indices, including the simple ratio (SR) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), from Landsat TM data were correlated to ground-based measurements of LAI, effective LAI, and the crown closure in boreal conifer forests located near Candle Lake and Prince Albert, Saskatchewan and near Thompson, Manitoba, as part of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). The measurements were made using two optical instruments: the Plant Canopy Analyzer (LAI-2000, LI-COR) and the TRAC (Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies). The TRAC was recently developed to quantify the effect of canopy architecture on optical measurements of leaf area index. The stands were located on georeferenced Landsat TM images using global positioning system (GPS) measurements. It is found that late spring Landsat images are superior to summer images for determining overstory LAI in boreal conifer stands because the effect of the understory is minimized in the spring before the full growth of the understory and moss cover. The effective LAI, obtained from gap fraction measurements assuming a random distribution of foliage spatial positions, was found to be better correlated to SR and NDVI than LAI. The effective LAI is less variable and easier to measure than LAI, and is also an intrinsic attribute of plant canopies. It is therefore suggested to use effective LAI as the most important parameter for radiation interception considerations.

Muskrat Abundance Responses to Water level Regulation Within Freshwater Coastal Wetlands	WETLANDS												Muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) are aptly described as "ecosystem engineers" for their influences associated with herbivory, house building, and movement within freshwater wetlands. Sensitivity to flow regime alteration via hydrologic regulation, however, may limit their populations and ability to facilitate wetland diversity and heterogeneity. Muskrat house surveys in coastal wetlands in tributaries (reference wetlands) subject to regional scale water level regulation were compared to treatment sites where local scale water-control structures were installed to alter the regulation effect. Data were used to develop a two-step model to predict wetland occupancy then house density to assess effects associated with proposed water level regulation plans. Field surveys indicated low house densities for cattail-dominated reference wetlands, and nearly 85% of houses located were in treatment sites. House distribution at reference sites was limited to channel edges, whereas houses at treatment sites were found throughout the floodplain. Occupancy of wetlands by muskrats was estimated by winter water depth, and fall water depth, and winter air temperature were selected as predictors of house density. Model validation indicated complete agreement for wetland occupancy, but density tended to be underestimated. Simulations provided a tool to evaluate water management plans and indicated that muskrat populations are suppressed under the current water level regulation regime.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				APR	2010	30	2					211	219		10.1007/s13157-010-0034-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-010-0034-x													WOS:000278625800004
J	VANDERVALK, AG; RHYMER, JM; MURKIN, HR				VANDERVALK, AG; RHYMER, JM; MURKIN, HR			FLOODING AND THE DECOMPOSITION OF LITTER OF 4 EMERGENT PLANT-SPECIES IN A PRAIRIE WETLAND	WETLANDS												Changes in mass, N, and P for old and new litter of four emergent plant species (Scolochloa festucacea (Willd1.) Link, Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin ex Steud., Typha x glauca Godr., and Scirpus lacustris L. spp. glaucus (Sm.) Hartm.) were studied under two water-level regimes in a 10-cell experimental marsh complex in the Delta Marsh, Manitoba, Canada. In the normal regime, water levels were kept at the regulated water level for Lake Manitoba until the fall of 1981, while in the flooded or high-water regime, they were raised 1 m above the regulated level in the fall of 1980. In the spring of 1980, old litter (i.e., litter from the previous growing season) was placed in all ten cells of the complex, and in the fall of 1980, new litter (i.e., litter from the 1980 growing season) was placed in the same 10 cells. Litter of S. festucacea had the highest mean decomposition rate (k = 0.00171), followed by T. x glauca (0.0131), S. l. glaucus (0.00126), and P. australis (0.00050). Mean decomposition rates were higher in the flooded treatment than in the normal treatment for P. australis and S. festucacea. Within water-level treatments, mass loss depended on initial litter age. The amount of N and P lost or gained by the end of 1981 varied with species, litter age, and water-level treatment. Scolochloa festucacea old and new litter had a lower percent N and P remaining in the flooded than in the normal water-level treatment. The percent N and P remaining in old litter of P. australis and S. l. glaucus at the end of the study was higher than that in new litterregardless of water-level treatment. For T. x glauca, however, new litter had a higher percent of N and P remaining than old litter at the end of the study in both water-level treatments. Litter with lower initial N and P levels accumulated more N and P than did that with higher initial levels.																			0277-5212					JUN	1991	11	1					1	16		10.1007/BF03160837	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF03160837													WOS:A1991FT72300001

Existing paleoclimate records contain conflicting evidence for the timing of summer monsoon advance into this region: an early arrival pre-Younger Dryas or a late arrival at the beginning of the Holocene. A 30-kyr-long leaf wax hydrogen isotope (n-alkanoic acid, delta H-2(wax)) record from Lake Qinghai helps to address this discrepancy by elucidating changes in the three main moisture sources in this region: southerly (summer monsoon), northwesterly, and local precipitation. Lake Qinghai delta H-2(wax) indicates that the arid glacial period was dominated by northwesterly moisture. Extremely arid conditions prevailed from 15 to 14 ka, likely because westerly winds were weakening and the summer monsoon had not yet reached this region. This arid period ended by 13.6 ka when small amounts of summer monsoon precipitation reached Lake Qinghai. Summer monsoon moisture subsequently retreated off of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau during the Younger Dryas and re-advanced in the early Holocene. Summer monsoon precipitation decreased progressively throughout the Holocene in response to decreasing summer insolation, and the modern northwesterly- and local-dominated moisture regime was attained ca. 2.6 ka. Lake Qinghai delta H-2(wax) demonstrates that the summer monsoon extent was dynamic during the past 30 kyr, responding dramatically to insolation and North Atlantic circulation changes. Moreover, Lake Qinghai delta H-2(wax) demonstrates that local and northwesterly air masses are important moisture sources to the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, and should be considered when reconstructing past hydroclimate in this region.

Decrease in CO2 efflux from northern hardwater lakes with increasing atmospheric warming	NATURE												Boreal lakes are biogeochemical hotspots that alter carbon fluxes by sequestering particulate organic carbon in sediments(1,2) and by oxidizing terrestrial dissolved organic matter to carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane through microbial processes(3,4). At present, such dilute lakes release similar to 1.4 petagrams of carbon annually to the atmosphere(3,4), and this carbon efflux may increase in the future in response to elevated temperatures(5) and increased hydrological delivery of mineralizable dissolved organic matter to lakes(6,7). Much less is known about the potential effects of climate changes on carbon fluxes from carbonate-rich hardwater and saline lakes that account for about 20 per cent of inland water surface area(4,8). Here we show that atmospheric warming may reduce CO2 emissions from hardwater lakes. We analyse decadal records of meteorological variability, CO2 fluxes and water chemistry to investigate the processes affecting variations in pH and carbon exchange(9,10) in hydrologically diverse lakes of central North America. We find that the lakes have shifted progressively from being substantial CO2 sources in the mid-1990s to sequestering CO2 by 2010, with a steady increase in annual mean pH. We attribute the observed changes in pH and CO2 uptake to an atmospheric-warming induced decline in ice cover in spring that decreases CO2 accumulation under ice, increases spring and summer pH, and enhances the chemical uptake of CO2 in hardwater lakes. Our study suggests that rising temperatures do not invariably increase CO2 emissions from aquatic ecosystems.					; Simpson, Gavin/KFQ-1110-2024; Leavitt, Peter/A-1048-2013	Tutolo, Benjamin/0000-0002-3047-8828; Simpson, Gavin/0000-0002-9084-8413; Wissel, Bjoern/0000-0001-6312-149X; Leavitt, Peter/0000-0001-9805-9307													0028-0836	1476-4687				MAR 12	2015	519	7542					215	218		10.1038/nature14172	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14172								25731167					WOS:000350770500035

Observations of Phytoplankton Community Composition in the Santa Barbara Channel During the Thomas Fire	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												The Thomas Fire ignited on December 5, 2017 and burned nearly 300,000 acres of land in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties until January 12, 2018, making it the largest wildfire in California history at the time. During the fire, a persistent plume of ash, smoke, and soot extended up to 1,000 km offshore over the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC). The effect of this ash influx on the SBC phytoplankton community was investigated with an Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) onboard R/V Sally Ride during a research cruise in mid-December 2017. Over 100,000 images of phytoplankton and nonliving particles were collected and each image was manually classified, resulting in time series of phytoplankton cells and detrital particles, including ash. Comparing the Thomas Fire conditions to historical monthly sampling in the SBC in December reveals significant differences in sea surface temperature, nutrient concentration, and phytoplankton community composition (PCC) in December 2017. During the Thomas Fire, dinoflagellates dominated the phytoplankton community (comprising up to 90% of the total phytoplankton cell biovolume per sample), while diatoms and picophytoplankton typically dominate surface ocean PCC in the SBC in December. While this study was not able to demonstrate a correlational relationship between PCC and wildfire ash concentration, the significant differences in surface ocean biogeochemistry in December 2017 compared to past winters is notable. Wildfire severity and frequency are annually increasing in California and globally with unknown impacts on the marine ecosystem; thus, this study provides an important baseline assessment for the SBC. Plain Language Summary This work describes marine phytoplankton community composition (PCC) during a wildfire. This work was conducted as part of a previously planned cruise onboard R/V Sally Ride in December 2017, which enabled us to sample PCC in the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC) during the Thomas Fire. The Thomas Fire was the largest wildfire in California history at the time, although it has since been surpassed by the Mendocino Fire complex in summer 2018 and five separate wildfires in summer 2020. This work was conducted using an Imaging FlowCytobot to quantify and characterize PCC and describe ash and detrital particle concentrations during the fire. We found that the phytoplankton community during the Thomas Fire was dominated by dinoflagellates (up to 90% of biomass), while the phytoplankton community in winter in the SBC is typically composed of diatoms or picophytoplankton. While we are not able to show a causal relationship between the Thomas Fire and PCC with the data collected on this cruise, we use time series data to show that December 2017 was significantly different from historical winters in the SBC. Warmer sea surface temperatures and a negative North Pacific Gyre Oscillation may have contributed to conditions that were favorable for dinoflagellates. Wildfire severity and frequency are expected to increase worldwide-this study provides a baseline for the impacts of wildfires in the SBC.					; Fischer, Alexis/M-4531-2019	Bisson, Kelsey/0000-0003-4230-3467; Kramer, Sasha/0000-0002-9944-6779; Fischer, Alexis/0000-0002-8028-487X; 													2169-9275	2169-9291				DEC	2020	125	12							e2020JC016851	10.1029/2020JC016851	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JC016851													WOS:000603643300013

Periodic pH depression occurs in the lakes during spring snowmelt and infrequent, intense summer rains. The lakes contained many crustaceans and rotifers known or suspected to be acid intolerant, such as Daphnia rosea, Daphnia middendorffiana, Diaptomus signicauda, Conochilus unicornis, and Polyarthra vulgaris. Macrocyclops albidus, Bosmina longirostris and Diaptomus signicauda were the crustaceans most frequently encountered during snowmelt, while Polyarthra vulgaris, Keratella quadrata and Keratella taurocephala were the most frequently encountered rotifers. In several lakes, the zooplankton was numerically dominated by known acid resistant species during snowmelt (e.g. B. longirostris and H. gibberum). Daphnia rosea was found during snowmelt only three times during the entire study. Seasonal variation in species richness occurred in some of the lakes. No long term trends in species richness were observed.																			0003-9136					MAR	1995	133	1					1	21																WOS:A1995QV65300002

Biodiversity of Flora and Fauna in Alpine Waters	ALPINE WATERS	Handbook of Environmental Chemistry Series											The study of Alpine aquatic environments began in the early 19th century, but only since the early 1990s has scientific interest intensified on these systems. The goal of this chapter is to summarize the community patterns of algae, zoobenthos, and fish that occur in Alpine freshwaters. Benthic algae in Alpine waters are differentiated among particular regions of the Alps in relation to geology, stream origin, and anthropogenic activity. Because of their dominance, the diatoms are the most widely studied algae in Alpine waters. By possessing various morphological structures and physiological traits, most stream insects are adapted to the dynamic and cold aquatic habitat of alpine landscapes. Aquatic insects comprise a substantial proportion of the zoobenthos in surface waters, with Chironomidae being most common. Seasonality is a common feature of macroinvertebrate assemblages in glacial streams in the Swiss Alps. Two evolutionarily successful strategies in glacial streams are adaptation to unstable stream conditions during summer (summer species) or avoidance of these conditions (winter species). Only a few native fishes are able to colonize and inhabit Alpine waters. Over the last decades, non-native, cold stenothermic species have established self-reproducing populations and appear well-adapted to the harsh environmental conditions in the Alps. The indigenous brown trout (Salmo trutta fario L.) is the most important fish in alpine running waters. Glacier retreat has accelerated globally, increasing the probability that fundamental ecological changes will. occur in alpine landscapes, in particular the ecology of running and standing waters.																			1433-6863		978-3-540-88274-9				2010	6						193	223		10.1007/978-3-540-88275-6_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-88275-6_10	10.1007/978-3-540-88275-6												WOS:000274168300010

Sequences of 586 bp length of the partial region of 18S and ITS-1 ribosomal DNA from cercariae were obtained. They were compared with extant GenBank sequences of Trichobilharzia. Accordingly, the ocellate furcocercariae were identified as belonging to the species Trichobilharzia franki Muller and Kimmig, 1994. Sequences of the 18S (712 bp) and ITS-2 (218 bp) rDNA gene of snails belonging to the family Lymnaeidae collected in the study area have allowed detection of this bird schistosome in Italy in Radix auricularia. The prevalence of the schistosome infection in snails was P = 9.6%. The reduction in habitat disturbance at the lake, as a result of its recent dedication as a nature reserve, has enhanced bird species abundance and richness. This has favoured the establishment of the life cycle of T. franki in the study area.

The Relationship between Age-0 Walleye Density and Adult Year-Class Strength across Northern Wisconsin	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Walleyes Sander vitreus are an important cultural and economic resource in northern Wisconsin, both as a recreational fishery and a tribal subsistence fishery. Understanding the recruitment of age-0 walleyes to the adult population could be of great utility in effectively managing harvest and informing stocking efforts in this mixed-use fishery. Our objective was to determine the relationship between abundance of age-0 walleyes in the fall and the subsequent adult year-class 4 years later and to explain additional residual variation related to environmental variables. Since 1986, fall electrofishing surveys have been conducted to estimate the densities of age-0 walleyes and spring mark-recapture surveys to estimate spawning adult walleyes. We fit a gamma stock-recruitment curve to a data set of 104 paired surveys (age-0 survey with adult survey conducted 4 years later) on 58 lakes and attempted to explain residual variation related to additional environmental variables. Our analysis suggests that the maximum number of age-4 fish (3.36/ha) is not produced by the maximum number of age-0 fish but by a somewhat intermediate density (243/ha) and that this relationship varies with the complexity of the shoreline. This density-dependent relationship should help managers refine models forecasting walleye abundance, as well as optimize stocking rates.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2012	32	4					663	670		10.1080/02755947.2012.690823	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2012.690823													WOS:000306460000006

Nevertheless, critical knowledge gaps persist regarding the spatial heterogeneity of GHG production potentials, their environmental determinants, and microbial regulatory mechanisms within such large-scale water transfer infrastructures. Through systematic sampling (132 water samples from 44 sites across seasons) along the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (MR-SNWDP) - the world's longest artificial water conveyance system - we quantified methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) production potentials using microbial taxonomic profiling coupled with abundance normalization. Our analyses revealed striking longitudinal gradients: upstream segments exhibited 60 %-460 % higher N2O production potential than downstream reaches, whereas CH4 production potential showed an inverse pattern with 120 %-310 % elevation in downstream zones. Multivariate analysis identified carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio displayed a positive correlation with CH4 production potential (Spearman's rho = 0.68, p < 0.01) but a negative association with N2O generation (rho = -0.54, p < 0.05). The variations of potentials could be clarified by the architecture of networks that altered along the water diversion canal in different seasons. The proportions of negative correlations between denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) and nitrification for N2O production increased from upstream to downstream. The positive interactions of O/R values charactering the relationships among functional groups involving CH4 production and N metabolism enhanced simultaneously. Thus, elevated C/N ratio suppressed N2O production via intensified competitive interactions among nitrifying and denitrifying taxa, while facilitating CH4 accumulation through enhanced mutualistic relationships between methanogens and N-cycling bacteria across summer, autumn and spring based on network analysis. These findings establish a dual regulatory role of C/N ratio in GHG production: directly modulating substrate availability for microbial metabolisms, and indirectly restructuring microbial interaction networks. The identified trade-off mechanism between N2O and CH4 production provides a scientific basis for optimizing water quality management strategies to mitigate GHG emissions in mega-scale water transfer projects.

The study took place prior to the invasion of the zebra mussel and exotic fish species such as the round goby and the ruffe, which have subsequently altered the habitat. Twenty-six fish species were captured by electrofishing. These species included five species which were not known to occur in Illinois waters of Lake Michigan; they were: white perch, quillback carpsucker, longear sunfish, black crappie, and the freshwater drum. Seventeen species were caught by sport fishermen. One of these species, the channel catfish, was never previously caught by fishermen or other sampling techniques in the Illinois waters of Lake Michigan. The abundant species were alewife, carp, gizzard shad, golden shiner, and yellow perch. Other species included largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, rock bass, bluegill, pumpkinseed, green sunfish, black bullhead, and white sucker. Chinook salmon, coho salmon, brown trout, rainbow trout, and a single lake trout were caught during the fall months. Yellow perch was the primary sport fish caught, and rainbow smelt was caught by gillnets in spring.																			0270-5060					DEC	1996	11	4					469	474		10.1080/02705060.1996.9664475	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1996.9664475													WOS:A1996VV56500011

The PCB and PBB mixtures caused induction of hepatic microsomal benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase (AHH), 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase (7-EC) and 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (ERF) activities but not benzphetamine N-demethylase (BND), epoxide hydrolase (EH) or glutathione S-transferase (GSH-T) activities. This induction pattern was typical of that caused by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in fish and mammals or by tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in mammals. The extent of induction of AHH-activity and cytochrome P-450 content was higher when experiments were carried out in summer (water temperature 25 .+-. 4.degree. C) than in winter (water temperature 11 .+-. 3.degree. C). Firemaster FF1 (15 mg/kg) induced fish for at least 56 days in summer and winter at which time the liver concentrations of PBB were in the ppm range. PCB concentrations in the ppm range were found in fish from polluted lakes and seas and environmental exposure to PCB is sufficient to induce hepatic mixed function oxidase (MFO) activities. The PCB isomer 3,3'',4,4'',5,5''-HCB, which induced the same spectrum of hepatic drug-metabolizing activities as TCDD and PAH in rats had a similar effect in the sheepshead. Another purified isomer, 2,2'',4,4'',5,5''-HBB, which induced the same enzymes as PB in rats, had no effect on drug-metabolizing activities in sheepshead. PB was also without effect on sheepshead hepatic drug- metabolizing enzymes, although a typical narcotic effect was produced in PB-treated sheepshead. Drug-metabolizing activities in fish liver were induced by chemicals like TCDD or PAH but induction after treatment of sheepshead with inducers of the PB type was not demonstrated.

These proliferations modify the global quality of the water resources and the Algal Organic Matter (AOM) produced by the algae and the cyanobacteria impacts the content and the characteristics of the Natural Organic Matter (NOM). However, none study deals with the sustainable influence of the recurrent seasonal blooms of phytoplankton on the chemical quality of the water resources. The physico-chemical, chemical and biological quality of a water resource and more specifically the content and the characteristics of the NOM were thus in situ monitored in a eutrophic pond in 2017-2018 and compared to the characteristics observed in 2012-2013. The blooms of phytoplankton were more important in 2017-2018 and the increase of both the temperature of the air and the radiance promoted the domination of cyanobacteria. None significant evolution of the content in chlorophyll-a, the concentrations in nutrients and the pH was observed between 2012-2013 and 2017-2018. However, the concentrations in DOC increased, more in summer periods than winter, because of the production of AOM by the algae and the cyanobacteria and the NOM presented more hydrophilic and less aromatic characters. These evolutions of the characteristics of the NOM were more important in 2017-2018 than 2012-2013. The recurrent inputs of AOM every year in summer periods seemed thus to sustainably modify the intrinsic characteristics of the NOM.

In the spring of 2000, the forest was hydrologically restored by notching an artificial levee that had separated the Olentangy River and its floodplain forest for 100 years. One-hundred flat sediment traps (30cm x 30cm) were used to collect sediment samples during spring/summer flooding events from 2003 to 2005. Results showed that sediment deposition is determined by 2 the landscape variability during flooding events, Net sediment deposit in the wettest area averaged 134 +/- 12 g-dry wt m(-2) in 2003, 127 +/- 17 g-dry wt m(-2) in 2004 and 149 +/- 23 g-dry wt m(-2) in 2005. Total N and C sedimentation ranged from 0.49 to 0.92 g-N m(-2) and 5.2 to 19.9 g-C m(-2). Fe dominates the sediment chemistry and results show the elemental abundance in the order of Al > Fe > Ca > K > Mg > S > P > Na > Mn > Zn > B > Cu > Mo. A hydrologic pulsing index (HPI) could be used as an indicator for mass changes of energies with hydrologic pulsing events. Restoration of seasonally flooded bottomland forests could stimulate potentially large nutrient and Fe releases, which would eventually lead to an enhanced forest productivity and biodiversity.

J	Hawes, I; Howard-Williams, C; Sorrell, B				Hawes, Ian; Howard-Williams, Clive; Sorrell, Brian			Decadal timescale variability in ecosystem properties in the ponds of the McMurdo Ice Shelf, southern Victoria Land, Antarctica	ANTARCTIC SCIENCE												Meltwater ponds are important biodiversity elements in continental Antarctica. Many occupy closed basins and are vulnerable to changes in the balance between water accrual, through melting of ice and snow, and water loss by ablation and evaporation. We use a two-decade long record of ponds on the McMurdo Ice Shelf to assess temporal variability in key limnological variables. Ponds underwent many-fold change in biologically conservative variables, such as conductivity, and changes were similar in ponds from different catchments but of comparable area. In contrast, biologically active variables (pH, inorganic nutrients and planktonic/benthic biomass) are buffered by in-pond processes and show consistency between years and no coherence across catchments. Coherent behaviour across catchments implies an overarching, climatic effect. However, we could identify no signature of summer air temperature or irradiance in pond dynamics, although winter snow deposition may leave a legacy of low conductivity to the following summer. While ponds are clearly affected by climate, our data show that ecosystem responses are complex and highlight the need for system-appropriate, long-term observation if directional environmental change is to be separated from inherent variability in systems that respond to multiple climatic variables and which have significant biological buffering capacity.

INTRODUCTION	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												In 2019, the dominant greenhouse gases released into Earth's atmosphere continued to increase. The annual global average carbon dioxide concentration at Earth's surface was 409.8 +/- 0.1 ppm, an increase of 2.5 +/- 0.1 ppm over 2018, and the highest in the modern instrumental record and in ice core records dating back 800 000 years. Combined, greenhouse gases and several halogenated gases contributed 3.14 W m(-2) to radiative forcing, representing a 45% increase since 1990. Carbon dioxide is responsible for about 65% of this radiative forcing. The annual net global uptake of similar to 2.4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide by oceans was the highest in the record dating to 1982 and 33% higher than the 1997-2017 average. A weak El Nino at the beginning of 2019 transitioned to ENSO-neutral conditions by mid-year. Even so, the annual global surface temperature across land and oceans was still among the three highest in records dating to the mid-to late 1800s. July 2019 was Earth's hottest month on record. Well over a dozen countries across Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Caribbean reported record high annual temperatures. In North America, Alaska experienced its warmest year on record, while the high northern latitudes that encompass the Arctic were second warmest, behind only 2016. Stations in several countries, including Vietnam, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, set new all-time daily high temperature records for their nations. Australia set a new nationally averaged daily maximum temperature record of 41.9 degrees C on 18 December, breaking the previous record set in 2013 by 1.6 degrees C. Daily temperatures surpassed 40 degrees C for the first time in Belgium and the Netherlands. Lake temperatures increased on average across the globe in 2019; observed lakes in the Northern Hemisphere were covered in ice seven days fewer than the 1981-2010 average, according to phenological indicators. Over land, the growing season was an average of eight days longer than the 2000-10 average in the NH. Above Earth's surface, the annual lower troposphere temperature was third highest to record high, and the lower stratosphere temperature was third lowest to record low, depending on the dataset analyzed. Middle- and upper-stratospheric temperatures were lowest on record since satellite records began in 1979. In September, Antarctica experienced a dramatic upper-atmosphere warming event that led to the smallest ozone hole since the early 1980s. Below-average Antarctic sea ice extent persisted throughout 2019, continuing a trend that began in September 2016. Net sea ice extent was below the 1981-2010 average for all days of the year, and January and June each set a new low monthly mean sea ice extent record. The Antarctic ice sheet continued to lose mass, with the highest rates of loss occurring in West Antarctica and Wilkes Land, East Antarctica. Across the cryosphere, alpine glaciers continued to lose mass for the 32nd consecutive year. Permafrost temperatures in the European Alps were slightly below the record temperatures measured in 2015, while record high permafrost temperatures were observed at a majority of the observation sites across the high northern latitudes. For the first time in the observational record at 26 sites in interior Alaska and the Seward Peninsula, the active layer did not freeze completely, a result of long-term permafrost warming and back-to-back relatively mild and snowy winters. In March, when Arctic sea ice reached its annual maximum extent, thin, first-year ice comprised similar to 77% of all ice, compared to about 55% in the 1980s. In September, the minimum sea ice extent tied for the second smallest extent in the 41-year satellite record. In the Bering Sea, increasing ocean temperatures and reduced sea ice-which was the lowest on record there for the second consecutive winter-are leading to shifts in fish distributions within some of the most valuable fisheries in the world. Larger and more abundant boreal species, as opposed to smaller and less abundant Arctic species, dominated a large portion of the Arctic shelf in 2018 and 2019. During the 2019 melt season, the extent and magnitude of ice loss over the Greenland ice sheet rivaled 2012, the previous year of record ice loss. Melting of glaciers and ice sheets, along with warming oceans, account for the trend in rising global mean sea level. In 2019, global mean sea level set a new record for the eighth consecutive year, reaching 87.6 mm above the 1993 average when satellite measurements began, with an annual average increase of 6.1 mm from 2018. Ocean heat content measured to 700 m depth was record high, and the globally averaged sea surface temperature was the second highest on record, surpassed only by the record El Nino year of 2016. In October, the Indian Ocean dipole exhibited its greatest magnitude since 1997, associated with dramatic upper ocean warming in the western Indian Ocean basin. While ENSO conditions during 2019 appeared to have limited impacts, many climate events were influenced by the strong positive IOD, which contributed to a large rainfall deficit from the eastern Indian Ocean to the South Pacific Ocean east of Australia. Record heat and dryness in Australia intensified drought conditions already in place following below-average rainfall in 2017 and 2018, leading to severe impacts during late austral spring and summer, including catastrophic wildfires. Smoke from these wildfires, along with the volcanic eruptions of Raikoke (Russia) and Ulawun (Papua New Guinea), helped load the stratosphere with aerosol levels unprecedented since the post-Mt. Pinatubo era of the early 1990s. Indonesia also suffered severe drought and extreme wildfires toward the end of 2019; no rainfall was observed in the East Sumba District of the East Nusa Tenggara Province for 263 days. Conversely, the positive IOD also contributed to excess rainfall over the Horn of Africa from August through December, resulting in widespread flooding across East Africa. Elsewhere, India experienced one of its heaviest summer monsoon rains since 1995 despite a delayed and suppressed monsoon during June. In the United States, rapid snowmelt in the spring, as well as heavy and frequent precipitation in the first half of the year, contributed to extensive flooding in the Midwest throughout spring and summer, notably the Mississippi and Missouri basins. Dry conditions persisted over large parts of western South Africa, in some locations having continued for approximately seven years. Antecedent dry conditions and extreme summer heat waves pushed most of Europe into extreme drought. Due in part to precipitation deficits during December 2018 to January 2019-the peak of the rainy season-wildfires scorched vast areas of the southern Amazonian forests in Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru, as well as in northern Paraguay, later in 2019. Millions of trees and animals perished, with some local extinctions reported. In Siberia, fire activity during the summer was both strong and farther north than usual. This led to a new record of 27 teragrams (10(12) g) of carbon emitted from fires in the Arctic, which was more than twice as high than in any preceding year. Closer to the equator, 96 named tropical storms were observed during the Northern and Southern Hemisphere storm seasons, well above the 1981-2010 average of 82. Five tropical cyclones reached Saffir-Simpson scale Category 5 intensity. In the North Atlantic basin, Hurricane Dorian caused unprecedented and tremendous devastation, with over 70 fatalities and damages totaling $3.4 billion (U.S. dollars) in The Bahamas. Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth severely impacted southeastern Africa in March and April, respectively. Idai resulted in total damages of at least $2.2 billion (U.S. dollars), the costliest storm on record for the South Indian Ocean basin, as well as the deadliest with over 1200 fatalities across Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Madagascar.

The objective was to investigate the role of weather conditions and lake hydrology in regulating the development of Cyclotella and Fragilaria functional species groups. The different responses of the two species to the environmental variability and their reciprocal relationships were considered. Cyclotella showed a weak relationship with the selected environmental variables and its seasonal development was difficult to interpret, also in relation to its opportunistic behaviour. On the contrary, Fragilaria complex showed a prompt response to environmental variability and its seasonal development appeared to be mainly regulated by hydrological conditions, through nitrate nitrogen and, secondarily, by silica concentrations. Water temperature and thermal stability affected only Fragilaria species, while different nutrient requirements allowed Cyclotella species to grow under conditions of limited resources for Fragilaria. Since Lake Tovel has scarce internal nutrient reserves and its hydrology is strongly affected by precipitation both in winter and summer, diatom phenology seems to be indirectly regulated by weather conditions.

During the wintering season, it is home to various rare and endangered species with abundant plant resources. However, extensive disturbances from both global climate change and human activities, such as the construction of hydroelectric dams, have exerted severe impacts on the hydrological regime and the vegetation dynamics in this region. To evaluate the suitability of the habitat for wintering waterfowl, it is necessary to monitor the spatio-temporal changes of vegetation over the protected wetland, and explore the potential environmental driving factors of the changes during the past decades. In this study, the time-series MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data from 2000 to 2018, were used to analyze the seasonal dynamics and interannual tendencies of vegetation coverage over the wintering period from October to January. The results showed that the largest monthly mean EVI generally occurred in November, and was related to the quantity of wintering waterfowl in Poyang Lake wetland. The mean EVI in November had a lagged response to both temperature and accumulated precipitation. Long-term trend analysis revealed that the average EVI of the reserve increased significantly in the winters since the new millennium. Over the past 18 years, the hydrological regime, particularly the water area, is recognized as the dominant environmental factor determining the interannual variation of EVI. From 2010 onwards there was also an increasing influence of temperature. These analyses would help in the creation of appropriate management strategies to protect the habitat of wintering waterfowl in Poyang Lake wetland. (C) 2020 The Authors.

This study combined hydroacoustic surveys, spatial autocorrelation analysis (Moran's I), and generalized additive models (GAMs) to investigate seasonal and spatial fish distribution, aggregation characteristics, and regulatory mechanisms in China's Zhelin Reservoir. The results reveal pronounced seasonal fluctuations, with summer fish density peaking at 13.70 +/- 0.91 ind./1000 m(3) and declining to 1.95 +/- 0.13 ind./1000 m(3) in winter. Spatial heterogeneity was evident, with the Xiuhe region sustaining the highest density (15.69 +/- 1.09 ind./1000 m(3)) and persistent hotspots in upstream bays. Transient high-density clusters (90-99% confidence) near the Zhelin Dam during summer suggested thermal or hydrodynamic disturbances. GAM analysis (R(2)adj = 0.712, 78.5% deviance explained) identified seasonal transitions (12.26% variance), water depth (16.54%), conductivity (13.75%), and dissolved oxygen (13.29%) as dominant drivers, with nonlinear responses to depth and bimodal patterns for conductivity/oxygen. These findings demonstrate that hydrological seasonality and habitat heterogeneity jointly govern fish aggregation, underscoring the ecological priority of Xiuhe and upstream bays as core habitats. This study provides a mechanistic framework for guiding reservoir management, including targeted conservation, dam operation adjustments to mitigate hydrodynamic impacts, and integrated strategies for balancing hydrological and ecological needs in similar ecosystems.																			2076-2615					APR 7	2025	15	7							1068	10.3390/ani15071068	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani15071068								40218461					WOS:001464812700001

Spring-migration Ecology of Northern Pintails in South-central Nebraska	WATERBIRDS												Spring-migration ecology of staging Northern Pintails, Anus acuta, was investigated in south-central Nebraska, USA. Habitat associations, local movements, settling patterns, arrival dates, residency times and survival were estimated from 71 radiomarked pintails during spring 2001, 2003 and 2004, and diet determined from 130 females collected during spring 1998 and 1999. Seventy-two percent of pintail diurnal locations were in palustrine wetlands, 7% in riverine wetlands, 3% in lacustrine wetlands, 6% in municipal sewage lagoons and irrigation reuse pits and 10.5% in croplands. Emergent wetlands with hemi-marsh conditions were used diurnally more often than wetlands with either open or closed vegetation structures. Evening foraging flights averaged 4.3 km (SE = 0.6) and 72% were to cornfields. In accord with these findings, 87% of 93 pintails collected during spring 1998 and 1999 returning to evening roosts consumed corn, which represented 84% dry mass of all foods. Pintails collected on non-cropped wetlands ingested invertebrates and seeds from wetland plants more frequently than birds returning to roost. Radiomarked pintails arrived in Nebraska on 7 March 2003 and 18 February 2004; average arrival date was six days earlier during 2004 compared to 2003. Residency time for individuals varied greatly (1-40 days) yet yearly means were similar and averaged 9.5 clays within the region. No mortality was detected for 71 birds monitored over 829 exposure days. Conservation planners linking population dynamics and habitat conditions at spring-staging areas need to focus on pintail body condition during spring and its connection with reproductive success and survival during the breeding season.

J	Elliott, JM				Elliott, JM			Periodic habitat loss alters the competitive coexistence between brown trout and bullheads in a small stream over 34 years	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Changes in the population density of juvenile sea trout Salmo trutta L. and bullheads Cottus gobio L. were compared in a small stream over 34 years. Both species have a similar diet and obviously live in the same general habitat. Habitat loss was most marked in seven summer droughts: severest in 1976, 1983, 1984, 1995, and less severe but followed by autumn droughts in 1969, 1989 and 1993. The contrasting effects of habitat loss on the two species were examined. 2. For both species, the Ricker curvilinear model significantly fit (P < 0.001) the relationship between initial egg density and survivor density for successive life stages, even though egg densities were much lower for bullheads than trout. These analyses provided evidence for density-dependent population regulation and also identified extreme outliers, most being for year-classes affected by summer droughts. 3. The variable effects of changes in habitable area (= % wettable area in sampling section) were quantified by using the residuals, each residual being the absolute value expressed as a percentage of the expected value from the Ricker curve. Significant relationships between the residuals and habitable area showed that habitat loss had a marked effect on survivor density, this being negative for 0+ and 1+ trout, and positive for 0+, 1+ and 2+/3+ bullheads. 4. Therefore, during periods of habitat loss in the summer months, bullhead density increased at the expense of trout density. Low flows and a decrease in wettable area were associated with a marked reduction in habitat quality for drift-feeding trout and an increase in habitat quality, and perhaps also quantity, for benthic-feeding bullheads. This case study shows that, during a major perturbation, the relationship between the densities of two species can change markedly in favour of the less numerous species. The competitive coexistence between the two species is therefore a dynamic process that changes through time with periodic changes in the environment.																			0021-8790	1365-2656				JAN	2006	75	1					54	63		10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.01022.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.01022.x								16903043					WOS:000235043700006

Atmospheric organochlorine pesticide concentrations near the Great Lakes: Temporal and spatial trends	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												As a part of the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network, atmospheric organochlorine pesticide concentrations were measured in both the gas and particle phases at seven sites near the Great Lakes. Much higher organochlorine pesticide concentrations were found in the gas phase compared to that in the particle phase. Longterm decreasing trends were observed for most pesticides in both phases. Two different seasonal trends were observed in the particle phase: (a) in-use pesticides, such as endosulfan, showed higher concentrations in the summer, a time corresponding to their agriculture use, and (b) restricted organochlorine pesticides, such as lindane, showed higher particle-phase concentrations in the winter, presumably due to their enhanced partitioning from the gas phase to particles. Generally, Chicago had the highest concentrations of chlordanes, dieldrin, and Sigma DDT, suggesting that urban areas could be sources of these compounds to atmosphere. Point Petre had the highest concentrations of endosulfan, likely due to its agricultural application in Southern Ontario.																			0013-936X					NOV 1	2006	40	21					6587	6593		10.1021/es060858+	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es060858+								17144282					WOS:000241628800017

In contrast, the microbial diversity of cold sulfur springs remains largely unrecognized. Culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches were used to study the diversity of sulfur-oxidizing bacterial communities in two cold sulfur springs in Slovakia. Geological conditions and resulting spring water chemistry appear to be major factors influencing the composition of the sulfur-oxidizing bacterial community. Bacterial communities in both springs were found to be dominated by Proteobacteria with Epsilonproteobacteria being prevalent in the high-salinity Stankovany spring and Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria in the low-salinity Jovsa spring. Limited overlap was found between culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches with multiple taxa of cultivated sulfur-oxidizing bacteria not being detected by the culture-independent metagenomics approach. Moreover, four cultivated bacterial isolates could represent novel taxa based on the low similarity of their 16S rRNA gene sequence (similarity lower than 98%) to sequences of known bacteria. Our study supports the current view that multiple approaches are required to assess the bacterial diversity in natural habitats and indicates that sulfur springs in Slovakia harbor unique, yet-undescribed microorganisms.					; Piknova, Maria/AAC-8682-2019; Kiskova, Jana/R-6381-2016; Pristas, Peter/K-7512-2016	Pristas, Peter/0000-0002-7948-2617; Kolesar Fecskeova, Livia/0000-0002-0752-2173; Piknova, Maria/0000-0003-2822-7605; , Jana/0000-0002-0753-9231; Nosalova, Lea/0000-0001-6498-0640; 													0343-8651	1432-0991				MAY	2023	80	5							145	10.1007/s00284-023-03251-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-023-03251-x								36949342					WOS:000952232200001

A total of 2.7 x 10(6) walleye fingerlings and 1.7 x 10(5) northern pike fingerlings were stocked during 1987-99 in eutrophic Lake Mendota. The objectives of the biomanipulation were to improve sport fishing and to increase piscivory to levels that would reduce planktivore biomass, increase Daphnia grazing and ultimately reduce algal densities in the lake. The combined biomass of the two piscivore species in the lake increased rapidly from <1 kg ha(-1) and stabilised at 4-6 kg ha(-1) throughout the evaluation period. 2. Restrictive harvest regulations (i.e. increase in minimum size limit and reduction in bag limit) were implemented in 1988 to protect the stocked piscivores. Further restrictions were added in 1991 and 1996 for walleye and northern pike, respectively. These restrictions were essential because fishing pressure on both species (especially walleye) increased dramatically during biomanipulation. 3. Commencing in 1987 with a massive natural die-off of cisco and declining yellow perch populations, total planktivore biomass dropped from about 300-600 kg ha(-1) prior to the die-off and the fish stocking, to about 20-40 kg ha(-1) in subsequent years. These low planktivore biomasses lasted until a resurgence in the perch population in 1999. 4. During the period prior to biomanipulation when cisco were very abundant, the dominant Daphnia species was the smaller-bodied D. galeata mendotae, which usually reached a biomass maximum in June and then crashed shortly thereafter. Beginning in 1988, the larger-bodied D. pulicaria dominated, with relatively high biomasses occurring earlier in the spring and lasting well past mid-summer of many years. 5. In many years dominated by D. pulicaria, Secchi disc readings were greater during the spring and summer months when compared with years dominated by D. galeata mendotae. During the biomanipulation evaluation period, phosphorus (P) levels also changed dramatically thus complicating our analysis. Earlier research on Lake Mendota had shown that Daphnia grazing increased summer Secchi disc readings, but P concentrations linked to agricultural and urban runoff and to climate-controlled internal mixing processes were also important factors affecting summer readings. 6. The Lake Mendota biomanipulation project has been a success given that high densities of the large-bodied D. pulicaria have continued to dominate for over a decade, and the diversity of fishing opportunities have improved for walleye, northern pike and, more recently, yellow perch. 7. Massive stocking coupled with very restrictive fishing regulations produced moderate increases in piscivore densities. Larger increases could be realised by more drastic restrictions on sport fishing, but these regulations would be very controversial to anglers. 8. If the lake's food web remains in a favourable biomanipulation state (i.e. high herbivory), further improvements in water clarity are possible with future reductions in P loadings from a recently initiated non-point pollution abatement programme in the lake's drainage basin.

J	Li, WB; Zhang, WC; Wang, YJ				Li, Wubiao; Zhang, Wenchao; Wang, Yujie			Holocene seasonal temperature reconstruction based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) records from different regions in China	HOLOCENE												The patterns of Holocene temperature change can provide important insight for understanding the recent global warming and assessing future global climate change. However, the mismatch in Holocene mean annual temperature between proxy records and climate models remains controversial, which is likely caused by potential seasonal bias from the geological records. Here, 64 surface sediment samples are analyzed to examine the seasonal bias of brGDGTs reconstruction. Subsequently, we compile 23 brGDGT-based seasonal and annual temperature records from different regions in China and compare them with the TraCE-21 ka simulation results in the same geographical location. The linearly analysis shows a higher correlation between MBT '(5me) and MAF (mean temperature of months above freezing) than that of MAT (mean annual air temperatures), suggesting the reconstructed temperature based on brGDGTs from aquatic sources may be biased toward MAF. The regionally stacked results indicate that MAF in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Northern China warmed from similar to 12 to 7 ka BP and then cooled thereafter, while an overall warming trend occurred in Southern China. These patterns of MAF change can be well reproduced by the model simulations. The summer and autumn temperature patterns during the Holocene in the Northern China are primarily driven by local insolation and modulated by ice sheets and greenhouse gas concentrations. The retreat of ice sheets in the early and middle Holocene, coupled with the increase in greenhouse gases, is considered the main driving factor for the long-term warming trend of the Holocene in southern China, whereas orbital-induced summer temperature change might be the major driving factor of MAF change in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Our results suggest that the patterns of seasonal temperature change are basically matched between proxy records and climate models during the Holocene.

J	MACKIE, GL				MACKIE, GL			BIOLOGY OF THE EXOTIC ZEBRA MUSSEL, DREISSENA-POLYMORPHA, IN RELATION TO NATIVE BIVALVES AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT IN LAKE ST-CLAIR	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is a new exotic species that was introduced into the Great Lakes as early as the fall of 1985. It differs markedly from native species of bivalves in its: (i) shell form; (ii) mode of life; (iii) reproductive potential; (iv) larval life cycle; (v) population dynamics; (vi) distribution, (vii) dispersal mechanisms; (viii) physiology; (ix) potential impact on the ecosystem; and (x) impact on society and the economy. In body form, it has an anterior umbone, a flat ventral surface with permanent aperature for the byssal apparatus and a shape that together make the animal well adapted for life on a hard surface. The shell has a zebra-stripe pattern, a heteromyarian muscle condition and lacks hinge teeth which make it easily identifiable from native bivalves. The zebra mussel is strongly byssate and has an epifaunal mode of life not seen in native bivalves. The species is dioecious and has external fertilization, the eggs developing into pelagic veligers which remains planktonic for approximately 4 weeks. Gametogenesis begins in late winter to early spring, veligers appear in the water column in late May to early June and disappear in mid to late October in Lake St. Clair. Adults live for about 2 years and have very rapid growth rates. Maximum shell lengths average 2.3 to 2.5 cm. Standing crops as high as 200 000 m-2 are present in the 1-m depths of the Ontario shores. Infestations may be interfering with the normal metabolism of native unionid clams and there is potential of the unionid clam populations being reduced or even eliminated from Lake St. Clair.																			0018-8158					JUL 26	1991	219						251	268		10.1007/BF00024759	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00024759													WOS:A1991GK03100017

In Lake Pyhajarvi, southwest Finland, profound changes have occurred in the commercial winter fisheries targeting the coregonids vendace, Coregonus albula, and whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus. The responses of vendace have been examined earlier, and here the detailed analyses are extended to the whitefish. In the 1970s and 1980s, the coregonid fishery was sustainable, but in 1991-1998, intense exploitation led to recruitment overfishing of vendace. Despite temporarily improved growth and recruitment of whitefish during vendace decline, whitefish population biomass declined throughout the study period, while perch (Perca fluviatilis), roach (Rutilus rutilus) and ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus) increased and vendace and smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) maintained their abundance. As many other northern lakes, Pyhajarvi seems to be changing from coregonid to perch dominance due to climate warming and eutrophication. Whitefish decline was associated with decreases in fecundity, winter survival of embryos, and larval density. The spawning stock was kept small by intensive fishery. The decline of the relative fecundity was likely due to food competition with vendace and especially the perch and roach populations that increased with eutrophication and more frequent hot summers. The winter survival of whitefish embryos decreased when the introduced signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) increased. Despite decreasing fishing effort in the 2000s the larval numbers continued to decline. In the prevailing circumstances in Pyhajarvi, whitefish will with high probability remain as a minor and still declining species of the fish assemblage.

Correlated bulk organic and biogenic silica proxy data demonstrated high-amplitude changes from 125 to 71 ka, suggesting that summer insolation directly influenced lake productivity during MIS 5. From 60 to 57 ka, hydrologic state changes and events occurred in California and the U.S. Southwest, though the pattern of response varied geographically. Intermediate, less variable levels of winter and summer insolation followed during MIS 3 (57-29 ka), which likely maintained moist conditions in Southern California that were punctuated with smaller order, millennial-scale events. These Dansgaard-Oeschger events brought enhanced surface temperatures (SSTs) to the eastern Pacific margin, and aridity to sensitive terrestrial sites in the Southwest and Southern California. Low temperatures and reduced evaporation are widespread during MIS 2, though there is increasing evidence for moisture extremes in Southern California from 29 to 20 ka. Our record shows that both orbital-scale radiative forcing and rapid North Atlantic temperature perturbations were likely influences on Southern California climate prior to the last glacial. However, these forcings produced a hydroclimatic response throughout California and the U.S. Southwest that was geographically complex. This work highlights that it is especially urgent to improve our understanding of the response to rapid climatic change in these regions. Enhanced temperature and aridity are projected for the rest of the 21st century, which will place stress on water resources. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, a modeling framework was developed to assess the response of environmental variables to climate change scenarios in Lake Taihu, China. A coupled hydrodynamic-water quality-sediment flux model was employed to simulate water quality processes under future climate scenarios projected from a general circulation model (GCM) forced by the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5). The results showed that the climate change impacted physico-chemical parameters and biological interactions in Lake Taihu. The annual average water temperature increased by 0.96, 2.09, and 3.2 degrees C by the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively. Daily temperature stratification tended to occur earlier and the period of stratification increased, especially in summer during calm wind conditions. The sediment flux increased and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration decreased with climate change. Additionally, climate change increased the onset time, duration, and areas of algal blooms. The results showed that the blooms activation time advanced approximately six days per decade. The onset time of algal blooms of 2080s was in February and March and the elevated concentration of chlorophyll a lasted until late autumn in the west lake region. The chlorophyll a concentration in summer did not increase substantially (about 10-15 mu g/L). Overall, water management strategies and ecological restoration plans in Lake Taihu, mainly based on nutrient load reduction and hydrodynamic modification, should incorporate anticipated effects of climate change.					; Jiang, Peng/L-7536-2018	Tang, Chunyan/0000-0002-6803-0914; 													0270-5060	2156-6941				JAN 2	2015	30	1			SI		59	73		10.1080/02705060.2014.999360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2014.999360													WOS:000349680600004

JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Resightings of uniquely marked birds from 2001 to 2008 were used to determine winter distributions of 4 breeding populations of a species at risk, the piping plover (Charadrius melodus). Although considerable overlap exists, a distinct pattern in winter distributions was evident. Birds originating from eastern Canada wintered farthest north compared to other populations. Most individuals from the United States Great Lakes were found in South Carolina and Georgia in winter, whereas birds from eastern Canada were found primarily in North Carolina. Although the great majority of birds marked in Prairie Canada were observed wintering in Texas, particularly southern Texas, breeding plovers from the United States Great Plains were more widely distributed on the gulf coast from Florida to Texas. Very few large-scale movements of individuals in winter were reported either within or between years. This study highlights the significance of geographic regions for eastern Canada, the United States Great Lakes, the United States Great Plains, and Prairie Canada populations, and demonstrates relatively high winter site fidelity. This information will help focus conservation efforts for specific breeding populations during the winter. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.

The stream network and wetland patches dispersed among the fields and wetland zones close to lake shores play a crucial role in transport and transformation of nutrient compounds before they eventually reach the lake ecosystems. The river Jorka watershed (area about 65 km(2), length of river about 15 km, discharge between 0.1 and 1.5 m(3) s(-1)) contains a typical fragment of lakeland area, with a highly mosaic structure. Precipitation, discharge in 11-17 small streams, nitrate-nitrogen and total phosphorus loading transported in streams, and changes in their concentration while passing through lakeshore wetland zones were studied over several years and seasons (vernal freshet, summer drought). There was no trend in seasonal and year-to-year changes of TP and N-NO3 concentration while transported with stream waters and no direct relation to discharge. The most frequent range of values of concentration for TP and N-NO3 were 0.08-0.5 and 0.1-0.8 mg l(-1), respectively. The export rates for both nutrients were higher in spring than in summer. The vernal freshet was found to be the most important hydrological event that stimulated the transport of phosphorus and nitrate-nitrogen in surface waters and sustained an adequate moisture condition in wetland zones to remove both nutrients transported with groundwaters. It was found that the concentration of both nutrients in that period significantly decreased towards the lakeshore, particularly in the case of nitrate-nitrogen. In the summer (drought period) there was a significant decrease of dissolved phosphorus but no change in the case of nitrate-nitrogen. The consequences of these phenomena for lake protection zones are emphasised. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Spatial changes in trace element and strontium isotope water chemistry in a temperate river system with application to sturgeon movement	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Understanding patterns in trace element concentrations and water quality within river systems provides a foundation to evaluate retrospective movements and habitat use of fish. Because trace elements are incorporated into calcified structures of fishes relative to water concentrations, baseline maps have application for fisheries management, including for rare species such as sturgeons. Therefore, trace elements [strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and magnesium (Mg)], strontium isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86), dissolved oxygen and salinity were measured in the Pearl River and Lake Pontchartrain watersheds, within Mississippi and Louisiana, USA for application in assessing riverine use by Gulf Sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi. Water samples were collected during the summer-fall period when juvenile Gulf Sturgeon were anticipated to be present and analyzed by solution and multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Trace element to calcium (Ca) ratios in Sr, Ba, Zn, and Mg were distinguishable between the upper Pearl River and the Bogue Chitto River tributary, and the upper Pearl River and lower Pearl River. For most trace elements and Sr-87/Sr-86, there was a gradual increase from upper river regions to lower river regions, and large differences between freshwater and saline areas. Lake Pontchartrain watershed rivers were not easily differentiated, but regions of low dissolved oxygen concentrations in the lower reaches suggest available Gulf Sturgeon habitat may be seasonally limited. Therefore, maps of water microchemistry in the Pearl River watershed allow for retrospective analyses of fish watershed use.

Our objectives were to measure site-specific degradation rates of labile dissolved and particulate organic matter, quantify the potential importance of bacteria in these processes, and examine the kinetics of degradation over time. Unfiltered samples, and samples treated to remove (or dilute out) particles larger than bacteria, were enclosed in 9-1 bottles and incubated in, the dark for 3-5 d. Respiration rates and inorganic compound accumulation rates were higher in summer than in winter and were highest in unfiltered surface samples at sites of intermediate salinities where phytoplankton were most abundant. The ratio of ammonium accumulation to oxygen removal in summer experiments suggested that the mineralized organic material resembled ''Redfield''' stoichiometry. Chemical fluxes were greater in bottles containing large (>1-3 mu m) particles than in the bottles with these particles removed, but bacterial activities were generally similar in both treatments. These results suggest that particle consumers were an important component of total organic matter degradation. However, these experiments may have underestimated natural bacterial degradation rates because the absence of light could affect the production of labile organic substrates by phytoplankton, In agreement, with this hypothesis, bacterial growth rates tended to decrease over time in summer in surface plume waters where phytoplankton were abundant. In conjunction with other data, our results indicate that heterotrophic processes in the water column are spatially and temporally dependent on phytoplankton production.

Sediments From a Seasonally Euxinic Coastal Ecosystem Show High Nitrogen Cycling Potential	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Coastal ecosystems are susceptible to eutrophication and deoxygenation, which may alter their nitrogen cycle dynamics. Here, we investigated the microbial nitrogen cycling potential in the sediment of a seasonally euxinic coastal ecosystem (Lake Grevelingen, NL) in winter and summer. Activity tests revealed ammonium (NH4+) oxidation potential with maximum potential rates up to 53 mu mol g-1 day-1, even in anoxic sediment layers. A nitrifying microbial community was present in both oxic and anoxic sediment sections (up to 1.4% relative abundance). Nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), and nitrous oxide (N2O) reduction potential were prominent across all sediment sections, with the highest potential rates (167 mu mol NO3-center dot g-1 day-1) in the surface sediment in summer. Denitrification (79.3%-98.4%) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA; 1.6%-20.7%) were the major NO3- removal pathways, as supported by the detection of the narG/napA, nirK/nirS, norB, nosZ and nrfA/otr genes in all sediment sections. The DNRA contribution increased with depth and with the addition of electron donors, such as monomethylamine. Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) was not detected in these eutrophic sediments. Combined, our results show that there is high potential for nitrogen removal in eutrophic coastal ecosystems, which may help further restoration measures.

Occurrence and distribution of six NNIs and a metabolite (desmethyl-acetamiprid) in surface water were investigated in the central Yangtze River, China at 20 sites from March to July and September 2015. Acetamiprid (ACE), imidacloprid (IMI) and thiamethoxam (THM) were the most frequently detected NNIs and IMI had a highest median concentration of 4.37 ng/L, followed by ACE (2.50 ng/L), THM (1.10 ng/L), nitenpyram (NTP; 0.34 ng/L), clothianidin (CLO; 0.10 ng/L), and thiacloprid (THCP; 0.02 ng/L). Significantly higher concentrations and detection frequencies of NNIs were observed in the summer than in the spring, which may be explained by the heavier precipitation in summer. Spatial variation with higher levels among the lower sites than the upper sites may be related with the agriculture land use. NNI contamination presented a low risk to aquatic life according to the risk quotient method, while IMI had potential risk to aquatic life according to the threshold of IMI (8.3 ng/L) in freshwater recommended in Netherland. Using the relative potency factors method for chronic cumulative risk assessment for NNIs, potential exposure to NNIs through water ingestion are three orders of magnitude lower than the recommended relative chronic reference dose. Ongoing environmental monitoring of NNIs is needed due to the increase use of NNIs in China. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Summer thermal stratification occured but was not persistent. Annual heat budgets were slightly higher than for temperate lakes and increased with increasing mean depth; latent heat of fusion constituted one half to one third of the total heat flow. Ice thickness reached a maximum of 1.6-2.2 m, depending upon winter snow cover, and a thin layer (.apprxeq. 5 cm) of white ice occurred in some years. Ice-out was a partial function of mean June temperature. The open-water season lasted 2-3 ms. Light attenuation through white and candled ice, snow, and water was measured. About 28% of the annual surface irradiance penetrated the unfrozen water, about half that which would have been absorbed under ice-free conditions. Extinction coefficients were inversely correlated with mean depth and positively correlated with nutrient status.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				AUG	1987	44	8					1451	1461		10.1139/f87-174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f87-174													WOS:A1987L628400008

Feather isotopes (62Hf) and morphometrics reveal population-specific migration patterns of the Blackpoll Warbler (Setophaga striata)	AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY												Blackpoll Warblers (Setophaga striata) have declined precipitously according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey, but that survey's coverage of the boreal breeding range is limited. Migration monitoring offers an attractive tool for additional assessment because migrants from inaccessible portions of the breeding range are included in counts. However, for site-specific trends to be combined into regional or range-wide population trends, the breeding ground origin of the migrants counted at each site must be known. Blackpolls have a loop migration pattern in which spring and fall migrants follow different paths, but very little is known about population-specific routes within North America. We used stable hydrogen isotope assays of tail feathers (52Hf, 4th rectrix) and wing-length measurements from migration monitoring sites across Canada and the northeastern United States to broadly delineate breeding/natal origins of blackpolls captured at those sites. Blackpolls captured on spring migration in southern Ontario and western Quebec had characteristics expected of birds from breeding range west of the Great Lakes. These birds travel northward from the eastern Gulf of Mexico to Canada east of the Great Lakes before turning westward to reach their final destination between northwestern Ontario and eastern portions of the Northwest Territories. Many birds sampled at Great Lakes sites prior to 2010, but not thereafter, had 52Hf and wing-length characteristics expected of breeding range in eastern Canada, suggesting differential rates of population change among regions. Estimates of migratory connectivity indicated considerable mixing of populations from different portions of the breeding range during migration.

We studied delta O-18 values of two large (L. Caldonazzo and L. Levico) and four small lakes (L. Lavarone, L. Santo di Cembra, L. Serraia, and L. Tovel) characterised by different hydrological regimes (> or <1 year renewal time) and size (> or < 50 ha). Differences in isotope composition along the water column, between years and layers were used to investigate the extend of lake water renewal, mixis, stratification, and groundwater infiltration. Lakes with short renewal time had significantly different spring overturn values. while lakes with longer renewal time had substantially constant values. The isotope content of the water column also clarified the extent of mixis for some lakes: Lavarone underwent complete mixing only in some years, while Tovel, previously considered meromictic, could no longer be considered as such. With the exception of L. Tovel, characterised by a peculiar hydrology, thermal stratification was reflected it? yearly isotope patterns. Analysis of hypolimnetic isotope values indicated that in L. Lavarone and L. Serraia strong storm events altered summer hypolimnetic delta O-18 values suggesting aroundwater infiltration. Furthermore, epilimnetic isotope enrichment was related to lake elevation by a linear relationship. The extraordinarily hot 2003 summer led to a higher evaporation with respect to other years considered. Multi-annual data on the isompic values of rainfall for L. Tovel (1178 m a.s.l.) provided the necessary background for data interpretation since precipitation governs isotope inputs. Based on our data, we proposed a general scheme of the seasonal delta O-18 pattern in temperate lakes distinguishing between small and large lakes.

This paper explores the possible origins of the Ulva sp. in Tokyo Bay and describes field studies intended to explore the nutrient dynamics in Yatsu Higata and Tokyo Bay. Study results show that the Ulva sp. flourishes in Yatsu Higata due to a ready supply of nutrient runoff supplied by the Yatsu River. The water of Yatsu Higata contains high levels of nitrate nitrogen which is considered to strongly affect the growth of Ulva sp. The ability of Yatsu Higata to purify seawater is reduced in the summer and winter due to the presence of Ulva sp.

Eight species of prey-fish were found in the stomachs of 31 of the 112 pike individuals, and 71.9% of the prey-fish in the stomachs of 16 of the 31 pike individuals were European weather loach, Misgurnus fossilis. This first recording of European weather loach in the diet of pike is a valuable finding, because it provides new information on an endangered species categorized as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The high number of European weather loach found in the diet of pike suggests that this species was easy prey for the predator after the spawning period when pike start to feed intensively to replace the energy used for reproduction.

Since microorganisms could have great impact on the ecosystem even during winter, we explored various sites in the Eastern Carpathians regarding the abundance and taxonomic composition of planktonic microorganisms.

Diet of rainbow trout in Lake Rotoiti: an energetic perspective	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												We characterised seasonal and ontogenetic changes in diet and prey energy density of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Lake Rotoiti, New Zealand, to better understand the prey requirements of trout in central North Island lakes. Common smelt (Retropinna retropinna) was the dominant prey item of rainbow trout larger than 200 mm (77.8% of diet by weight), followed by koura (freshwater crayfish Paranephrops planifrons; 6.3%), common bully (Gobiomorphus cotidianus; 5.5%), and koaro (Galaxias brevipinnis; 3.4%). Juvenile rainbow trout (<200 mm) consumed amphipods, aquatic and terrestrial insects, oligochaetes, tanaid shrimps, and smelt. Trout consumed koaro only in autumn and winter; consumption of other species did not vary seasonally. The maximum size of smelt consumed increased with increasing trout size, but trout continued to consume small smelt even as large adults. Consumption of larger prey items (koaro and koura) also increased with increasing trout size. This study indicates the importance of smelt for sustaining rainbow trout populations, as predation on other species was relatively low. These findings provide a basis for bioenergetic modelling of rainbow trout populations in lakes of the central North Island of New Zealand.

Two sites (1033 and 1034) were drilled to maximum depths of 105 and 118 m, recovering sediments ranging in age from 13,300 to less than 300 C-14 yr. Earliest sediments consist of dense, largely massive, gray glaciomarine muds with dropstones and sand and silt laminae deposited during the waning stages of glaciation, Deposition of organic-rich olive gray sediments began in the fjord about 12,000 C-14 yr ago, under well-oxygenated conditions as reflected by the presence of bioturbation and a diverse infaunal bivalve community. At about 10,500 C-14 yr, a massive, gray unit, 40-50 cm thick, was emplaced in a very short span of time. The unit is marked by a sharp lower contact, a gradational upper contact and an abundance of reworked Tertiary microfossils. It has been interpreted as resulting from massive flood events caused by the collapse of glacial dams in the Eraser Valley of mainland British Columbia. Progressively greater anoxia in bottom waters of Saanich Inlet began about 7000 C-14 yr ago. This is reflected in the preservation of varved sediments consisting of diatomaceous spring-summer laminae and terrigenous winter laminae. Correlation of the sediments was based on: marked lithologic changes, the presence of massive intervals (reflecting localized sediment gravity flow events), the Mazama Ash, occasional thin gray laminae (indicative of abnormal flood events in nearby watersheds), varve counts between marker horizons, and 71 accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dates.

We found that the SSS record increased gradually from the middle to late Holocene, indicating reduced summer precipitation in Taiwan. Our results also suggest regional patterns of SSS with SSS increasing in the southern OT and decreasing in the northern OT since the mid -Holocene. Observational data indicate that the SSS in the southern and northern OT are strongly affected by fluvial discharge from Taiwan and the Changjiang River, linked to summer precipitation in South and Central Eastern China, respectively. The contrasting changes in SSS from the OT since the mid -Holocene suggest different spatial patterns of precipitation, with decreasing summer precipitation in South China and increasing summer precipitation in central -eastern China due to the weakened East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) and solar insolation. The delayed seasonal transitions of the EASM, with a longer Meiyu stage and a shorter midsummer stage from the mid -Holocene to late Holocene, are consistent with the delayed northward migration of the westerlies in the late Holocene.

The new data place better age constraints on the sediments and improve the accuracy of the previously published paleomagnetic record from this locality. A complex, yet distinct, waveform is observed in all three components of the paleomagnetic vector. The waveform begins as the 180-190 ka Pringle Falls/Long Valley/Summer Lake II geomagnetic excursion and continues for two cycles after the excursion, until the record is interrupted by an unconformity that we correlate to the oxygen isotope stage 6/5e boundary. The waveform's directional morphology in virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) space is defined by two clockwise loops followed by a distinctive counterclockwise, clockwise, counterclockwise looping sequence. The VGP paths of the two cycles after the excursion are rotated 180 degrees about Earth's spin axis with respect to the VGP paths of the excursion cycle. The waveform also consists of a relative paleointensity variation which repeats during the two cycles after the excursion. The average paleointensity of the postexcursion waveform repetitions is high relative to the extremely low values that occur during the excursion. This observation indicates that excursion-initiated secular variations can occur after the field fully recovers from the low intensities which commonly typify excursions. Because of the similarities noted previously between this excursion and full polarity transitions (Tric et al., 1991), our new observations constrain models for a wide range of field behavior including polarity transitions, excursions, and secular variation.					; Roberts, Andrew/E-6422-2010	Roberts, Andrew P./0000-0003-0566-8117; 													2169-9313	2169-9356				DEC 10	1994	99	B12					24105	24119		10.1029/94JB01544	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/94JB01544													WOS:A1994PX33800022

The share of biomass as a fuel in Latvia is 30.3 %, which is the highest percentage in the enlarged EU. Cereal grain is ready to use fuel which successfully can be applied for heat production in small scale boilers. The main problem of grain usage in furnaces is ash content and ash melting and slagging.

J	Guidry, SA; Chafetz, HS				Guidry, SA; Chafetz, HS			Anatomy of siliceous hot springs: examples from Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Numerous siliceous hot spring systems in the Norris and Lower Geyser Basins of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, provide insights into spring geometries, depositional facies, and lithofacies associated with modem hot springs. Analyses of active (Cistern Spring, Octopus Spring, Deerbone Spring, and Spindle Geyser) and inactive (Pork Chop Geyser) siliceous hot springs have facilitated the construction of a facies model for siliceous hot spring deposits at Yellowstone. Yellowstone's siliceous springs tend to group into four broad morphological categories: siliceous spires and cones, domal mounds, terraced mounds, and ponds. Siliceous spires/cones are subconical accumulations up to 5 - 7 m high and about 2 m in diameter, and are common deposits in Yellowstone Lake. Domal mounds are characterized by siliceous precipitates with a broad lens or shield 2 geometry (2-3 m in vertical relief), discharge channels, and an areal accumulation of approximately 150 m. In contrast, terraced mounds have a stair-step morphology, a substantial pool (similar to 8-10 m in diameter), "shrubby" precipitates, and occupy areas of - 2000 m(2). Siliceous ponds are variable in size, have little outflow, and exhibit low amounts of silica precipitation. Of these morphological varieties, domal mounds and terraced mounds are thought to have the best long-term preservation potential. The four spring morphotypes are composed of up to eight cumulative hot spring depositional facies: (1) vent (> 95 degreesC), (2) proximal vent (< 95 degreesC), (3) pool (similar to80-90 degreesC), (4) pool margin (similar to80 degreesC), (5) pool eddy (< 80 degreesC), (6) discharge channel/flowpath (< 80 degreesC to ambient), (7) debris apron (variable temperatures), and (8) geyser (variable temperatures). This facies model based on numerous springs facilitates our ability to interpret ancient hot spring deposits and to infer depositional conditions. Precipitation of siliceous sinter is the result of abiotic and biotic processes. Abiotic precipitational processes are dominant in the vent area, whereas biotic influences on the precipitate fabric become progressively more important downflow.

Limnoraphis was present in Willow Creek Reservoir throughout the summer and fall, coexisting with various other cyanobacteria in blooms that were associated with microcystin. The absence of cyanotoxin genes from the Limnoraphis sp.

These lakes are typical macrophyte-dominated, shallow and polymictic water bodies. Periphyton was collected from two macrophyte-covered stations, including the rush vegetation station (Typha angustifolia L.) and the stonewort stand (Chara tomentosa L.) in each examined lake. The material was sampled three times in 2003, including the spring (April), summer (July) and autumn (September) seasons, from the same parts of the lakes. The aim of the study was to find out whether there is an influence of particular macrophyte species, differing spatially and morphologically and representing two different ecological types of aquatic vegetation, on the development of particular periphytic species. There was also an attempt at answering the question of what is more important in the structuring of the periphytic communities - the specific architecture of the macrophyte substratum or the physical-chemical features of a particular lake? The concentrations of chlorophyll a, TN, TP and TOC in water were higher in the Chara beds compared with the Typha stations in most cases. The Shannon-Weaver biodiversity index of periphytic algae revealed very high values in all lakes and amounted in the Typha and Chara stands to the mean values 4.68 and 3.87 respectively in Wielkowiejskie Lake, 3.32 and 4.39 in Budzynskie Lake and 3.08 and 3.91 in Debiniec Lake. Furthermore, the standardized index of evenness exhibited the greatest differentiation in the Typha station with the highest (0.76) in Wielkowiejskie and the lowest (0.52) in Debiniec Lake. The analysis of the growth-forms of periphytic communities showed slightly higher diversity of slowly moving and stalked diatoms in most cases at the Chara stations of all studied lakes. The similarity between periphytic communities in the Typha and Chara stands of the examined lakes, compared using the Ward method and Euclidean distance measure, revealed a stronger relationship within a particular habitat but not a lake. The clearest pattern of similarity grouping a particular habitat was obtained for the summer period, when macrophytes reached their optimum. The Jaccard similarity index confirmed the differentiation of both examined habitats, reaching the mean value of 0.34. Based on the biomass of single periphytic species, habitat selectivity for seven species was found. Significantly higher biomass was obtained in the case of the rush zone for only one algae species - Eunotia lunaris (Ehr.) Grim. In the Chara bed six species revealed significantly higher biomasses - Cosmarium regnelli Wille, Oocystis marssonii Lemm., Ulotrix zonata (Weber et Moor) Kutz., Scenedesmus acuminatus (Lagerh.) Chod., Merismopedia elegans A. Braun and Phacus orbicularis Hubner. The habitat preference of periphytic communities to different macrophyte species may be due to the environmental factors, including the specific architecture of a particular macrophyte substrate such as density or texture of the plant surface. Furthermore, seasonality, as well as physical-chemical parameters may structure periphytic communities within the littoral zone of lakes.					; Kuczyńska-Kippen, Natalia/AAC-1955-2022	Messyasz, Beata/0000-0002-4371-3591; 													1505-2249						2006	54	1					15	27																WOS:000236073300002
J	Moos, MT; Cumming, BF				Moos, Melissa T.; Cumming, Brian F.			Changes in the parkland-boreal forest boundary in northwestern Ontario over the Holocene	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Changes in vegetation were tracked from a well-dated sediment core from a boreal lake, Lake 239, at similar to 200-year resolution over the Holocene. This presently oligotrophic lake is located similar to 100-km east from the present-day parkland-forest ecotone in northwestern Ontario. Near-shore sediment core transects from Lake 239 have previously shown this lake was at least 8-m lower than present in the mid-Holocene, or similar to 58% less lake volume in comparison to today. Large shifts were expected in the terrestrial vegetation if the low lake levels were related to climate. The core from Lake 239 shows increases in the relative abundance and concentration of pollen such as Cupressaceae and Ambrosia, indicating a more open boreal forest between similar to 4500-8000 cal yr BP. Pollen-based inferences of average, summer and winter temperatures suggest that temperatures were on average up to 1-2 degrees C warmer than today, with winter temperatures up to 4 degrees C warmer. The pollen inferences also suggest enhanced precipitation, likely in the summer, but with an overall increase in evaporation and evapotranspiration resulting in reduced effective moisture. To assess regional climate changes, pollen-based reconstructions of temperature and precipitation were developed and synthesized from sediment cores from eight previously published lakes, from which pollen sites were available to both the west and east of Lake 239, spanning present-day prairie lakes to forested lakes up to 300 km east of the prairie-boreal ecotone. All sites show shifts in pollen assemblages that indicate a warm mid-Holocene period: prairie sites west of the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) show mid-Holocene decreases in precipitation relative to today, whereas sites near or east of ELA show consistent increases in precipitation, but with increased temperatures and enhanced evaporation during the mid-Holocene.

J	OVENDEN, JR; WHITE, RWG				OVENDEN, JR; WHITE, RWG			MITOCHONDRIAL AND ALLOZYME GENETICS OF INCIPIENT SPECIATION IN A LANDLOCKED POPULATION OF GALAXIAS-TRUTTACEUS (PISCES, GALAXIIDAE)	GENETICS												Galaxias truttaceus is found in coastal rivers and streams in south-eastern Australia. It spawns at the head of estuaries in autumn and the larvae spend 3 months of winter at sea before returning to fresh water. In Tasmania there are landlocked populations of G. truttaceus in a cluster of geologically young lakes on the recently glaciated Central Plateau. These populations have no marine larval stage and spawn in the lakes in spring. Speciation due to land locking is thought to be a frequent occurrence within Galaxias. To investigate the nature of the speciation event which may be occurring within lake populations of G. truttaceus we studied the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and allozyme diversity of both lake and stream population. Using the presence or absence of restriction sites recognized by 13 six-base restriction endonucleases, we found 58 mtDNA haplotypes among 150 fish collected from 13 Tasmanian and one south-east Australian mainland stream populations. The most parsimonious network relating the haplotypes by site loss or gain was starlike in shape. We argue that this arrangement is best explained by selection upon slightly benefical mutations within the mitochondrial genome. Gene diversity analysis under Wright''s island model showed that the populations in each drainage were not genetically subdivided. Only two of these stream haplotypes were found among the 66 fish analyzed from four lake populations. Despite the extreme lack of mtDNA diversity in lake populations, the observed nuclear DNA heterozygosity of 40 lake fish (0.10355) was only slightly less than that of 82 stream fish (0.11635). In the short time (3000-7000 years) that the lake fish have been landlocked, random genetic drift in a finite, stable-sized population was probably not responsible for the lack of mtDNA diversity in the lake populations. We infer the lake populations have probably experienced at least one, severe, but transitory bottleneck possibly induced by natural selection for life-history characters essential for survival in the lacustrine habitat. If speciation is occurring in the landlocked populations of G. truttaceus, then it may be driven by genetic transilience.

J	Miller, JH; Wald, EJ; Druckenmiller, P				Miller, Joshua H.; Wald, Eric J.; Druckenmiller, Patrick			Shed female caribou antlers extend records of calving activity on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge by millennia	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) have among the longest annual migrations of any terrestrial mammal as they move from winter ranges to spring calving grounds. Biomonitoring records indicate broad consistencies in calving geography across the last several decades, but how long have herds used particular calving grounds? Furthermore, how representative are modern patterns of calving geography to periods that pre-date recent climatic perturbations and increased anthropogenic stresses? While modern ecological datasets are not long enough to address these questions, bones from past generations of caribou lying on the tundra provide unique opportunities to study historical calving geography. This is possible because female caribou shed their antlers within days of giving birth, releasing a skeletal indicator of calving. Today, the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (Alaska) is a key calving ground for the Porcupine Caribou Herd (PCH). To test the duration across which caribou have used this area as a calving ground, we radiocarbon dated three highly weathered female antlers collected from tundra surfaces on the Coastal Plain. Calibrated radiocarbon dates indicate that these antlers were shed between similar to 1,600 and more than 3,000 calendar years ago. The antiquity of these shed antlers provides the first physical evidence of calving activity on the PCH calving grounds from previous millennia, substantiating the long ecological legacy of the Coastal Plain as a caribou calving ground. Comparisons to published lake core records also reveal that dates of two of the antlers correspond to periods with average summer temperatures that were warmer than has been typical during the last several decades of biomonitoring. This finding expands the range of climatic settings in which caribou are known to use the current PCH calving grounds and suggests that the Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge may remain an important caribou calving ground during at least portions of predicted future warming. Discarded skeletal materials provide opportunities to assess the historical states of living populations, including aspects of reproductive biology and migration. Particularly in high-latitude settings, these insights can extend across millennia and offer rare glimpses into the past that can inform current and future management policies.

Methane emission from mires of the West Siberian taiga	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												In the summer-autumn seasons of 2007-2011, the methane emission from typical mire landscapes of Western Siberia was studied using the static chamber method. The lowest methane flux turned out to be characteristic of the ryams (pine-dwarf shrub-sphagnum associations) and the ridges of the ridge-hollow complexes, as well as of the wetland lakes in the northern and middle taiga (the medians are within the range of 0.1-0.5 mg C-CH4/m(2) h). Values that are 10 times higher are typical for the oligotrophic hollows, fens, peat mats, and poor fens in different subzones (the medians are 2 to 7 mg C-CH4/m(2) h). The maximal values of the methane flux from the wetland lakes of the southern taiga are 17.98 mg C-CH4/m(2) h. Based on the data obtained by the authors, along with the previously published ones, the regional methane fluxes from the taiga mires were calculated: 2.22 Mt C-CH4/m(2) per year, or about 80% of the total methane flux from the West Siberian mires. The estimates of the CH4 regional flux obtained by other researchers are discussed; the main source of the estimation uncertainty is analyzed.

J	Williams, MW; Hood, E; Caine, N				Williams, MW; Hood, E; Caine, N			Role of organic nitrogen in the nitrogen cycle of a high-elevation catchment, Colorado Front Range	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Here we report on 3 years (1996-1998) of measurements of organic and inorganic nitrogen (N) fluxes to and from Green Lakes Valley, a high-elevation ecosystem in the Colorado Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. Nitrate-N (NO3-N) was the dominant form of N in both precipitation and stream water. Annual precipitation contained 52% NO3-N, 32% ammonium-N (NH4-N), 9% dissolved organic N (DON), and 7% particulate organic N (PON). Annual export of N in streamflow was composed of 70% NO3-N, 4% NH4-N, 14% DON, and 12% PON. Thus the percentage of organic N increased from 16% of total N in precipitation to 26% of total N in streamflow. Subtracting inputs from outputs, Green Lakes Valley always shows net retention of inorganic N. The only form of N that showed net export was DON. DON export was low (0.18 to -0.13 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), with net export recorded in 2 years and basin retention recorded in 1 year. There was a seasonal pattern in the concentrations of inorganic N (NO3-N + NH4-N) and organic N (DON + PON). Concentrations of inorganic N were similar to 15-25 mu mol L-1 during base flow, increased to similar to 30 mu mol L-1 on the rising limb of the hydrograph during snowmelt runoff, then decreased to -5 mu mol L-1 on the recession limb of late summer, with a return to base flow values in the autumn. In contrast, organic N was 7-15 mu mol L-1 during base flow and decreased to near or below detection limits on the rising limb of the hydrograph, with a gradual but consistent increase on the recession limb and on into the autumn. The amount of N in dissolved organic matter changed over time, with the dissolved organic carbon (DOC):DON ratio decreasing from similar to 45 on the rising limb of the hydrograph to < 20 in the autumn. Spatially, there was a striking difference in the ratios of NO3-N and DON between talus and tundra areas. Nitrate concentrations in surface water draining talus areas were always greater than DON. In contrast, DON concentrations in surface water draining tundra areas were always greater than NO3-N. Concentrations of DON were not significantly correlated with DOC (R-2 = 0.04, p > 0.05), indicating that controls on DON export may be different than controls on DOC export. Our results suggest that the ratio of the annual mass flux of inorganic N to organic N in stream waters may provide a novel index to evaluate the N status of terrestrial ecosystems from various biomes.																			0043-1397	1944-7973				OCT	2001	37	10					2569	2581		10.1029/2001WR000485	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2001WR000485													WOS:000171211300012
J	Wilcox, DA; Xie, YC				Wilcox, Douglas A.; Xie, Yichun			Predicted Effects of Proposed New Regulation Plans on Sedge/Grass Meadows of Lake Ontario	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Previously described models for predicting the percent of Lake Ontario wetlands that would be occupied by sedge/grass-dominated meadow marsh were used to test four proposed new plans for regulation of lake levels and to make comparisons with the current plan and unregulated conditions. The models for drowned river mouth, barrier beach, open embayment, and protected embayment wetlands assessed responses to lake levels that would be generated by each plan under net total supplies modified from those that occurred from 1900 to 2000. In years when reduced supplies would allow meadow marsh regeneration, simulated unregulated lake levels produced the most meadow marsh in all wetland geomorphic types; current Plan 1958DD produced the least. Overall predicted percent meadow marsh under the test plans decreased in the order B+, 2007, D+, and A+, and the latter three plans produced rather similar results in many cases. Lower percentages of meadow marsh under some plans were due to insufficient low lake levels that could allow soils to dry and restrict invasion by cattails, as well as lack of periodic high lake levels that could kill invading upland plants. An assessment of seasonal lake-level characteristics demonstrated that Plan 2007 would reduce mean winter lake levels by 13 cm or more than Plan B+ and springtime take levels by more than 10 cm. These seasonal differences could result in less winter habitat for muskrats and reduced access to spring spawning habitats for fish such as northern pike. Our model results provide important information for use in the process of selecting a new regulation plan for Lake Ontario.																			0380-1330					DEC	2008	34	4					745	754																WOS:000262663900014
J	MOMOT, WT				MOMOT, WT			POPULATION DYNAMICS AND PRODUCTIVITY OF CRAYFISH ORCONECTES VIRILIS IN A MARL LAKE	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												The population dynamics of the crayfish, Orconectes virilis, were studied to define the role of the crayfish as a consumer in a marl lake ecosystem. Insight was gained into the factors controlling its production. There was year-class fluctuation in the age structure of the crayfish population. Males had a greater growth rate than females. After age-I, mortality rates for females were greater than for males. Both sexes matured after a molt in July, at age-I; mating followed and eggs were laid the following spring. Reproductive capacity was 58% of the potential capacity. Two-year-old females produced most of the eggs (92.5%). The estimated reproductive rate for 1963 was low (0.78 per generation) due to poor survival of the 1963 year class. The maximum life span for both sexes was 3 years. Newly hatched young left the females and remained in shallow water. Adult females then molted and migrated to a depth of 7.6 m, where most of them remained all summer. A migration of males to deep water followed. O. virilis acts as a herbivore in marl lakes, feeding chiefly on the algae and the "aufwuchs" with marl incrustations, though it is also a scavenger on animal materials. The peak standing crop of crayfish (119.5 kg/ha) occurred in the spring of 1963. The annual net production of crayfish was 205.3 kg/ha, about 8.9 times greater than an estimate of the production of all other bottom invertebrates in West Lost Lake (23.0 kg/ha). The total net production of 310.8 kg was 2.33 times the average standing crop during the summer of 1963. This crayfish has a lower daily numerical turnover rate (2.0%) than the amphipod Hyalella (2.9%) and the cladoceran Daphnia (25.0%). Population size is probably regulated by cannibalism and natural mortality at molting.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1967	78	1					55	+		10.2307/2423370	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2423370													WOS:A19679723700002
J	Braconnot, P; Joussaume, S; de Noblet, N; Ramstein, G				Braconnot, P; Joussaume, S; de Noblet, N; Ramstein, G			Mid-holocene and Last Glacial Maximum African monsoon changes as simulated within the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												As part of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP), several atmospheric general circulation models have performed climate simulations of the mid-Holocene (6 ka BP) and of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climates (21 ka BP) using the same experimental design for boundary conditions, insolation and CO2 forcing. PMIP results are used in this study to investigate how the position of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) changes over West Africa throughout the seasonal cycle in these two climates. The Mid-Holocene corresponds to a period of enhanced seasonal cycle with colder winters and warmer summers, leading to an increase of the African monsoon. During LGM, the presence of large ice sheets and lower CO2 give rise to a colder climate and a reduced summer monsoon. For the two time periods and all the models, it is found that over West Africa, both the atmospheric low level temperature gradient and the position of the maximum of surface temperature control the position of the ITCZ. The energetic changes associated with the change in the hydrological cycle are driven by latent heat release in the atmosphere within the rainbelt and by radiative fluxes north of the ITCZ. The sensible heat flux plays also a non-negligible role over the desert during mid-Holocene. Differences between the PMIP simulations reflect differences in model parameterization, including surface processes and clouds. However, for a given model, the partitioning between the changes in the different heat fluxes is quite similar for the mid-Holocene and the LGM climate change. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Spatiotemporal distribution, source apportionment and combined pollution of antibiotics in natural waters adjacent to mariculture areas in the Laizhou Bay, Bohai Sea	CHEMOSPHERE												The spatiotemporal distribution, source apportionment and combined pollution of 14 antibiotics in natural waters adjacent to mariculture farms of Laizhou Bay in the Bohai Sea were studied. The contribution proportion and quantity of each potential pollution source to antibiotics in natural water bodies were quantitatively described. The correlations between heavy metals and antibiotics and their underlying mechanisms in natural and aquaculture water environment were analyzed. Fourteen antibiotics were detected in natural water and sediment in the coastal area of Laizhou Bay. The maximum concentrations of sulfamethazine and trimethoprim in water reached tens or even hundreds of mu g/L in winter. Trimethoprim was the main antibiotic in natural water bodies in winter and summer, and enrofloxacin was the principal antibiotic in sediments. Enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and oxytetracycline were detected in all underground water samples; thus, control of these antibiotics needs to be made a priority to mitigate groundwater contamination. PCA-MLR revealed that the potential sources of antibiotics in natural waters of Laizhou Bay include the mariculture wastewater (18.3%), the domestic sewage (63.3%) and the livestock wastewater (18.4%). Therefore, the antibiotic burden of Laizhou Bay was principally from the domestic sewage. In natural water, the concentration of Cu was positively correlated with antibiotics, which might be related to the common sources, the competitive adsorption in sediments and the easy complexation characteristic of Cu and antibiotics. Positive correlations among antibiotics and heavy metals were observed in mariculture sediments, while negative relationships were observed in natural sediments. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

J	MAKAREWICZ, JC				MAKAREWICZ, JC			FEASIBILITY OF SHORESIDE MONITORING OF THE GREAT-LAKES	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Over a 2-year period, chemical, physical, and biological parameters were statistically compared between a shore-based sampling site (a water treatment plant) and nearshore and offshore sites sampled by boat. The seasonal comparison suggested that water samples taken from the Shoreside Site were not representative of the nearshore water column during turbidity events in excess of 10 NTU. Significant differences between the Shoreside and the Nearshore Sites were minimized by removing sampling dates from the analysis in which meterological events caused turbidity and upwelling events in the nearshore region. Below 10 NTU, water chemistry, all phytoplankton groups, and abundance of the Cladocera, Calanoida, and the Rotifera were not significantly different between the Shoreside and Nearshore Sites over four seasons. Similarly, when sampling was restricted to days of 10 NTU or less, the Shoreside Site was not significantly different from the Offshore Site for water chemistry, the production parameters, Alpha and Pmax, and phytoplankton abundance and biomass with the exception of turbidity during limnological winter and diatom abundance and biomass during the winter and spring. During a meteorologic event, wind induced turbidity plumes and upwellings were demonstrated to be the cause of significant variability in limnological variables monitored from the Shoreside Site. These results suggest that greater utilization of water intakes as monitoring sites in the Great Lakes is warranted. However, prior to initiation of any long-term monitoring program using water intakes, feasibility studies that calibrate and verify what the intake pipe is sampling over four seasons are necessary.																			0380-1330						1991	17	3					344	360		10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71371-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71371-3													WOS:A1991GK77500007

Combined records from a stalagmite from Barbados and from lake sediments in Haiti reveal variable seasonality in the Caribbean between 6.7 and 3 ka BP	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The growth of a well-dated stalagmite from Barbados records high infiltration rates into the karst aquifer and hence increased rainfall intensity between 6.7 and 3 ka BP in agreement with records from Lake Miragoane, Haiti [Hodell et al., 1991. Reconstruction of the Caribbean climate change over the past 10,500 years. Nature 352, 790-793], mainly reflecting the insolation maximum of the Northern Hemisphere. Both the lake record and the stable isotope record of the stalagmite reveal additional centennial variability of recharge. High oxygen isotope values in stalagmite calcite, corresponding to reduced recharge, are synchronous with periods of lower stable isotope values recorded in Lake Miragoane ostracods, previously attributed to enhanced precipitation. Accordingly, periods of increased recharge in Barbados correspond to O-18-enriched isotope values of ostracods, which were attributed to higher evaporation/precipitation ratios in the lakes. We ascribe this apparent discrepancy to changes in seasonality, i.e., winter periods of reduced temperature and relative humidity following summer months of increased precipitation. At present, such climate conditions occur during periods of enhanced Northern Atlantic Oscillation (NAO(+)). If enhanced seasonality is a consequence of a NAO(+) situation, the apparent discrepancy of high isotope values in lakes (previously attributed to droughts) can be reconciled with lower winter temperatures in the takes. Further, the correlation of solar intensity (derived from C-14 and Be-10) with the isotopic signals recorded in the lacustrine sediments suggests a solar forcing of the NAO during the mid Holocene.

Nutrient content, species, and nitrogen (N) to phosphorus (P) ratios were obtained through water quality analyses. Nutrient limitation was evaluated by nutrient enrichment bioassays (NEBs) in the autumn of 2012 and spring of 2013. Average annual concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) were 0.05, 0.08, and 0.10 mg/L, and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations were 0.77, 1.95, and 2.06 mg/L in the water column at CS, ES, and WS, respectively. All of the three lakes exhibited 'meso-eutrophic' states and the TN: TP ratio ranged from 25:1 to 74:1 with variability between seasons and sites. NEBs verified that primary productivity in the lakes at ES and WS were mainly limited by P, while N limitation or N and P co-limitation was present in the aquatic zones at CS due to unavailable dissolved inorganic nitrogen. In the studied lakes, the blue-green algae, which comprised 70% of all identified species, was the predominant taxa, while the micro-zooplankton taxa was dominant, indicating a typical trophic structure of eutrophic lakes.

The delta(18)O and delta D of snow and most ground water samples fall near the meteoric water line, with the ground water being isotopically heavier than the snow, indicating that a portion of the recharge must come from non-winter precipitation events. One ground water and all the surface water samples fall below the meteoric water line, demonstrating extensive evaporation. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio of the snow is more radiogenic than those of the ground water samples, indicating that the ground water has increased its Sr-86 content by the dissolution of mafic rock in the aquifer. Stump Lake has a much more radiogenic Sr isotopic ratio than the waters of Devils Lake suggesting a source of water different from that of Devils Lake. The East Stump Lake water, on the other hand, appears to be either a mix of Devils Lake and Stump Lake waters, or Devils Lake water diluted with precipitation.																			0921-2728					JAN	1997	17	1					147	154		10.1023/A:1007913718664	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007913718664													WOS:A1997WK96500011

Adult males occupied significantly larger annual home ranges than adult females. Males' ranges overlapped those of females and also each other's. In winter, home ranges of males shrank and showed less overlap. Otters often associated in groups, the core members typically being adult females with young, or adult males. Otters tended to be more solitary in winter. In winter, movement rates of all sex and age classes were similar, and much reduced for males compared with those in other seasons. These data indicated a strong limiting effect of winter ice on behaviour and dispersion. We tested the hypothesis that otters select water bodies in winter on the basis of the suitability of shoreline substrate and morphology for dens with access both to air and to water under ice. Intensity of selection was greatest in winter, with avoidance of gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel. Adults selected bog lakes with banked shores containing semiaquatic mammal burrows, and lakes with beaver lodges. Subadults selected beaver-impounded streams. Apart from human harvest, winter habitats and food availability in such habitats are likely the two factors most strongly limiting otter density in boreal Alberta.																			0008-4301					JUL	1994	72	7					1314	1324		10.1139/z94-175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z94-175													WOS:A1994PT90000019

The primary objective of this research was to investigate the importance of snowmelt in relation to landslide occurrence and to define the critical climatic conditions that may trigger massive winter landslides. We used monthly precipitation and average monthly maximum temperature data from meteorological and precipitation stations in the Viso & ccaron;ica River basin (Dojkinci) and in the immediate proximity of Lake Zavoj (Pirot, Dimitrovgrad and Topli Do) as data inputs to the Snow-Melt Landslide (SML) index. It considers the summed monthly precipitation for previous months that continuously have an average maximum temperature below 0 degrees C. According to this method, the event at Zavoj Lake stands out among all other precipitation and snowmelt values for the past 72 years. After applying the SML index, all stations showed values of >300 mm for February 1963, which we consider as the threshold value for potential landslides appearance. In addition to meteorological data, we applied the SML index to data from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) regional climate model outputs for the region from 2022 to 2100. As expected, climate change will have influenced the temperature values, especially during the winter. Conversely, the study area is experiencing drastic changes in land use caused by depopulation, leading to a reduced risk of winter landslides in the Viso & ccaron;ica basin. We suggest that future climatic conditions in the area will make it more likely to experience extreme summer precipitation events, which might trigger large landslides. The SML method can be implemented for all landscapes that experience snowy winters, providing information in a timely manner so that local residents can react properly when the probability of landslide occurrence rises. The SML index, grounded in essential meteorological principles, provides a tailor-made, data-driven methodology applicable across varied geographical settings. Its utility extends to mitigating hydro-meteorological hazards on scales ranging from local to national scales, offering diverse and effective early warning solutions					; Spalevic, Velibor/AAS-9304-2020; Marjanovic, Milos/KWT-5899-2024; Basarin, Biljana/ADC-1183-2022; Mudelsee, Manfred/C-6063-2018	Marjanovic, Milos/0000-0003-0412-6615; Spalevic, Velibor/0000-0002-7800-2909; Markovic, Rastko/0000-0002-6357-9481; Radivojevic, Aleksandar/0000-0002-8176-5165; Radakovic, Milica/0000-0002-5916-4187; Mudelsee, Manfred/0000-0002-2364-9561; Lukic, Tin/0000-0001-5398-0928														2073-4433				MAR	2024	15	3							256	10.3390/atmos15030256	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos15030256													WOS:001191903000001
J	ELLISEVANS, JC; SANDERS, MW				ELLISEVANS, JC; SANDERS, MW			OBSERVATIONS ON MICROBIAL ACTIVITY IN A SEASONALLY ANOXIC, NUTRIENT-ENRICHED MARITIME ANTARCTIC LAKE	POLAR BIOLOGY												Amos Lake is a shallow, permanently cold, maritime Antarctic lake which is almost totally anoxic for much of the 9 month period of winter ice cover each year. The lake catchment is a source of considerable nutrient enrichment for the lake due to the presence, in summer, of large numbers of seals and seabirds. A dense growth of phytoplankton was supported by this enrichment and, in turn, was a source of nutrients for the diverse microflora of the lake. The phytoplankton had a very high assimilation efficiency and an apparent high tolerance of anoxia. Bacterioplankton numbers and activity were closely linked to algal activity and both groups showed a strong seasonality typical of polar systems. Anaerobic bacteria (notably sulphate reducers and methanogens) were not as significant as anticipated, being largely restricted to the deeper lake trough region and possibly subject to substrate limitation later in the anoxic period. The results are discussed in the context of previous findings for other maritime Antarctic lakes.																			0722-4060	1432-2056				MAR	1988	8	4					311	318		10.1007/BF00263180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00263180													WOS:A1988M419500009

The 21 study catchments (0.69-56 km(2)) are located over Finland excluding the northernmost regions. The mean annual total organic carbon (TOC) load from the catchments ranges from 2 600 to 8 800 kg/km(2)/a. Using a total acidity of 9.7 mu eq/mg DOC this would represent organic acid load of about 25-85 keq/km(2)/a which is higher than the mean annual deposition of strong acids in the highest deposition areas in southern Finland. The study demonstrates that organic acids dominate stream water acidity over large regions in Finland. In southern Finland minerogenic acidity is, however, more important. Organic acids exceeded mineral acids not only in autumn but also during spring snowmelt in 18 catchments. Moreover, the lowest pH values (25th percentile) were dominated by organic acids in 20 catchments. In most catchments TOC better explained pH than non-marine sulphate. In stepwise multiple regression base cations and TOC explained 67-83 % of the variation in pH for catchments divided into six groups according to season, deposition and peatland percentage; non-marine sulphate had minor contribution.

J	Bürgi, H; Stadelmann, P				Bürgi, H; Stadelmann, P			Change of phytoplankton composition and biodiversity in Lake Sempach before and during restoration	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Sempach, located in the central part of Switzerland, has a surface area of 14 km(2), a maximum depth of 87 m and a water residence time of 15 years. Restoration measures to correct historic eutrophication, including artificial mixing and oxygenation of the hypolimnion, were implemented in 1984. By means of the combination of external and internal load reductions, total phosphorus concentrations decreased in the period 1984-2000 from 160 to 42 mg P m(-3). Starting from 1997, hypolimnion oxygenation with pure oxygen was replaced by aeration with fine air bubbles. The reaction of the plankton has been investigated as part of a long-term monitoring program. Taxa numbers, evenness and biodiversity of phytoplankton increased significantly during the last 15 years, concomitant with a marked decline of phosphorus concentration in the lake. Seasonal development of phytoplankton seems to be strongly influenced by the artificial mixing during winter and spring and by changes of the trophic state. Dominance of nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria (Aphanizomenon sp.), causing a severe fish kill in 1984, has been correlated with lower N/P-ratio in the epilimnion. Buoyant algae such as Planktothrix rubescens (syn. Oscillatoria rubescens) increased in abundance due to enlargement of the trophogenic layer and extended mixing depth during winter. The interactions between zoo- and phytoplankton seemed to be depressed as a result of restoration measures. Zooplankton composition changed to more carnivorous and less herbivorous species. Oxygenation of the hypolimnion induced bioturbation of sediments, mainly by oligochaetae worms, and stimulated germination of spores and cysts and hatching of resting eggs.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2002	469	1-3					33	48		10.1023/A:1015575527280	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1015575527280													WOS:000175764800004
J	Romanov, AA				Romanov, A. A.			Ecological and Geographical Structure and Dynamics of the Autumn Migration of Passerine Birds on the Putorana Plateau	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The ecological and geographical differentiation and dynamics of the autumn migration of passerine birds on the Putorana Plateau are analyzed. In 1988-2004, eight sites were surveyed in the western and central parts of the region in an area of 150 000 km(2). The route census method was used. The passerine fauna of Putorana during the autumn migration period includes 42 species. Birds fly along a narrow shore forest-edge strip on the banks of large rivers or lakes in the southern, southwestern, or western directions. There are species distributed everywhere (n = 16; 38%), locally (n = 9; 22%), and pointwise (n = 17; 40%). The bird population density is 239-643 (on average, 440 individuals/km(2), n = 8). The population density of passerine birds during autumn migration is maximal in the south of Putorana, lower in the middle part of the region, and minimal in the north of the plateau. At multiday observation points, the population density was 420-796 individuals/km(2) on the days of most intensive flight (on average, 608 individuals/km(2), n = 2). Passerine birds fly at 8 degrees-12 degrees. For most species, the average duration of the entire autumn migration is 20-26 days; the average duration of their main migration is 7-12 days. The vast majority of individuals of almost all migratory species are united into monospecific and polyspecific flocks. The configuration of the autumn migration is a combination of four waves with four well-defined maxima. The most significant bursts of migration activity are associated with a decrease in air temperature and the absence of precipitation. The bulk of individuals of different species of the same genus or family usually migrate on different days. Synchronization of waves of peak migration is rare in related species. The community is numerically dominated by the Arctic warbler, common redpoll, and little bunting.																			1995-4255	1995-4263				APR	2025	18	2					171	183		10.1134/S1995425524700987	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995425524700987													WOS:001485669800010

Therefore, a deeper understanding of possible mechanisms that determine the properties of karst springs is crucial. In this work, we present an example of Unica Spring and Malni Spring, the two main outlets of a large karst system in the Notranjska karst region, Slovenia. Although the two springs share same catchment area, the flow distribution between them shows an interesting behaviour: At low-flow conditions Malni Spring is the main outlet, while Unica spring receives almost no water. During high water events, discharge of Malni Spring stays limited and Unica Spring becomes the main outlet. We relate these observations to the local geometry of the channels and breakdowns in the remote part of the Planinska Jama (Planina Cave), called Mysterious Lake. There, waters from Rakov kocjan and Javorniki aquifer merge and further diverge to both springs. At low water conditions, the outflow towards the Unica Spring is restricted by the breakdown, so that most of the inflow is directed towards the Malni Spring. With increasing recharge, the level in Mysterious Lake rises until the water starts to flow over the breakdown along a system of large channels (Rak Branch of Planinska Jama) to the Unica Spring. The breakdown level keeps the hydraulic head and the flow towards Malni Spring limited. To verify this scenario, a hydraulic conduit model was made based on the known and predicted channels, and inflows calculated from the historical data of discharge measurements at related springs and ponors. An inversion procedure was used to obtain a satisfactory fit to the observed discharge data and to constrain the selected model parameters. The model accurately reproduced the observed discharge behaviour under low- and high-flow conditions.

A/whooper swan/Mongolia/6/2009 (H5N1) experimentally infected ducks and replicated systemically with higher mortality than that of the isolates in 2005 and 2006. Intensive surveillance of avian influenza in migratory waterfowl flying from their nesting lakes in Siberia to Mongolia in every autumn indicate that HPAI viruses have not perpetuated at their nesting lakes until 2009. The present results demonstrate that wild waterfowl were sporadically infected with H5N1 HPAI viruses prevailing in domestic poultry in the southern Asia and died in Mongolia on the way back to their northern territory in spring.

Relatively few studies on the spatiotemporal dynamics of wetland plant biomass have been conducted because of the difficulties in obtaining detailed and accurate data. Carex cinerascens meadows are important patches in Poyang Lake in eastern China and provide significant food resources and habitats for wintering waterbirds, particularly geese. We proposed a method to estimate the biomass of C. cinerascens in a subsection of Poyang Lake, i.e. Baisha Lake, employing the digital elevation model and water level gradient of the lake combined with the logistic regression model based on data from field measurements in different elevations. We obtained four C. cinerascens biomass estimation models based on four elevations divided. The maximum biomass decreased with decreasing elevation. Meanwhile, the maximum growth rate initially increased and subsequently decreased. The biomass of C. cinerascens per unit area ranged from 0.10 to 0.58 kg/m(2) in the autumn and winter. Significant differences in the growth process of C. cinerascens were observed in different water level gradients. The total biomass of C. cinerascens in Baisha Lake changed following an S-shaped curve and reached 221, 503, and 615 t in the middle of October, November, and December, respectively. The research results can be used to forecast the biomass of C. cinerascens under different hydrological conditions in Poyang Lake, and to provide wetland plant biomass estimation methods for other similar regions.

J	Bensizerara, D; Chenchouni, H				Bensizerara, Djamel; Chenchouni, Haroun			Are diurnal time-budgets and activity patterns density-dependent in the Shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) wintering in Algeria? An analysis across multiple temporal scales	AVIAN RESEARCH												Background: The Shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) is a characteristic waterbird species of inland wetlands in northeastern Algeria. Its wintering behavior in relation to changes of local abundances and foraging group density is poorly known. Objectives: This study aims at monitoring patterns of diurnal activities and the variation of behavioral time-budgets in relation to numbers of wintering Shelducks. We investigate temporal variations of diurnal activities across multiple-time scales and consider their interrelationships. Methods: Assessments of local population abundance were weekly surveyed during two wintering seasons (2010-2012), whereas diurnal activities (feeding, sleeping, swimming, preening, loafing, flying, courtship, and antagonism) were studied three times a month during seven hours (08:00-16:00) using the Scan method. Time budget variations of each behavioral activity were tested using nested ANOVAs following multiple time scales. Generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) tested whether variations in diurnal activities were density-dependent. Results: During the wintering season, Shelduck's numbers followed a bell-shaped trend, which indicated that the species was typically a wintering migrant in Sabkha Djendli. The first individuals arrived onsite in October-November then numbers reached a peak in January (up to 2400 individuals in 2012) with steady density during December-February, afterward individuals left the site progressively until late April when the site is deserted. During both wintering seasons, diurnal activities were dominated by feeding (60%), followed by sleeping (12%) then swimming and preening with 9% and 8%, respectively. The rest of the activities (loafing, flying, courtship and antagonistic behaviors) had low proportions of time budget. ANOVAs showed that activity time budgets varied significantly following multiple time scales (year, season, month, day, semi-hour). Time budgets of diurnal activities during each wintering season were significantly interrelated. Correlations patterns between the two seasons were similar. GLMMs revealed that the variations of diurnal activities were not density-dependent, except for preening and swimming. Conclusion: During the wintering season, habitats of Sabkha Djendli are important for waterbirds, including the Shelduck that used the lake mainly for food-foraging and resting. The 2400 individuals censused in mid-winter are important locally and at the North African scale. This stresses the need to strengthen the protection status of this wetland and mitigate degradation sources that threaten wintering waterfowl.					; djamel, benz/I-5140-2017; Chenchouni, Haroun/I-7494-2012	Bensizerara, Djamel/0000-0001-9930-0668; djamel, benz/0000-0003-3632-4819; Chenchouni, Haroun/0000-0001-9077-2706													2053-7166					APR 16	2019	10								12	10.1186/s40657-019-0152-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40657-019-0152-y													WOS:000466731200001

Culling aimed at reducing local population size takes place in some wintering areas, particularly in France and Switzerland. The effectiveness of such management actions is unknown and depends on how high cormorant site fidelity is. We use winter resightings from the period 1980-2000 of 24,000 cormorants colour-ringed in Denmark and The Netherlands to estimate site fidelity. Year-to-year fidelity to single, sites (typically lakes) was 85-90%. For cormorants that changed site mean distances moved from year to year were typically between 10 and 50 kin, depending on geographical location. However, long-distance movements (maximum observed was 1,891 km) also occurred regularly. For larger parts of the winter range, exemplified by France, about 3% of all birds left the area from year to year. A mathematical model showed that the observed levels of movement among wintering areas were sufficiently high to sustain a wintering population in France at levels of cuffing which would drive it to extinction in the absence of immigration. Although cormorants are not nomadic outside the breeding season, as previously believed, site fidelity is sufficiently low and movement among wintering areas sufficiently high that it must be taken into account in management programmes.

J	Idestam-Almquist, J				Idestam-Almquist, J			Dynamics of submersed aquatic vegetation on shallow soft bottoms in the Baltic Sea	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Persistence and colonization of submersed aquatic plant species were studied in permanent plots (20 cm x 20 cm) at three shallow sites adjacent to Asko island, in the northern Baltic Sea. The study started in 1991 at two of the sites, in 1992 at a third site and continued until 1997. Two major weather-induced disturbances occurred during the study: a long, stormy period during a mild winter and a cold winter with extreme low water levels. The stormy period caused a large loss of species from plots (95 +/- 5% SE) at the most wave-exposed site, resulting in a low species number per plot (0.8 +/- 0.2) the following summer. During the three following years the mean species number increased to 3.6 +/- 0.2. The cold winter caused high species turnover and increased species number per plot at the two most wave-exposed sites. The species turnover at the sheltered site was highest in the two years with low water level in May, possibly due to increased waterfowl herbivory. Annuals, loosely anchored and highly reproductive species had significantly higher plot colonization rates and lower persistence than perennials, well-anchored species and species with none or low reproduction. The extent of lateral growth had no significant effect on colonization or persistence. Although these disturbances have a large effect on the dynamics, species mobility was also high in other years. Relative to other, similar, studies in terrestrial vegetation mean persistence in plots was remarkably low and mean mobility and species turnover rates were very high.																			1100-9233	1654-1103				JUN	2000	11	3					425	432		10.2307/3236635	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3236635													WOS:000088512900012

The net deposition of PCB included the wet, dry and vapor deposition, less any evaporation. The measurements were made on ice cores collected from the frozen surface of Lake Huron late in the ice seasons of 1978 and 1979. Intrusions of lake water into the accumulated deposition layer of ice and snow were not encountered. Such intrusions had complicated other attempts to use this method. Possible reasons for not encountering them in this study were discussed. For Saginaw Bay, a net deposition rate of 2.0 gm/km2 per mo. of PCB to the ice was found for the winters of 1977-1978 and 1978-1979. Upon ice break-up and thaw in the spring, all PCB accumulated on the ice likely entered the bay. For inner Saginaw Bay, this would have been 8 kg in March, 1978, and 6.5 kg in March, 1979.																			0380-1330						1983	9	1					92	96		10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71876-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71876-9													WOS:A1983QG13100013

Seasonal patterns and responses to an extreme climate event of rotifers community in a shallow eutrophic Pampean lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Shallow lakes of temperate areas experience seasonal and inter-annual variability in weather conditions, impacting on their biological communities. Here, we studied the temporal fluctuation of the zooplankton community in a highly eutrophic shallow lake, Laguna ChascomA(0)s. Rotifers and the cyclopoid copepod Acanthocyclops robustus dominated the community. The most important rotifers were Brachionus caudatus, B. havanaensis, and Keratella tropica. The abundance of the two Brachionus species reached maximum values in late summer/early autumn. In contrast, K. tropica and A. robustus did not display seasonal patterns. A prolonged period of low water temperature resulted in a massive fish winterkill event (in 2007), which seemingly allowed the development of unusually dense populations of cladocerans. We used vector autoregressive models to analyze the rotifer time series. The model accounted for 76% of the variance in rotifer abundance and provided evidence of their dependence on temperature and chlorophyll a. In addition, the impact of the fish winterkill on rotifer abundance could be assessed through intervention analysis. The evidence collected here suggests that the zooplankton community structure is controlled by fish planktivory, while rotifers population dynamics are mostly driven by temperature and available food.

A comprehensive examination of the hydroclimatic variations at the transboundary level is essential for the development of any adaptation or mitigation plans to deal with the negative effects of climate change. This research paper examines the hydroclimatic factors that contribute to the desiccation of the Doosti Dam's basin in the transboundary area using multisensor satellite data from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The Mann-Kendall and Sens slope estimator test was applied to the satellite datasets to analyse the spatial and temporal variation of the hydroclimate variables and their trend over the transboundary area for 18 years from 2004 to 2021 (as the dam began operating in 2005). Statistical analysis results showed decreasing trends in temperature and an increase in rainfall with respect to station-observed available data. Evapotranspiration and irrigated area development followed the increasing pattern and a slight decrease in snow cover. The results confirmed a large expansion of the irrigated area, especially during the winter growing season. The increase in irrigated cultivated areas during both winter and summer seasons is possibly the main reason for the diversion of water to meet the irrigation requirements of the developed agriculture areas. The approach followed in this study could be applied to any location around the globe to evaluate the hydrological conditions and spatiotemporal changes in response to climate change, trend analysis and human activities.

J	Chu, PC; Li, RF				Chu, PC; Li, RF			South China Sea isopycnal-surface circulation	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY												This paper investigates the seasonal variabilities of the South China Sea isopycnal-surface circulations and of the Kuroshio intrusion through the Luzon Strait using the U.S. Navy's climatological temperature and salinity dataset (public domain) with 1/2 degrees x 1/2 degrees resolution by the P-vector method. The representative pattern is a persistent basin-scale cyclonic circulation away from the surface, and a seasonally varying circulation with a weak anti-cylonic gyre in the summer and a strong cyclonic gyre in the winter near the surface. This pattern is consistent with a classical view of mean cyclonic circulation in large stratified lakes and semienclosed marginal seas by Emery and Csanady and with a recent numerical simulation using the navy's Layered Ocean Model by Metzger and Hurlburt. The computed monthly volume transport through the Luzon Strait is negative (inflow) all year round with a minimum value of -13.7 Sv in February (strongest intrusion) and a maximum value of -1.4 Sv in September (weakest intrusion). The annual mean transport is -6.5 Sv (intrusion).

Seasonal shifts in diel vertical migrations by lake-dwelling coastal cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii, reflect thermal regimes and prey distributions	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Lakes provide important habitat for salmonids that may use them as a primary feeding area between periods of reproduction. The seasonal changes in vertical thermal structure in lakes can affect the distribution of salmonids on seasonal and diel time scales as they search for, consume, and digest prey that also exploits the water column's distribution of food, temperature and light. Our goal was to analyse the vertical distribution of wild, native coastal cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii clarkii) in Lake Washington on daily and seasonal time scales. This lake is stratified in the summer and isothermal in winter, allowing us to compare vertical movements between periods with and without thermal structure in water 50 m deep. We predicted that trout would be deeper in the water column during stratified months and shallower during isothermal months, and shallower at night than in the day. Overall, the trout showed these patterns in the depths and temperatures they occupied, tending to be within or below the thermocline in the summer but not in the coolest water available, and closer to the surface when the lake was isothermal. The trout were also closer to the surface at night and deeper during the day. The vertical range of these diel movements shifted with the seasons-deepest in October, as the thermocline deepened and weakened, and shallowest in January when the lake was isothermal. These seasonal and diel vertical distribution patterns by the trout optimise metabolism for growth, and facilitate feeding on planktivorous fishes that also show seasonal and diel vertical distribution changes.

J	Gvirtzman, H; Garven, G; Gvirtzman, G				Gvirtzman, H; Garven, G; Gvirtzman, G			Hydrogeological modeling of the saline hot springs at the Sea of Galilee, Israel	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Meteoric fresh groundwater from shallow aquifers and hot brines from deep aquifers mix while emerging from several springs along the western coast of the Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake located within the Dead Sea Rift Valley, Israel. After the rainy season, when elevations of the groundwater table rise in the regional aquifers and discharge rates of springs increase, solute concentrations decrease at Tabha springs but, surprisingly, increase at Fulya springs, apparently suggesting two different salinization mechanisms. Two detailed geologic cross sections were constructed, one across the rift valley at Tabha and a second at Fulya, each about 6 km deep and 70 km long. The hydrodynamics in these cross sections were analyzed using a two-dimensional finite element code that solves the coupled variable-density groundwater flow and heat transfer equations. Numerical simulations indicate that a topography-driven flow model explains both spring systems, and the opposite salinity behavior results from the different hydrogeological configurations of the two subsurface drainage basins. At Fulya, both aquifers, the shallow one and the deeper one, are partially phreatic, whereas at Tabha, the deeper aquifer is totally confined. The response of springs to changes in elevation of groundwater table were simulated, reproducing field observations. This analysis has implications for the management scheme for the lake and its surrounding aquifers.																			0043-1397					MAY	1997	33	5					913	926		10.1029/96WR03191	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/96WR03191													WOS:A1997WX37800001
J	Lürling, M; van Oosterhout, F				Lurling, Miquel; van Oosterhout, Frank			Case study on the efficacy of a lanthanum-enriched clay (Phoslock®) in controlling eutrophication in Lake Het Groene Eiland (The Netherlands)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Het Groene Eiland was created in the beginning of 2008 by construction of dikes for isolating it from the surrounding 220-ha water body. This so-called claustrum of 5 ha was treated using lanthanum-modified clay (Phoslock(A (R))) to control eutrophication and mitigate cyanobacterial nuisance. Cyanobacteria chlorophyll-a were significantly lower in the claustrum than those in the reference water body, where a massive bloom developed in summer, 2008. However, PO4-P and TP did not statistically differ in these two waters. TN and NO3-N were significantly lower in the claustrum, where dense submerged macrophytes beds developed. Lanthanum concentrations were elevated after the applications of the modified clay in the claustrum, but filterable lanthanum dropped rapidly below the Dutch standard of 10.1 mu g l(-1). During winter, dozens of Canada geese resided at the claustrum. Geese droppings contained an average of 2 mg PO4-P g(-1) dry weight and 12 mg NH3-N g(-1) dry weight and might present a growing source of nutrients to the water. Constructing the claustrum enabled unrestricted bathing in subsequent three summers, as no swimming bans had to be issued due to cyanobacteria blooms. However, the role of the modified clay in this positive outcome remains unclear, and longevity of the measures questionable.

However, it has deteriorated as a result of urban, industrial, and farming pollution. It is highly eutrophic, and its sediment contains persistent pollutants, such as heavy metals. In anoxic sediments, sulphides represent an important binding phase for heavy metals. In this study, acid volatile sulphide (AVS) and simultaneously extracted metals (SEM) were analyzed in surface sediment extracted from Lake Albufera; organic matter and total metals were also analyzed. Twelve sites were sampled in each of three sampling campaigns conducted in March and September 2007 and September 2008. The results revealed elevated organic matter contents varying between 6.9 and 16.7%. The concentrations of AVS in the lake were high, ranging from 8.5 to 48.5 mu mol/g; the lowest concentrations were found in the central sites. The AVS results displayed significant differences between the samples from the winter and summer of 2007 (p < 0.05) but not between the two summer samples. The results obtained for SEM varied from 1.4 to 4.8 mu mol/g. The difference SEM-AVS was less than zero for all sampling locations and campaigns, indicating the existence of a sulphide pool able to bind metals.

J	Wagner, A; Benndorf, J				Wagner, Annekatrin; Benndorf, Juergen			Climate-driven warming during spring destabilises a Daphnia population:: a mechanistic food web approach	OECOLOGIA												Temperature-driven changes in interactions between populations are crucial to the estimation of the impact of global warming on aquatic food webs. We analysed inter-annual variability in two data sets from Bautzen reservoir, Germany. In a long-term data set (1981-1999) we examined the pelagic phenology of Daphnia galeata, a keystone species, the invertebrate predator Leptodora kindtii, phytoplankton and Secchi depth in relation to water temperature and the North Atlantic Oscillation index. In a short-term data set (1995-1998) we examined food web relations, particularly the consumption of D. galeata by young-of-the-year (YOY) percids and L. kindtii and rates of population change of D. galeata (abundance, recruitment pattern and non-consumptive mortality). The start of the clear-water stage (CWS) was correlated with winter temperatures. It started 5.8 days earlier per degree warming after warm winters (mean January-March temperature >= 2.5 degrees C) compared to cold winters (mean temperature < 2.5 degrees C). However, the end of the CWS remained relatively constant. Predation by L. kindtii and YOY percids on D. galeata started distinctly earlier, i.e. by 13.0 and 6.5 days per degree warming, respectively, in years when the average May temperature was high (>= 14 degrees C) compared to years when it was low (< 14 degrees C). Significant reductions of Daphnia abundance in midsummer occurred only in years in which the mean May temperature exceeded 14 degrees C. This temperature regime resulted in a match of over-exploitation of food resources by Daphnia during the CWS and strong predation by YOY percids and L. kindtii. Consumptive mortality increased at higher rates with a rise in temperature than net recruitment, resulting in lower Daphnia densities at the end of the CWS. Our data suggest that even low warming by 1.7 degrees C during a short, but critical seasonal period, resulting in the coincidence of two or more factors adversely affecting a keystone species, such as Daphnia, may induce changes in whole lake food webs and thus alter entire ecosystems.																			0029-8549					MAR	2007	151	2					351	364		10.1007/s00442-006-0554-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-006-0554-5								17120058					WOS:000244302500017
J	Nicolle, A; Hansson, LA; Brönmark, C				Nicolle, Alice; Hansson, Lars-Anders; Bronmark, Christer			Habitat structure and juvenile fish ontogeny shape zooplankton spring dynamics	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Macrophytes in shallow lakes have the potential to alter fish-zooplankton interactions considerably. How far predation effects by newly hatched fish (0+ fish) on zooplankton are influenced by different types of aquatic vegetation, and how effects change during the first weeks of fish ontogeny remains, however, less clear. In order to address these issues, we examined the predation effects of 0+ fish on zooplankton in three different habitats during spring and summer in a shallow, eutrophic lake in Sweden. Zooplankton and fish samples were taken along the reed vegetation, in a shallow, unvegetated part of the lake and above dense, submersed vegetation to relate 0+ fish predation effects to vegetation complexity. All the size classes of zooplankton decreased when 0+ fish started to feed on them in all the different habitats. The magnitude of predation effects depended, however, on both the size of zooplankton and the complexity of the vegetation. While small cladocerans could maintain stable populations in the dense Chara vegetation after 0+ fish had started to feed on them, medium and large-sized zooplankton disappeared from all the habitats. Our results suggest that only small cladocerans can use dense vegetation as a refuge against 0+ fish predation, while medium and large zooplankton are not safe from 0+ fish predation in any habitat.					; Hansson, Lars-Anders/HCI-2735-2022	Hansson, Lars-Anders/0000-0002-3035-1317; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2010	652	1					119	125		10.1007/s10750-010-0323-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0323-7													WOS:000280087900010
J	Mezquita, F; Boronat, MD; Miracle, MR				Mezquita, F; Boronat, MD; Miracle, MR			The life history of Cyclocypris ovum (Ostracoda) in a permanent karstic lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												We studied the life history of Cyclocypris ovum, a small candonid ostracod, in a Spanish mountain karstic lake (Lake La Cruz). Samples were collected from the littoral area of the lake between June 1996 and December 1998 and the relative abundances of all developmental instars were analysed. Hatching took place between November and May and juvenile development lasted around 6 months; adult life-span was 6-8 months. In summer, a sharp decline in adult population densities was observed, and juveniles completely disappeared until the next hatching period. This population decline is probably a result of mortality, and the commencement of dormancy in immature adults, which may move towards the bottom to enter dormancy buried in the sediments. These processes may be triggered by the combined effects of summer whiting and an increase in water temperature above 20 degreesC. Densities of mature adults progressively increase in autumn, suggesting that the end of dormancy is stimulated by decreasing temperatures and turbulence. In this way, females lay eggs that will hatch mainly during the overturn period. In permanent waters, dormancy of an immature adult stage which optimises reproduction and growth under favourable conditions, could be more adaptive than resting egg production (as commonly occurs in ostracods inhabiting temporary waters). Further research is needed to know to what extent temperature variability and calcium carbonate precipitation affect the life history of this small, nektonic ostracod, which is common in northern Europe but rather rare at low altitudes in the Iberian Peninsula.

In order to understand its long-term variability and to infer linkages between precipitation and atmospheric and oceanic systems, we conducted a thorough sedimentary and geochemical study on a composite core retrieved in lake Son Kul (central Kyrgyzstan). A multi-proxy approach was conducted on lake sediments based on grain size analyses, magnetic susceptibility, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and carbon and oxygen isotope analyses on bulk and biogenic materials (ostracoda and molluscs shells) at a resolution equivalent to ca 40 years, aiming to characterise the sequence of palaeolimnological changes in Son Kul. As indicated by delta O-18 record of bulk carbonates, mainly consisting of aragonite, the Holocene hydrological balance was negative during most of time, suggesting an excess of evaporation (E) over precipitation (P). Limnological conditions fluctuated rapidly before 5000 cal yr BP indicating significant changes in regional hydrology and climate. In particular, the long-term negative hydrological balance was impeded by several short stages with marked increase of precipitation, lasting several decades to a few centuries (e.g., 8300-8200, 6900-6700, 6300-6100, 5500-5400, 5300-5200 and 3100 -3000 cal yr BP). Precipitation changes as inferred from 8180 data are also documented by increased minerogenic detritus and higher TOC. We propose that the seasonal pattern of precipitation varied transiently in western Central Asia during the Holocene, although evaporation changes may also account for the rapid changes observed in delta O-18 data. When the annual water balance was less critical (P <= E), the excess of water might be ascribed to increased precipitation during cold seasons mainly because winter precipitation has more negative delta O-18 than its summer equivalent. Conversely, when the annual water balance is negative (P E), the moisture was mainly delivered during the warm season, as between 5000 and 2000 cal yr BP. Our results thus imply that moisture sources could have changed as well during the Holocene. Moisture was delivered as today mainly during summer from the extended Caspian-Aral Basin and eastern Mediterranean, although Arctic and even North Atlantic seas might be important moisture sources when seasonal precipitation was dominated by winter precipitation. We hypothesise that warming Arctic and North Atlantic seas were important for the North Hemisphere circulation during the cold season. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	PENNAK, RW				PENNAK, RW			AN UNUSUAL ALGAL NUISANCE IN A COLORADO MOUNTAIN LAKE	ECOLOGY												Beginning in 1946 an algal bloom formed on Howard Lake, in the montane zone of n. Colorado. It began as early as April and persisted until autumn, and consisted mostly of Plectonema nostocorum and Anacystis marginata. The algae originated as an extremely loose mat of intermingled microscopic gelatinous colonies on the entire sand bottom of the lake. During the daytime small masses floated to the surface and drifted to shore where they formed a persistent floating mat from 10 to 30 cm. thick and extending out 3-8 m. from the water''s edge. High winds deposited portions of this mat on shore where they dried as irregular, hard, crust-like masses 7-60 cm. in diam. and 3-10 cm. thick. The bloom had a weak, inoffensive odor. In the summer of 1948 two treatments with CUSO4 eliminated the bloom. It is thought that the onset of the bloom was a fortuitous event in the eutrophication cycle of the lake resulting from the disappearance of limiting factors.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1949	30	2					245	247		10.2307/1931192	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1931192													WOS:A1949XW59800012

New hydrological insights for the region: Results indicated that clean water transfer could dramatically increase flow rate and decrease nutrient concentrations near the water transfer inlets, while the grade level of lake water quality is not changed. The degree of improvement in water quality parameters is not always proportional to lake flow rate. A clean water transfer through the eastern route (ZH) has the largest improvement effect on the average flow rate and water quality (total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)) of the entire lake. Winter water transfer improves TN and TP better than summer, while the opposite for ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N). Decrease of wind speed is essential for mitigating nutrient accumulation in western lake's heavily polluted bay through weakening the reverse circulation and the northwest flow. Water transfer operations are revealed to improve water quality in Lake Chaohu: conduct water transfer through ZH in winter, strictly control NH3-N concentration in the donating water, and combine the effects of the low east wind.

J	Valley, RD; Heiskary, S				Valley, Ray D.; Heiskary, Steve			Short-term declines in curlyleaf pondweed in Minnesota: potential influences of snowfall	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Curlyleaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus) is a long-established, nonnative aquatic plant common throughout southern and central Minnesota that is thought to be expanding northward. Curlyleaf pondweed typically grows abundantly in spring in productive lakes and then senesces in midsummer, often followed by algae blooms. We report observations of widespread, short-term declines in curlyleaf pondweed cover that appear linked to winter snow depth on frozen lakes. These findings suggest that climate change may greatly affect habitat suitability for curlyleaf pondweed. As Minnesota lakes warm with less snow cover limiting light penetration, curlyleaf pondweed growth will likely increase. These observations form the foundation for targeted follow up studies that more precisely describe conditions limiting the growth and expansion of curlyleaf pondweed in north-temperate, North American lakes.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2012	28	4					338	345		10.1080/07438141.2012.745911	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2012.745911													WOS:000313322400009

However, despite the potential of organic spring deposits a number of studies demonstrate complications in the application of standard C-14 techniques which has, in several cases, led to confusing chronologies. This implies that dynamic carbon pathways commonly occur within spring systems. Because of the importance of springs as critical palaeoenvironmental archives, this study sought to better understand the behaviour of C-14 and other radionuclides used in geochronology within organic springs, and ultimately, establish a protocol for building reliable chronologies in these environments. To do this, we utilised multiple geochronological methodologies to investigate cores collected from three springs in the Kimberley region of northwest Australia. This included C-14 dating of different carbon fractions, Pb-210 dating, the application of Pu239+24, and novel, high spatial resolution, luminescence techniques as indicators of geochronological structure. The natural sensitivity corrected luminescence (L-n/T-n) signal indicated the studied springs contained a relatively complete stratigraphic record, however C-14 results were found to be convoluted by contamination attributed to a combination of roots, groundwater fluctuations and allochthonous input of "old" carbon affecting ages. Whilst it was found that no single carbon fraction is universally reliable in dynamic spring environments, dating the stable polycyclic aromatic carbon (SPAC), isolated by hydrogen pyrolysis (HyPy) pre-treatment, appeared to remove the effects of post-depositional modification which otherwise perturbed the age of carbon fractions with respect to sedimentary development of the spring. By contrast, the ability of Pb-21 and Pu239+24 to provide detailed chronologies for recent spring sediments (i.e. the past 100 years) was found to be complicated due to the behaviour of springs as an open system with regards to uranium. Therefore, it may not be possible to construct Pb-210 chronologies in many spring environments. Overall, the results of this study indicate that it is possible to construct C-14 based chronologies in spring systems, however it is necessary to understand the effects of physical and biological processes within springs on C-14 pathways. In particular, the application of HyPy pre-treatment of SPAC appears to offer a viable approach to constructing chronologies in these environments. Furthermore, although this study pertains to springs, the sources of geochronological complexity described here are not exclusive to these systems and our results are therefore more widely applicable.					; Moss, Patrick/AFM-9408-2022; McGowan, Hamish/AAD-9607-2021; Marx, Samuel/D-1122-2013; Heijnis, Hendrik/A-6673-2010	Moss, Patrick/0000-0003-1546-9242; Heijnis, Hendrik/0000-0002-7601-3452; Hotchkis, Michael/0000-0003-2321-0222; Haig, Jordahna/0000-0003-1350-522X; Marx, Samuel/0000-0003-2333-5260													1871-1014	1878-0350				FEB	2018	43						50	71		10.1016/j.quageo.2017.10.002	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quageo.2017.10.002													WOS:000418981800005

New insights into the 21 November 2000 tsunami in West Greenland from analyses of the tree-ring structure of Salix glauca	POLISH POLAR RESEARCH												We test the application of dendrochronological methods for dating and assessing the environmental impacts of tsunamis in polar regions, using an example of the 21 November 2000 landslide-generated tsunami in Vaigat Strait (Sullorsuaq Strait), West Greenland. The studied tsunami inundated a c. 130 m-wide coastal plain with seawater, caused erosion of beaches and top soil and covered the area with an up to 35 cm-thick layer of tsunami deposits composed of sand and gravel. Samples of living shrub, Salix glauca (greyleaf willow) were collected in 2012 from tsunami-flooded and non-flooded sites. The tree-ring analyses reveal unambiguously that the tsunami-impacted area was immediately colonized during the following summer by rapidly growing shrubs, whilst one of our control site specimens records evidence for damage that dates to the time of the tsunami. This demonstrates the potential for dendrochronological methods to act as a precise tool for the dating of Arctic paleotsunamis, as well as rapid post-tsunami ecosystem recovery. The reference site shrubs were likely damaged by solifluction in the autumn 2000 AD that was triggered by high seasonal rainfall, which was itself a probable contributory factor to the tsunami-generating landslide.					; Strzelecki, Mateusz/Y-9851-2019; Szczuciński, Witold/A-3612-2008; Buchwal, Agata/F-5516-2013; Szczucinski, Witold/A-3612-2008	Long, Antony/0000-0002-7605-1205; Buchwal, Agata/0000-0001-6879-6656; Szczucinski, Witold/0000-0003-2466-2263; Strzelecki, Mateusz C/0000-0003-0479-3565													0138-0338	2081-8262					2015	36	1					51	65		10.1515/popore-2015-0005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/popore-2015-0005													WOS:000351852600003

Ray; Winn, Brad			Seasonal abundance of nonbreeding Piping Plovers on a Georgia barrier island	JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY												Although breeding populations of Piping Plovers are well studied, their winter distribution is less clear. We studied the seasonal abundance of nonbreeding Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) during the winters of 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 on Little St. Simons Island (LSSI), Georgia. Our objectives were to determine the relative abundance of individuals from three breeding populations at LSSI, and identify possible differences among populations in arrival time, winter movements, or departure time. We observed up to 100 Piping Plovers during peak migration, and approximately 40 plovers wintered at LSSI. From July 2004 to May 2005, approximately 20% of the Great Lakes breeding population used LSSI. Plovers were not present at LSSI during June. All breeding populations of Piping Plovers had similar patterns of temporal occurrence on LSSI, suggesting no need for population-specific management plans at this site. Our results suggest that LSSI is among the most important wintering sites on the Atlantic coast for Piping Plovers, especially for individuals from the endangered Great Lakes population.																			0273-8570					DEC	2007	78	4					420	427		10.1111/j.1557-9263.2007.00134.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1557-9263.2007.00134.x													WOS:000251415900011

Bacterioplankton production was measured in the water columns of two ultra-oligotrophic, freshwater Antarctic lakes (Crooked Lake and Lake Druzhby) during an annual cycle. In both lakes bacterial production, measured by the incorporation of [H-3] thymidine, continued in winter and showed a cycle over the year. The range of production was between 0 and 479 ng C L-1 h(-1) in Crooked Lake and 0-354 ng L-1 h(-1) in Lake Druzhby. 2. Abundance and mean cell volume both varied, producing marked changes in biomass during the year, with highest biomass occurring in the winter and early spring. Biomass showed similar seasonal trends in both lakes. 3. For most of the year inorganic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus were detectable in the water columns of the lakes and were unlikely to have limited bacterial production. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was below 3000 mug L-1. Dissolved amino acids and carbohydrates contributed 5-25% of the DOC pool in Crooked Lake and 5-64% in Lake Druzhby. Dissolved carbohydrates were consistently low, suggesting that this may have been the preferred carbon substrate for bacterioplankton. 4. Aggregate associated bacteria had higher mean cell volume, abundances and production than freely suspended bacteria in Lake Druzhby, while in Crooked Lake aggregate associated bacteria consistently had higher mean cell volumes than free bacteria, but abundance and production were on occasion higher in free bacteria compared with aggregate associated communities. 5. The data indicated that production is limited by continuous low temperatures and the limited availability of suitable DOC substrate. However, the bacterioplankton functions year round, responding to factors other than temperature.					jones, davey/C-7411-2011; QUAYLE, WENDY/Q-3719-2016	QUAYLE, WENDY/0000-0003-0622-1915													0046-5070					JUN	2004	49	6					735	744		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01221.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01221.x													WOS:000221492000005

Retrieval of Snow Water Equivalent by the Precipitation Imaging Package (PIP) in the Northern Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY												Performance of the Precipitation Imaging Package (PIP) for estimating the snow water equivalent (SWE) is evaluated through a comparative study with the collocated National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration National Weather Service snow stake field measurements. The PIP together with a vertically pointing radar, a weighing bucket gauge, and a laser-optical disdrometer was deployed at the NWS Marquette, Michigan, office building for a long-term field study supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Global Precipitation Measurement mission Ground Validation program. The site was also equipped with a weather station. During the 2017/18 winter, the PIP functioned nearly uninterrupted at frigid temperatures accumulating 2345.8 mm of geometric snow depth over a total of 499 h. This long record consists of 30 events, and the PIP-retrieved and snow stake field measured SWE differed less than 15% in every event. Two of the major events with the longest duration and the highest accumulation are examined in detail. The particle mass with a given diameter was much lower during a shallow, colder, uniform lake-effect event than in the deep, less cold, and variable synoptic event. This study demonstrated that the PIP is a robust instrument for operational use, and is reliable for deriving the bulk properties of falling snow.

J	García-Berthou, E				García-Berthou, E			Food of introduced mosquitofish:: ontogenetic diet shift and prey selection	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki of Lake Banyoles, Catalonia, Spain, were strictly littoral. Their population was dominated by females throughout the year, except in spring when males were more common. Their diet was based on littoral cladocerans, particularly Chydorus sphaericus, Scapholeberis ramneri, Ceriodaphnia reticulata, and Pleuroxus laevis, and nematoceran (basically chironomid) adults. There was a large variety of prey of terrestrial (collembolans, ants) or aquatic neustonic origin (S. ramneri, emerging nematoceran adults), showing the microhabitat of mosquitofish closely linked to the water surface. In contrast to other studies, terrestrial insects were not especially important in summer. In addition to seasonal and between-site variation, there was an ontogenetic diet shift from microcrustaceans, particularly cladocerans (smallest fish also using diatoms and copepod nauplii) to larger prey, namely nematoceran adults. However, there was an unusual, inverse relationship between fish length and the size of two prey (S. ramneri and the collembolan Sminthurides sp.), parallelling the overall increase in mean prey size.

We investigate the temporal and spatial characteristics of the ECEs on the TP and the possible effects of Arctic sea ice. The daily observed minimum air temperature at 73 meteorological stations on the TP during 1980-2018 and the BCC_AGCM3_MR model are used. Our results show that the main mode of winter ECEs over the TP exhibits the same spatial variation and interannual variability across the whole region and is affected by two wave trains originating from the Arctic. The southern wave train is controlled by the sea ice in the Beaufort Sea. It initiates in the Norwegian Sea, and then passes through the North Atlantic Ocean, the Arabian Sea, and the Bay of Bengal along the subtropical westerly jet stream. It enters the TP from the south and brings warm, humid air from the oceans. By contrast, the northern wave train is controlled by the sea ice in the Laptev Sea. It originates from the Barents and Kara seas, passes through Lake Baikal, and enters the TP from the north, bringing dry and cold air. A decrease in the sea ice in the Beaufort Sea causes positive potential height anomalies in the Arctic. This change enhances the pressure gradient between the Artic and the mid-latitudes, leading to westerly winds in the northern TP, which block the intrusion of cold air into the south. By contrast, a decrease in the sea ice in the Laptev Sea causes negative potential height anomalies in the Artic. This change reduces the pressure gradient between the Artic and the mid-latitudes, leading to easterly winds to the north of the TP, which favors the southward intrusion of cold polar air. A continuous decrease in the amount of sea ice in the Beaufort Sea would reduce the frequency of ECEs over the TP and further aggravate TP warming in winter.																			0930-7575	1432-0894				MAY	2022	58	9-10					2281	2292		10.1007/s00382-021-06007-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-021-06007-0		OCT 2021											WOS:000712944400005

Within-winter movements may contribute to the spreading of diseases, such as avian influenza, outside the actual migration period. The Common Pochard Aythya ferina seems to be particularly sensitive to infection with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 and, consequently, could play an important role as vectors for the disease. We describe here the within-winter movements of Pochards in Europe in relation to topography, climate, sex and age. We analysed data provided by the Euring data bank on 201 individuals for which records from different locations from the same winter (December-February) were available. The distances and directions moved within the winter varied markedly between regions, which could be ascribed to the differing topography (coast lines, Alps). We found no significant differences in terms of distances and directions moved between the sexes and only weak indications of differences between the age classes. In Switzerland, juveniles moved in more westerly directions than adults. During relatively mild winters, winter harshness had no effect on the distances travelled, but in cold winters, a positive relationship was observed, a pattern possibly triggered by the freezing of lakes. Winter harshness did not influence the directions of the movement. About 41% (83/201) of the Pochards that were recovered at least 1 km from the ringing site had moved more than 200 km. A substantial number of birds moved between central/southern Europe and the north-western coast of mainland Europe, and between the north-western coast of mainland Europe and Great Britain, whereas no direct exchange between Great Britain and central/southern Europe was observed. Within-winter movements of Pochards seem to be a common phenomenon in all years and possibly occur as a response to the depletion of food resources. This high tendency to move could potentially contribute to the spread of bird-transmitted diseases outside the actual migration period.					; Keller, Irene/F-6043-2012	Korner-Nievergelt, Franzi/0000-0001-9081-3563; 													0021-8375	1439-0361				APR	2009	150	2					483	494		10.1007/s10336-008-0367-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-008-0367-x													WOS:000264043500016
J	Hebert, CE				Hebert, CE			Winter severity affects migration and contaminant accumulation in northern Great Lakes Herring Gulls	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Herring Gull band returns were analyzed from 1962 to 1995. Winter severity was found to affect the winter distribution of Herring Gulls banded as flightless chicks on colonies in northern Lake Huron and northern Lake Michigan. The effects of winter severity were most pronounced in adults, followed by immatures. Little response was observed in juveniles. In adults, the proportion of band returns from southerly locations increased in response to increased winter severity. In general, concentrations of organochlorine contaminants in Herring Gull eggs collected annually from northern Great Lakes colonies increased with winter severity. However, the significance of the relationship between winter severity and organochlorine concentration was compound and colony specific. This probably reflected intercolony differences in winter migration patterns with concomitant differences in contaminant exposure during the overwintering period. With increased winter severity, gulls migrated to more contaminated southerly Great Lakes locations. After spending the winter in these areas the birds returned to their breeding colonies, transferring contaminants to their eggs. The degree to which Herring Gull eggs laid on colonies located in the northern Great Lakes reflect local contaminant bioavailability will be affected by winter severity and overwinter migration patterns.																			1051-0761					AUG	1998	8	3					669	679		10.1890/1051-0761(1998)008[0669:WSAMAC]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(1998)008[0669:WSAMAC]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000075219300012

We studied temporal variation of sediment characteristics in a floodplain lake. including concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, acid volatile sulfide and trace metals. The sampling period included a severe winter inundation and a dramatic water level drop during summer. Temporal changes were interpreted using multivariate analysis and chemical equilibrium calculations. Metal concentrations in sediment increased with depth, indicating a gradual improvement of sediment quality. In contrast, dissolved metal concentrations were highest in top layers due to mobilization from oxyhydroxides and precipitation with sulfides in deeper layers. Inundation had a mobilizing effect as it stimulated resuspension and oxygenation of sediment top layers. Water table lowering combined with organic matter decomposition led to immobilization due to sulfide formation. The chemistry of the sediments was consistent with model calculations, especially for macro-elements. The results illustrate the importance of seasonality for metal risk assessment.

However, most studies on water-related recreation values have not analyzed direct links between ecological elements providing recreation opportunities and user demands. Therefore, we implemented an ecosystem service approach to study human-nature interaction during the actual recreation visit to an urban freshwater site. We developed a conceptual model of local cultural ecosystem services (CES) to study interactions between recreation supply and demand. We were interested in seasonality of water-related recreation supply, and the different demands of summer and off-summer visitors. We chose urban Lake Kuusijarvi in the city of Vantaa, Finland, as our case study area, because it is a popular outdoor recreation area around the year. We identified 14 key elements of the supply of local CES and 22 socio-cultural values for the demand for local CES. We found little seasonal change in recreation supply, but the socio-demographic characteristics and demands of summer and off-summer visitors varied significantly. Demand was higher and more diverse during the summer season, while off-summer visitors were more specific in their demands. Moreover, some visitors feared that some socio-cultural values can be lost if the recreational use of the lake area increases. We discuss our findings in a theoretical context focusing especially on interactions between supply and demand of local CES at Lake Kuusijarvi.

While abiotic drivers have been identified as contributors to CWCBs, the role of biotic factors-particularly the adaptation induced by the shifts in intraspecific trait distributions-in this process remains largely unexplored. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the thermal history of cyanobacteria affects their thermal adaptations by reshaping the distribution of optimum growth temperature (T opt). Using a trait-based phytoplankton model coupled with a one-dimensional lake model, we simulated cyanobacteria dynamics over 364 days in a large, eutrophic, shallow lake recently experiencing CWCBs. The model demonstrated that T opt diversification promotes cold-adapted strains, leading to CWCBs while mitigating summer blooms. This occurs because the thermal response of T opt-diverse populations depends on their T opt distribution, which is determined by past temperature sequence, allowing T opt-diverse populations to retain a 'memory' of temperatures preceding summer. Consequently, increased summer temperatures inhibit these cold-adapted populations, challenging the prevailing cyanobacteria-temperature paradigm, which suggests that high temperatures universally favor cyanobacteria. These findings reveal that models assuming fixed traits may misrepresent cyanobacterial dynamics under climate change, highlighting the necessity of incorporating trait diversity into predictive frameworks for improved forecasting and to support adaptive lake management strategies.

Histopathological alterations induced by marine environmental pollutants on the bivalve Cerastoderma glaucum (Bruguiere 1789) from Temsah Lake, Suez Canal, Egypt	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Bivalves are considered a main consumed matrix for coastal communities worldwide and classified as hyperaccumulators of pollutants. The present study aims to determine some micro-organisms, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and okadaic acid (OA) levels in Cerastoderma glaucum collected from Temsah Lake, Egypt, and their induction through histopathological damage and caspase-3 protein expression. During the autumn, it was found different types of biological and chemical pollutants, especially benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) that accumulated in C. glaucum soft tissues and exceeded the safety limit for shellfish consumption. Dioxin-like PCB3 was predominant in C. glaucum soft tissues during autumn, but the total levels of PCBs in these tissues have not exceeded the permissible limit. Chlorophyll-a (Chl. a), nutrient concentrations, and Prorocentrum lima dinoflagellates in the water significantly increased during autumn. High P. lima abundance was confirmed by high OA in the soft tissues during this season compared to the other seasons. The measured contaminants may render C. glaucum more susceptible to bacterial and fungal infections. The autumn season showed a significant increase in the colony-forming units (CFU). C. glaucum showed calcification abnormalities and adhering of abnormal brown organic material to the inner surface of the shell valves, which was related to poor water conditions and Vibrio infection. Damages or injuries on gills and digestive gland tissues indicated an impact of the pollutants on C. glaucum. Also, high expressions of caspase-3 were recorded in these tissues during all the seasons. So, C. glaucum cockles, collected from Temsah Lake, may induce serious diseases to consumers, especially when eaten raw or insufficient cooking.

J	Bergström, I; Kortelainen, P; Sarvala, J; Salonen, K				Bergstrom, Irina; Kortelainen, Pirkko; Sarvala, Jouko; Salonen, Kalevi			Effects of temperature and sediment properties on benthic CO2 production in an oligotrophic boreal lake	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. Temperature and many other physical and chemical factors affecting CO2 production in lake sediments vary significantly both seasonally and spatially. The effects of temperature and sediment properties on benthic CO2 production were studied in in situ and in vitro experiments in the boreal oligotrophic Lake Paajarvi, southern Finland. 2. In in situ experiments, temperature of the water overlying the shallow littoral sediment varied seasonally between 0.5 and 15.7 degrees C, but in deep water (>= 20 m) the range was only 1.1-6.6 degrees C. The same exponential model (r2 = 0.70) described the temperature dependence at 1.2, 10 and 20 m depths. At 2.5 and 5 m depths, however, the slopes of the two regression models (r2 = 0.94) were identical but the intercept values were different. Sediment properties (wet, dry, mineral and organic mass) varied seasonally and with depth, but they did not explain a significantly larger proportion of variation in the CO2 output rate than temperature. 3. In in vitro experiments, there was a clear and uniform exponential dependence of CO2 production on temperature, with a 2.7-fold increase per 10 degrees C temperature rise. The temperature response (slope of regression) was always the same, but the basic value of CO2 production (intercept) varied, indicating that other factors also contributed to the benthic CO2 output rate. 4. The annual CO2 production of the sediment in Lake Paajarvi averaged 62 g CO2 m-2, the shallow littoral at 0-3 m depth releasing 114 g CO2 m-2 and deep profundal (> 15 m) 30 g CO2 m-2. On the whole lake basis, the shallow littoral at 0-3 m depth accounted for 53% and the sediment area in contact with the summer epilimnion (down to a depth c. 10 m) 75% of the estimated total annual CO2 output of the lake sediment, respectively. Of the annual production, 83% was released during the spring and summer. 5. Using the temperature-CO2 production equations and climate change scenarios we estimated that climatic warming might increase littoral benthic CO2 production in summer by nearly 30% from the period 1961-90 to the period 2071-2100.					; Kortelainen, Pirkko/AAN-7045-2020; Sarvala, Jouko/J-8962-2019	Kortelainen, Pirkko/0000-0002-1448-0688; 													0046-5070					AUG	2010	55	8					1747	1757		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02408.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02408.x													WOS:000279734300013

Habitat selection and diel distribution of the crustacean zooplankton from a shallow Mediterranean lake during the turbid and clear water phases	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The fish fauna of many shallow Mediterranean Lakes is dominated by small-bodied exotic omnivores, with potential implications for fish-zooplankton interactions still largely unknown. Here we studied diel variation in the vertical and horizontal distribution of the crustacean plankton in Lake Vela, a shallow polymictic and eutrophic lake. Diel sampling was carried out on three consecutive days along a horizontal transect, including an open-water station and a macrophyte (Nymphaea alba) bed. Since transparency is a key determinant of the predation risk posed by fish, the zooplankton sampling campaigns were conducted in both the turbid (autumn) and clear water (spring) phases. 2. In the turbid phase, most taxa were homogeneously distributed along the vertical and horizontal axes in the three consecutive days. The only exception was for copepod nauplii, which showed vertical heterogeneity, possibly as a response to invertebrate predators. 3. In the clear water phase, most zooplankton taxa displayed habitat selection. Vertically, the general response consisted of a daily vertical migration (DVM), despite the limited depth (1.6 m). Horizontally, zooplankters showed an overall preference for the pelagic zone, independent of the time of the day. Such evidence is contrary to the postulated role of macrophytes as an anti-predator refuge for the zooplankton. 4. These vertical (DVM) and horizontal (macrophyte-avoidance) patterns were particularly conspicuous for large Daphnia, suggesting that predation risk from size-selective predators (fish) was the main factor behind the spatial heterogeneity of zooplankton in the spring. Thus, the difference in the zooplankton spatial distribution pattern and habitat selection among seasons (turbid and clear water phases) seems to be mediated the predation risk from fish, which is directly related to water transparency. 5. The zooplankton in Lake Vela have anti-predator behaviour that minimises predation from fish. We hypothesise that, due to the distinct fish community of shallow Mediterranean lakes, aquatic macrophytes may not provide adequate refuge to zooplankters, as seen in northern temperate lakes.

J	Burns, DA				Burns, DA			The effects of liming an Adirondack lake watershed on downstream water chemistry - Effects of liming on stream chemistry	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Calcite treatment of chronically acidic lakes has improved fish habitat, but the effects on downstream water quality have not previously been examined. In this study, the spatial and temporal effects of watershed CaCO3 treatment on the chemistry of a lake outlet stream in the Adirondack Mountains of New York were examined. Before CaCO3 treatment, the stream was chronically acidic. During spring snowmelt before treatment, pH and acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) in the outlet stream declined, and NO, and inorganic monomeric aluminum (Al-IM) concentrations increased sharply. During that summer, SO42- and NO3-, concentrations decreased downstream, and dissolved organic carbon (DOG) concentrations and ANC increased, in association with the seasonal increase in decomposition of organic matter and the attendant SO42--reduction process. A charge-balance ANC calculation closely matched measured downstream changes in ANC in the summer and indicated that SO42--reduction was the major process contributing to summer increases in ANC. Increases in Ca2+ concentration and ANC began immediately after CaCO3 application, and within 3 months, exceeded their pretreatment values by more than 130 mu eq/L. Within 2 months after treatment, downstream decreases in Ca2+ concentration, ANC, and pH, were noted. Stream mass balances between the lake and the sampling site 1.5 km downstream revealed that the transport of all chemical constituents was dominated by conservative mixing with tributaries and ground water; however, non-conservative processes resulted in significant Ca2+ losses during the 13-month period after CaCO3 treatment. Comparison of substrate samples from the buffered outlet stream with those from its untreated tributaries showed that the percentage of cation-exchange sites occupied by Ca2+, as well as non-exchangeable Ca, were higher in the outlet-stream substrate than in tributary-stream substrate. Mass-balance data for Ca2+, H+, Al-IM, and DOC revealed net downstream losses of these constituents and indicated that a reasonable set of hypothesized reactions involving Al-IM, HCO3-, Ca2+, SO42-, NO3-, and DOC could have caused the measured changes in stream acid/base chemistry. In the summer, the sharp decrease in ANC continued despite significant downstream decreases in SO42- concentrations. After CaCO3 treatment, reduction of SO42- was only a minor contributor to ANC changes relative to those caused by Ca2+ dilution from acidic tributaries and acidic ground water, and Ca2+ interactions with stream substrate.

Here, we detected human rotavirus A (HRVA) circulating in two wastewater treatment plants, two lakes, irrigation water and a wastewater landfill located in Riyadh. VP7-derived surface protein sequences were assessed by phylogenetic analyses and inspection of thermotolerance-mediated secondary structure and seasonal variation. HRVA was most prevalent at An-Nazim wastewater landfill (AN-WWLF; 63.89%). Phylogenetic analyzes revealed the predominance of HRVA G2 lineage for the first time in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, a single HRVA sequence (2B64I-ANLF3/2018) was recovered at 45 degrees C from AN-WWLF; secondary structure prediction indicated that this sequence was thermotolerant with a high hydrophobicity, an absence of Ramachandran outliers, and a higher content of proline patches on the protein surface. Varied relationships were significantly observed between sampling areas influenced by temperature ranges (p<0.05). HRVA prevalence was influenced by seasonal variations, favoring moderate temperatures in late autumn and early winter in all locations. However, a significant temperature impact was detected in Wadi-Hanifah Lake (p=0.01). Our study extends the knowledge of currently circulating HRVA genotypes, and indicates the probable emergence of thermotolerant strains and seasonally mediated HRVA prevalence.

Spawning migration, sex-specific home ranges, and seasonal site fidelity in a lacustrine population of Bowfin (Amia ocellicauda)	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Bowfin, Amia spp., are broadly distributed freshwater fishes native to eastern North America. Male bowfin build nuptial nests in the spring and provide parental care for eggs and young. Spawning occurs in or near wetland habitats often associated with larger bodies of water, but the literature suggests wider distribution during the growing season, such that annual movements may structure population and community dynamics. However, bowfin movements and their ecological roles are poorly known. Over 3 years, using radio telemetry, we studied movement patterns and home range size of the bowfin, Amia ocellicauda, in Oneida Lake, a large inland lake in New York State. We found female bowfin tended to range more widely than males. Furthermore, within-year structure in movement data and seasonal step-changes in relocations suggest that most bowfin exhibited migration-like movements to and from a primary spawning area in northwest Oneida Lake. After spawning (and for males, after parental care), bowfin dispersed around the western half of the lake, with some fish traversing the full extent of our study area. Analysis of home range sizes revealed high variability in how widely individuals roamed, but there was a significant tendency for females to exhibit larger home ranges than males during the spring. During the summer, there was a tendency for individual bowfin of both sexes to inhabit the same area in successive years, though males appeared to exhibit site fidelity more often than females. These data provide a new perspective on the movement ecology of bowfin.

J	Kuczynska-Kippen, N; Pronin, M				Kuczynska-Kippen, Natalia; Pronin, Malgorzata			Diversity and zooplankton species associated with certain hydroperiods and fish state in field ponds	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Human-induced impact on the biocoenoses in small water bodies within field landscape, aquatic ecosystems undergoing habitat loss, is not only restricted to trophic increase. Ponds are often used for amateur fish production, mainly carp and crucian carp. In addition, in order to limit the growth of aquatic vegetation alien fish species to native fauna, grass carp, are frequently introduced. Only temporary ponds remain entirely free of such manipulations. Therefore, changes in diversity and the occurrence of specific species can be expected in ponds representing different scenarios of fish predation FP and water regime WR. In order to establish conditions responsible for zooplankton occurrence in field ponds subjected to FP (three categories of ponds: fish-free; low fish stocking; high fish stocking) and WR (two categories of ponds: permanent vs. temporary), material was collected from the open water of six neighbouring ponds, thirteen times in 2009, covering the spring, summer and autumn. A total of 134 zooplankton taxa was recorded with rotifers (94 taxa) prevailing taxonomically over cladocerans (24) and copepods (16). A tendency of certain taxa and species diversity to group along a gradient of WR and FP was observed. Higher species diversity was attributed to fish-free ponds, partly depending on the higher contribution of macrophyte-dominated areas, which are known to support a high variation of organisms. Two groups from among the most frequent species that indicated temporary ponds were: 1/littoral-associated (e.g. Lepadella ovalis, Chydorus sphaericus) in fish-free ponds and 2/large-bodied mainly pelagic (e.g. Eudiaptomus gracilis) in low-fish ponds. Fish ponds that were of permanent character, however, had lower species richness, with a high frequency of typically eutrophic taxa such as Brachionus angularis, Keratella cochlearis f. tecta or Trichocerca pusilla. However, they were also a source of rare species such as Brachionus falcatus, Lecane tenuiseta, Ceriodaphnia dubia that occurred exclusively in these ponds compared to natural fish-free ponds, which were remnants of lost species richness. This in turn increased overall zooplankton richness in the regional aspect. Thus, the co-occurrence of temporary ponds along with fish-production targeted permanent ponds may lead to a rise in zooplankton biodiversity on a local scale. We assume therefore that not only patterns of zooplankton biodiversity but also the occurrence of particular species can be treated as a useful indicator of FP and WR in small water bodies and are crucial for conservation purposes and management of aquatic systems at regional and landscape levels.

J	Levengood, JM				Levengood, JM			Cadmium and lead in tissues of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and Wood Ducks (Aix sponsa) using the Illinois River (USA)	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Cadmium and lead concentrations were determined in the tissues of Mallards and Wood Ducks collected from two waterfowl management areas along the Illinois River, USA, during the autumn and late winter of 1997-1998. Lead concentrations in livers of Mallards were lower than previously reported, and, along with those in a small sample of Wood Duck livers, were within background levels (<2.0 mug/g wet weight). Mean concentrations of cadmium in the kidneys of Wood Ducks utilizing the Illinois River were four times greater than in after-hatch-year Mallards, and 14 times greater than in hatch-year Mallards. Concentrations of cadmium in the kidneys of Wood Ducks were comparable with those of specimens dosed with cadmium or inhabiting contaminated areas in previous studies. Wood Ducks utilizing wetlands associated with the Illinois River, and presumably other portions of the lower Great Lakes region, may be chronically exposed to cadmium. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study aims to characterize Fe-OM interactions to understand the role of Fe in promoting aggregation and transport of OM. Samples of Fe and OM were collected from water, settling material, and sediment along a gradient starting from the inlet and continuing offshore within a boreal lake. Fe speciation was determined using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and the chemical composition of OM was assessed using Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT IR) and Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). The results show a decrease in Fe and OM concentrations in the water column with increasing distance from the inlet. Winter sampling revealed a shift in Fe speciation from dominance of organically complexed Fe to an increase in Fe(oxy)hydroxide, accompanied by a loss of aromatic and carboxylate function of OM. Summer sampling revealed no significant changes along the gradient, with Fe(oxy)hydroxide and carbohydrates dominating the water phase. Interestingly, settling particles and surface sediments were dominated by Fe(oxy) hydroxides and aliphatic OM. We propose that phototransformation may be an important process that influences the interaction between Fe and OM and, as a consequence, their fate along the spatial gradient. Our study suggests a photochemically induced loss of carboxylate groups, reflected by an increased carbohydrate-to-carboxylate ratio along the gradient, particularly in winter, and generally lower levels during summer. Loss of carboxylate function promotes the formation of Fe(oxy)hydroxides, which in turn, facilitates the aggregation and sinking of OM, particularly aliphatic components. These insights contribute to a broader understanding of carbon cycling and storage in lakes. Future studies should assess the significance of photochemical processes to OM burial and it how may change given trends in Fe and OM in northern regions.					; Persson, Per/HOF-7984-2023; Herzog, Simon David/JNS-3603-2023; soares, margarida/OJU-1128-2025	Herzog, Simon David/0000-0003-2504-8070; 													0168-2563	1573-515X				DEC	2024	167	12					1533	1552		10.1007/s10533-024-01184-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-024-01184-6		OCT 2024											WOS:001331793800001

The lake lies just at the northern border of the strong Westerlies influence with dry summers and humid winters. Geochemical, sedimentological and diatom analyses provide evidence for an and period between cal 200 BC and AD 200 and a subsequent increase in moisture after cal AD 200. Abundant elastic layers in the core represent flood events. Periods with a higher frequency of flood events indicate an increased intensity of the Westerlies, more winter frontal system activity and possibly ENSO-related variability, probably comparable to modern conditions in Mediterranean Central Chile. Periods of high elastic input occur around cal AD 200-400, 500-700, especially around cal AD 1300-1700, and around AD 1850-1998. During the last 50 years, at least eight flood events were detected. correlating mainly with El Nino years. A very short drier period also occurred in the late 1960s.

In spring 1996, white bass eggs of each strain were fertilized with fresh semen from the same strain or with extended striped bass (M. saxatilis) semen pooled from nine males collected from the Arkansas River. Each strain of white bass and sunshine bass (female Al. chrysops X male M. saxatilis) was stocked at 500,000/ha as 4-day posthatch larvae into recently filled and fertilized earthen ponds (triplicated for white bass and quadruplicated for sunshine bass). The fish were offered salmonid fry meal (similar to 50% crude protein, CP) 21-day poststocking. Phase I fingerlings were harvested similar to 40-day poststocking. Mean survival rates of sunshine bass (12.5%) were significantly higher than those of white bass (2.6%). No differences in survival rates existed within the white bass or sunshine bass groups. Phase II sunshine bass were subsequently stocked in triplicated ponds at 25,000/ha. The fish were fed to satiation twice daily with a 40% crude protein salmonid diet and harvested 100-day poststocking. Mean weights of Lake Erie sunshine bass (90.2 g) were significantly greater than those of Arkansas fish (58.4 g), but not South Dakota fish (69.0 g). Phase M sunshine bass were stocked in late autumn 1996 in quadruplicated ponds at 4900/ha and fed beginning the next spring in the same manner as in Phase II. In autumn 1997, ponds were harvested and all fish had reached marketable size with Lake Erie sunshine bass averaging 648 g, followed by Arkansas fish at 636 and South Dakota fish at 566 g. These weights were not significantly different (P > 0.05). However, Lake Erie and South Dakota fish had significantly (P < 0.05) higher fillet (without ribs) dress-outs (37.3% and 37.8%, respectively) than Arkansas fish (34.6%). These results demonstrate the feasibility of raising sunshine bass to market size in earthen ponds in the north central region of the United States. Lake Erie white bass might offer some advantage as a source of broodfish relative to the strains compared and under the conditions in which they were raised in this study.

Dispersal of two species of Trichoptera from desert springs: Conservation implications for isolated vs connected populations	JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION												During the Pleistocene, when the climate was wetter and cooler, aquatic habitats in the Great Basin of western North America were much more extensive and connected. As the climate warmed over the last 10 000 years, many of these habitats dried but others remained as isolated springs and inland lakes. The isolation of desert springs and lack of dispersal between populations of non-vagile species (e. g. fish, spring snails) has led to genetic differentiation and speciation. However, the extent to which vagile species of aquatic insects disperse from spring to spring is unknown. We examined the population genetics of two caddisflies, Hesperophylax designatus (Limnephilidae) and Lepidostoma ojanum (Lepidostomatidae) that occur in isolated springs in Nevada and eastern California to determine the extent of their dispersal from spring to spring. Mitochondrial DNA sequences indicate that the populations of L. ojanum are isolated and that the populations represent management units. In contrast, H. designatus individuals are flying from spring to spring and their populations are connected by dispersal. Disturbance impacts (e. g. grazing by ungulates, water extraction) that eliminate poor dispersers (e. g. L. ojanum) locally may result in permanent losses of genetic diversity; this is less likely with broader dispersers such as H. designatus.

Here we evaluate two Mg/Ca-based sea-surface temperature reconstructions for the 2.78-2.52 Ma interval using the planktonic foraminifera Globigerina bulloides and Globigerinoides ruber (white) sensu stricto as the biotic carriers (SSTbul and SSTrub), and a reconstruction based on the alkenone saturation index (SSTalk). The Mg/Ca-based SST estimates begin to diverge from one another significantly during MIS G3 (similar to 2.66 Ma), culminating during MIS 104 (similar to 2.60 Ma), and remaining distinctly different for the remaining 80 kyr of the studied interval. The magnitude of this divergence (Delta SSTrub-bul) is caused mainly by a decrease in SSTbul, with SSTrub remaining relatively constant. We attribute this difference to a drop in SST during the early-spring blooming season of G. bulloides that was less pronounced during the late-summer blooming season of G. ruber. Using Delta SSTrub-bul as a seasonality indicator, we show that seasonality increased significantly owing to a drop in early spring temperatures from MIS 104 onwards, and peaked during glacial episodes. Maximum seasonality occurred during MIS 104 in coincidence with a major expansion of the circum-Atlantic ice sheets, particularly the North American ice sheet. This expansion appears to have had a critical influence on global climate and especially seasonality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The study adopted random forests (RF) based downscaling land surface temperature (LST) to assess the surface urban heat island (SUHI) of Fukuoka, Japan. The LST images were first downscaled to 250 m spatial resolution, and then the seasonal and diurnal SUHI was identified. The results implied that the SUHI in summer daytime is the most significant while in winter nighttime is the least significant in the area. Through the bivariate Moran?s I test and zonal statistics, the cooling effect of the green-blue spaces were evaluated. The forest has the most substantial urban cooling effect with the average LST change occurs at a distance of about 1 km (maximum 6.32 K). The cooling effect of the sea is significant during daytime, whilst that of the lake/river and the cropland/grassland is not obvious. We concluded the urban population and land use and land cover (LULC) are significantly spatial correlated to UHI, and are important factors of considering the urban heat island (UHI) mitigation strategies.					; Gao, Weijun/AAH-5061-2020	Wang, Rui/0000-0002-8236-6473; Gao, Weijun/0000-0003-0299-3686; 													2212-0955					MAR	2021	36								100790	10.1016/j.uclim.2021.100790	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2021.100790		MAR 2021											WOS:000632732800005

Three periods of nutrient and phytoplankton dynamics (chlorophyll a, biogenic silica, species composition), were distinguished during spring 1992, each corresponding, respectively, to a bloom of Thalassiosira sp. and Skeletonema costatum during early spring (April), Rhizosolenia sp. during mid-spring (May) and Chaetoceros sociale during late spring (June). During each period the production of biogenic silica (the mean rate of spring biogenic silica production was 13 mmol Si m-2 d-1), derived from C-14 primary production measurements, size fractionation experiments and appropriate Si:C ratios, has been compared with the sum of the silica acid inputs to the bay originating from rivers, from the adjacent Iroise Sea and from the sediments. From this comparison, it is concluded that (1) the early spring diatom bloom was mainly sustained by silicic acid from the watershed, (2) recycling of silicic acid within the water column played a major role during mid-spring to sustain the bloom of Rhizosolenia sp. and (3) silicic acid recycling at the sediment-water interface was the main contributor to the silica production during the late spring bloom. On a seasonal basis, the riverine inputs of Si (net source) balance the Si burial in sediments (net sink), and the contribution of the sediment to the silica production equals that of the watershed. The factors that govern the quantitative and qualitative variations of phytoplankton blooms during these periods are discussed. In these nitrate-rich coastal waters, support is given to the hypothesis of Si-limitation of the diatom growth, at least during the early spring period when inputs of silicic acid from the watershed represented the major contribution to the silica production.

J	TAN, B				TAN, B			EXTENT AND EFFECT OF ACID PRECIPITATION IN NORTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES AND EASTERN CANADA	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The alkalinity -to .SIGMA.(base cations) (ABC)ratios and [Aln+ and H+]-versus-[So42-/.SIGMA.(base cation)] (AHSBC) plots were used to asses acid precipitation (AP) in northeastern USA and eastern Canada. ABC ratios were used to study the extents when the AP was not severe, and AHDBC plots were used to study the effects when the AP was sever. The Appalachians with calcareous bedrocks were least affected by AP (ABC ratio, 0.65), three New England States were subject to intermediate AP (ABC ratios, 0.49), and the Canadian Shield, New Hampshire and certain Adirondack lakes showed the effects of advanced AP (ABC ratios, 0.29). Groundwater hydrology also affects ratios where highest ABC ratios were recorded for lowest groundwater velocities (largest residence time), and vice versa in Quabbin Reservation, Massachusetts. Lower ABC ratios and higher AHSBC acidic cations in spring compared to summer confirmed the fact the H+ ions were released from spring snowmelt. AHSBC plots had decreasing ABC ratios from left to right when the contribution from Aln+ and organic acids was minimal, ABC ratios were large (e.g., Appalachian and Massachusetts); when the contribution of acidic cations dominated, ABC ratios were small (e.g., certain Adrondack lakes). Limitations associated with the ratio and plot in making interpretations are discussed.																			0090-4341	1432-0703				JAN-APR	1989	18	1-2					55	63		10.1007/BF01056190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01056190													WOS:A1989Q889300004

Temporal and spatial patterns of UV penetration in Lakes Michigan and Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Expansion of dreissenid mussel populations and decreased nutrient loading have led to a decrease in seston concentration and an increase in water clarity documented by Secchi depth and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in Lakes Michigan, Huron and Ontario. We hypothesized that the increase in water clarity also led to increased penetration of ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths that may affect diurnal vertical migrations and survival of zooplankton and larval fish. To predict UV penetration from standard limnological variables and how they may vary across habitats, we measured penetration of ultraviolet wavelengths and PAR across seasons in nearshore and offshore areas of Lakes Michigan and Huron from 2012 to 2021. Offshore and nearshore areas of Lake Huron showed little difference in UV and PAR penetration among sites; however, UV and PAR penetration in Lake Michigan increased with distance from shore owing to dilution of high concentrations of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), total suspended solids, and high chlorophyll a associated with loading from major rivers. A comparison with data from the mid-1980s in Lake Michigan indicated that UV-A and PAR penetration has increased in spring before and immediately after stratification, likely related to removal of particulate material by dreissenid mussel grazing when they are connected with the total water column during isothermal periods. In contrast, UV-B penetration, because of its strong association with CDOM, has remained unchanged or even decreased during summer. Nearshore areas near major rivers may serve as refuges for UVsensitive organisms. Potential impacts on plankton and larval fishes are discussed.					; Mason, Doran/ABF-1415-2020	Rutherford, Edward/0000-0002-7282-6667; Glyshaw, Paul/0000-0003-1962-2021													0380-1330					APR	2024	50	2							102291	10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102291	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2024.102291		MAR 2024											WOS:001222493300001

Phylogenetic analysis revealed a high diversity of type I and type II methanotrophs in the oxygenated uppermost centimeter of the sediment. T-RFLP profiles indicated a high similarity between the active methanotrophic community in the oxic layer and the inactive community in an anoxic sediment layer at a 10-cm depth. There were also no major changes in community structure between littoral sediment cores sampled in summer and winter. By contrast, the fingerprint patterns showed substantial differences between the methanotrophic communities of littoral and profundal sediments.

Seasonal variation in mercury and food web biomagnification in Lake Ontario, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Seasonal variation in mercury (Hg) concentrations and food web structure was assessed for eastern Lake Ontario. Hg concentrations, measured in 6 species of invertebrates and 8 species of fishes, tended to be highest in the spring and lowest in the summer for most biota. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) exhibited significant ontogenetic shifts in diet and Hg, although such patterns were not evident for other species. Food web structure, as indicated by stable isotope values (delta N-15, (delta C-13) was not static. Log-transformed Hg data were strongly and consistently correlated with delta N-15 values for the whole food web in each of the three seasons (slopes, 0.17-0.24) and across the entire year (slope, 0.2). While significantly different between seasons, the regression slope values are still consistent with published global Hg bio-magnification rates. Our results indicate that the assessment of Hg trends in Great Lakes must take into account seasonal patterns and time of sampling. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The genus Planktothrix (Cyanobacteria) usually produces concentrated populations of filaments in the summer metalimnion of thermally stratifying lakes. This has been associated with the action of gas vesicles, cellular structures providing positive buoyancy. At the end of the summer, filaments are carried by convective mixing deeper into the water column where some gas vesicles collapse as a result of high hydrostatic pressure. They then lose their buoyancy, sink and are lost from the euphotic zone. 2. The resistance of gas vesicles to hydrostatic pressures is critical for the survival of Planktothrix in deep lakes. However, comparative observations on populations from lakes of a range of depths and hydrodynamic regimes are still needed to examine the relationships between the adaptive trait (i.e. the 'critical' pressure at which each gas vesicle collapses) with the environmental factor (i.e. the maximum hydrostatic pressure). 3. To explore the adaptation of Planktothrix populations to the depth of winter circulation in different systems, we collected 276 strains of P. cf. rubescens from eight lakes (zmax = 24-410 m) in Northern Italy during summer 2009 and we analysed the multicopy gene gvpC coding for a protein that crucially influences the critical pressure. 4. The strains analysed clustered into two main groups having gas vesicles with a mean critical pressure of 1.1 and 0.9 MPa, respectively. The proportion of the stronger strains was generally positively related to lake depth, although the overall pattern was complicated by individual lake morphology and hydrology. The relative frequency of stronger filaments was (i) greatest in deep basins with concave slopes and (ii) least in one deep, but permanently stratified lake. 5. The simultaneous presence of 'weaker' and 'stronger' filaments could allow for a rapid adaptive response to changes in hydrostatic pressures, related to changes in the amplitude of vertical circulation characterising deep lakes.

Sampling was carried out monthly between November 2009 and October 2010. The stomachs of 204 individuals were analyzed and 32.35% of them were empty. Feeding intensity varied by seasons and length group. Fullness index values were the lowest during summer and in large sized pike, while feeding intensity was the highest during autumn and in small specimens. Prey fish dominated the diet in all length groups throughout the year whereas feeding on invertebrates was limited to small pikes. For small, medium and large length individuals, the most preferred prey fish were Perca fluviatilis (V-a = 0.139, chi(2)= 3.86, P < 0.05), Chondrostoma regium (V-a = 0.169, chi(2) = 5.752, P < 0.05) and Abramis brama (V-a = 0.337, chi(2) = 22.731, P < 0.01), respectively. The pike exhibited a specialist feeding strategy on fish. The most important food items of pike were Scardinius erythrophthalmus, Perca fluviatilis and Abramis brama, respectively.

Pairs arrived at the river estuary from early winter, but the main influx to freshwater took place in late April and in May, when breeding pairs dispersed far upriver. Females began incubation from late May. Most young hatched in July and fledged by late September. Males left the river in June and congregated at an offshore moulting site, their numbers peaking in August, and dispersed rapidly in September. Breeding density and total duckling production decreased with increasing distance upstream, decreasing river width and increasing gradient and elevation. The total number of breeding pairs and their distribution on the river were similar from year to year, despite variable numbers killed, suggesting a stable breeding population near the upper limit the habitat would support in those years. It also suggested that killing mergansers in April was an ineffective way to reduce the population. The spatial variation in merganser breeding density was not correlated with the density of their main spring food, parr of salmon Salmo salar, but could have been related to its availability. The production of well-grown ducklings varied annually and was inversely correlated with river flow during the main period of hatch. It is argued that Red-breasted Mergansers breed late in the year because the hatching of ducklings in July coincides with an abundance of their food, large aquatic invertebrates and tiny juvenile fish.																			0019-1019					JAN	1993	135	1					33	41		10.1111/j.1474-919X.1993.tb02807.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.1993.tb02807.x													WOS:A1993KF94400005
J	Myerchin, G; White, D; Woolard, C				Myerchin, Greta; White, Dan; Woolard, Craig			Disinfection by-product formation during long-term water storage in Alaska	JOURNAL OF COLD REGIONS ENGINEERING												In many areas of Northern and Western Alaska, small streams and shallow lakes serve as community raw water supplies. These water supplies freeze completely during winter. In order to supply drinking water during the 6-9 month winter, communities store water that was treated during summer. A chlorine residual is maintained in the stored water. Raw water sources derived from surface water may be heavily laden with dissolved organic matter. At utilities where organic matter escapes treatment, the potential for accumulation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) during storage is a significant health concern. The following study was performed to evaluate this potential threat. Water was collected from five operating utilities, four that normally store water for 6-9 months and one that produces drinking water year-round. Raw, filtered (i.e., unchlorinated) and "finished" (i.e., filtered and chlorinated) water samples were collected during the summer pumping season and stored in the laboratory for 8 months. In order to mimic practice in the field, the chlorine residual was maintained in the finished water for the full storage period. While the concentration of DBPs in the finished water varied over the study period, there was not a statistically significant trend from the third to the eighth month of storage. The observed DBP values were strongly a function of the type of treatment system used. Those systems passing more organic matter had higher DBP values throughout the storage period. The ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nanometers (UV254) decreased continuously in the finished water coincident with chlorine consumption. UV254, often used as a surrogate for DBPs, remained constant during the entire storage period in raw and filtered water samples. Filtered water that was stored prior to chlorination accumulated fewer DBPs than finished water that was continuously chlorinated during the storage period. This result suggests that storing filtered water instead of finished water for long periods would limit DBP exposure to consumers. This conclusion was based on a comparison of DBP formation potentials (i.e., raw and filtered water) to DBPs (i.e., finished water). It is important to note that DBP formation potentials are based on a 24 hchlorine contact time. If long term storage were provided for filtered water, a smaller volume of secondary storage would still be needed to provide contact time for disinfection.																			0887-381X	1943-5495				DEC	2006	20	4					168	180		10.1061/(ASCE)0887-381X(2006)20:4(168)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0887-381X(2006)20:4(168)													WOS:000242431600003

Assessment of anthropogenic, seasonal and aquatic vegetation effects on the contamination level of oxbows	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												The contamination level of oxbows depends on both natural and anthropogenic effects. The aim of our study was to identify those abiotic and biotic factors that determine the contamination level of oxbows. The effect of anthropogenic activities, seasonality, and vegetation types was studied on the contamination level of surface water of oxbows. The following chemical variables were measured: suspended solid, ammonium, nitrate, chlorophyll-a, Al, Ba, Fe, Mn, Pb, Sr and Zn from eight oxbows from 2013 summer to 2014 autumn in the Upper Tisza region in Eastern Hungary. Three of the studied oxbows were protected, four oxbows were used for fishing and one oxbow was contaminated with wastewater. Our findings revealed that anthropogenic activities had remarkable effect on the contamination level of oxbows. Seasonality also influenced the contamination level, except the concentration of suspended solid, chlorophyll-a and manganese. Significant differences were found among vegetation types for the concentration of suspended solids, aluminium, iron, manganese and lead. The high level of iron concentration was not explained by the anthropogenic activities, suggesting that the quality of oxbows depends on both natural and anthropogenic effects.

R. salmoninarum was detected in 62.31% (according to Q-ELISA) of the 1284 examined lake whitefish, with some fish displaying the typical signs of BKD, such as renal congestion, swelling, and whitish nodules. Kidney cultures on MKDM yielded bacteria with morphological and biochemical characteristics identical to those of R. salmoninarum recovered from other Great Lakes fish species, as well as those from other parts of the world. Isolate identification was confirmed via nested polymerase chain reaction. Antibiograms demonstrated high sensitivity to enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, sensitivity to oxytetracycline, erythromycin, azithromycin, chloramphenicol, novobiocin, and carbenicillin, and resistance to polymyxin B, clindamycin. and kanamycin. Statistical analysis of R. salmoninarum prevalence and intensities revealed significant interactions among stocks, years and sampling seasons, with highest prevalence generally in fall and frequent wide variation in prevalence and intensity from one season to the next for a particular stock. It was surprising to find that the prevalence of R. salmoninarum exceeded 50% in the four stocks, much higher than originally thought. Moreover, a positive association between R. salmoninarum intensity and the abundance of the swimbladder nematode, Cystidicola farionis, was identified. Our findings suggest that Great Lakes lake whitefish are vulnerable to serious fish pathogens. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH					Joint Conference of the European Large Lakes Symposium (ELLS) / Conference of the International-Association-for-Great-Lakes-Research (IAGLR) - Big Lakes - Small World	2019	Univ Savoie Mont Blanc, Alpine Ctr Res Troph Networks & Limn Ecosystems, Evian, FRANCE	French Natl Res Inst Agr Food & Ennvironm, Int Assoc Great Lakes Res	Univ Savoie Mont Blanc, Alpine Ctr Res Troph Networks & Limn Ecosystems			In the past 26 years the transport of allochthonous matter into Lake Onego has increased. Water brownification in Petrozavodsk Bay, a northwestern bay in Lake Onego, and in the Shuya River, a tributary of the bay, was shown earlier to begin in spring. The goal of this paper was to find out whether brownification spreads from Petrozavodsk Bay to the central part of the lake in summer. Spearman's correlation coefficient and linear correlation coefficient confirm a significant (p < 0.05) increase in water color in Petrozavodsk Bay in the summers of 1992-2018. A tendency for increasing water color was found in the Central Onego's epilimnion. Total iron and CO2 concentrations in the epilimnion have increased and pH values have decreased both in Petrozavodsk Bay and in the Central Onego. In the Central Onego's hypolimnion, only total iron and CO2 concentrations have considerably increased. However, the present lake ecosystem is resistant to the increased effect of allochthonous matter due to long water renewal time and self-purification. In spite of a significant increase in CO2 concentration in the lake water, the bicarbonate buffer system maintains the acid-base equilibrium and the changes revealed are not considered critical for the ecosystem.

Here we use visible and near infrared (VNIR), and short-wave infra-red (SWIR) hyperspectral imaging combined with geochemical analyses to reconstruct lake stratification history, redox status and mixing conditions in the water column of Lake Son Kol (Kyrgyzstan) in Central Tian Shan during the last 8500 years. In particular, the detection of Bacteriopheophytin a (Bphe a), a pigment produced by anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria at the chemocline of meromictic lakes, emphasizes episodes of multidecadal to centennial hypolimnetic anoxia in Lake Son Kol. Phases of hypolimnetic anoxia are inferred from the deposition of dark organic sediments within a stratified lake system, which occurred during periods of increased snowmelt (and solid winter precipitation) and warmer spring/summer temperatures that promoted floods and the export of terrestrial material from the catchment. Prolonged euxinic conditions in bottom waters (involving the development of a stable chemocline) are reported around 8500, 8400, 8200-7800, 7700-7500, 7300-7000, 6500-6100, 6000-5700 and 5500-5250 cal yr BP. At ca. 5250 cal yr BP, the chemocline abruptly vanished as Lake Son Kol tipped into a regime with predominantly cooler and well-mixed conditions (predominance of oxygenic phototrophs), coeval with higher lake levels. The disappearance of hypolimnetic anoxia in Lake Son Kol coincides with strengthened wind conditions that imply enhanced lake overturning and upward mixing of nutrients in the water column. This study reveals the strong potential of hyperspectral imaging, in combination with more classical palaeolimnological approaches, to reconstruct the lake trophic and mixing history and explore the controlling mechanisms at work on decadal to centennial timescales. Our results outline how abrupt ecosystem changes may occur even in the absence of anthropogenic climate change. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It has been argued that these conditions enabled population growth that became unsustainable following the onset of a cold-arid phase ca. 3000 BP, with these cycles of growth and collapse again repeating ca. 2000 and 1000 BP. Here we present multi-proxy palynomorph, charcoal and sediment data indicating that from ca. 4500-1500 BP the environment of the valley was characterised by drier conditions, comparable to other regional records indicating weakening Westerly precipitation over Central Asia. Considering recent archaeobotanical data indicating the presence of both West Asian winter crops and East Asian summer millets in the valley as early as 4500 BP, we argue that rather than Malthusian cycles of growth and collapse in Kashmir, early populations likely drew on a broad range of available domesticates and varied ecotopes across the valley to allow a Boserupian response to changing Holocene climate conditions. These adaptations were likely more oriented towards flexible systems of agro-pastoralism practiced throughout the Inner Asian mountains, rather than towards developing large urban settlements as was the case in the river basins and plains south of Kashmir.					; spate, michael/HGC-2838-2022	Spate, Michael/0000-0003-2844-735X; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				JUN 20	2022	623				SI		127	138		10.1016/j.quaint.2021.07.014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2021.07.014		APR 2022											WOS:000798848300001
J	WYATT, RJ; KENNEDY, CR				WYATT, RJ; KENNEDY, CR			THE EFFECTS OF A CHANGE IN THE GROWTH-RATE OF ROACH, RUTILUS-RUTILUS (L), ON THE BIOLOGY OF THE FISH TAPEWORM LIGULA-INTESTINALIS (L)	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Investigations into the biology of the roach and the pathogenic tapeworm Ligula intestinalis (L.) populations at Slapton Ley, Devon [UK] were carried out between October 1982 and December 1984. Data collected from the lake since 1977 have also been re-analysed to determine how the dramatic improvement in the individual growth rate of the roach over this period may have affected the growth, maturation and life-cycle of Ligula. Only the very young roach at this site become infected, so it was possible to follow cohorts of plerocercoids of similar age through each roach year class. Results for the 1978 and 1983 year classes are presented in detail. The roach grew extremely rapidly from May to August in each year, resulting in a pronounced cyclical pattern of changes in the condition of the roach, with the lowest condition occurring in late winter and spring. The yearly increase in the roach growth rate was accompanied by an increase in plerocercoid growth rate in the 0+ roach, but not in the 1+ roach. The growth rate of the pleroceroids was very high compared to that at other sites. It is usual for the parasite index (PI) of Ligula-infected fish to be high and to increase throughout their first few years of life. At Slapton, however, a lack of multiple infections has prevented high PIs from occurring, and in recent years the growth rate of the roach has been so high that the plerocercoids were unable to maintain a high weight relative to the fish, and the highest PIs occurred in the 0+ roach throughout late winter and spring. In recent year classes, therefore, the maximum PIs and highest pathogenicities coincided with the period of lowest condition in the 0+ roach. Observations of both caged and natural populations of 0+ roach over winter showed that a significant loss of roach containing the larger plerocercoids occurred from the population. In vitro cultivation of Ligula plerocercoids showed that they were capable of maturation at weights of 0.5 g, and only 6 months after having infected the roach. The increase of the growth rate of the plerocercoids in the 0+ roach has therefore resulted in a greater proportion of these plerocercoids being capable of infecting the definitive host. As a result of the increase in individual growth rate of the roach at Slapton, the potential for Ligula transmission, as measured in terms of both their pathogenicity and maturity, has shifted from the 1+ to the 0+ roach.																			0022-1112	1095-8649				JUL	1988	33	1					45	57		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1988.tb05447.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1988.tb05447.x													WOS:A1988P613900004
J	Gurkan, S; Innal, D; Gulle, I				Gurkan, Sule; Innal, Deniz; Gulle, Iskender			Monitoring of the trophic ecology of pipefish species (Syngnathus abaster, Syngnathus acus) in an alluvial lake habitat (Lake Bafa, Turkey)	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												The present study investigated the trophic ecology of two species living in an alluvial lake ecosystem in terms of season, length groups, sex, and mouth morphology. The fish were caught in a coastal lake area between December 2014 and March 2016 using a seine. In general, C. aquaedulcis was the most important prey for S. abaster, accounting for 10.99% of all prey, while amphipods accounted for 54.04% of the S. acus diet. Amphipods were the most frequently consumed prey in autumn, while C. aquaedulcis was the most important prey in spring. This result indicates that the species preferred similar prey groups and generated food competition depending on the season. The short-length group contained samples of S. abaster with empty guts, whereas S. acus in the same group consumed C. aquaedulcis. Length group II and III of individuals indicated that both species consumed amphipods and juvenile Syngnathus sp. Thus, the two species had statistically different preferences in terms of prey length. The mouth width of S. abaster was larger than that of S. acus. In conclusion, zooplankton constituted the main prey for both species in the lake and the morphological differences between the mouth apparatus of the species were due to the differences in feeding habits.

Bacterioplankton community composition in Portuguese water bodies under a severe summer drought	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												In 2005, a severe drought occurred in Portugal, with several reservoirs becoming dry in the southern region. A set of 20 Portuguese water bodies were analysed through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (16SrDNA-DGGE) and DNA sequencing to assess its bacterioplankton diversity under these particular conditions. Environmental parameters were determined to assess the trophic conditions of each water body. Most water bodies fell into the meso-to eutrophic and hypereutrophic state. In general, the levels for conductivity, pH and total suspended solids were higher than the average data from previous years. Dominant phylotypes belonged to Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes groups. Despite the geographic distance, common phylotypes could be recorded among water bodies. Bacteroidetes dominated at Sousa River and were related to high nutrient levels. Cyanobacteria dominated at Alentejo reservoirs and correlated with higher conductivity values. However, Actinobacteria showed ubiquitous phylotypes throughout several samples, suggesting its persistence over geographically distant water bodies. This study showed a clear deterioration of water quality, from a physico-chemical point of view; furthermore, dominance of Cyanobacteria and Actinobacteria in reservoirs used for drinking water supply were also detected, which may become a concerning issue. However, the most severe bacterial community composition variations between summer 2005 and others were mainly related to higher water residence times. Thus, along with the expected intensification of drought episodes, with severe effects particularly in Southern Europe, it is clearly predictable an intensification in risks for water quality maintenance and even Public Health.					; de Figueiredo, Daniela/C-6192-2008; Correia, Antonio/B-1593-2008; Castro, Bruno/B-7552-2008	Pereira, Mario J./0000-0003-1826-391X; de Figueiredo, Daniela/0000-0003-3760-4142; Correia, Antonio/0000-0002-5115-1429; Castro, Bruno/0000-0002-7130-6061													1585-8553	1588-2756				DEC	2012	13	2					185	193		10.1556/ComEc.13.2012.2.8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1556/ComEc.13.2012.2.8													WOS:000311361200008

To determine the sediments adsorption and release characteristics and their impacts on water quality, surface sediments samples collected from Biliuhe reservoir in August 2015 were studied through simulation experiments in a laboratory. The results demonstrated that the equilibrium concentrations (EC0) of ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) and total phosphorus (TP) were 8.29 mg/L and 0.025 mg/L, respectively, which were both higher than the average concentrations in the overlying water. Therefore, the sediments of Biliuhe reservoir mainly acted as the pollution sources for NH4+-N and TP, and the release to water showed a seasonal variation. When potential release amounts were considered, the average concentrations of NH4+-N and TP in the overlaying water could reach 6.4 mg/L and 0.21 mg/L, respectively, which significantly exceeded the current contents. Further, water quality exhibited a decreased tendency after taking the release potential of nutrients into account of water quality assessment. Among the samples, 42% and 33% of them in summer and autumn exceeded the third level of the National Surface Water Quality Standards of China (GB3838-2002). The results indicated that sediments release potential had an unignored influence on water quality during various seasons.																				1660-4601				SEP 2	2019	16	18							3303	10.3390/ijerph16183303	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16183303								31500400					WOS:000489178500077

Suitability of Eastern Gamagrass for In Situ Precipitation Catchment Forage Production in Playas	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Freshwater playas, shallow ephemeral lakes whose basins fill aft er periods of prolonged or intense rainfall, occupy 3 to 5% of the land in the Llano Estacado and are considered marginal farmlands. The goals of this work were to determine if a native species, eastern gamagrass, could be grown on playa soils and to preliminarily evaluate the suitability of gamagrass [Tripsacum dactyloides (L.) L.] as a component of an in situ precipitation catchment forage production system. Flooding tolerance of gamagrass seeds was evaluated, and plants were grown on playa soil in both the greenhouse and field for several seasons. Gamagrass seed was resistant to extended flooding, especially at low ambient temperatures typically encountered in late fall or winter. Gamagrass roots penetrated nearly 2 m into waterlogged playa soil in greenhouse experiments. Stands were successfully established in playas, and plants survived for 6 yr when crowns were not destroyed by close mowing or vehicles. Eastern gamagrass is a viable candidate species that might be used as part of a novel playa-based forage production system.

The total fatty acid production rate varied from 2.8 to 10.9-mu-g C l-1 day-1 at the water surface and accounted for 9.1-30% of photosynthetic production of particulate organic carbon. A high contribution of fatty acid to the particulate organic carbon production rate was noticed during winter time, and an increase in the fatty acid contribution resulted in an increase in the C/N value in the photosynthetic products. The fatty acid composition varied throughout the year, mainly depending on the seasonal change in the dominant phytoplankton species. The contribution of polyunsaturated fatty acids to total fatty acids was low during the summer period, probably due to nitrogen limitation of phytoplankton growth.

To better predict shifts in its current climate system and to test models, more regional climate records are needed spanning longer than the instrumental period. Here we provide a high-resolution reconstruction of autumn precipitation for the Central Pyrenees since 1500 CE based on annual calcite sublayer widths from Montcortes Lake (Central southern Pyrenees) varved sediments. The 500-yr calcite data series was detrended and calibrated with instrumental climate records by applying correlations and cross-correlations to regional precipitation anomalies. Highest relationships were obtained between a composite calcite series and autumn precipitation anomalies for the complete calibration period (1900-2002) and for the two halves of the full period. Applied statistical tests were significant, evidencing that the climatic signal could be reconstructed. The reconstructed precipitation anomalies show interdecadal shifts, and rainfall decrease within the coldest period of the LIA and during the second half of the 20th century, probably associated to current Global Warming. Neither increasing nor decreasing linear trends or periods of extreme precipitation events were identified. Our results are coherent with other palaeohydrological reconstructions for northern Iberian Peninsula. Correlations between the predicted autumn precipitation and the main teleconnections -NAO, ENSO and WEMO- were weak, although a potential relationship with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) pattern is suggested. The obtained reconstruction provides the first estimations of regional autumn precipitation shifts in the Central Pyrenees and is one of the few reconstructions that cover annual-to-century scale climate variability of precipitation in the Mediterranean region from the end of the Litte Ice Age (LIA) to the current period of Global Warming.

Temporal and spatial separation allow coexistence of predatory cladocerans: Leptodora kindtii, Bythotrephes longimanus and Cercopagis pengoi, in southeastern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The predatory cladocerans. Leptodora kindtii, Bythotrephes longimanus, and Cercopagis pen got coexist in the waters of southeastern Lake Michigan near Muskegon, Michigan. Leptodora is indigenous, whereas Bythotrephes and Cercopagis are nonindigenous and became established in 1986 and 2000, respectively. To observe seasonal changes in their abundances, and relationships to each other, cladocerans were collected from 1994 to 2008 at an offshore (110-m) site, from 1998 to 2008 at a transitional (45-m) site and from 1999 to 2008 at a nearshore (15-m) site. Bythotrephes was most abundant at the offshore site compared to Leptodora and Cercopagis. Bythotrephes peak abundances usually occurred in autumn at all sites. Cercopagis tended to be more abundant at the nearshore site, and peak densities occurred in summer. At the mid-depth site, similar abundances occurred for all three predatory cladocerans, however, the date of peak abundance was usually earliest for Cercopagis, followed by Leptodora, and latest for Bythotrephes. In recent years, 2007 and 2008, densities of all three predatory cladocerans have increased. Temperature preference, fish predation, and competition between the invertebrate predators may all be important in allowing the dominance of one species over the other seasonally or spatially.

Starting in late September, the lakes are covered in ice, with ice persisting well into June or early July. In summer, the lakes are highly productive, supporting waterfowl and fish populations. However, little is known about the diversity and ecology of microscopic life in the lakes that influence biogeochemical cycles and contribute to ecosystem services. Even less is known about the prevalence of species that are characteristic of the seasons or whether some species persist year-round under both ice cover and summer open-water conditions. To begin to address these knowledge gaps, we sampled 10 morphometrically diverse lakes in the region of Ekaluktutiak (Cambridge Bay), on southern Victoria Island (NU, Canada). We focused on Greiner Lake, the lakes connected to it, isolated ponds, and two nearby larger lakes outside the Greiner watershed. The largest lakes sampled were Tahiryuaq (Ferguson Lake) and the nearby Spawning Lake, which support commercial sea-run Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) fisheries. Samples for nucleic acids were collected from the lakes along with limnological metadata. Microbial eukaryotes were identified with high-throughput amplicon sequencing targeting the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene. Ciliates, dinoflagellates, chrysophytes, and cryptophytes dominated the lake assemblages. A Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix separated communities into under-ice and open-water clusters, with additional separation by superficial lake area. In all, 133 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) occurred either in all under-ice or all open-water samples and were considered "core" microbial species or ecotypes. These were further characterized as seasonal indicators. Ten of the OTUs were characteristic of all lakes and all seasons sampled. Eight of these were cryptophytes, suggesting diverse functional capacity within the lineage. The core open-water indicators were mostly chrysophytes, with a few ciliates and uncharacterized Cercozoa, suggesting that summer communities are mixotrophic with contributions by heterotrophic taxa. The core under-ice indicators included a dozen ciliates along with chrysophytes, cryptomonads, and dinoflagellates, indicating a more heterotrophic community augmented by mixotrophic taxa in winter.

J	Ponder, WF; Eggler, P; Colgan, DJ				Ponder, WF; Eggler, P; Colgan, DJ			Genetic differentiation of aquatic snails (Gastropoda:Hydrobiidae) from artesian springs in arid Australia	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Electrophoretic surveys of 10 species of hydrobiid snails in two indigenous genera (Fonscochlea and Trochidrobia) living in arid-zone artesian 'mound' springs are reported. The study is based on 96 populations of hydrobiid snails living in 32 different springs representing 18 spring groups in the Lake Eyre Supergroup, northern South Australia. The species-level taxonomy of these snails, previously based on morphological differences alone, was tested and modified. The snails were examined within five clear-cut morphological groups: the two largest, fully aquatic species (Fonscochlea accepta and F. aquatica) were treated independently, as was the amphibious F. zeidleri. The morphologically similar three smaller aquatic species were investigated as a group. Within this group one new species is described and, on the basis of the genetic evidence, two others (F. variabilis and F. conica) are considered conspecific. The four species of Trochidrobia are investigated together and T. punicea separately in more detail. Sympatry between Trochidrobia smithi and T. punicea is recorded for the first time. The springs are arranged in an essentially linear pattern and genetic differentiation largely follows an isolation by distance model, although there is a significant genetic discontinuity between two nearby spring groups, Beresford/Warburton Springs and Strangways Spring, which is presumably the result of differential historical continuity of spring habitat. The size of the spring influences the degree of genetic difference between springs within spring groups, with small springs attaining greater levels of differentiation than large springs. The findings suggest that if genetic diversity is to be conserved, current management strategies protecting only single springs within a group are inadequate. Despite the considerable number of indigenous species found in these springs, currently all remain on pastoral leases and some are threatened by the continuing expansion of water extraction from the Great Artesian Basin.

Chlorophyll a, TN, and TP increased, whereas the TN:TP ratio fell substantially between the two periods, reaching values generally between 25 and 10 (by weight). On the contrary, DIN, SRP, and DIN:SRP ratios were similar for both periods in each lake. DIN:SRP ratios generally ranged from 5 to 20 (by weight). This ratio was low in the lakes with small catchment areas and increased progressively with catchment basin size. A regression analysis for the smallest catchments showed that chlorophyll a concentrations were not accounted for by variability in TP concentration. The results obtained are discussed in relation to the influence of episodes of Saharan dust, rich in P, reaching the Southern Mediterranean area.

Inter-lake comparisons indicate that fish predation, rather than high temperature, is the major driver of summer decline in Daphnia and other changes among cladoceran zooplankton in subtropical Florida lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The mid-summer disappearance of Daphnia and the small size of cladocerans in subtropical lakes have been explained as phenomena caused by high water temperature. Recent experimental and observational studies suggest that instead, fish predation could be the cause. In the present study, we evaluated effects of temperature and fish predation by comparing summer occurrence of Daphnia and seasonality of other cladocerans in subtropical lakes where there was (a) vegetation and a high abundance and diversity of planktivorous fish; versus (b) no vegetation, turbid water, and primarily benthivorous and piscivorous fish. Daphnia disappeared from mid-summer plankton samples at all locations with vegetation, yet it persisted year-round at the turbid vegetation-free location despite identical water temperatures (all lakes were shallow and isothermal). Body size of cladocerans, in general, was twofold lower at vegetated locations, and biomass was threefold lower. Smaller species dominated at the locations with vegetation, especially in summer. Our results demonstrate that in subtropical lakes Daphnia is able to tolerate high summer water temperatures, and suggest that fish predation may be a more important regulator than temperature for cladoceran size, biomass and taxonomic structure.					east, t/KVY-8260-2024														0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2015	750	1					57	67		10.1007/s10750-015-2177-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2177-5													WOS:000350244600005
J	Jones, B; Peng, XT				Jones, Brian; Peng, Xiaotong			Hot spring deposits on a cliff face: A case study from Jifei, Yunnan Province, China	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												A cliff face in the Jifei karst area, southwest China, is covered by a spectacular succession of precipitates that formed from the hot spring water that once flowed down its surface. This layered succession is formed of aragonite layers that are formed largely of "fountain dendrites", calcite layers that are formed mostly of "cone dendrites", and microlaminated layers that contain numerous microbes and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Many of the aragonite crystals are hollow due to preferential dissolution of their cores. The calcite cone dendrites are commonly covered with biofilms, reticulate Si-Mg coatings, and other precipitates. The microbial layers include dodecahedral calcite crystals and accessory minerals that include opal-A, amorphous Si-Mg coatings, trona, barite, potassium sulfate crystals, mirabillite, and gaylussite. Interpretation of the 8180(calcite) and delta O-18((aragonite)) indicates precipitation from water with a temperature of 54 to 66 degrees C. The active hot spring at the top of the cliff presently ejects water at a temperature of 65 degrees C. Layers, 1 mm to 6 cm thick, record temporal changes in the fluids from which the precipitates formed. This succession is not, however, formed of recurring cycles that can be linked to diurnal or seasonal changes in the local climate. Indeed, it appears that the climatic contrast between the wet season and the dry season had little impact on precipitation from the spring waters that flowed down the cliff face. Integration of currently available evidence suggests that the primary driving force was aperiodic changes in the CO2 content of the spring waters because that seems to be the prime control on the saturation levels that underpinned precipitation of the calcite and aragonite as well as the dissolution of the aragonite. Such variations in the CO2 content of the spring water were probably due to changes that took place in the subterranean plumbing system of the spring. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the field, sedimentation rate was reduced in experimental areas by a factor of 2.3 by covering the bottom of the lake. Sedimentation rate, bacterial parameters, as well as protozoan and metazoan abundance were recorded over a period of 8 month. The benthic community showed strong seasonal variation but did not respond to the reduced sedimentation rate in the field. In autumn, undisturbed sediment cores from the study site were transferred to the laboratory. Material from the lake was collected in sedimentation traps and continuously added to half of the cores over a period of 3 months. Controls received no material. The abundance of flagellates, ciliates and nematodes was higher in the treatments receiving material from the lake, though the effect was restricted to the uppermost sediment layer (0-0.5 cm). This study shows that sedimentation was of minor importance for the population dynamics of the organisms in the field, but turned out to be an important factor for a specific part of the benthic community under controlled laboratory conditions.

It has provided some of drinking-water for Isparta since 1994 due to the problem of water shortage. A few successive blooms were firstly observed in the western shores of Egirdir Lake during the summer and autumn of 2006. The blooms were seen as a bluegreen jelly or hand in shores of the lake. M. aeruginosa and M. flos-aqua were identified in our investigation but M. aeruginosa was determined as the bloorn-forming species. M, aeruginosa was counted as 16,530 colony/L and Chlorophyll-a concentration was measured as 117 mu g L-1 in Our investigation. In this respect, we can say that Egirdir Lake is under the potential risk of cyanobacterial toxicity. Surface water temperature was recorded as 24.2 degrees C.

To inform conservation and management of these habitats, models are needed to link birds and hydrological changes due to climate and human water use. We modeled seasonal relationships between counts for 35 migratory shorebird, waterfowl, and other waterbird species or taxonomic groups and hydrological metrics at Bear River Bay, a globally Important Bird Area at Utah's Great Salt Lake. We found that increased fall surface flows to the bay increased counts of 13 species, including American Avocets (Recurvirostra americana), American White Pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos), American Wigeons (Mareca americana), Northern Pintail (Anas acuta), Redheads (Aythya americana), and Ruddy Ducks (Oxyura jamaicensis). Increased spring surface flows increased counts of Forster's Terns (Sterna firsteri) and the sandpiper group, whereas intermediate spring flows produced peak counts for American White Pelicans. Thus, conservation or management actions that increase seasonal flows to Bear River Bay are expected to increase bay use by diverse members of the avian community. Counts for 11 species or taxonomic groups responded positively or negatively to the seasonal elevation of Great Salt Lake, and these responses are hypothesized to reflect the relative availability of habitats within the bay versus the lake as a whole. Our models provide tools that allow managers to understand how hydrological changes associated with climate change and human water use will affect birds in Bear River Bay. Addressing lake-wide and regional population implications of changing hydrological conditions at Bear River Bay, Great Salt Lake, and other locations across the Great Basin will require a regionally coordinated assessment of hydrology, habitat, and bird movements in response to changing habitat conditions.																			0273-8570	1557-9263				DEC	2021	92	4					388	401		10.1111/jofo.12381	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jofo.12381		NOV 2021											WOS:000715387800001

Contrasting cesium dynamics in neighboring deep and shallow warm-water reservoirs	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												To measure the long term retention and seasonal dynamics of an initial 4 kg addition of Cs-133 into an 11.4-ha, 157,000 m(3) reservoir (Pond 4, near Aiken, South Carolina, USA), the concentrations and inventories of Cs-133 in the water column were measured at periodical intervals for 522 days following the 1 August, 1999 release. After rapid declines in concentrations and inventories during the first 90 days, the Cs-133 concentrations in the water column declined at an average proportional rate of 0.004 d(-1). However, there were periods of less rapid and more rapid rates of declines, and these were correlated with periods of increasing and decreasing K concentrations in the water column. The decline rates were less and the K concentrations greater in the winter than in the summer. In the deeper, neighboring monomictic reservoirs of Par Pond and Pond B, a yearly cycle of increasing and decreasing Cs-137 concentrations in the water column is driven by anoxic remobilization of Cs from the sediments into a persistent summer hypolimnion. In Pond 4, whose mean depth of 1.6 m is too shallow to support a persistent anoxic hypolimnion, the pattern of yearly dynamics for K and Cs appear to be related to the accumulation and release of these elements from the extensive, seasonal macrophyte communities. The contrasting results between Pond 4 and Pond B suggest that a full appreciation of the relative importance of 1) anoxic remobilization and 2) accumulation and release by macrophytes in these systems remains to be established.

Characteristics of Winter-Precipitation-Related Transportation Fatalities in the United States	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY												Winter precipitation can be very disruptive to travel by aircraft and by motor vehicles. Vehicle fatalities due to winter precipitation are considered "indirect'' and are not counted in Storm Data, the publication commonly used to evaluate losses from meteorological hazards. The goal of this study is to examine the spatial and temporal characteristics of these indirect transportation fatalities that involve winter precipitation for the period 1975-2011. Motor vehicle fatalities were gathered from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's 9NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System 9FARS) database, while aviation fatalities were collected from the National Transportation Safety Board's 9NTSB) Aviation Accident database. Statistical analysis and geographic information systems 9GIS) were used to assess the spatial and temporal characteristics of these deaths. Most winter-precipitation-related motor vehicle fatalities occur during the daylight hours. Fatal motor vehicle accident rates are higher than expected in the Northeast and Great Lakes regions, while winter-precipitation-related aviation fatalities are most common in the western United States. Vehicle fatality counts due to winter weather are compared to fatality counts for various hazards from Storm Data to highlight the differences between the datasets. Because of the exclusion of vehicle fatalities, Storm Data underestimates by an order of magnitude the number of fatalities that involve winter weather each year. It is hoped that a better understanding of winter precipitation mortality can be applied in order to reduce fatalities in the future.					; Mote, Thomas/U-6681-2017; Black, Alan/AAC-7357-2019	Black, Alan/0000-0002-9336-6532; Mote, Thomas/0000-0002-0021-0134; 													1948-8327	1948-8335				APR	2015	7	2					133	145		10.1175/WCAS-D-14-00011.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/WCAS-D-14-00011.1													WOS:000354445100005
J	MOLL, RA; STOERMER, EF				MOLL, RA; STOERMER, EF			A HYPOTHESIS RELATING TROPHIC STATUS AND SUBSURFACE CHLOROPHYLL MAXIMA OF LAKES	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												A small but rapidly growing body of information concerning the development of a deep-living phytoplankton layer is used to form an alternate hypothesis to the currently accepted theory of phytoplankton seasonal succession. This hypothesis shows how plankton in the late spring and throughout the summer occupy a low light, temperature, and turbulence niche in order to remain in a nutrient-rich environment. Species which occupy this niche form a distinct layer, generally in or below the thermocline. This deep phytoplankton layer contains up to 10 times the concentration of chlorophyll in the surface water of Lake Michigan [USA], and more than 10 times in smaller lakes. The phytoplankton in the subsurface chlorophyll maximum have high levels of photosynthesis despite the low levels of light observed in the metalimnion. Implications of the deep chlorophyll maximum to general phytoplankton ecology have been considered especially in relation to the summer standing crop in thermally stratified lakes. The formation and persistence of the deep chlorophyll maximum is directly tied to trophic status of lakes. Experimental evidence from the Great Lakes is used to verify the hypothesis relating the deep chlorophyll maximum to trophic status. As lakes move toward increasing eutrophy, the environment available for subsurface phytoplankton growth is restricted by shading from epilimnetic algae growth. Eventually a subsurface chlorophyll maximum cannot develop in highly eutrophic lakes. The subsurface maximum was maintained primarily by in situ growth in Lakes Michigan and Superior [North America] rather than by sinking cells. The subsurface chlorophyll maximum was observed to have an important effect on the vertical distribution of nutrients in Lake Michigan.																			0003-9136						1982	94	4					425	440																WOS:A1982PW30400002

Accurate predictions of lake P dynamics are needed to understand whole-ecosystem P budgets, as well as the consequences of changing lake P concentrations for water quality. However, complex biophysical processes within lakes, along with limited observational data, challenge our capacity to reproduce short-term lake dynamics needed for water quality predictions, as well as long-term dynamics needed to understand broad scale controls over lake P. Here we use an emerging paradigm in modeling, process-guided machine learning (PGML), to produce a phosphorus budget for Lake Mendota (Wisconsin, USA) and to accurately predict epilimnetic phosphorus over a time range of days to decades. In our implementation of PGML, which we term a Process-Guided Recurrent Neural Network (PGRNN), we combine a process-based model for lake P with a recurrent neural network, and then constrain the predictions with ecological principles. We test independently the process-based model, the recurrent neural network, and the PGRNN to evaluate the overall approach. The process-based model accounted for most of the observed pattern in lake P; however it missed the long-term trend in lake P and had the worst performance in predicting winter and summer P in surface waters. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the process-based model, the recurrent neural network, and the PGRNN was 33.0 mu g P L-1, 22.7 mu g P L-1, and 20.7 mu g P L-1, respectively. All models performed better during summer, with RMSE values for the three models (same order) equal to 14.3 mu g P L-1, 10.9 mu g P L-1, and 10.7 mu g P L-1. Although the PGRNN had only marginally better RMSE during summer, it had lower bias and reproduced long-term decreases in lake P missed by the other two models. For all seasons and all years, the recurrent neural network had better predictions than process alone, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 23.8 mu g P L-1 and 28.0 mu g P L-1, respectively. The output of PGRNN indicated that new processes related to water temperature, thermal stratification, and long term changes in external loads are needed to improve the process model. By using ecological knowledge, as well as the information content of complex data, PGML shows promise as a technique for accurate prediction in messy, real-world ecological dynamics, while providing valuable information that can improve our understanding of process.

J	Straile, D; Müller, H				Straile, Dietmar; Mueller, Helga			Response of Bosmina to climate variability and reduced nutrient loading in a large lake	LIMNOLOGICA												The long-term dynamics of the cladoceran Bosmina spp. were analysed in Lake Constance during the study period 1979-1998. During this period the lake ecosystem has been influenced strongly by changes in nutrient inflow (oligotrophication) and by climate variability associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation. Bosmina abundances declined strongly during the study period presumably as an indirect consequence of the reduced P loading of the lake. A detailed seasonally resolved analysis of Bosmina dynamics revealed that its abundance decline occurred throughout the year with the exception of the spring period. The lack of a population decline during spring may be attributed to the seasonal absence of the factor, e.g., food limitation and/or predation control by invertebrates causing the population decline. Additionally, climate variability had its strongest influence on Bosmina dynamics during spring and large climate-associated variability of Bosmina may have decreased the power to detect a significant reduction in spring Bosmina abundances with oligotrophication. However, when we account for the confounding influence of climate variability, the effects of oligotrophication are revealed more clearly also during the spring period. Likewise, the detectability of the influence of climate variability on spring Bosmina dynamics increases when accounting for the reduction of abundances in the course of oligotrophication.

Here we assessed the influence of contrasting meteorological conditions on stratification and phytoplankton bloom composition in a eutrophic lake, and tested for associated changes in GHGs inventories in both the shallow and deep waters, over three seasons (2010-2012). Atmospheric heatwaves had one of the most dramatic effects on GHGs. Indeed, cyanobacterial blooms that developed in response to heatwave events in 2012 enhanced both sedimentary CH4 concentrations (reaching up to 1mM) and emissions to the atmosphere (up to 8 mmol m & minus;2 d & minus;1). That summer, CH4 contributed 52% of the integrated warming potential of GHGs produced in the lake (in CO2 equivalents) as compared to between 34 and 39% in years without cyanobacterial blooms. High CH4 accumulation and subsequent emission in 2012 were preceded by CO2 and N2O consumption and under-saturation at the lake surface (uptakes at 30 mmol m(-2) d(-1) and -1.6 mu mol m(-2) d(-1), respectively). Fall overturn presented a large efflux of N2O and CH4, particularly from the littoral zone after the cyanobacterial bloom. We provide evidence that, despite cooling observed at depth during hot summers, CH4 emissions increased via stronger stratification and surface warming, resulting in enhanced cyanobacterial biomass deposition and intensified bottom water anoxia. Our results, supported by recent literature reports, suggests a novel interplay between climate change effects on lake hydrodynamics that impacts both bloom characteristics and GHGs production in shallow eutrophic lakes. Given global trends of warming and enrichment, these interactive effects should be considered to more accurately predict the future global role of lakes in GHG emissions. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Geerts, B				Geerts, B			Empirical estimation of the monthly-mean daily temperature range	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												This is a sequel to a study of the empirical estimation of the annual mean temperature and its range, at any location on land, based on the historical surface climate record. Here the spatial patterns of the daily temperature range (DTR) and its seasonal variation are examined. The DTR is highest in the subtropical deserts and is less at high latitudes, as well as within 30-150km from an ocean. It is generally higher in winter (summer) at low (high) latitudes. The coastal DTR reduction is explained by sea breezes, onshore advection, and low-level cloud cover. Even large bodies of water, such as Lake Michigan, affect the near-shore DTR. Elevation does not directly affect the DTR, but valleys tend to have a DTR that is 2-6 K larger than adjacent hills or ridges. The main factor affecting the DTR is the afternoon relative humidity, which is dynamically linked to low-level cloud cover. An empirical relationship between DTR and afternoon relative humidity has an uncertainty of about 1.4 K for monthly-mean values.

From October 2013 to November 2014, we collected suspended particulate matter (SPM) monthly at three depths and retrieved the sediment from a trap located at 20 m below the lake surface. The GDGT contents in the SPM and sediment trap presented a marked seasonal variation, showing the highest values in summer and autumn. In addition, the isoGDGT proxy TEX86 in SPM and sediment trap showed a marked seasonal variability which matched the temperatures of the upper water column and fit the published global trend between TEX86 and mean annual lake surface temperature (LST). However, in the hypolimnion where oxygen was depleted for most of the study period, we found that TEX86 co-varied with DO. This further confirms previous claims with seasonal field data that the sedimentary TEX86 LST signal may be confounded by DO conditions. Consequently, the application of TEX86 to estimate LST should be carefully appraised in environments with depleted DO conditions.

Evaporation from a large lowland reservoir - observed dynamics and drivers during a warm summer	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												We study the controls on open water evaporation of a large lowland reservoir in the Netherlands. To this end, we analyse the dynamics of open water evaporation at two locations, Stavoren and Trintelhaven, at the border of Lake IJssel (1100 km(2)); eddy covariance systems were installed at these locations during the summer seasons of 2019 and 2020. These measurements were used to develop data-driven models for both locations. Such a statistical model is a clean and simple approach that can provide a direct indication of (and insight into) the most relevant input parameters involved in explaining the variance in open water evaporation, without making a priori assumptions regarding the process itself. We found that a combination of wind speed and the vertical vapour pressure gradient can explain most of the variability in observed hourly open water evaporation. This is in agreement with Dalton's model, which is a well-established model often used in oceanographic studies for calculating open water evaporation. Validation of the data-driven models demonstrates that a simple model using only two variables yields satisfactory results at Stavoren, with R-2 values of 0.84 and 0.78 for hourly and daily data respectively. However, the validation results for Trintelhaven fall short, with R-2 values of 0.67 and 0.65 for hourly and daily data respectively. Validation of the simple models that only use routinely measured meteorological variables shows adequate performance at hourly (R-2 = 0.78 at Stavoren and R-2 = 0.51 at Trintelhaven) and daily (R-2 = 0.82 at Stavoren and R-2 = 0.87 at Trintelhaven) timescales. These results for the summer periods show that open water evaporation is not directly coupled to global radiation at the hourly or daily timescale. Rather a combination of wind speed and vertical gradient of vapour pressure is the main driver at these timescales. We would like to stress the importance of including the correct drivers of open water evaporation in the parametrization in hydrological models in order to adequately represent the role of evaporation in the surface-atmosphere coupling of inland waterbodies.

Effects of localized temperature and precipitation on historic Walleye recruitment in Wisconsin, USA with implications for climate change	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Walleye (Sander vitreus) populations in Wisconsin are near the center of their geographical range and support valuable fisheries. The role of seasonal temperature and precipitation in Walleye recruitment was examined using regression tree analysis. Climatological variables were estimated at the 8 km(2) scale and Walleye recruitment was estimated based on 298 individual electrofishing surveys. Estimated changes in Walleye recruitment between 1950 and 2006were examined based on changes in explanatory climatological variables. Spring precipitation and summer maximum temperature were significant predictors of age-Walleye density and mean estimated changes in these variables between 1950 and 2006 were used to estimate changes in Walleye recruitment. The model predicted a small overall increase in Walleye recruitment and provides insight into the direct role of climatological variables in Walleye recruitment. However, given the low explanatory power (R-2 = 0.103), it is likely that historic climatological changes have had a limited effect on recruitment levels.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2014	17	2					115	121		10.1080/14634988.2014.905100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2014.905100													WOS:000337162000002

Hourly dust plume observations of the Dust Belt from geostationary-orbit satellites are analyzed for the 2017-12-2022-11 period. To identify dust source areas and their extents, we back-track plumes to their source, assessing source areas in terms of emission frequency, contribution, and plume extent patterns. This method advances over traditional source allocation techniques that rely on polar-orbiting satellites based on a few daily passes and meteorological wind fields for backtracking. Our findings indicate that Boreal summer is the most intense season for most sources, except in the Southern Sahara, which experiences winterly winds. Our analysis also reveals significant contributions from regions within the Sahara that experience expansive but infrequent dust storms, highlighting the importance of considering both frequency and magnitude in understanding dust emissions. This study focuses on the role of mineral dust, a significant climate constituent originating mainly from arid regions. Identifying where dust comes from and where it goes is essential for understanding how it affects the climate. To do so, we employ high temporal frequency satellite data to backtrack dust plumes to their sources, revealing key dust-emitting regions and their seasonal variations. We also quantify each source area's frequency and magnitude of emissions and the spatial distribution of emanating dust plumes. Our findings show that summer is the peak season for most areas, except for the strongest dust sources, located in Southern Sahara, which peak in winter driven by seasonal winds. Additionally, some Saharan source areas exhibit severe storms but have been under-emphasized because they were measured by the frequency of their storms. High-temporal-resolution images from geostationary-orbit satellites enable precise back-tracking of dust source areas Dust source areas are analyzed in terms of their emission frequency, contribution to the regional atmosphere, and corresponding plume extent Summer is the peak dust emission season for most sources in West Asia and Sahara and ephemeral lake beds are active during the dry season					; chehbouni, abdelghani/ACN-8375-2022	Entekhabi, Dara/0000-0002-8362-4761; Alnasser, Faisal/0009-0005-1909-4646; 													0094-8276	1944-8007				AUG 28	2024	51	16							e2024GL110753	10.1029/2024GL110753	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024GL110753													WOS:001296372800001

To clarify the internal nutrient load and provide reference for eutrophication control in Yuqiao Reservoir, a drinking water source reservoir in China, pore water profiles and sediment core incubation experiments were conducted. The nutrients in the water (soluble reactive P (SRP), nitrate-N (NO3--N), nitrite-N (NO2--N), and ammonium-N (NH4+-N)) and in the sediments (total N (TN), total P (TP) and total organic carbon (TOC)) were quantified. The results show that NH4+-N was the main component of inorganic N in the pore water. NH4+-N and SRP were higher in the pore water than in the overlying water, and the concentration gradient indicated a diffusion potential from the sediment to the overlying water. The NH4+-N, NO3--N, and SRP fluxes showed significant differences amongst the seasons. The NH4+-N and SRP fluxes were significantly higher in the summer than in other seasons, while NO3--N was higher in the autumn. The sediment generally acted as a source of NH4+-N and SRP and as a sink for NO3--N and NO2--N. The sediments release 1133.15 and 92.46 tons of N and P, respectively, to the overlying water each year.

The number of oligocarbophilic bacteria, which are growing on mineral or diluted media, are generally 2 times higher than saprophytic bacteria, which are tested on different nutrient media. By using media with different nutrient composition, different taxa of bacteria in the ecosystem were detected. In comparison to all other tested media, the CPS-medium gave the greatest abundance of bacteria, indicating a better utilization of this medium than the others. The seasonal abundance of oligocarbophilic bacteria and the heterotrophic saprophytes is, with some exceptions, the same at all depths. Both bacterial groups have a small maximum during the winter and a very significant maximum at the beginning of summer. In both cases bacterial numbers decrease with depth. On agar plates which were incubated in an atmosphere totally free from organic carbon, fewer colonies were counted than in normal atmosphere.																			0003-9136						1982	93	3					287	302																WOS:A1982NE69300003

They commuted directly to foraging sites up to 13.4 km away at speeds often exceeding 40 km h(-1) Except during lactation, individuals occasionally day-roosted away from the nursery in buildings or hollow trees. These were also sometimes used as night roosts, especially during rain, which also stimulated return to the nursery. On most nights the first flight lasted the longest. During preparturition, when distances from roost to foraging site were greatest, and time spent flying per night (t(F)) was least, there was often only one flight, with a second towards dawn on warmer nights, and occasionally a third. After parturition, in June, t(F) and the number of flights (N-F) increased up to weaning, corresponding to rising energy demands. But distances to foraging sites fell, rising only slightly in postlactation, presumably because insects, and thus feeding patches, were more abundant than in preparturition. N-F fell to preparturition levels after lactation. Exploratory behaviour by juveniles intensified with time - distances to feeding sites, t(F) and the total distance flown each night all increased; the distance flown each night was eventually greater than any recorded for adults. Roosting away from the nursery was also more common. Before dispersal, there were extended migrations by juveniles outside the summer range of the adults. Distances moved by two dispersed juveniles exceeded 34 km. Two-thirds of the recorded foraging time was over pasture or drainage canals. Foraging over other habitats, particularly lake and conifer forest, was greatest in preparturition. Other habitats foraged included lights, estuary, stream, beach and dunes.

J	Chen, Q; Huang, MT; Tang, XD				Chen, Qi; Huang, Mutao; Tang, Xiaodong			Eutrophication assessment of seasonal urban lakes in China Yangtze River Basin using Landsat 8-derived Forel-Ule index: A six-year (2013-2018) observation	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Lakes eutrophication have been a complex and serious problem for China's Yangtze River Basin. A series of algorithms based on different remote sensing dataset have been proposed to simulate the lakes trophic state. However, these algorithms are often targeted at a particular lake and cannot be applied to a watershed management. In this study, a Forel-Ule index (FUI) method based on Landsat 8 OLI image is proposed to simulate trophic state index (TSI) in three typical urban lakes (Dianchi, Donghu, and Chaohu) from 2013 to 2018. The results show that the Landsat 8 derived FUI can well represent the lake TSI with an accuracy of R-2 = 0.6464 for the in situ experimental TSI dataset (N = 115) and R-2 = 0.8065 for the lake average TSI dataset (N = 315). In the study period 2013-2018, the order of the simulated TSI is Dianchi > Chaohu > Donghu. Seasonal dynamics show differences where the percentage of eutrophic area in summer is significantly lower than the other seasons for Lake Dianchi and Chaohu. However, the percentage of eutrophic area for Lake Donghu is highest in summer and lowest in winter. To further detect the driving factors of eutrophication in study lakes, the Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. The results show that sunshine and temperature are, respectively, the most and the second most significant factors for Lake Dianchi with explanations of 14.8% and 22.0%; temperature and pollution are the main influencing factors for Lake Donghu (39.2% and 10.9% explanation, respectively) and Chaohu (57.2% and 60.7% explanations, respectively). In addition, the wind is another negatively significant factor for Lake Chaohu with an explanation of 31.3%. Our results serve as an example for other lakes in the Yangtze River Basin and support the formulation of effective strategies to reduce seasonal eutrophication. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Diatom communities have received some attention but have remained largely unknown in the south-western Alps. We therefore studied the springs of the south-western extreme of the Alpine mountain range. We analysed epilithic and epiphytic assemblages in 48 springs of different ecomorphological types, located on contrasting lithological substrata (carbonate/siliceous). Moreover, phytosociological releves were carried out for carbonate springs. The diatom flora consisted of 223 taxa. Most (198) of the taxa were included in the Red List, and 12.5% belonged to threatened categories. Characteristic spring taxa (crenophiles) were present. The ecological preferences of crenophilous diatom species described in the eastern Alps were confirmed. Diatom species characteristic of the lake-littoral zone were found in pool springs. We observed no significant differences in species richness and diversity between epilithic and epiphytic assemblages, but some species showed a preference for bryophytes, and five occurred in the epibryon only. As regards moisture conditions, 15% of the taxa occurred on wet or temporarily dry sites, and 4% lived mostly outside water bodies. The main environmental factors influencing diatom assemblages were pH, conductivity, altitude, and shading. The carbonate-substratum crenic vegetation was composed of a mixture of vascular plants and bryophytes, which find their ecological optimum in springs. Bryophyte cover was dominant, with the most abundant taxa belonging to the genus Palustriella. The vegetation corresponded to the Cratoneuretum commutati association.

In the meso-polyhaline Lake Veere Acartia tonsa is abundant, mainly during summer. In springs a small population of Eurytemora americana is found. The tidal estuary harbored far denser copepod populations throughout the year than the stagnant brackish lake water. The average yearly copepodid + adult biomass in the Westerschelde estuary was approximately 850 mg/m3 (wet wt); in Lake Veere it was approximately 130 mg/m3. Temporarily low O2 values did not influence negatively the copepod populations in the Westerschelde estuary. The seasonal distribution of the dominant copepods in both areas is explained in the light of recent literature data. Perennial E. affinis abundance in the Westerschelde estuary must be mainly caused by large concentrations of nannodetritus particles, bacteria included, throughout the year. A. tonsa in Lake Veere has to thrive mainly on nannophytoplankton.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1977	52	1					3	13		10.1007/BF02658076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02658076													WOS:A1977CW21200001

A song of ice and vessels: Seasonal trends in the soundscape of the western arm of Lake Superior	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The soundscapes of marine systems have been studied for decades to determine spatial and temporal patterns of biological, geological, and anthropogenic activity. However, comparatively little is known about freshwater soundscapes. Lake Superior is the world's largest freshwater lake by surface area and home to a variety of aquatic animals. The Twin Ports of Duluth and Superior, located in the western arm of Lake Superior, are annually closed because of ice cover, providing a unique opportunity to explore sound levels in the absence of vessel traffic. Passive acoustic monitoring was conducted over 15 months between November 2018 and March 2020 to investigate seasonal patterns. Sound pressure levels were significantly lower (8 dB) at low frequencies (<100 Hz) during the winter and spring months (when ice cover increased). Quieter ambient sound pressure levels may provide an acoustic refuge to soniferous animals, especially those that vocalise during winter spawning. During the ice-free months, commercial shipping introduces a near continuous source of sound, increasing sound levels by up to 25 dB (at frequencies < 1,000 Hz). Climate change is expected to further reduce ice cover and thickness allowing the shipping season into the Twin Ports to be extended, thus warranting concern about the effect of noise from vessel activity on aquatic life. This study provides a baseline of the soundscape in the western arm of Lake Superior, against which scientists and environmental managers can assess future changes to this important habitat.

J	Glover, C; Robertson, AHF				Glover, C; Robertson, AHF			Origin of tufa (cool-water carbonate) and related terraces in the Antalya area, SW Turkey	GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL												Extensive tufa deposits covering 600 km(2) of the terraced Plio-Quaternary Antalya coastal plain were deposited from cool karstic spring waters, reaching a total thickness of up to 250 m. The tufa formed within the Aksu Basin, a large N-S-trending half-graben bordered by the Taurus Mountains. The tufa is exposed on two main levels: an upper terrace at c. 300 m above sea level (a.s.l.) and a lower terrace at 100-200 m a.s.l. An additional terrace is reported to be submerged offshore at -50 to -100 m below sea level. Tufa deposition was preceded by Late Pliocene regression of a shallow sea. Initial tufa deposition occurred in and around small lakes ponded by N-S extensional fault blocks. The tufa was mainly precipitated in shallow lakes, marshes and sluggish streams, resulting in complex facies associations. Radiometric dating of the lower terrace yielded ages of >600 ka (the maximum resolution of the method). A climatically favourable time for maximum tufa formation was 2.0-1.5 Ma (latest Pliocene), representing a prolonged period of cool, but seasonally variable climate. This favoured carbonate dissolution, aquifer recharge and profuse, uninterrupted spring activity. Basin-wide tufa deposition ended when the lakes and marshes shrank. Afterwards mid-Late Quaternary climatic conditions were unsuitable for large-scale tufa deposition. Pre-existing tufa was then eroded, dissolved and karstified, while terra rossa soils formed. Gradual tectonic uplift continued during Quaternary time. Glacio-eustatic sea-level fluctuations during the mid-Quaternary, coupled with localized stream erosion, created the second main terrace, backed by irregular cliffs and promontories. The submarine terrace possibly formed in response to Late Quaternary sea-level fall, followed by post-glacial submergence and sculpting of coastal cliffs. Relatively small volumes of spring water continued to flow at different levels of the terrace system, depositing high-energy tufa in waterfalls, cascades and areas of sloping run-off.

J	Hofer, R; Medgyesy, N				Hofer, R; Medgyesy, N			Growth, reproduction and feeding of dwarf Arctic char, Salvelinus alpinus, from an Alpine high mountain lake	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The Arctic char population (Salvelinus alpinus) from a shallow high mountain lake in the Alps (Oberer Plenderlesee, Kuhtai, Tyrol, Austria, 2344 m a.s.l.) was subjected to seasonal studies on growth, reproduction and feeding. Growth rate and condition factors were low, and the life-span was relatively short (up to 10 years). Males matured in their third year, the majority of females one year later, partly with spawning cycles of more than one year. Ovaries started to grow in July and attained a weight of 13.3% in October. Atretic eggs (10-30%) were found in one third of adult females. The relative number of eggs decreased with age and size of the fish. The relative liver weight increased with gonadal development by a factor of 2.5. Compared to low-altitude populations the relative liver weight of female Arctic char from Oberer Plenderlesee is significantly higher, indicating compensation for the low environmental temperature. Fish fed during an seasons; the highest values of stomach contents, however, were found at the period of ice-break and in autumn. In winter, Arctic char fed almost exclusively on chironomid larvae. During the ice-free period, the diet was more complex with a predominance of flying insects.																			0003-9136					FEB	1997	138	4					509	524																WOS:A1997WQ50600005

Plankton samples showed that the dominating copepod species in the lake were Eudiaptomus graciloides (Lilljeborg), Cyclops scutifer Sars and Heterocope appendiculata Sars. E. graciloides passed the winter as adults and C. scutifer as copepodids while H. appendiculata was restricted to a short period in the summer. Copepods occurred in the stomachs in Sept.-Oct. and to a certain extent in April-May, but only cyclopids and Heterocope sp. were found. C. scutifer may be the main 1st intermediate host of D. dendriticum and D. ditremum. The potential final hosts were the common gull, Larus canus L., for D. dendriticum and the black-throated diver, Gavia arctica (L.), for D. ditremum. One common gull was experimentally successfully infected with plerocercoids of D. dendriticum. The parasites showed no seasonal cycle in incidence of infection.																			0022-1112	1095-8649					1978	13	1					51	71		10.1111/j.1095-8649.1978.tb03413.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.1978.tb03413.x													WOS:A1978FP27600007
J	Nisa, FU; Umar, R				Nisa, Fahim Un; Umar, Rashid			Spring water system classifications and their methods of study: An overview of the current status and future perspectives	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Spring constitutes one of the primary water resources in some parts of the world, such as the Indian Himalayas. However, these remain imperfectly surveyed and delineated far and wide in most areas worldwide. Due to natural and anthropogenic factors, the springs are under great threat. All over the globe, springs have left as data deficit and have not relatively gained considerable attention in comparison to other systems like rivers, streams, lakes, and wetlands. This is also true for India, where most of the research is usually centered on groundwater, rivers, lakes and wetlands. This manuscript presents an overview of studies carried out on various themes of spring water systems, such as characteristics, classification schemes, and different empirical and analytical methods at international and national levels. A comprehensive overview of the literature identified the demand for an integrated approach of different empirical and analytical methods to strengthen the understanding of spring hydrology in the Himalayan region and elsewhere.																			2347-4327	0973-774X				JAN 8	2024	133	1							10	10.1007/s12040-023-02218-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-023-02218-7													WOS:001137242200006
J	Timm, T				Timm, T			Oligochaeta of Lake Taimyr: A preliminary survey	HYDROBIOLOGIA					VI International Symposium on Aquatic Oligochaetes	SEP 05-10, 1994	STROMSTAT, SWEDEN					Lake Taimyr in Siberia is northernmost among the world's large lakes: 73 degrees 40' -75 degrees 20' N, 99-106 degrees E. The lake area is up to 4650 km(2) in summer, with a maximum depth of 26 m and a mean depth of only 2.8 m. The ice-free period lasts about three months. The water level sinks 5.5-6 m during winter, so that 85% of the bottom surface is frozen into ice for some time and subjected to negative temperatures, probably down to -20 degrees C. In artificially melted sediment samples, 75-92% of animals survived. The average summer biomass of zoobenthos is about 1 g m(-2) wet weight, a half of this being formed by Oligochaeta. Altogether 76 samples with 3742 oligochaete specimens collected by V. N. Greze in 1943-1944 were studied. At least 14 taxa of Tubificidae, Lumbriculidae, and Enchytraeidae were found in the lake, and some more enchytraeids in an adjacent river. Many immature animals could not be identified to species. Naididae were completely lacking probably due to the absence of macrovegetation. The shallow freezing zone is inhabited mostly by Alexandrovia ringulata. The profundal fauna is dominated by Lamprodrilus isoporus, Stylodrilus sp., and Isochaetides sp.																			0018-8158					OCT 14	1996	334	1-3					89	95		10.1007/BF00017357	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017357													WOS:A1996VY79600011
J	VINER, AB				VINER, AB			LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS ON THE EFFECTS OF LIGHT AND TEMPERATURE ON THE UPTAKE OF NUTRIENTS BY LAKE ROTONGAIO PHYTOPLANKTON	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of sustained light and temperature of the uptake of PO43--P, NH4+-N and NO3--N and on the biomass of the phytoplankton of Lake Rotongaio. Two sets of experiments compared differences between the seasonally contrasting dominant phytoplankton species, which consist of a filamentous N-fixing cyanophyte in summer and diatoms in winter. The extent to which nutrients became exhausted, cell N/P ratios changed, and N-fixation was enhanced, depended on the amount of light supplied and strongly indicated that light is the limiting factor for phytoplankton growth under normal lake conditions. Re-illumination after extended periods of darkness suggested that sedimentation below the euphotic zone could be tolerated by the phytoplankton, and that growth could be quickly reestablished upon re-entry to better light conditions. Temperature could have some effect on metabolic rate but is probably of minor importance compared to light availability for the species selection and overall nutrient dynamics of the lake.																			0028-8330	1175-8805					1984	18	3					323	340		10.1080/00288330.1984.9516054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.1984.9516054													WOS:A1984TU48400007

Groves, a regionally alien and invasive charophyte, on macrophyte diversity in the species native range	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study aimed to determine the relationships between the abundance of Nitellopsis obtusa, a controversial charophyte, locally red-listed in its native Eurasian range but invasive in North America, and the species diversity of macrophyte stands dominated by N. obtusa. Three lakes of different morphology, productivity and catchment were surveyed in the species native range. In each lake, the species composition and cover of three N. obtusa-dominated stands were determined monthly from spring to autumn and illustrated by the Shannon-Wiener diversity index. Water chemistry supplemented vegetation study. The species diversity turned out to be lake-specific and declined with the increasing share of N. obtusa, which developed mass occurrence in less mineralised and less fertile waters, leaving no space and limiting light and nutrient availability for large and branchy macrophytes. We postulate that this mechanism makes N. obtusa a superior competitor in less fertile waters and seems common to both native and invaded territories, as is the pool of macrophyte species most frequently co-occurring with N. obtusa.					; Brzozowski, Michał/AAB-2500-2022; Pełechaty, Mariusz/HDN-8393-2022; Pukacz, Andrzej/L-7757-2014; Pukacz, Andrzej/O-1936-2019	Pelechaty, Mariusz/0000-0002-4075-6561; Brzozowski, Michal/0000-0002-8028-2129; Zhapparova, Bazargul/0000-0002-7591-2667; Pukacz, Andrzej/0000-0002-2395-1680; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN	2022	849	1					63	76		10.1007/s10750-021-04710-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04710-x		OCT 2021											WOS:000705789400002

Circulation and stream plume modeling in Conesus Lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT												A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model that includes the effect of drag from macrophytes was applied to Conesus Lake to study the seasonal circulation and thermal structure during spring and early summer. Local weather conditions and stream flow data were used to drive the model. The drag coefficient for macrophytes was calculated as a function of leaf density. In general, the model results show good agreements with the observations, including vertical temperature profiles measured at two locations and average surface temperature derived from calibrated thermal imagery for large-scale simulations of the entire lake. Additional high-resolution simulations were carried out to understand water circulation and transport of sediment and model-generated tracer during hydrometeorological events at stream mouths for two experimental sites. The model results show that the plume development at stream mouths during storm events in Conesus Lake are site-dependent and may either be current- or wind-driven. The results also show a significant effect from the presence of macrophytes on sediment deposition near stream mouths.

Reproductive contribution of lake sturgeon transferred upstream of dams on a Great Lakes tributary	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Dam construction contributes to declines in the distribution and abundance of many fishes. Increasing connectivity through adult transfer can be demographically and genetically beneficial, but assessing the effects resulting from transfer can be difficult if resident fish exist upstream. Genotypes of adult and larval lake sturgeon ( Acipenser fulvescens) were used to quantify contributions to larval recruitment from adults transferred upstream of dams on the Menominee River, USA. We evaluated whether transfer timing, sex, and adult size were associated with the odds of reproduction. Elevator transfer operations in Fall 2019, Fall 2020, and Spring 2021 resulted in 152 male and 81 female lake sturgeon transferred upstream. In 2020 and 2021, 580 and 518 larvae were genotyped. We found that 86% (201/233) of adults reproduced and 62.3% (684/1098) of offspring had transferred parents. In total, we estimated that 392 resident adults contributed to offspring production. Mixed matings accounted for 53% of offspring genotyped, increasing levels of offspring genetic diversity relative to offspring produced from resident-only matings. Transferring adults may be a viable restoration alternative for other iteroparous fish in river systems where connectivity to spawning areas has been impeded.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JAN	2025	82								215	10.1139/cjfas-2024-0215	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2024-0215													WOS:001410649000001

A relation between the developmental rate of embryos and temperature was found. At 11-20 m depth in Lake Esrom deposition of cocoons occurred in spring and summer, beginning at lower depths at about 5.degree. C due to a larger weight of the specimens here. Usually breeding first ceased at lower depths because of higher temperature. In the deepest parts of the lake the breeding period may be shortened by anaerobic conditions. The production of eggs per individual increased with decreasing depth. Deposition of cocoons was accompanied by decrease in weight of the individuals.																			0003-9136						1975	76	4					449	474																WOS:A1975BB82200004
J	HAMBURGER, K				HAMBURGER, K			ENERGY-FLOW IN THE POPULATIONS OF EUDIAPTOMUS-GRACILOIDES AND DAPHNIA-GALEATA IN LAKE ESROM	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The crustacean plankton in eutrophic Lake Esrom, Denmark, is dominated by the calanoid copepod, Eudiaptomus graciloides and the daphnid, Daphnia galeata. The annual energy flow within the two populations was estimated on the basis of earlier reports on production and population dynamics, and respiration rates measured in animals cultured in the laboratory. In both populations the assimilation reached a maximum in mid-summer, at the time when the spring bloom was over and the phytoplankton production was decreasing. The production efficiency (K2) varied greatly with the season, reflecting the large variations in ambient food concentration. The respiratory expenditures are discussed in relation to the food concentration. It is concluded that the annual energy flow in the planktonic crustaceans lies between a minimum of 535 kcal m-2 and a maximum of 670 kcal m-2, out of which 185 kcal m-2 continue to higher trophic levels. These values correspond to 27-33% and 9% of the gross phytoplankton production, respectively.																			0003-9136					FEB	1986	105	4					517	530																WOS:A1986A251900007
J	Grasby, SE; Londry, KL				Grasby, Stephen E.; Londry, Kathleen L.			Biogeochemistry of hypersaline springs supporting a mid-continent marine ecosystem: An analogue for martian springs?	ASTROBIOLOGY					Special Session on Extreme Environments held at the Geological-Society-of-America Annual Meeting	2005	Salt Lake City, UT	Geol Soc Amer				Hypersaline springs that host unique mid-continent marine ecosystems were examined in central Manitoba, Canada. The springs originate from a reflux of glacial meltwater that intrudes into underlying bedrock and dissolved buried salt beds. Two spring types were distinguished based both on flow rate and geochemistry. High flow springs ( greater than 10 L/s) hosted extensive marine microbial mats, which were dominated by algae but also included diverse microbes. These varied somewhat between springs as indicated by changes in profiles of fatty acid methyl esters. Culture studies confirmed the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria in sediments at the high flow sites. In contrast, low flow springs were affected by solar evaporation, increasing salinity, and temperature. These low flow springs behaved more like closed nutrient-limited systems and did not support microbial mats. Direct comparison of the high and low flow springs revealed interesting implications for the potential to record biosignatures in the rock record. High flow springs have abundant, well-developed microbial mats, which desiccate and are cemented along the edges of the spring pools; however, the high mass flux overwhelms any geochemical signature of microbial activity. In contrast, the nutrient-limited low flow sites develop strong geochemical signatures of sulfate reduction, even in the absence of microbial mats, due to less dilution with the lower flows. Geochemical and physical evidence for life did not correlate with the abundance of microbial life but, rather, with the extent to which the biological system formed a closed ecosystem.

Both display declining trends during the past 68 years (1954-2021). In this study, the influencing factors of spring gales and DSs around northern China and possible adjustment functions of the East Atlantic (EA) teleconnection pattern have been investigated. It was found that the major systems controlling spring gales include the North Polar vortex (NPV), mid-high-latitude blocking highs (BHs), air pressure status of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) over the Eurasian continent, India-Burma trough (IBT) and western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH). Under synthetic atmospheric circulation conditions of an enlarged NPV, lower air pressure over the TP, a strong IBT, and a southeastward-retreated WPSH, spring gales increase, and the frequency of DS occurrence is increased, and vice versa. Additionally, spring gales are also negatively affected by BHs. The most important is the Baikal BH, which has influence not only in previous seasons but also in the contemporary spring. Furthermore, the NPV and IBT have close negative correlation with the EA pattern, whereas the TP and WPSH have positive correlation with the EA pattern both in previous seasons and in the contemporary spring. A high-pitched EA pattern results in a strong western current north of Lake Baikal, which may prohibit the expansion of the NPV in the sector of northern China. A shrunk NPV means infrequent cold air attacks and decreased gales and DSs.

Leeches of the upper aerodigestive tract	REVUE DE STOMATOLOGIE ET DE CHIRURGIE MAXILLO-FACIALE												Introduction. The leech is an aquatic worm living in fresh water, especially in tropical areas. It may be found exceptionally in the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) after consumption of spring water or water from natural wells, after swimming in still waters (lakes and dams). The author's objective was to study epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic, and evolutive aspects of this infestation. Patient and methods. This prospective 2-year study was carried out from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2008. We included all patients consulting at the emergency unit presenting with leeches in the UA DT. Results. Twenty patients living in rural settings were included: 16 children, mostly boys (sex ratio 3:1). All cases were recorded during the summer season, with 14 cases due to consumption of fresh water and six due to swimming in still waters. The delay between infestation and onset of symptoms ranged from 2 to 15 days. Leeches were found in the oropharynx (six cases), the nasopharynx (five cases), the hypopharynx (six cases), and the glottis (three cases). An anemia syndrome was noted in four patients. All parasites were removed. All patients were given local antiseptics and analgesics. Patients with anemia were given iron supplementation. The outcome was favorable for all patients. Discussion. UA DT leeches are not uncommon in Morocco. The infestation is usually observed in the summer. Symptom vary according to UADT localization. The diagnosis should be made rapidly to prevent complications. Whatever the localization, removing the parasite is difficult. In laryngeal localizations induction general anesthesia is recommended, without intubation. Evolution after treatment is rapidly favorable, with complete disappearance of symptoms.

However, recent advances in acoustic telemetry technology have facilitated measurements of individual behaviour at scales not previously possible in aquatic ecosystems. Methods Using a Walleye (Sander vitreus) population inhabiting Black Bay, Lake Superior, we examine whether life history characteristics differ between more and less mobile individuals as predicted by Pace of Life Syndrome. We tracked the movement of 192 individuals from 2016 to 2019 using an acoustic telemetry study, relating patterns in annual migratory behaviour to individual growth, and seasonal changes in optimal thermal-optical habitat. Results We observed two consistent movement patterns in our study population-migratory individuals left Black Bay during late summer to early fall before returning to the bay, whereas residents remained within the bay year-round. The average maximum length of migrant Walleye was 5.5 cm longer than residents, and the sex ratios of Walleye caught during fall surveys was increasingly female-biased towards the mouth of Black Bay, suggesting that a majority of migrants were females. Further, Walleye occupancy outside of Black Bay was positively associated with increasing thermal-optical habitat. Conclusions Walleye in Black Bay appear to conform to Pace of Life Syndrome, with migrant individuals gaining increased fitness through increased maximum size, which, given size-dependent fecundity in this species, likely results in greater reproductive success (via greater egg deposition vs. non-migrants). Further, apparent environmental (thermal) controls on migration suggest that migratory Walleye (more so than residents) may be more sensitive to changing environmental conditions (e.g., warming climate) than residents.					; Dunlop, Erin/HGA-8508-2022; Pratt, Thomas/LTC-9063-2024	Mackereth, Robert/0000-0002-5017-1567; Pratt, Thomas/0009-0003-3648-2144; 													2051-3933					MAR 2	2022	10	1							10	10.1186/s40462-022-00308-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40462-022-00308-7								35236408					WOS:000763406000002

THE STUDY OF NODULARIA SPUMIGENA BLOOM EVENT IN THE SOUTHERN CASPIAN SEA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Despite the increase in phytoplankton population in the Caspian Sea, there is few detail study regarding bloom of some species in the recent years. Previous studies have announced the bloom-forming Cyanophyta Nodularia spumigena Mertens to the Caspian Sea. In this study, we attempt to understand the bloom events that are involved Nodularia spumigena population and environmental parameters in the Iranian coastal water in 2009. The preliminary results suggested that Nodularia spumigena observed in the Caspian Sea in some seasons at different depths but bloom formation starting from middle of summer and reach a maximum in the early of autumn at the surface. Result of this study also showed that phytoplankton assemblage comprised of 46 species after bloom. Bacillariophyta had the highest number of species (17) follow by Pyrrophyta (14), Cyanophyta and Chlorophyta (6) and Euglenophyta (3). But, phytoplankton species of bloom sample is classified in three groups: Cyanophyta, Pyrrophyta and Bacillariophyta which Cyanophyta dominated over the other groups of algae and formed more than 98% and 96% of phytoplankton abundance and biomass, respectively. As of now, the pattern of dominant and frequent species in the Caspian Sea indicated that the health of the water body and aquatic organisms are at risk.

J	Murphy, NP; Adams, M; Austin, AD				Murphy, Nicholas P.; Adams, Mark; Austin, Andrew D.			Independent colonization and extensive cryptic speciation of freshwater amphipods in the isolated groundwater springs of Australia's Great Artesian Basin	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												The groundwater-dependent springs of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) in arid inland Australia represent a unique and threatened ecosystem. These incredibly isolated springs support a diverse array of endemic flora and fauna. One of the common faunal groups in the GAB springs is the freshwater amphipods of the family Chiltoniidae. The morphological conservatism and taxonomic uncertainty associated with these amphipods has ensured their true biodiversity, phylogeographical history and evolutionary affinities have remained unknown. We have used mitochondrial DNA and allozyme data to unravel a complicated history of isolation, extinction and dispersal among spring amphipod populations across the GAB. The results provide evidence for multiple independent colonizations in the GAB springs, particularly within the Lake Eyre group of springs. The inclusion of a group of Western Australian (WA) stygobitic amphipods from populations up to 1500 km away found surprising evidence for a shared evolutionary history between stygobitic and GAB spring amphipods. Approximate dating of the diversity found between major clades suggests the majority of lineages originated in the late Miocene, around the time of the aridification of inland Australia. The large number of independent lineages and the close connection between GAB spring and WA stygobitic amphipods suggest that a significantly rich amphipod fauna existed in the much wetter environment that once existed in inland Australia. The results also provide evidence for a gross underestimation of the species diversity within the springs, with 12 putative species identified, a conclusion with significant implications for the ongoing conservation of the GAB springs.					; Murphy, Nick/J-9883-2019	Murphy, Nick/0000-0002-0907-4642; 													0962-1083	1365-294X				JAN	2009	18	1					109	122		10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.04007.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.04007.x								19140968					WOS:000261962300012

Since the 1990s, the advances have caused the formation of ice-dammed Dan & PRIME; Zhur Lake, which has filled and drained in summers following a surge event. Here, we report how these drainages initially occur through a subglacial channel under the glacier terminus, which then typically closes the following winter, enabling another lake to form and drain the next summer. However, our remote sensing and field observations indicate that after several drainage events, a subaerial ice canyon is formed through the glacier terminus, which prevents another lake from forming until after the glacier surges again. We predict that the next surge of Dan & PRIME; Zhur Glacier will occur around the mid-2020s, causing the formation of a larger Dan & PRIME; Zhur Lake during the following quiescent phase because, despite periodic advances, a long-term trend of glacier recession is exposing a larger basin for the lake to form in. However, each subsequent surge is causing less terminus advance than the previous one, until ultimately the surges will be insufficient to dam Dan & PRIME; Zhur Chu' (Donjek River), and lakes will cease to form.					; Will, Kochtitzky/AAW-8532-2021	Dow, Christine/0000-0003-1346-2258; Kochtitzky, William/0000-0001-9487-1509; Copland, Luke/0000-0001-5374-2145; Medrzycka, Dorota/0000-0002-5391-3239														2368-7460				SEP	2024	10	3					583	595		10.1139/as-2023-0001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/as-2023-0001		JUN 2023											WOS:001013461500001
J	Ingleton, T; McMinn, A				Ingleton, Timothy; McMinn, Andrew			Thermal plume effects: A multi-disciplinary approach for assessing effects of thermal pollution on estuaries using benthic diatoms and satellite imagery	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Rapid, reliable and cost-effective techniques for assessing and monitoring pollution are required because of increased development pressures associated with continued population growth. An innovative multidisciplinary approach was applied to a power station discharge in Lake Macquarie, Australia, using benthic diatoms, water quality, satellite imagery and temperature loggers. Triplicate sediment samples at five sites across a thermal gradient in one plume affected and two control bays were analysed for benthic diatoms. Multivariate analysis indicated that diatom assemblages and environmental gradients in the receiving water embayment were significantly different to control bays. The plume affected benthic assemblages to greater depths (similar to 4.7 m) than observed by previous studies and this is likely to have implications for estimates of estuarine productivity and nutrient cycling. Of the 244 diatom taxa identified, Navicula rhaphoneis appeared to best identify areas of the lake bed exposed to temperatures 3 -4 degrees C above ambient (Delta T). Tryblionella lanceola, Tryblionella littoralis, Grammatophora spp. and Psammodictyon panduriformis also contributed to gradients and might be used as plume indicator species. Temperature, ammonia, oxidised nitrogen and selenium significantly explained gradients in the species data (p = 0.02). Satellite imagery indicated that receiving bay temperature gradients (<7 degrees C) were greatest in winter, whereas loggers showed Delta T was greatest in autumn then winter. These analyses highlighted that seasonality is an important factor when considering the effects of thermal plumes on receiving environment ecology. Analyses of imagery and logger data are effective techniques for managers to routinely assess plume intensity and extent. This study demonstrates that both benthic diatoms and satellite imagery are valuable tools for the monitoring and assessment of thermal pollution in coastal environments.

Use of stable isotope analysis to evaluate the possible impact of fish migration on a lake biomanipulation	AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS												1. A lake restoration project involving mass fish removals was started to improve further the water quality of a lake recovering from severe eutrophication. The effectiveness of such biomanipulation as a lake management option could be compromised if removed fish are rapidly replaced by large-scale immigration from a connected lake. 2. Stable isotope analysis (SIA) was used to examine the migrations of perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) and roach (Rutilus rutilus (L.)) between two connected lakes in central Finland, Jyvasjarvi and the larger Paijanne. Baseline delta N-15 signatures in primary consumers were significantly higher in Jyvasjarvi and this difference was reflected further up the food chain in fish. 3. Spring fish spawning migrations from Paijanne resulted in a significant decrease in mean delta N-15 signatures of both perch and roach in the adjacent part of Jyvasjarvi, but by summer these mean delta N-15 signatures in fish muscle tissue had increased again to match those in the rest of the lake. delta C-13 signatures of both fish species were more variable and were of less value for tracking fish migrations. 4. A robust discriminant analysis was used to classify perch and roach caught from Jyvasjarvi into fish originating from either Jyvasjarvi or Paijanne. The greatest proportions of immigrant perch and roach in Jyvasjarvi were observed in spring 2004 (71% and 56%), when biomanipulation of Jyvasjarvi had started. Immigrant fish percentages in the following spring were considerably lower (24% and 14%, respectively), most likely due to effective biomanipulation. 5. Results indicate that the current biomanipulation has decreased the extent of the spring migration, and that immigrant fish have not significantly repopulated Jyvasjarvi after the intense fishing. More generally, the data illustrate how stable isotopes offer the possibility to track migrations of common fish species between adjacent freshwater lakes.

J	Goldbach, A; Kuttler, W				Goldbach, Anja; Kuttler, Wilhelm			Turbulent Heat Fluxes above a Suburban Reservoir: A Case Study from Germany	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												With the objective of quantifying turbulent sensible Q(H) and latent Q(E) heat fluxes above a suburban reservoir, a micrometeorological turbulence measurement campaign using the eddy covariance technique was carried out between June and November 2012 on the Baldeneysee, an artificial lake (2.64 km(2) area with up to 4-m depth) located in Germany. The study was conducted at this site because there is little information on this type of lake and the findings are important for the local water management system. Sensible heat fluxes show a mean diurnal course with maximum positive values during the early morning hours (maximum = +31.3 W m(-2)) and negative values in the afternoon (minimum = -12.3 W m(-2)). During daytime, average Q(H)/Q* ratios (where Q* is the radiation balance) are, in general, smaller than 0.20. Sensible heat fluxes are especially affected by the product of wind speed and water-air temperature difference, as well as the magnitude of global radiation. In contrast, mean hourly values of Q(E) are, on average, positive over the whole day, with an absolute spread between +175.1 and -0.8W m(-2). During daytime in summer, 74% of the radiation balance is transferred via Q(E). The measurement values show that during two summer days, 3.72 and 2.84 mm day(-1) of water could be evaporated, whereas during two measurement days in autumn, evaporation rates of only 1.36 and 0.94 mm day(-1) were registered. The magnitude of Q(E) is mainly affected by four main parameters: the product of wind speed and vapor pressure deficit, followed by the magnitude of global radiation and water temperature.																			1525-755X	1525-7541				FEB	2015	16	1					244	260		10.1175/JHM-D-13-0159.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-13-0159.1													WOS:000349367500017
J	Netherland, MD; Skogerboe, JD; Owens, CS; Madsen, JD				Netherland, MD; Skogerboe, JD; Owens, CS; Madsen, JD			Influence of water temperature on the efficacy of diquat and endothall versus curlyleaf pondweed	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Studies were conducted in a greenhouse facility and a pond to determine the impact of water temperature on the efficacy of the contact herbicides diquat (6,7-dihydrodipyrido [1,2-alpha :2',1'-c] pyrazinediium ion) and endothall (7-oxabicyclo [2.2.1] heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid) for control of the exotic nuisance species curlyleaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus L.) across a range of water temperatures. Although P. crispus is reported to be highly susceptible to contact herbicides, treatments are usually conducted late in the growing season after turion formation has occurred. These turions are the major source of reinfestation the following spring, and treatment strategies to prevent their production would require applications at water temperatures which are generally thought to inhibit herbicide efficacy. Herbicide treatments were applied to 50-L aquaria containing curlyleaf pondweed growing at water temperatures of 10, 12.5, 15, 20, and 25C. Both diquat and endothall efficacy was inhibited as water temperature decreased; however, treatments at all temperatures significantly reduced biomass and turion formation. Although treatments conducted at 25C were the most efficacious, waiting until the water warms to this temperature limits the potential for reducing turion production. Endothall treatment of small plots in a pond infested with curlyleaf pondweed demonstrated that a late March treatment (18C water) reduced turion densities by 86%, whereas a mid-May treatment (25C water) reduced turions by 40% compared to untreated plots. Based on results of this study, it is recommended that early spring and fall treatment strategies are rested to determine if curlyleaf pondweed can be more effectively managed on a long-term basis by reducing turion populations.

In this study, we assessed the atmospheric gaseous and particulate levels of eight NHFRs in nine urban areas in China. We detected high mean atmospheric (vapour plus particle phases) concentrations of tetrabromophthalate (TBPH) (74.8 pg m(-3)) and decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) (68.8 pg m(-3)), two major NHFRs. Most of the gaseous and particulate NHFR concentrations presented seasonal variations (from summer to autumn), possibly driven by temperature. Spatially, concentrations and patterns of the NHFRs differed among the nine cities. Significantly higher concentrations were detected in cities with higher gross domestic products. The composition, especially the DBDPE/TBPH ratio (S), were clearly different among the cities, which pattern in each city are likely driven by variations in the type of industries operating in each city. Based on the temporal analysis of other researches and our data, PBDE levels have decreased markedly, while NHFRs levels have increased. Since high NHFR levels had detrimental effects on public health, NHFRs research warrants more attention. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Körner, S				Körner, S			Development of submerged macrophytes in shallow Lake Muggelsee (Berlin, Germany) before and after its switch to the phytoplankton-dominated state	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The occurrence of macrophyte- and phytoplankton-dominated states has been studied in shallow Lake Muggelsee, which, due to its rather high average depth and naturally eutrophic condition, differs from most typical shallow lakes. At the beginning of the 20(th) century, a diverse vegetation covered one third of the lake with a maximum colonisation depth of 4 m. Secchi depths were high although cyanobacteria blooms, dominated by Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Microcystis spec., occurred in late summer. Increasing eutrophication finally led to disappearance of submerged plant stands around 1970 and a switch to phytoplankton dominance. Cyanobacteria were now mainly represented by Planktothrix agardhii and Limnothrix redekei, preventing a clear-water phase in spring. Turbidity increased significantly after disappearance of submerged plants. Since 1990, external nutrient loads have been reduced. Cyanobacteria structure reversed to dominance of Aphanizomenon and Microcystis resulting in a clear-water phase in spring and re-appearance of submerged macrophytes. Nevertheless, submerged plant stands still covered only 3 % of the total lake area in 1999. Average colonisation depth, biomass and colonisation densities of the dominant species Potamogeton pectinatus are low. Hitherto, re-colonisation by other species formerly present in the lake has not taken place. Exclosure experiments revealed that grazing by herbivorous birds or fish hamper re-colonisation.																			0003-9136					OCT	2001	152	3					395	409																WOS:000172108800003
J	Stanton, C; Barnes, BD; Kump, LR; Cosmidis, J				Stanton, Chloe; Barnes, Ben Davis; Kump, Lee R.; Cosmidis, Julie			A re-examination of the mechanism of whiting events: A new role for diatoms in Fayetteville Green Lake (New York, USA)	GEOBIOLOGY												Whiting events-the episodic precipitation of fine-grained suspended calcium carbonates in the water column-have been documented across a variety of marine and lacustrine environments. Whitings likely are a major source of carbonate muds, a constituent of limestones, and important archives for geochemical proxies of Earth history. While several biological and physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the onset of these precipitation events, no consensus has been reached thus far. Fayetteville Green Lake (New York, USA) is a meromictic lake that experiences annual whitings. Materials suspended in the water column collected through the whiting season were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy. Whitings in Fayetteville Green Lake are initiated in the spring within the top few meters of the water column, by precipitation of fine amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) phases nucleating on microbial cells, as well as on abundant extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) frequently associated with centric diatoms. Whiting particles found in the summer consist of 5-7 mu m calcite grains forming aggregates with diatoms and EPS. Simple calculations demonstrate that calcite particles continuously grow over several days, then sink quickly through the water column. In the late summer, partial calcium carbonate dissolution is observed deeper in the water column. Settling whiting particles, however, reach the bottom of the lake, where they form a major constituent of the sediment, along with diatom frustules. The role of diatoms and associated EPS acting as nucleation surfaces for calcium carbonates is described for the first time here as a potential mechanism participating in whitings at Fayetteville Green Lake. This mechanism may have been largely overlooked in other whiting events in modern and ancient environments.

J	Gibson, CE; Wang, G; Foy, RH				Gibson, CE; Wang, G; Foy, RH			Silica and diatom growth in Lough Neagh: the importance of internal recycling	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Lough Neagh is a large eutrophic lake with a high dissolved silica (SiO2) concentration arising from the basaltic rock in parts of the catchment and the normal winter maximum concentration is over 8 mg L-1. Based on frequent observations between 1974 and 1997, the annual cycles of SiO2 input, uptake and release are explored. 2. Large spring blooms of the planktonic diatoms Aulacoseira subarctica and Stephanodiscus astraea occur every year and are terminated by SiO2 depletion. Although there are periods when one diatom species has dominated the other, over the period as a whole, the two diatoms appear to be in a stable coexistence. 3. A model of the effect of river inputs on lake concentration shows that without SiO2 release from the sediment, the maximum spring dissolved SiO2 concentration (and hence diatom crop) would be only about one-third of that actually observed. 4. It is concluded that within-lake processes play a large role and are potentially more variable than catchment processes in determining the available SiO2 in Lough Neagh. 5. The role of benthic animals, especially Chironomus anthracinus, in the sediment SiO2 release process is discussed. Field data suggest the SiO2 release rate is highly sensitive to temperature, but this could be partly caused by an interaction between temperature and animal activity.																			0046-5070					NOV	2000	45	3					285	293		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2000.00624.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2000.00624.x													WOS:000165904400001

Differential response to climatic variation of free-floating and submerged macrophytes in ditches	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Experimental studies have indicated in freshwater ecosystems that a shift in dominance from submerged to free-floating macrophytes may occur with climate change because of increased water surface temperatures and eutrophication. Field evidence is, however, rare. 2. Here, we analysed long-term (26 years) dynamics of macrophyte cover in Dutch ditches in relation to Dutch weather variables and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) winter index. The latter appears to be a good proxy for Dutch weather conditions. 3. Cover of both free-floating macrophytes and evergreen overwintering submerged macrophytes was positively related to mild winters (positive NAO winter index). On the other hand, high cover of submerged macrophytes that die back in winter coincided with cold winters (negative NAO winter index). Our results therefore suggest that the effect of weather on macrophyte species depends strongly on their overwintering strategy. 4. The positive relation of free-floating macrophytes with the NAO winter index was significantly stronger in ditches in organic soil than in those in inorganic soil. This may be because of increased nutrient loading associated with increased decomposition of organic matter and increased run-off to these ditches during mild wet winters. 5. Our results suggest that mild winters in a changing climate may cause submerged macrophytes with an evergreen overwintering strategy and free-floating macrophytes to outcompete submerged macrophytes that die back in winter.

In October 2013, upon the increase in whitefish abundance, the species richness of zooplankton increased insignificantly; the values of the trophic coefficient and the Shannon index, calculated by the number, increased; and the specific number of Rotifera and Cladocera decreased. At the same time, atypical changes were recorded in the development parameters of zooplankton invertebrates. They were expressed as an increase in the total biomass due to Cladocera, among which large Daphnia (Ctenodaphnia) magna Straus occupied the leading position.

Avian influenza sampling and surveillance of wholesale and retail markets in Nanchang, the largest city in the southwestern region of Poyang Lake, have been conducted since 2017. The transmission pattern of avian influenza in this region was comprehensively evaluated in multiple dimensions including time, subtype changes, seasonality and meteorological factors. Samples were tested for avian influenza A virus nucleic acids using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and positive results were typed. Wavelet coherence analysis was used to reveal the time-frequency variation in meteorological factors associated with avian influenza. The random forest algorithm was used to perform a multifactorial analysis of meteorological factors. Results revealed that the highest avian influenza positivity rate of 42.29 % (95 % CI: 41.18-43.41) occurred in summer. Meteorological factors were found to be significantly associated with the avian influenza positivity rate on a periodic basis. Random forest analysis revealed significant heterogeneity between meteorological factors and changes in the positivity rates of different avian influenza subtypes. Pollution concentration significantly affected the positivity rate of different avian influenza subtypes. The effect of temperature on the positivity rate of the H5 and H9 subtypes followed the opposite pattern to that of the non-H5/H7/H9 positivity rate. In winter, positivity rates of the H5 and H9 subtypes were lower and those of the non-H5/H7/H9 samples were higher; the opposite was true in spring. There is a correlation between pollutant concentration and avian influenza positivity rate. Authorities should consider climatic conditions and the level of contaminants in the prevention and control of avian influenza and adopt different preventive and control measures according to the characteristics of the different subtypes. We recommend continued surveillance of avian influenza in the region and the adoption of a 'onehealth' approach for integrated prevention and control.																				2352-7714				JUN	2025	20								101047	10.1016/j.onehlt.2025.101047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2025.101047								40331080					WOS:001479523500001

In this context, in 2009 we started to estimate the concentration of DDTtot (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, sum of p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD, o,p-DDD, p,p- DDE, o,p-DDE) and sumPCB14 (polychlorinated biphenyls 18, 28, 31, 44, 52, 101, 118, 149, 138, 153, 170, 180, 194 and 209) in zooplankton pelagic organisms preyed on by zooplanktivorous fish (size fraction >= 450 mu m). We evaluated taxa specific repositories of DDTtot and sumPCB14, their seasonal variation, their changes over the period 2009-2021 and the potential contribution of different taxa in transferring toxicants to whitefish, based on the Ivlev's Electivity Index. The repository of both POPs was generally higher in spring. A decrease in the zooplankton Standing Stock Biomass (SSB) drove a decline in the zooplankton DDTtot repository over the last six years (2016-2021 SSBmean = 12.5 mg m- 3; 2009-2015; SSBmean = 30 mg m-3), despite the concentration being broadly constant during this period. The sumPCB14 repository was generally characterized by lower values during the last six years, but the difference with the previous period was not so marked. Daphnia and cyclopoids were the major contributors to the repository; however, when the whitefish selectivity index was applied, the role of carnivorous Bythotrephes was more important to the detriment of cyclopoids, particularly in summer and winter. Our results are useful to elaborate predictive models on the transfer of POPs along the food chain and highlight not only the importance of freshwater zooplankton in toto, but also that different taxa can have different roles. The increasing importance of microphagous zooplankton, driven by water warming and extended thermal stratification, underlines the need for future studies on the role of small zooplankton as carriers of POPs in freshwater lakes.					; Bettinetti, Roberta/AAD-7072-2019	Bettinetti, Roberta/0000-0001-7481-6190; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				MAR 20	2024	917								170563	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170563	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170563		JAN 2024						38296082					WOS:001175947800001

Species distribution modelling approaches can prove to be a useful tool in protecting biodiversity. The current study considers the ecological health of pitlakes through models of three winter migratory waterfowl species, namelyAnser indicus(bar-headed goose),Nettapus coromandelianus(cotton pygmy goose) andNetta rufina(red-crested pochard), providing practical information for conservation setups in and around selected pitlakes in Eastern India. The AUC +/- SD (Standard deviation) values of MaxEnt models of target species, viz.A. indicus, N. coromandelianus,andN. rufinaare 0.729 +/- 0.026, 0.772 +/- 0.012, and 0.732 +/- 0.024, respectively. Thus through the evaluation of the respective models and ground truth verification criteria, three pitlakes have proven to hold excellent conditions for the survival of these winter migratory birds as compared to the 20 studied ones. Three zones were created in these three lakes based on their characteristics to support these species and their associates. A large chunk of the region falls under the proposed zone of conservation priority sites from each of the three pitlakes. The need of the hour is to fulfill the voids between researchers, policymakers, and Eastern Coalfield's administration and work towards implementing the proposed idea.					; Gupta, Santanu/C-1608-2014; Mukherjee, Aparajita/AAX-7522-2021; Das, Snehangshu/AAR-9950-2020	Gupta, Santanu/0000-0002-7328-0918; Mukherjee, Aparajita/0000-0002-8308-7660; Gupta, Santanu/0000-0003-1904-5156; Das, Snehangshu/0000-0002-1647-8768; 														2578-4854				AUG	2020	2	8							e216	10.1111/csp2.216	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/csp2.216		JUN 2020											WOS:000544443900001

NUTRIENT MONITORING IN SPANISH WETLANDS USING EPIPHYTIC DIATOMS	VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT												The Water Framework Directive requires that the European Union countries determine the biological state of their waters with respect to sites of high quality. Although bioindicators have been widely applied in running waters and deep lakes throughout Europe, little is known about their applicability in shallow lakes and wetlands. The objective of this work is to check the effectiveness of epiphytic diatoms as indicators of the trophic state in two wetlands of Alava Province (N Spain). Diatom and water chemical samples were collected during summer and autumn 2007, following standard methodology. Stems of submerged macrophyte (Carex riparia, Iris psemlacorus, Veronica anagallis-aquatica) were sampled in each lake. Based on the number of statistically significant correlations between diatom indices and environmental factors, the SID index was show as the most suitable method to assess nutrients within these systems. SID was significantly correlated with TP, NTK and ammonium levels. Among three different plants, only the indices calculated from I. pseudacorus samples were significantly correlated with nutrients.

To understand the status and changes of organochlorine pesticide (OCP) contamination, and to assess the OCPs' risks for the ecosystem in Honghu Lake, thirty surface water samples, fifteen surface sediments, and a sediment core were collected in January and July, 2005. OCPs, such as DDTs, HCHs and chlordanes, were determined by GC-ECD in all samples. Concentrations of OCPs in surface water collected during the wet season (July 2005) were relatively higher than those collected during the dry season (January 2005), indicating that the increasing land runoff during the summer might bring the chemical residues from soils to Honghu Lake. The relatively low alpha-HCH/gamma-HCH ratio and the relatively high o,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDT ratio indicated the application of lindane on regional agricultural lands in late spring and summer (April-August), which increased the increasing contribution of dicofol to DDT in Honghu Lake, respectively. The levels of Sigma HCHs and Sigma DDTs in the surface sediments were relatively lower than those from the Yangtze River Delta, but comparable to those from other lakes and rivers in China. The composition of HCHs and DDTs in the surface sediments showed that there was fresh input of lindane (gamma-HCH), and DDT residues in Honghu Lake were aged and probably mainly originated from weathered agricultural soils of surrounding Jianghan Plain. Wash out of HCHs and DDTs from soil was the possible process which caused the increasing concentrations of these chemicals in recent years. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Surface waters at river mouths, weedy littoral, and pelagic areas from each of three bay regions had pronounced and characteristic differences of chlorophyll contents over and above seasonal and intraseasonal differences. Cultures of algae derived from muds taken beneath these same areas during winter and spring likewise exhibited characteristic areal individualities especially with reference to bloom-forming blue-green spp. A case history of an individual bloom of Diplocystis (=Microcystis) aeruginosa shows that the bloom was accompanied by an increase in gelatinous material disproportionately greater than the increase in chlorophyll of the sp. The possibility of localized origins of blue-green blooms on the basis of wind-produced agitation of sediments is suggested as an explanation of the sporadic outbursts of the blooms in relation to phenomena of ecological succession.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1951	32	4					581	593		10.2307/1932727	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1932727													WOS:A1951XW60800001

GlacierLake incorporates snowfall, in situ snow and ice melt, incoming water from the surrounding catchment, ice lid formation, basal freeze-up and thermal stratification. Snow cover and temperature are varied to test lake development through winter and the maximum lid thickness is recorded. Average wintertime temperatures of -2 to $-30<^>{\circ }{\rm C}$ and total snowfall of 0 to 3.45 m lead to a range of the maximum lid thickness from 1.2 to 2.8 m after ${\sim }250$ days, with snow cover exerting the dominant control. An initial ice temperature of $-15<^>{\circ }{\rm C}$ with simulated advection of cold ice from upstream results in 0.6 m of basal freeze-up. This suggests that lakes with water depths above 1.3 to 3.4 m (dependent on winter snowfall and temperature) upon lid formation will persist through winter. These buried lakes can provide a sizeable water store at the start of the melt season, expedite future lake formation and warm underlying ice even in winter.					; Banwell, Alison/W-8180-2018; Law, Robert/JZD-7970-2024; Arnold, Neil/AAI-2272-2021	Law, Robert/0000-0003-0067-5537; Willis, Ian/0000-0002-0750-7088; Banwell, Alison/0000-0001-9545-829X; 													0022-1430	1727-5652				JUN	2020	66	257					362	372		10.1017/jog.2020.7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/jog.2020.7													WOS:000531857800002

Their reproduction occurs throughout the year, but with peaks in spring and autumn. Embryogenesis duration supposedly depends on the near-bottom water temperature. Hatching appears to be timed to coincide with the periods of increased food supplies. Egg capsule and protoconch morphology has been examined in several species, and four types of capsules are described. Shells of the Baicaliidae are orthostrophic, and only in Liobaicalia stiedae does the protoconch axis differ significantly from the telecconch axis, which was previously mistaken for heterostrophy. Three groups were distinguished on the basis of a cluster analysis of size and number of protoconch whorls. These clusters do not fully coincide with the recent taxonomy of the Baicaliidae based on shell morphology and the female reproductive system. Some species assigned to the same genus or subgenus differ either in protoconch size or egg capsule morphology.					; Sitnikova, Tatiana/JBR-8697-2023	Sitnikova, Tatiana/0000-0002-3278-6111; 													0076-2997						2001	43	1-2					59	85																WOS:000170497500005

The Balkan population has received little attention, making it difficult to assess whether the ecological traits reported for other populations apply also to this population. This hampers the development of targeted conservation measures. The present study reports the first findings on the spatial ecology and daily activity pattern of wildcats in a human modified landscape in Greece, using cutting edge data loggers attached to wildcat collars. In Greece, wildcat home range sizes are within the range of those reported for other populations. Male wildcats are active primarily at night and near dawn and dusk, as is typical for the species. However, the activity of some females varied from this pattern in late spring, in ways expected for wildcats, caring for offspring at a den. Overall, our findings help fill the ecological knowledge gap of the species in Greece and suggest that lowland agricultural areas with patches of natural habitats may have a significant role in the future conservation of the species.The Balkan populations of the European wildcat are among the least studied. This study reports the first findings on the spatial ecology and activity pattern of the wildcat in Greece and compares them to those of better studied northern populations. We fitted five wildcats (two males, three females) with collars containing GPS and accelerometer loggers (E-obs 1A) and collected data from fall to early summer. All animals moved within a mosaic of lowland agricultural fields, woodland patches, riparian forests and wetlands near the banks of a lake. The trapping rate was the highest reported for the species. The home range sizes, estimated using Brownian bridge movement models, ranged from 0.94 to 3.08 km(2) for females and from 1.22 to 4.43 km(2) for males. Based on overall dynamic body acceleration (ODBA) values estimated from the accelerometer data, the diel activity of male wildcats followed the species' typical nocturnal pattern with crepuscular peaks. Female activity varied seasonally, at times being cathemeral. We found only weak effects of environmental variables on wildcat activity, and no significant difference in the activity in open versus forested areas. Our findings suggest that human modified landscapes can play a significant role in the conservation of this typically forest-associated species.					; Gioulatos, Dionysios/C-2150-2008; Karantanis, Nikolaos/C-4774-2013; Astaras, Christos/AAP-4186-2020; Youlatos, Dionisios/C-2150-2008; DIAKOU, ANASTASIA/AED-0130-2022	Migli, Despina/0000-0002-4413-5842; Gioulatos, Dionysios/0000-0001-8276-727X; Diakou, Anastasia/0000-0001-8347-0769; Astaras, Christos/0000-0002-8503-217X													2076-2615					NOV	2021	11	11							3030	10.3390/ani11113030	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani11113030								34827762					WOS:000727052500001

J	Niu, XS; Liu, XF; Chen, WX				Niu, Xinsheng; Liu, Xifang; Chen, Wenxi			The provenance and evolution of thermal spring waters from the Dogai Coring area of Qiangtang basin in Tibet, China	GEOTHERMICS												Chemistry of major and minor elements, Sr-87/Sr-86, delta O, delta D, and delta S-34 of thermal spring water, and S-34 of gypsum were measured from Jurassic strata in the Qiangtang basin, China. The aim is to elucidate the provenance and evolution of thermal spring water, further to reveal geological information on the deep basin. Analysis results show that the spring waters are rich in K and Ca but deficient in Mg and Br. Most spring water samples have TDS within the range of 10-100 g/L, with a few containing 1-10 g/L TDS, and can be referred to as saline springs. High consistency of spring water data with seawater curves indicates that Na and Cl in spring water are derived from residual seawater sequestered in strata, or dissolution of self-evaporiting salts in strata. However, the mean Cl/Br value of spring water samples ranges from 1000 to 30,000, further indicating that solutes in spring water are derived from dissolved evaporites (e.g., NaCl) in strata. Sulfur isotopic characteristics indicate that thermal spring waters commonly dissolve Jurassic gypsum in strata and dolomitization of calcite is the mainly reason for Mg loss. The interpretation of Ca enrichment of spring waters of northwest Wan'an Lake (NWA), Yuanquan River (YQR), and east Thermal Spring (ETS) include: dissolution of gypsum and albitization of plagioclase. Spring waters of south Dogai Coring Lake (SDC) are enriched with more Ca than that at the NWA, YQR and east ETS, mainly due to dissolution of gypsum and dolomitization of calcite. The enrichment of K of spring waters at NWA, YQR and ETS can be attributed to albitization and dissolution of K-feldspar in groundwater. Relatively increased K in SDC spring waters are possibly derived from dissolution of potassium minerals (e.g., KCl). The 2nd member of Xiali Formation has 87Sr/86Sr values distributed in a consistent range with those of thermal spring waters in the Dogai Coring area, which is most likely the source horizon of salts (e.g., halite, gypsum, and sylvine). Modern meteoric water enter strata and dissolve ancient evaporites.

Since their abundance has declined globally due to anthropogenic activities, it is important to include them in aquatic ecosystem restoration programs. Macrophytes establishment in early spring is crucial for the subsequent growth of other warm-adapted macrophytes. However, factors affecting this early establishment of submerged macrophytes have not been fully explored yet. Here, we conducted an outdoor experiment from winter to early spring using the submerged macrophytes Potamogeton crispus and Vallisneria spinulosa to study the effects of shading, nutrient loading, snail herbivory (Radix swinhoei), and their interactions on the early growth and stoichiometric characteristics of macrophytes. The results show that the effects strongly depend on macrophyte species. Biomass and number of shoots of P. crispus decreased, and internode length increased during low light conditions, but were not affected by nutrient loading. P. crispus shoot biomass and number showed hump-shaped responses to increased snail biomass under full light. In contrast, the biomass of the plant linearly decreased with snail biomass under low light. This indicates an interaction of light with snail herbivory. Since snails prefer grazing on periphyton over macrophytes, a low density of snails promoted growth of P. crispus by removing periphyton competition, while herbivory on the macrophyte increased during a high density of snails. The growth of V. spinulosa was not affected by any of the factors, probably because of growth limitation by low temperature. Our study demonstrates that the interaction of light with snail herbivory may affect establishment and growth of submerged macrophytes in early spring. Macrophyte restoration projects may thus benefit from lowering water levels to increase light availability and making smart use of cold-adapted herbivores to reduce light competition with periphyton.

Larvae of rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) dominated late spring and early summer catches and larvae of alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) the midsummer catches. Larval yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were caught in early summer but were rarely the dominant species. The time of spawning and hatching, and thus occurrence of larvae, differed between areas but was less variable for alewives than for yellow perch. The appearance of larvae in Saginaw Bay was followed successively by their appearance in southern, central and northern Lake Huron. Rainbow smelt were most abundant in northern Lake Huron and yellow perch and alewives in inner Saginaw Bay. Densities of either rainbow smelt or alewives occasionally exceeded 1/m3; those of yellow perch never exceeded 0.1/m3. Abundance of alewives was usually highest 1-3 m beneath the surface and, that of rainbow smelt, 2 to at least 6 m beneath the surface. Important nursery areas of rainbow smelt were in bays and off irregular coastlines, and those of yellow perch were in bays. All nearshore waters seemed equally important as nursery areas of alewives.																			0380-1330						1983	9	1					14	22		10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71867-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(83)71867-8													WOS:A1983QG13100004

Multizone Aquatic Ecological Exposures to Landfill Contaminants from a Groundwater Plume Discharging to a Pond	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												While it is recognized that groundwater contaminant plumes can impact surface waters, there remains little information on the magnitude, spatial extent, and especially temporal variability of the resulting exposure to the variety of aquatic organisms, particularly for stagnant surface waters (e.g., ponds). The present study of a historic landfill plume discharging to a pond investigated contaminant exposure to multiple aquatic zones (endobenthic, epibenthic, pelagic) over approximately 1 year within a temperate climate. Landfill tracers included the artificial sweetener saccharin, ammonium, chloride, and specific conductance. Sampling of pond sediment porewater (upwelling groundwater) and continuous geophysical imaging of the subsurface showed a relatively stable plume footprint covering approximately 26% of the pond, although with spatially varying leachate composition, revealing year-round exposure to endobenthic (within sediments) organisms. Substantial and variable contaminant exposure to epibenthic organisms within the plume footprint was shown by elevated specific conductance measured directly above the sediment interface. Exposure varied daily at times and increased through winter to values representing undiluted plume groundwater. Exposure to pelagic organisms (overlying water) covered a larger area (similar to 50%) due to in-pond circulation. The stream outlet concentrations were stable at approximately 10 times dilution for chloride and saccharin, but were substantially less in summer for ammonium due to in-pond processes. Whereas groundwater contaminants are typically assumed elevated at base flows, the outlet stream contaminant mass discharges to downstream receptors were notably higher in winter than summer, following stream flow patterns. Insights from the present study into the timings and locations of contaminant plume exposure to multiple ecological zones of a pond can provide guidance to contaminated site and aquatic ecosystem managers on improved monitoring, assessment, and remediation protocols.

Understanding the behavior of nitrogen (N) in karst aquifers is imperative for effective groundwater quality management. This study combined multiple stable isotopes (82H-H2O, 818O-H2O, 813C-DIC, 815N-NO3, and 818O-NO3), including hydro-chemical data, with a tracer test and a Bayesian isotope mixing (SIAR) model to elucidate the NO3- sources and N cycling within the Babu karst aquifer in Guizhou Province, Southwest China. Nitrate isotopes and SIAR model revealed that manure and sewage, nitrogen fertilizer, and soil organic nitrogen were the three dominant NO3- sources in winter, contributing to 37%, 32%, and 31% to spring NO3-, and 38%, 31%, and 31% to surface water NO3-, respectively. The 818O-NO3 values of sampled waters ranging from 0.3%o to 13.7%o (mean of 7.7 +/- 3.0%o; N = 63) and the significant negative correlations between 815N-NO3 and 813CDIC in the spring waters (P < 0.01) revealed that nitrification was the primary N transformation process in the Babu watershed. Whereas, denitrification might still occur locally, confirmed by the enriched values of 815N-NO3 (14.3 +/- 7.6%o; N = 6) and high denitrification extent (46.6 +/- 22.2%; N = 6) in the springs from residential areas, and by elevated 813C-DIC (-11.2 +/- 0.6%o; N = 26) and 815N-NO3 values (18.9 +/- 5.2%o; N = 26) in the boreholes. During the base flow period, point-inputs of the AMD-impacted stream and sewage waters, and short transit time (<5 days) were conducive to nitrification processes in the karst conduit, resulting in elevated NO3- concentration and NO3-/Cl- ratio at the watershed outlet. Approximately 50% of NO3- flux at the outlet was derived from nitrification, indicating that a significant extent of nitrification occurred in the NH4+-contaminated karst conduit, which may be a new NO3- source to receiving rivers and lakes. This study provided an integrated method for exploring the N dynamics in contaminated karst aquifers. Moreover, the study highlighted that the point N sources control required particular attention for groundwater protection and restoration.																			0043-1354	1879-2448				FEB 15	2022	210								118000	10.1016/j.watres.2021.118000	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.118000		JAN 2022						34996012					WOS:000758719500010
J	Chen, P; Pan, DL				Chen, Peng; Pan, Delu			Ocean Optical Profiling in South China Sea Using Airborne LiDAR	REMOTE SENSING												Increasingly, LiDAR has more and more applications. However, so far, there are no relevant publications on using airborne LiDAR for ocean optical profiling in the South China Sea (SCS). The applicability of airborne LiDAR for optical profiling in the SCS will be presented. A total of four airborne LiDAR flight experiments were conducted over autumn 2017 and spring 2018 in the SCS. A hybrid retrieval method will be presented here, which incorporates a Klett method to obtain LiDAR attenuation coefficient and a perturbation retrieval method for a volume scattering function at 180 degrees. The correlation coefficient between the LiDAR-derived results and the traditional measurements was 0.7. The mean absolute relative error (MAE) and the normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD) between the two are both between 10% and 12%. Subsequently, the vertical structure of the LiDAR-retrieved attenuation and backscattering along airborne LiDAR flight tracks was mapped. In addition to this, ocean subsurface phytoplankton layers were detected between 10 to 20 m depths along the flight track in Sanya Bay. Primary results demonstrated that our airborne LiDAR has an independent ability to survey and characterize ocean optical structure.

J	Viveen, W; Zevallos-Valdivia, L; Sanjurjo-Sanchez, J				Viveen, Willem; Zevallos-Valdivia, Leonardo; Sanjurjo-Sanchez, Jorge			The influence of centennial-scale variations in the South American summer monsoon and base-level fall on Holocene fluvial systems in the Peruvian Andes	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												The occurrence of Holocene changes in the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM) in the Peruvian Andes has been well established in paleoclimatological records such as speleothem, lake and glacier records. How river systems responded to these events has, however, hardly been investigated. Here, we present evidence based on sedimentological, stratigraphical and geomorphological data as well as radiometric (optically stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon) dating that rivers from the Peruvian Andes are extremely sensitive to changes in SASM activity. The presence of lake sediments shows that from at least 12,000 years ago until 4153 +/- 988 years ago a lake was present in the Mantaro River valley, possibly due to damming by a glacier or glacial landforms. A reconstruction of fluvial terrace profiles shows that 4418 +/- 500 years ago the Mantaro and its tributary, the Cunas River, incised and laid down sediments simultaneously as a response to changes in regional base-level and increased SASM activity. The latter was largely subdued during a large part of the Holocene as evidenced by paleoclimatological records in the region. Between 2245 +/- 217 years ago and the present, the frequency of SASM events increased drastically and both rivers formed the majority of their fluvial terraces. In total, over the past 4000 years, the Mantaro River formed five terrace levels and the Cunas River formed seven main terraces. Locally, 11 terrace levels were recognised. Terrace formation occurred at intervals of approximately 250 to 300 years between 2245 +/- 217 and 1188 +/- 60 years ago and approximately every 150 years after 824 +/- 66 years ago until the present. A comparison with paleoclimatological data shows that sedimentation events correlate to periods of increased precipitation and glacier retreat in the Peruvian Andes, whereas phases of incision are attributed to continuous adjustments in base-level fall. Thirty-four metres of incision has occurred since 4418 +/- 500 years ago averaging 7.7 mm yr(-1). A comparison with data from other river systems in the Peruvian Andes shows that many rivers responded in a similar way to centennial-scale variations in SASM activity. Fluvial activity is thus not related to interannual variations in the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) contrary to previous proposals.

Water level in Columbia Lake was lowered by 1.15 m over a 2-week period in November 2001. The total phosphorus (TP) concentrations ranged from 63 to 486 mug L-1 in Columbia Lake and 71 to 373 mug L-1 at its outflow. All samples exceeded the Provincial Water Quality Objective of 30 mug TP L-1. Outflow concentrations of suspended solids and TP increased significantly with decreasing lake level and were attributed to the resuspension of cohesive bottom sediments that occurred at a critical threshold lake level (0.65 m below summer level). Suspended solids at the outflow consisted of flocculated cohesive materials with a median diameter (D-50) of c. 5 mum. Particulate organic carbon accounted for 8.5% of the suspended solids export by mass. A total mass of 18.5 t of suspended solids and 62.6 kg TP was exported from Columbia Lake, which represents a significant pulse of sediment-associated P to downstream environments each autumn during drawdown. The downstream impacts of this release can be minimized if the water level in Columbia Lake is lowered no more than 0.5 m below summer levels.

To grasp a more comprehensive understanding of PPCP pollution from the perspective of the whole basin, the occurrence, spatial and seasonal variation, source, and flux of thirteen PPCPs across the different environmental compartments of the northern Taihu Lake Basin (TLB) were studied. The results showed that the non-therapeutic pharmaceuticals caffeine (CFI) and n, n-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) were the main components across the different environmental compartments. The total concentrations of detected PPCPs ranged from 0.2 to 2437.9 ng/L. Higher concentrations of PPCPs were observed in spring and autumn, which were mainly attributed to seasonal differences in PPCP consumption. Generally, pollution level was higher in industry and agriculture area and in the inner bay and southwest of Taihu Lake. Source apportionment indicated that untreated water was the main source of PPCPs in river waters of the northern TLB. Flux estimation showed that the mean annual flux of PPCPs from northern TLB to Taihu Lake in 2021 was 1.6 t/a, which was higher in comparison with other areas. Overall, the resulting data will be useful to enrich the research of PPCPs in freshwater for environmental investigations.

Our research was based on data of long-term measurements of dissolved oxygen (2007-2020), water temperature, under-ice solar radiation, and snow-ice thickness (1995-2020) in Lake Vendyurskoe (Northwestern Russia). Changes of air temperature and precipitation in the study region during 1994-2020 and ice phenology of Lake Vendyurskoe for the same period based on field data and FLake model calculations were analyzed. The interannual variability of ice-on and ice-off dates covered wide time intervals (5 and 3 weeks, respectively), but no significant trends were revealed. In years with early ice-on, oxygen content decreased by more than 50% by the end of winter. In years with late ice-on and intermediate ice-off, the oxygen decrease was less than 40%. A significant negative trend was revealed for snow-ice cover thickness in spring. A climatic decrease of snow-ice cover thickness contributes to the rise of under-ice irradiance and earlier onset of under-ice convection. In years with early and long convection, an increase in oxygen content by 10-15% was observed at the end of the ice-covered period, presumably due to photosynthesis of phytoplankton.

J	Vilkov, EV				Vilkov, E. V.			Changes in the strategy of migration of gulls (Laridae) along the western coast of the Caspian Sea as a result of environmental changes in space and time	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												This paper generalizes the data obtained in 1995-2014 in the regions of the Sulak and Turali lagoons of Dagestan (the western coast of the Middle Caspian). The lagoons are located in a "bottleneck" that is a narrow migration corridor traversed by one of the largest migration routes of trans-palearctic species in Russia. This route is a part of the West Siberian-East African migration range. The migration traffic and territorial localization of the Laridae populations participating in the total migratory flow along the western coast of the Caspian Sea have been determined. The present-day migratory range of Laridae that covers the space from West Europe to the Baikal Lake and West India is specified. It is determined that Dagestan is crossed not by one but two independent and stable migration flows of Laridae, which fly across the transit region in different migration routes, but at the same periods of time. Three types of migration intensity of Laridae across the study area are defined: weak, average, and mass migration. Both spring and autumn migrations include five peaks of migration activity (migratory waves). Migratory timing, taxonomical composition, and abundance of different Laridae species vary for each degree type of migratory waves. The key determinants of migratory wave intensities are the abundance of migratory populations and weather conditions of a year. Over the last 5-7 years there has been a steady decrease in the abundance of some Laridae species on the western coast of the Middle Caspian that takes place under the impact of a set of regulating factors, which act across the whole migration range. The decrease in the abundance of migratory Laridae leads to a "blurring" of clear boundaries between migratory waves and migration intensity, changing migration routes of some Laridae populations, which now have shifted from traditional wintering routes along the western coast of the Caspian Sea and countries of the Middle East and northeastern Africa to India.																			1995-4255	1995-4263				MAY	2016	9	3					233	253		10.1134/S199542551603015X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S199542551603015X													WOS:000378901100001
J	Roebber, PJ; Gehring, MG				Roebber, PJ; Gehring, MG			Real-time prediction of the lake breeze on the western shore of Lake Michigan	WEATHER AND FORECASTING												A forecast verification study of the occurrence and inland penetration of the lake breeze on the western shore of Lake Michigan was conducted. A real-time version of The Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research fifth-generation Mesoscale Model (MM5) with 5-km grid spacing was evaluated for a set of 71 (68) dates at 12-24-h (36-48-h) forecast range from summer 1998 and spring 1999. Contingency measures showed skill in predicting lake-breeze development at both day 1 and day 2 [Kuipers skill score (KSS) of 0.80 and 0.74. respectively]. These skill levels exceeded capabilities demonstrated by a simple lake-breeze index computed for the identical set of cases and also surpassed the published performance of the operational 29-km Eta Model for another site. Skill in the prediction of the inland penetration of the lake breeze (relative to a baseline defined by the sample average distance of the lake-breeze front from the shoreline) peaked at 2100 UTC at both day 1 and day 2 (KSS of 0.28 and 0.22, respectively) but fell thereafter due to a westward forecast bias. The origins of this bias are tied in part to errors in the static model specification of the lake surface temperature, resulting from both errors in initialization and the observed diurnal cycle. Skill is also constrained by the sensitivity of the lake breeze to the prevailing synoptic flow; modest errors in forecasts of coast-normal winds can lead to substantial errors in the forecast position of the lake-breeze front by 0000 UTC, it is suggested that future research should focus on coupling a meteorological model to a dynamic lake model, improved initialization of lake water temperatures, and further refinements of the planetary boundary layer physics to improve near-surface winds. Such a model may be needed to allow reliable extension of forecasts out to timescales beyond 48 h.																			0882-8156					JUN	2000	15	3					298	312		10.1175/1520-0434(2000)015<0298:RTPOTL>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0434(2000)015<0298:RTPOTL>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000087543800003

Out of sight, but not out of season: Nitrifier distributions and population dynamics in a large oligotrophic lake	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Nitrification is an important control on the form and distribution of nitrogen in freshwater ecosystems. However, the seasonality of nitrogen pools and the diversity of organisms catalyzing this process have not been well documented in oligotrophic lakes. Here, we show that nitrogen pools and nitrifying organisms in Flathead Lake are temporally and vertically dynamic, with nitrifiers displaying specific preferences depending on the season. While the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) Nitrosomonadaceae and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) Nitrotoga dominate at depth in the summer, the ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) Nitrososphaerota and NOB Nitrospirota become abundant in the winter. Given clear seasonality in ammonium, with higher concentrations during the summer, we hypothesize that the succession between these two nitrifying groups may be due to nitrogen affinity, with AOB more competitive when ammonia concentrations are higher and AOA when they are lower. Nitrifiers in Flathead Lake share more than 99% average nucleotide identity with those reported in other North American lakes but are distinct from those in Europe and Asia, indicating a role for geographic isolation as a factor controlling speciation among nitrifiers. Our study shows there are seasonal shifts in nitrogen pools and nitrifying populations, highlighting the dynamic spatial and temporal nature of nitrogen cycling in freshwater ecosystems. Nitrogen pools and nitrifying organisms in a large oligotrophic lake were temporally and vertically dynamic, with nitrifiers displaying specific preferences depending on the season. Geographic isolation, substrate concentrations, and seasonal changes may influence the abundances, diversity, and evolution of nitrifier populations in lakes. image																			1462-2912	1462-2920				MAR	2024	26	3							e16616	10.1111/1462-2920.16616	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.16616								38517638					WOS:001189026500001
J	STAUFFER, RE				STAUFFER, RE			ALKALINITIES OF MAINE LAKES - ARE THEY REALLY CHANGING	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Alkalinity changes between 1938-1944 and 1985 were evaluated for Maine lakes (Z(max) greater-than-or-equal-to 15m) in granitic watersheds. Modern (late summer 1985) Gran alkalinities for the hypolimion were compared with historical alkalinities computed using: log10[HCO3-] = pH'(T) - pK'1(T) + log[H2CO3*] where pH(T) is the historic reported colorimetric pH at each hypolimnetic sampling depth and temperature, pK'1(T) the temperature-dependent negative logarithm of the first dissociation constant for carbonic acid, and H2CO3* represents initial CO2 at last spring overturn, plus the change in CO2 associated with the hypolimnetic oxygen deficit developed over summer (estimated from the historic oxygen data). With modern data for representative Maine lakes and historical (1932) data on dissolved gases reported for northern Wisconsin lakes, the apparent respiratory quotient relating-DELTA-CO2 to-DELTA-O2 = 0.92. The above model yields alkalinity estimates with a relative root-mean-square (RMS) error of approximately 15%. The alkalinities of the Maine lakes have increased by 15-50-mu-eq liter-1 ( > 30%) since the original surveys. Lake alkalization is not the result of differences in antecedent weather, since abnormally dry weather predating 1942 would have acted to elevate alkalinities.																			0024-3590					SEP	1990	35	6					1238	1257		10.4319/lo.1990.35.6.1238	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1990.35.6.1238													WOS:A1990EP94300003

It is found world-wide but most spectacularly in Ikka Fjord in southwest Greenland as submarine carbonate tufa columns. Here, ikaite is formed as a result of submarine spring water mixing with cold seawater. As ikaite disintegrates at temperatures above 6-7 degrees C, it has been speculated that global warming could endanger this unique habitat as well as other sites. In Ikka Fjord in situ water chemistry in and around an ikaite column measured continuously over two years showed that the column water is alkaline (pH > 9-10) throughout the year with temperatures of -1.3-6.0 degrees C and conductivities of 5.7-7.9 mS cm(-1), favoring year-round growth of columns at 4-5 cm per month. Short-term in situ measurements with needle micro sensors from both older dehydrated and calcified parts and more recently formed solid parts of an ikaite tufa column showed similar pH and temperature values, including a temperature variation over the tidal cycle. In the uppermost, recently deposited ikaite matrix, spring water escaping at the top causes passive drag of seawater into the porous ikaite matrix, leading to a mixing layer several centimeters thick that has pH values intermediate to the spring water in the column and the surrounding seawater. We conclude that the main part of the columns, consisting of fossilized ikaite (inverted to calcite) partly sealed by calcifying coralline algae and with year-round flow of alkaline freshwater through distinct channels, are resistant to warming. In the more diffuse top part of the columns, the formation of ikaite, and thus column growth, will be limited in the future due to increased fjord water temperature during the < 3 summer months a year.

The occurrence of hypoxic conditions may, however, be buffered by strong wind episodes, which favor water mixing and reoxygenation. The present study aims at explicitly linking the wind action and water oxygenation within dense hydrophytes stands in shallow lakes. For this purpose, seasonal 24 h-cycle campaigns were carried out for dissolved gases and inorganic compounds measurements in vegetated stands of an oligo-mesotrophic shallow lake. Further, seasonal campaigns were carried out in a eutrophic shallow lake, at wind-sheltered and -exposed sites. Overall results showed that dissolved oxygen (DO) daily and seasonal patterns were greatly affected by the degree of wind exposure. The occurrence of frequent wind episodes favored the near-bottom water mixing, and likely facilitated mechanical oxygen supply from the atmosphere or from the pelagic zone, even during the maximum standing crop of plants (i.e., summer and autumn). A simple model linking wind exposure (Keddy Index) and water oxygenation allowed us to produce an output management map, which geographically identified wind-sheltered sites as the most subjected to critical periods of hypoxia.					; Ribaudo, Cristina/LVS-4250-2024	Tison-Rosebery, Juliette/0000-0003-1090-7020; RIBAUDO, CRISTINA/0000-0001-8992-221X													2223-7747					JUL	2021	10	7							1269	10.3390/plants10071269	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants10071269								34206402					WOS:000677120600001

Investigation of the seasonal and local time variations of the high-altitude sporadic Na layer (Nas) formation and the associated midlatitude descending E layer (Es) in lower E region	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS												Recent studies have suggested that the major reservoir for the sporadic sodium layer (Na-s) above 95 km in altitude is likely the sodium ion (Na+) within the sporadic E layer (E-s) in the lower E region. However, theoretical and laboratory works have demonstrated that the metal ion's neutralization process is quite difficult above 100 km, while intensive neutral metal layers are consistently observed in the lower E region between 100 km and 125 km. In this paper, the multiyear observations of a Na lidar and an ionosonde at Utah State University (41.7 degrees N, 111.8 degrees W) and the nearby Bear Lake Observatory (41.9 degrees N, 111.4 degrees W) are utilized to understand their seasonal and local time variations. The comparison study between this set of the Na-s and the nocturnal Na-s observations in Beijing China (40.2 degrees N, 116.1 degrees E) reveals similar variations, but major differences are also noticed. To investigate the mechanism of these variations, the Hamburg Model of the Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere and the Climatological Tidal Model of the Thermosphere are utilized to simulate the ion vertical drift in the lower E region. The simulation shows that the lower E region is dominated by convergence of metal ions in summer, and ion diffusion prevails during winter. The tidal wind modulates the ion vertical drift speed and increases the likelihood of E-s evolution at certain local times during the summer, while the tidal components of atmospheric density facilitate Na-s formation by neutralizing the Na+ within the E-s.

Paleoclimate records from this region are crucial to further constrain the response of the water cycle to a globally warmer climate. Of these, the Dead Sea lacustrine record, collected by the Dead Sea Deep Drilling Project (DSDDP), provides a detailed history of climate change over the past 200,000 years and documents large-magnitude changes in regional water balance. Here, we analyze leaf wax isotopes (delta D-wax, delta C-13(wax)) on DSDDP 5017-1 and compare results to other proxies analyzed on the same core. The delta D-wax record closely resembles the speleothem delta O-18 record from nearby Soreq Cave, suggesting that both record a regionally coherent signature of glacial-interglacial cycles and the interplay between winter season rainfall and large-scale expansion and contraction of the Afro-Asian monsoon system. Principal components analysis of the pollen and core lithology shows that the first-order driver of variability in the Dead Sea paleoclimate record is global temperature, which controls effective moisture by modulating atmospheric evaporative demand. Leaf wax, pollen, and core lithology all suggest radical changes in the annual cycle of precipitation during the peak of the Last Interglacial. We hypothesize that the Dead Sea Basin experienced a dual-rainfall regime during this time, with intensified winter storms and a summer monsoon season. While these changes were driven by the Earth's precessional cycle, model simulations suggest a similar expansion of the African monsoon domain into the Arabian Peninsula under elevated CO2 levels. The Last Interglacial climate of the DSB provides a glimpse of what future climate in the southeastern Mediterranean region could look like. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, there is still a limited understanding of CO2 absorption/emission in eutrophic urbanizing lakes. This study therefore involved biweekly in-situ monitoring to evaluate fluctuations in the partial pressure (pCO(2)) and flux (fCO(2)) of CO2 and associated parameters from January to September 2020 (7:00-17:00 CST) in an urbanizing lake in southwestern China. Our study revealed that during the daylight hours of the 11 sampling days, both pCO(2) and fCO(2) consistently demonstrated decreasing trends from the early morning period to the late afternoon period, with notable increases on May 7th and August 15th, respectively. Interestingly, unlike our previous findings, an nonsignificant difference (p > 0.05) in mean pCO(2) and fCO(2) was observed between the morning period and the afternoon period (n = 22). Furthermore, the mean pCO(2) in January (similar to 105 mu atm; n = 4) and April (133-212 mu atm; n = 8) was below the typical atmospheric CO2 level (C-sink), while that in the other months surpassed 410 mu atm (C-source), although the average values (n = 44) of pCO(2) and fCO(2) were 960 +/- 841 mu atm and 57 +/- 85 mmol m(-2) h(-1), respectively. Moreover, the pCO(2) concentration was significantly greater in summer (May to August, locally reaching 1087 mu atm) than in spring (January to April at 112 mu atm), indicating a seasonal shift between the C-sink (spring) and the C-source (summer). In addition, a significant positive correlation in pCO(2)/fCO(2) with chlorophyll-a/nitrate but a negative correlation in dissolved oxygen and total phosphorus were recorded, suggesting that photosynthesis and respiration were identified as the main drivers of CO2 absorption/emissions, while changes in nitrate and phosphorus may be attributed to urbanization. Overall, our investigations indicated that this lightly eutrophic lake demonstrated a distinct shifting pattern of CO2 source-sink variability at daily and seasonal scales.

J	Reed, HS				Reed, HS			Effects of zinc deficiency on cells of vegetative buds	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The meristematic regions of apricot and peach trees show the effects of zinc deficiency by alterations in the cytoplasm and nuclei, as well as by the character of vacuolar inclusions. Phenolic compounds are formed in cells undergoing differentiation, the largest amts. being found in buds of trees showing characteristic Little-leaf symptoms. Phloroglucinol was abundant during the period of rapid spring growth; subsequently tannic compounds were more abundant, reaching a maximum at the end of the growing season. The accumulation of the latter was associated with conspicuous enlargement of the cells and an inhibition of their multiplication. In the affected buds there is neither gum-formation nor necrosis of cells. The hypoplastic condition of the meristematic cells is clearly evident in late winter before the buds emerge from the resting stage. Cells in affected buds have greater affinities for dyes, becoming prematurely vacuolate, and eventually polarized by an agglutination of protoplasmic material at one end of the cell. Nuclei have the appearance of having been "laked.".																			0002-9122	1537-2197				JAN	1941	28	1					10	17		10.2307/2437056	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2437056													WOS:000200470000002

Identifying carry-over effects of wintering area on reproductive parameters in White-winged Scoters: An isotopic approach	CONDOR												Events during one stage of the annual life cycle of migratory birds can have lasting (i.e. carry-over) effects that influence demographic parameters in subsequent seasons. We studied migratory connectivity and potential carry-over effects in a declining population of sea ducks. We measured stable isotope values of carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) in head feathers to assign breeding White-winged Scoters (Melanitta fusca; hereafter scoters) to either Atlantic or Pacific winter populations. The discriminant function for delta C-13 and delta N-15 correctly classified 93% of scoters sampled from these 2 winter areas. We then applied this classification scheme to head feathers of females breeding at Redberry Lake, Saskatchewan, and Cardinal Lake, Northwest Territories, to stratify each breeding population by winter provenance. We evaluated carry-over effects associated with winter location of females breeding in Saskatchewan by testing for differences in (1) nesting phenology, (2) clutch size, (3) mid-incubation body mass, (4) nest success, and (5) concentrations of trace elements contaminants of cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), and lead (Pb) in blood, between strata of putative winter origin. Breeding females from the Atlantic coast had later dates of nest initiation, greater mid-incubation body mass, and also had higher concentrations of Cd (one year only), Pb, and Se, relative to birds from the Pacific. Neither nest initiation date nor mid-incubation body mass, however, were related to contaminant concentrations in blood. We found no differences in clutch size or nest success between putative winter strata. Our study detected carry-over effects in the Saskatchewan population that merit further attention.

First data were processed separately using video/image processing and radar signal processing techniques and features of the targets are obtained by each sensor. Data fusion of radar and IR then is implemented to achieve feature vectors of the target. IR camera provides the coordinate information of the targets as well as some features such as flight's straightness index, direction, and target's heat, while the radar provides altitude information (z-coordinates) which is not provided by IR. So the data fusion of the IR and radar provide more detail and reliable information possible of the avian targets and their activity. Data was collected near Lake Erie in Ohio during 2011 spring and fall migration periods. Data analysis was performed in accordance to needs of wildlife biologists.

Attempts were also made to measure the mineralization response when the microbiota were subjected to near neutral pH conditions. Comparisons made on the basis of Vmax values revealed that the heterotrophic potential varied according to season, being lowest during the winter and highest during the summer. Also, an unexpected decrease in heterotrophic potential was realized for all samplings at an experimental, circumneutral pH. These results, in combination with observed, higher bacterial cell counts at the experimental pH, indicate that a fraction of the heterotrophic population is incapable of glucose mineralization at the higher pH, and are evidence of the existence of acidophilic bacteria in acid-stressed aquatic environments. Pre-incubation studies showed that the differences in heterotrophic potentials persisted for up to 15 days, the longest pre-incubation period examined.																			0043-1354	1879-2448					1986	20	12					1583	1587		10.1016/0043-1354(86)90124-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0043-1354(86)90124-7													WOS:A1986F518000017

Springs (n = 79), streamflows (n = 48), wetlands (n = 3), endorheic lakes (n = 3), hand-dug wells (n = 48) and boreholes in unconfined aquifers (n = 25) were monitored (2015-2017). Spring discharge fluctuates between wet (2.75 +/- 1.5 L/s) and dry seasons (0.87 +/- 0.21 L/s) (n = 68, p < .0001). Spring discharge and streamflow were larger at the foot of the escarpment than at the horst (p < .001). The water level of wells varied between horsts and escarpments in the grabens (p < .02). A water level depletion of up to 2.23 m/year occurred in response to withdrawals in the irrigated plains. Importantly, water level fluctuation was faster in streams, springs and hand-dug wells than in boreholes. Striking water level variations in the grabens were linked to rainfall deficit and management scarcity. An integration of surface water and groundwater management responses will bring the water table nearer to the surface; this could mitigate water storage in the fertile and productive grabens.

The annual average export of TOC ranged between 36 and 76 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and correlated positively with the areal extent of wetlands (r(2) = 0.72; p = 0.03). The daily output of TOC was 5-11 times higher during the spring than during any other season. In total, the four week long spring period contributed between 50% and 68% of the annual TOC export from the seven catchments. The relative importance of the spring snow melt period for the annual TOC export, however, correlated negatively with the percentage of wetlands (r(2) = 0.83; p<0.01). We suggest that the smaller relative importance of the spring runoff period for the annual TOC export from wetland dominated catchments is a result of the hydrological flow paths associated with the snow melt period. While a large fraction of the spring runoff from forested areas reaches the stream via subsurface flow paths across riparian soils rich in TOC, the flow paths through wetland dominated systems include a much larger component of low-TOC snow melt water via surface flow over ice and frozen peat.					; Kohler, Stephan/H-4267-2011; Laudon, Hjalmar/J-3074-2013; Köhler, Stephan/H-4267-2011	Buffam, Ishi/0000-0002-2625-6640; Kohler, Stephan/0000-0001-9707-9023; Laudon, Hjalmar/0000-0001-6058-1466; 													1015-1621					JUN	2004	66	2					223	230		10.1007/s00027-004-0700-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-004-0700-2													WOS:000221932000008
J	HOOPER, FF; MORRIS, LS				HOOPER, FF; MORRIS, LS			MAT WATER PHOSPHORUS EXCHANGE IN AN ACID BOG LAKE	ECOLOGY												The exchange of P between a bog lake and its surrounding Sphagnum mat and the fate of mat P entering the limnetic zone of a lake were studied by means of a series of mat-labeling experiments using 32P and by an analysis of water budgets of the lake and mat. A 32P solution applied directly to the Sphagnum, to simulate P input from rain fall, produced a labeled soluble but biologically refractory P fraction which persisted in the lake at the initial concentration level for > 16 days. Labeling the interstitial water of the mat directly with 32P produced a labeled particulate fraction which was biologically active and was quickly concentrated in the limnetic food web. Heavy rainfall flushed both labeled components into the lake. The pathway P takes to enter the lake from the mat was determined by temperature gradients in the mat and the degree of decomposition of the mat material. In early spring, with low water temperatures, P moves along isotherms from the mat directly to the hypolimnion and bypass the thermocline. In late spring, movement is to the epilimnion and thermocline. The maximum P concentrations in the mat were above a compacted zone at the 2-m depth. This maximum coincided with an open-water P maximum at 2 m, which indicated that there were frequent inputs of mat P to this stratum. The direction of net P movement was largely controlled by the water balance of the system. During periods of high precipitation, low temperatures and low evapotranspiration, as occurred in early spring, net P movement was toward the lake. During midsummer, high evapotranspiration of the mat vegetation increased the storage capacity of the mat. This reduced P flow toward the lake so that net flow was often toward the mat.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1982	63	5					1411	1421		10.2307/1938868	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1938868													WOS:A1982PJ82200025

In freshwater lentic environments, alien fish introduction heavily shapes macrobenthic invertebrate structure, with special regard for Chironomidae (Diptera) community. These effects could be more evident in alpine lakes whose environments are considered as remote and undisturbed, but extremely susceptible and vulnerable to both natural and anthropogenic impacts. In this context, modern and subfossil chironomid assemblages were studied in a high-altitude lake (Balma Lake, Piedmont, Italy) which was not previously investigated and subject to brook trout introduction for recreational fishing at the end of the twentieth century (after 1970). Seasonal samplings (summer, autumn) were performed in five littoral and three deep sites, while a core sample was extracted from the deepest point of the lake. The analysis highlighted significant differences in subfossil chironomid communities before and after fish introduction and between subfossil and modern communities, with notable decrease in recent diversities. Dissimilarities were mainly related to Corynocera oliveri, Zavrelimyia, Micropsectra, Metriocnemus, and Heterotrissocladius marcidus type. Therefore, this study highlights the importance and effects of anthropic environmental events, such as fish introduction, in climate reconstructions and their interpretation, especially regarding the last 100/200-year period, when human environmental issues have become more significant.					; Pastorino, Paolo/T-5288-2019	PIZZUL, ELISABETTA/0000-0001-9916-5005; Pastorino, Paolo/0000-0002-0585-1168; Bertoli, Marco/0000-0001-8345-6107; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2020	847	11					2393	2415		10.1007/s10750-020-04257-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04257-3		APR 2020											WOS:000528124600002

This study investigates the spatial and temporal characteristics of dust phenomena in the Urmia Basin using MERRA-2 data and observational data from Tabriz, Urmia, Sarab, and Mahabad over a 30-year period (1990-2019). The findings reveal that despite several fluctuations, the annual number of dusty days increased from the 1990s to the 2010s in the Urmia Basin. The maximum number of dusty days was found to predominantly occur in May (spring) and October (autumn), driven by two distinct mechanisms. In early autumn, developing synoptic systems associated with increased wind speeds can cause dust emission from dry land sources. Consequently, an increase in dust wet deposition, precipitation, dust surface concentration, and the number of dusty days occurs in October. In contrast, a sharp decrease in precipitation from April to May leads to drying soil and dust emission in May. Among the studied cities, Tabriz experienced the highest number of dusty days (728) due to the combined effects of cross-border and local dust sources. The highest dust column density and dust dry deposition in the south and east of Urmia Lake indicate the impact of declining water levels, which resulted in a dry lakebed as the primary local dust source. The MERRA-2 spatial distribution reveals that dust surface concentration, and the number of dusty days decrease similarly from the southwest to the northeast of the Urmia Basin as the distance from cross-border dust sources increases. A positive correlation is observed between the number of dusty days and MEERA-2 data, including dust surface concentration, dust dry deposition, column mass dust, and total aerosol extinction, with coefficients of 0.74, 0.71, 0.69, and 0.68, respectively.

Monitoring the concentration of algae and the occurrence of scum in lakes and lagoons has become a topic of interest for management and science. Optical remote sensing is a validated tool but unfortunately it is highly hindered by clouds. For regions with frequent cloud cover, such as the Baltic region, this means loss of data, which limits the purpose of sensing to spatially and temporally characterize any scum for a comprehensive ecological analysis. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images can compensate for the weaknesses of optical images for cyanobacteria bloom monitoring purposes in the event of cloudy skies. A "ready to use" approach to detect cyanobacteria bloom in the Curonian Lagoon based on the level 2 ocean product of Sentinel-1 images is proposed. This method is empirically validated for the images of summer/autumn 2018 of the Curonian Lagoon.					de santi, francesca/B-5013-2018; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013; Giardino, Claudia/O-9923-2015; pasquariello, guido/G-9191-2011; De+Carolis, Giacomo/AAW-8826-2020	Vaiciute, Diana/0000-0003-4479-5688; Lovergine, Francesco Paolo/0000-0002-8084-2122; Bresciani, Mariano/0000-0002-7185-8464; De Carolis, Giacomo/0000-0002-0523-9446; Giardino, Claudia/0000-0002-3937-4988; De Santi, Francesca/0000-0003-4823-9347; pasquariello, guido/0000-0001-8622-2058														2077-1312				DEC	2019	7	12							461	10.3390/jmse7120461	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jmse7120461													WOS:000506654700041

Short-term variations in abundances and potential activities of viruses, bacteria and nanoprotists in Lake Bourget	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Samples were collected at four depths every 6 h over a 42-h period during two contrasting seasons (June vs. December) from Lake Bourget, France, for evidence of circadian fluctuations in the concentrations and potential activities of viruses, prokaryotes and protists in relation to environmental conditions: temperature, chlorophyll a and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. Considerable vertical and temporal fluctuations were observed for all variables. Circadian variations were noted for DOC and chlorophyll a concentrations. Despite the external abiotic forcing (light, water movements), the fluctuations of microbial variables (including viruses) in most cases were apparently linked to biotic factors and interactions. Standing stocks and activities, as well as the number and levels of correlations among the microbial components, were, surprisingly, higher in winter than in summer. We speculate that this was because trophic interactions prevailed over the seasonal forcing (i.e. temperature) in shaping the observed differences.

J	GAEDKE, U				GAEDKE, U			THE SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF PLANKTON BIOMASS IN A LARGE LAKE AND ITS SEASONAL VARIABILITY	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Biomass size spectra were calculated from comprehensive microscopic assessment of plankton organisms in large, deep Lake Constance (Bodensee). They revealed an approximately constant size distribution of biomass from bacteria (10(-14) g C cell-1) to crustaceans (10(-4) g C ind.-1), resembling distributions found in open marine systems (seasonal average). Size ranges without detectable biomass as reported from other lakes did not exist. External perturbations, and size and depth of the pelagic zone, but not the type of habitat (marine vs. limnetic) were suggested as crucial factors influencing the shape of the biomass size distribution. The fit of the normalized biomass size spectrum to a straight line with a slope of -1.00 was very close (r2 = 0.98), indicating a decrease of abundance per size class N proportional to the increase of body weight w (N is-proportional-to w-1). Seasonal variation of biomass per size class was strongly related to body weight. It was largest for organisms with generation times of about 1 yr. Slopes of normalized biomass size spectra were steep in early spring (-1.16) indicating a dominance of small organisms and a low transfer efficiency to larger organisms. From spring to early summer, the size distribution of organisms shifted toward larger organisms (slope up to -0.94). The seasonal changes of the size spectra support the idea that, due to differences in the intrinsic reaction times of differently sized organisms, varying environmental conditions produce less regularly shaped actual size spectra, if not averaged over a period longer than the external fluctuations.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	1992	37	6					1202	1220		10.4319/lo.1992.37.6.1202	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1992.37.6.1202													WOS:A1992KR91400006

However, the effects of the contents of Fe(II) and sediment organic carbon (SOC) on the NRFO process still remain unclear. In this study, the influences of Fe(II) and organic carbon on nitrate reduction were analyzed quantitatively at two typical seasonal temperatures (25 degrees C representing summers and 5 degrees C for winters) by conducting a series of batch incubation experiments, using surficial sediments at the western zone of Lake Taihu (Eastern China). Results showed that Fe(II) greatly promoted NO3--N reduction by denitrification (DNF) and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) processes at high-temperature (25 degrees C, representing sum-mer season). As Fe (II) increased (e.g., Fe(II)/NO3- = 4), the promotion effect on NO3--N reduction was weakened, but on the other side, the DNRA process was enhanced. In comparison, the NO3--N reduction rate obviously decreased at low-temperature (5 degrees C, representing the winter season). NRFO in sediments mainly be-longs to biological rather than abiotic processes. A relatively high SOC content apparently increased the rate of NO3--N reduction (r = 0.023-0.053 mM/d), particularly on the heterotrophic NRFO. It is interesting that the Fe (II) consistently remained active in the nitrate reduction processes no matter whether SOC was sufficient in the sediment, particularly at high-temperature. Overall, the combining effects of both Fe(II) and SOC in surficial sediments made a great contribution towards NO3--N reduction and N removal in a lake system. These results provide a better understanding and estimation of N transformation in sediments of the aquatic ecosystem under different environmental conditions.

The Total Phosphorus with Point and Non-Point Inflows to Great Lakes-A Critical Review and GLWQA Targets	WORLD ENVIRONMENTAL AND WATER RESOURCES CONGRESS 2017: WATERSHED MANAGEMENT, IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE, AND WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT					17th Annual World Environmental and Water Resources Congress	MAY 21-25, 2017	Sacramento, CA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Environm & Water Resources Inst				The occurrence of algae blooms in the US waterbodies has become an annually recurring phenomenon. Lake Erie of the Great Lakes (North America) has been experiencing significant and harmful algae-blooms (HABs) during the mid-July to mid-September for more than ten (10) years now. The watersheds in the US are significantly affected by algae-bloom formations during the summer months, and, this has been a vicious cycle that the point and non-point wastewater effluents contribute nutrients to waterbodies, specifically during the Spring time, and the need to draw those intake waters to effectively treat those complex algal-blooms forming during the summer time in maintaining the uninterrupted supply of the potable water to cities and towns. Good reductions of total phosphorus (TP) loadings to Great Lakes, specifically to the Lake Erie, were accomplished compared to the 1970s; however, the non-point source TP loading to Lake Erie has been significant and varying year-to-year. More effective TP estimation methodology with respect to the phosphorus discharging sources will be required. Additional TP reductions are necessary toward a good water quality of Great Lakes. Interim open water TP concentrations and loadings are in effect since 2012, until updated. The Phosphorus Task Committee has recommended that March to July total Spring phosphorus loads should be reduced, and some of the basins of Lake Erie the nutrient load must be reduced as much as by 40%. The best management practices (BMPs) have been identified and recommended to be put into practice. In this work, authors focused on: Great Lakes' water-asset; nutrient TP loadings to Great Lakes and effects; the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA), on nutrient TP concentration and loading targets; TP including the dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) loading targets to the Lake Erie; a review on Lake Michigan; and, the binational (Ca and USA) action plans for TP reductions and, nutrient and excessive algae-bloom control requirements.

J	Verleyen, E; Hodgson, DA; Sabbe, K; Vanhoutte, K; Vyverman, W				Verleyen, E; Hodgson, DA; Sabbe, K; Vanhoutte, K; Vyverman, W			Coastal oceanographic conditions in the Prydz Bay region (East Antarctica) during the Holocene recorded in an isolation basin	HOLOCENE												Information on East Antarctic coastal environments during the Holocene is relatively sparse. This is surprising as sedimentary records from the interface between land and sea can provide chronologies of climatic change, isostatic uplift, relative sea level and the colonization of newly formed biomes. Here we examine a sediment core from Pup Lagoon, a coastal lake in the Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica. Sediment stratigraphy, fossil pigments and diatoms were used to infer the sequence of Holocene environmental and climatic change. Results show that between 5800 and 5500 cal. yr BP the marine coast of Prydz Bay was characterized by stratified, open-water conditions during spring and summer and seasonally warm conditions. From 5500 to 2750 cal. yr BP sea-ice duration in Prydz Bay increased with the coast being ice-free for 2-3 months each year, conditions which are similar to the present day. A return to stratified, open-water conditions and a reduction in winter sea-ice extent between 2750 and 2200 cal. yr BP is signalled by enhanced biogenic production and more open-water diatom taxa. This is consistent with evidence for the mid-Holocene Hypsithermal detected in other records in East Antarctica. Isostatic isolation of the Pup Lagoon basin from the sea between 2200 and 2000 cal. yr BP slightly precedes the emergence of lakes with comparable sill heights from the nearby Vestfold Hills. The colonization of Pup Lagoon after its isolation as a freshwater lake was initiated by a siliceous flora dominated by stomatocysts with microbial mat development being prevented by mechanical or physical stress. A brief period of marine incursion following the mid-Holocene Hypsithermal may be related to local events such as iceberg calving or to minor sea-level change. Weighted averaging regression, used to infer salinity in the lacustrine zone, shows that from 1500 cal. yr BP Pup Lagoon is a freshwater lake, where the flora is dominated by stratified cyanobacterial mats, with green algae and diatoms as co-dominants, comparable to modem Pup Lagoon and other lakes in the Larsemann Hills.																			0959-6836					MAR	2004	14	2					246	257		10.1191/0959683604hl702rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683604hl702rp													WOS:000221328100010

Inferring the source of evaporated waters using stable H and O isotopes	OECOLOGIA												Stable isotope ratios of H and O are widely used to identify the source of water, e.g., in aquifers, river runoff, soils, plant xylem, and plant-based beverages. In situations where the sampled water is partially evaporated, its isotope values will have evolved along an evaporation line (EL) in delta H-2/delta O-18 space, and back-correction along the EL to its intersection with a meteoric water line (MWL) has been used to estimate the source water's isotope ratios. Here, we review the theory underlying isotopic estimation of source water for evaporated samples (iSW(E)). We note potential for bias from a commonly used regression-based approach for EL slope estimation and suggest that a model-based approach may be preferable if assumptions of the regression approach are not valid. We then introduce a mathematical framework that eliminates the need to explicitly estimate the EL-MWL intersection, simplifying iSW(E) analysis and facilitating more rigorous uncertainty estimation. We apply this approach to data from the US EPA's 2007 National Lakes Assessment. We find that data for most lakes are consistent with a water source similar to annual runoff, estimated from monthly precipitation and evaporation within the lake basin. Strong evidence for both summer- and winter-biased sources exists, however, with winter bias pervasive in most snow-prone regions. The new analytical framework should improve the rigor of iSW(E) in ecohydrology and related sciences, and our initial results from US lakes suggest that previous interpretations of lakes as unbiased isotope integrators may only be valid in certain climate regimes.

Spatial distribution of pelagic fish larvae in the northern main basin of Lake Huron	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Larval fish occurrence in inshore and offshore zones in the northern main basin of Lake Huron was assessed during 2007 as part of a larger ecological examination of Lake Huron foodwebs and habitats. Day and night collections using neuston and conical nets at inshore (1.5-15m depths) and offshore (37 and 91m depths) locations at De Tour and Hammond Bay to assess the abundance, phenology, and spatial distribution of pelagic ichthyoplankton during spring and early summer were made. In general, densities of larval fishes were higher at De Tour than Hammond Bay during daytime neuston net collections, with the exception of Longnose Sucker, which were only collected at Hammond Bay. Lake Whitefish, Burbot, and Rainbow Smelt dominated inshore catches in early spring with Cisco, Deepwater Sculpin, Emerald Shiner, Bloater, Slimy Sculpin, Ninespine Stickleback, and Yellow Perch larvae also collected. Nighttime nearshore and offshore sampling revealed that Rainbow Smelt and Burbot larvae were present in relatively high abundances compared to inshore densities. Concentrations of larvae of deepwater demersal fishes such as Lake Whitefish and Deepwater Sculpin suggest that inshore zones in northern Lake Huron are important nursery habitats emphasizing a critical production and recruitment linkage between inshore and deepwater zones.

Its water column is divided into two parts: the mixolimnion, which is subjected to mixing during seasonal overturns; and the monimolimnion which remains unmixed. Using high precision and high frequency temperature and conductivity profiles along with continuous temperature measurements, this study reveals the presence of a sublacustrine, intermittent cold spring at the bottom of the mixolimnion at a depth between 50 and 55 m. This cold-water input rises in the water column by saline convection. The use of a simple conceptual model, representing turbulent diapycnal diffusivity and convection correlated with the presence of the spring within the water column indicates its role in maintaining the meromixis characteristic of the lake on the intra-annual time scale. The spring also influences seasonal overturns and thus contributes to establish the depth of the mixolimnion-monimolimnion interface on the inter-annual time scale. (C) 2011 Academie des sciences.

J	Shafer, JC; Steenburgh, WJ				Shafer, Jason C.; Steenburgh, W. James			Climatology of strong intermountain cold fronts	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Motivated by the intensity and severity of winds and temperature falls that frequently accompany rapidly developing cold fronts in northern Utah, this paper presents a 25-yr climatology of strong cold frontal passages over the Intermountain West and adjoining western United States. Using conventional surface observations and the North American Regional Reanalysis, strong cold frontal passages are identified based on a temperature fall of 7 degrees C or greater in a 2-3-h period, a concurrent pressure rise of 3 hPa or greater, and the presence of a large-scale 700-hPa temperature gradient of at least 6 degrees C (500 km)(-1). The number of strong cold frontal passages exhibits a strong continental signature with very few events (< 10) along the Pacific coast and more than 200 events east of the Continental Divide. The number of events increases dramatically from the Cascade Mountains and Sierra Nevada to northern Utah, indicating that the Intermountain West is a frequent cold front breeding ground. A composite of the 25 strongest events at Salt Lake City (based on the magnitude of the temperature fall) reveals that confluent deformation acting on a broad baroclinic zone over central Nevada commonly initiates Intermountain frontogenesis. The confluent deformation develops in southwesterly large-scale flow and appears to be enhanced by flow deflection around the Sierra Nevada. Quasi-stationary development and intensification of the southwest-northeast-oriented cold front then occurs as a mobile upper-level trough approaches from the west. The front becomes mobile as cold advection and ascent associated with the upper-level trough overtake the low-level front. Cloud and precipitation observations suggest that differential diabatic heating contributes to the rapid frontal intensification in many events.

These episodic events transfer heat and oxygen over large vertical scales and maintain the permanent temperature stratified deep-water status of the lake. Here we evaluate a series of intrusion events that reached the bottom of the lake in terms of the stratification and the wind conditions under which they occurred and provide a new insight into the triggering mechanisms. We make use of long-term temperature and current meter data (2000-2013) recorded in the South Basin of the lake combined with wind data produced with a regional downscaling of the global NCEP-RA1 reanalysis product. A total of 13 events were observed during which near-surface cold water reached the bottom of the South Basin at 1350 m depth. We found that the triggering mechanism of the events is related to the time of the year that they take place. We categorized the events in three groups: (1) winter events, observed shortly before the complete ice cover of the lake that are triggered by Ekman coastal downwelling, (2) under-ice events, and (3) spring events, that show no correlation to the wind conditions and are possibly connected to the increased spring outflow of the Selenga River.

The conductivity at 0.5 m depth in May and the mean air temperature during May or during May and June were used as independent variables. These equations were calculated using seven years of data (1983-1988 and 1992). From 1989 to 1991 two impermeable plastic-coated sheet fences were installed across the upper end of the reservoir along the top 5 m of water column. The equations were used to determine the effectiveness of this flow regulation on the summer Chl-a concentration. In 1989 and 1991, when the fences were in place from June to August, no effects were found on the observed C-S and C-M values. In 1990, when the fences had been in place since October 1989, the observed values were lower than the predicted values.																			0018-8158					AUG 11	1995	310	1					59	70		10.1007/BF00008183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008183													WOS:A1995TD86900006
J	Tarasov, VV				Tarasov, Vladimir V.			A Sharp Decrease in the Number of Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus (Aves: Pelecaniformes) in the Urals and Western Siberia in 2021	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-BIOLOGIYA												The Dalmatian pelican Pelecanus crispus (Bruch, 1832) is a globally rare species. Its extremely local ("point") placement during the nesting period on a few hard-to-reach water bodies distanced far from one another makes it a highly vul-nerable species. In the end of the 20th century, the number of the species in Chelya-binsk, Kurgan and Tyumen oblasts steadily grew. This was largely due to the redistri-bution of individuals from drying reservoirs of the more southern parts of the breeding range to the northern ones against the background of global climate warming. Thus, pelicans stopped nesting in the Svetlinsky Reserve (Orenburg oblast) due to the drought.In the spring and summer of 2021, the first mass deaths of these birds occurred in the history of study in the Urals and Western Siberia. During the observations of sev-en colonies in Chelyabinsk, Kurgan and Tyumen oblasts using the DJI Mavic-2 Zoom drone, we found that many individuals did not return to the breeding grounds in the spring after wintering, and another part died at the height of the breeding season. As a result, the number of pelicans decreased by 70-80% in some colonies; in others, the proportion of dead birds was less, and some separate colonies were almost not affect-ed at all. At the same time, in the western part of the study area (Chelyabinsk oblast), a significant part of the individuals died outside the breeding grounds, whereas in the eastern part, the birds died mainly in the breeding grounds and at a later time. In Kur-gan oblast, the death of birds was noted in May, in Tyumen oblast it was in June. The total number of pelicans in the study area decreased from 1.2-1.4 thousand pairs to about 600 pairs (see the table). Six colonies were preserved; most of them now num-ber 30-50 breeding pairs at best. However, in the study area, the largest colony (and the easternmost in the Okunevo Reserve (Tyumen oblast)) survived almost complete-ly with about 400 pairs of pelicans continuing to breed. No more than 30 individuals died there, and this happened later than in other colonies, in July 2021.The main version of the cause of birds' mass death is the epizootic of avian influ-enza which was tested in all samples (n = 5) taken from a colony in Tyumen oblast. Pelicans live in dense flocks all year round, and this could really contribute to the rap-id spread of the infection. The facts of the birds' death in various nesting sites located on a large territory, at a great distance from one another, make it seem that they con-tracted the virus in wintering areas. However, a number of questions remain unan-swered. In particular, it is unclear how the infected birds were able to travel thousands of kilometers to their breeding grounds, why individuals of only one particular species died, why only adults died, and why they died at different times. Maybe, the avian in -fluenza virus tested in the birds' bodies was low-pathogenic and was not the cause of their death, but it was due to some other factor, such as food poisoning. It might be that the immunity of the birds was weakened by the abnormal heat that came to the study area since mid-May 2021. If the birds died from a highly pathogenic virus, it is unclear why this did not happen immediately after infection (in the wintering areas), but in a long time, at least from May to July.Moreover, the infection with the virus did not prevent the birds from arriving at breeding sites, building nests, laying eggs and starting to incubate. However, influenza viruses are very diverse and continue to evolve rapidly changing their properties and increasing resistance to the environment. Our understanding of the ecological factors favoring emergence and sustainability of these viruses is still limited. More efforts should certainly be made to save such a globally rare species as the Dalmatian pelican. At the moment, a large breeding colony on the territory of Western Siberia (on Tundrovo Lake in the Okunevo Reserve (Tyumen oblast)) remains the main breeding ground of the species in this area. Therefore, the importance of preserving this breeding colony comes to the fore.

Cloudless aerosol forcing efficiency in the UV region from AERONET and WOUDC databases	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Center (WOUDC) combined information have been used to calculate the aerosol forcing efficiency under cloud-free conditions, Delta F(e), in the ultraviolet region ( 290 - 325 nm) at surface. The stations of these global networks have been collocated spatial and temporarily, resulting three common stations: two in Canada, representative of background conditions (Bratt's Lake and Saturna Island) and one in Italy, characterized by rural and industrial aerosols (Ispra).

The Delta F(e) values range from - 0.65 +/- 0.07 Wm(-2)/tau(500) to - 0.36 +/- 0.03 Wm(-2)/ tau(340) for Ispra, whereas for the Canadian observatories the interval varies from - 2.07 +/- 0.62 Wm(-2)/ tau(500) to - 0.16 +/- 0.23 Wm(-2)/ tau(340).

Pheromones attract conspecifics, which aid in overcoming tree defenses, and predators, which exploit these cues as kairomones. Sampling was conducted over 2 yr to characterize the assemblage of insects that arrive at and reproduce in trees colonized by I. pini, and how this assemblage is partitioned by host species, time after colonization, and seasonal phenology. Over 70 species from three orders were obtained. I. pini was most abundant, especially during late summer. The first natural enemy to arrive was Medetera bistriata Parent, which came simultaneously with L pini. Other Diptera such as Lonchaea corticis Taylor and Zabrachia polita Coquillett were also abundant. Roptrocerus xylophagorum (Ratzeburg), a late instar parasitoid, arrived last. Its emergence most closely coincided with L pini emergence, whereas the other species emerged substantially after I. pini. Host species did not affect total L pini emergence but strongly affected natural enemies. Most R. xylophagorum and Monochamus spp. emerged from white pine, and most Z. polita emerged from red pine. I. pini had the highest ratio of emergence to arrival per log. Only the predator T dubius and the parasitoid R. xylophagorum showed numerical responses to the number of emerging L pini. Exclusion of insects during the first 2 wk of colonization decreased reproduction of I. pini and other wood borers in the spring, but not summer.																			0013-8746					JAN	2004	97	1					117	129		10.1603/0013-8746(2004)097[0117:SAAAAE]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0013-8746(2004)097[0117:SAAAAE]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000189001600011

The most important characteristics of the experimentally changed food web are strong top-down control by high intensity of piscivory but weak nutrient limitation due to high external and internal P and N loadings. With the exception of a summer depression (June to August), high biomasses of D. galeata (up to 13 mg wet weight L(-1)) were observed. In summer and fall, large colonies of Microcystis spp. dominated the phytoplankton which was not a result of grazing by daphnids. The quota of non-edible size fractions in the total particulate PP was 76 +/- 24% (annual mean) and as much as 99 +/- 0.4% in September and October when the calculated filtration rate of D. galeata was very high. It was found to be impossible to control total PP by top-down pressure alone. But the edible fraction can be strongly controlled by grazing if a certain threshold of the filtration rate is exceeded. Before and during the summer depression of D. galeata, PP of edible phytoplankton reached relatively high values revealing that food limitation was not the reason for low biomass of the daphnids during this depression period. At low values of edible PP due to high grazing pressure exerted by Daphnia, exudation by mainly non-edible phytoplankton was much higher than edible PP indicating that a relatively important carbon flow via bacteria to Daphnia is possible.

In this study, we investigated the effects of drought-induced drawdown on the water quality of the Zhoucun Reservoir, Shandong Province, East China, during the fall overturn. Field surveys were conducted during stratification (April-November) over three standard years 2012, 2013, and 2014, and over the El Nino event of 2015. Temporal and vertical variations of the physical and chemical indexes were investigated during monitoring. Results show that after the formation of stratification, the hypolimnion rapidly shifted to anaerobic conditions, with the accumulation of pollutants such as manganese (Mn) and total phosphorous (TP). Due to the extreme El Nino event in 2015, both the upper and lower metalimnion limits moved down along with the water level in summer, which resulted in the transfer of hypolimnion water to the metalimnion. In summer 2015, large amounts of pollutants were measured in the metalimnion: a phenomenon that did not occur at the same period of the standard years. At the beginning of the overturn in 2015, the water quality of the whole reservoir deteriorated when the metalimnion water shifted to the epilimnion. Mn and TP concentrations in the epilimnion reached 0.202 mg/L and 0.086 mg/L, respectively, which are significantly higher than those in the standard years. Although the tributary rivers entered the epilimnion of the reservoir during the overturn, Mn and TP concentrations of the inflow were only of 0.049-0.072 mg/L and 0.033-0.047 mg/L, respectively, indicating that these rivers were not the source of the high TP and high Mn concentrations in the epilimnion. Hence, we conclude that more attention should be paid to the metalimnion position and the vertical distribution of pollutants when studying lakes and reservoirs experiencing droughts.

RESTORATION VERSUS INVASIVE SPECIES: BIGHEADED CARPS' USE OF A REHABILITATED BACKWATER	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Knowledge of how invasive species use invaded habitats can aid in developing management practices to exclude them. Swan Lake, a 1100-ha Illinois River (USA) backwater, was rehabilitated to restore ecosystem functions, but may provide valuable habitat for invasive bigheaded carps [bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) and silver carp (H.molitrix)]. Use (residency and passages) of Swan Lake by invasive bigheaded carps was monitored using acoustic telemetry (n=50 individuals/species) to evaluate the use of a large, restored habitat from 2004 to 2005. Passages (entrances/exits) by bigheaded carps were highest in winter, and residency was highest in the summer. Bighead carp backwater use was associated with the differences in temperature between the main channel and backwater, and passages primarily occurred between 18:00h and midnight. Silver carp backwater use was positively correlated with water level and main channel discharge, and fewer passages occurred between 12:00h and 18:00h than during any other time of day. Harvest occurring during summer or high main channel discharge could reduce backwater abundances while maintenance of low water levels could reduce overall backwater use. Conclusions from this study regarding the timing of bigheaded carps' use of backwater habitats are critical to integrated pest management plans to control invasive species.

It has been discovered that natural and anthropogenic aerosols have a great influence on meteorological variables such as temperature, snow water equivalent, and precipitation, which in turn impact the reservoir inflow. Therefore, it is imperative for us to quantify the impact of aerosols on reservoir inflow and to incorporate the aerosol models into future reservoir inflow forecasting models. In this paper, a comprehensive framework was developed to quantify the impact of aerosols on reservoir inflow by integrating the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and a dynamic regression model. The statistical dynamic regression model produces forecasts for reservoir inflow based on the meteorological output variables from the WRF-Chem model. The case study was performed on the Florence Lake and Lake Thomas Alva Edison of the Big Creek Hydroelectric Project in the San Joaquin Region. The simulation results show that the presence of aerosols results in a significant reduction of annual reservoir inflow by 4-14%. In the summer, aerosols reduce precipitation, snow water equivalent, and snowmelt that leads to a reduction in inflow by 11-26%. In the spring, aerosols increase temperature and snowmelt which leads to an increase in inflow by 0.6-2%. Aerosols significantly reduce the amount of inflow in the summer when the marginal value of water is extremely high and slightly increase the inflow in the spring when the run-off risk is high. In summary, the presence of aerosols is detrimental to the optimal utilization of hydroelectric power systems.					; Wu, Longtao/G-5509-2012	Yao, Weixin/0000-0001-5925-5081; Su, Hui/0000-0003-1265-9702; Yu, Nanpeng/0000-0001-5086-5465													0885-6087	1099-1085				OCT 30	2018	32	22					3365	3390		10.1002/hyp.13265	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13265								31073260					WOS:000446833100005

A historical record of benthic foraminifera in seasonally anoxic Lake Grevelingen, the Netherlands	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Lake Grevelingen is a former branch of the Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt estuary, which was artificially transformed into a salt-water lake by a dam in 1971. This transformation induced profound changes in the biological community of the basin, which have been described as an ecodisaster, with seasonal hypoxia/anoxia occurring in the deepest parts of the lake. Here, we investigate a sediment core sampled in 2012 in the Den Osse Basin (34 m depth) of Lake Grevelingen, recording the last -50 years and including the transition from an estuary to a salt-water lake. Sediment molybdenum (Mo) concentrations were used to refine an existing age model based on 210Pb, giving us an estimated precision of +/- 3 years. The benthic foraminiferal succession reflects the anthropogenic modifications in Lake Grevelingen and allows four successive stages to be distinguished: 1) before 1971, when the system was estuarine; 2) from 1971 to 1978, when the system rapidly changed into an enclosed brackish water lake; 3) from 1978 to 1999, when a seaward sluice was opened during winter and 4) the period from 1999 to 2012, with a year-round opening of the sluice and doubling of water exchanges with the North Sea. The foraminiferal record, showing communities mainly dominated by Elphidium selseyense, also highlights the appearance of the putatively exotic Ammonia confertitesta in the mid-1980s, which thereafter progressively replaced the congeneric autochthonous Ammonia aberdoveyensis. Finally, we hypothesise that the activity of cable bacteria, S-oxidising prokaryotes present in the surface sediments of Den Osse Basin in winter and spring, causes dissolution of foraminiferal tests by decreasing the pore water carbonate saturation state in the sediments directly below the oxic zone. This explains the contrast between the abundant living populations and the very low numbers of foraminiferal shells preserved in the top -15 cm of the sediment.

In karst areas, surface water that flows to a lake can drain through sinkholes in the lakebed to the underlying aquifer, and then flows in karst conduits and through aquifer matrix. At the study site located in northwest Florida, USA, Lake Miccosukee immediately drains into two sinkholes. Results from a dye tracing experiment indicate that lake water discharges at Natural Bridge Spring, a first-magnitude spring 32 km downgradient from the lake. By collecting weekly water samples from the lake, the spring, and a groundwater well 10 m away from the lake during the dry period between October 2019 and January 2020, it was found that, when rainfall effects on isotopic signature in spring water are removed, increased isotope ratios of spring water can be explained by mixing of heavy-isotope-enriched lake water into groundwater, indicating hydraulic connection between the lake and the spring. Such a detection of hydraulic connection at the scale of tens of kilometers and for a first-magnitude spring has not been previously reported in the literature. Based on the isotope ratio data, it was estimated that, during the study period, about 8.5% the spring discharge was the lake water that drained into the lake sinkholes.					; Ye, Ming/A-5964-2008	Ye, Ming/0000-0002-7080-0578; 													0017-467X	1745-6584				NOV	2021	59	6					856	865		10.1111/gwat.13105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gwat.13105		APR 2021						33871903					WOS:000645288400001
J	Park, SE; Jung, YT; Kim, HC				Park, Sang-Eun; Jung, Yoon Taek; Kim, Hyun-Cheol			Monitoring permafrost changes in central Yakutia using optical and polarimetric SAR data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The changes in the permafrost environment have been of interest as a sensitive indicator of changes in global climate conditions. Since changes in the soil and ecosystem of the permafrost active layer are spatially and temporally complex depending on many environmental factors, it is not easy to grasp climate-induced changes occurring in coupled atmospheric-ecological-geocryological systems. To understand the changes in the permafrost active layer, spatially detailed monitoring methods such as multi-spectral optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing technologies have been extensively applied to the permafrost observation. Optical and SAR systems observe different permafrost features due to significant differences in electromagnetic wave frequencies and imaging mechanisms. Therefore, most studies used optical and SAR data separately according to the purpose and characteristics of each study. The objective of this study is to explore the possibility of combined interpretation of optical and SAR data for identifying and understanding spatiotemporal details of the short- and long-term changes occurring in the permafrost active layer. Multi-spectral optical images acquired during the thawing period and L-band polarimetric SAR images acquired during the freezing period are used in this study in order to examine ecological characteristics and cryogenic processes, respectively. The result of analyzing the relationship between information obtained from optical and SAR sensors revealed that there was a significant correlation between winter changes in scattering properties observed in SAR data and summer land cover changes observed in optical data. The scattering characteristics of winter soil were found to be particularly related to the ecosystem changes in areas that can be explained by the thermokarst development process. Additional data from independent sources, such as elevation data, meteorological data, and long-term optical data, consistently supported the relationship between the winter SAR observations and the thermokarst-related ecosystem changes. The experimental results also elucidated that polarimetric scattering mechanism indicators representing the signal depolarization and surface roughness properties played an important role in deriving information related to the permafrost process from the winter SAR data.

Combining citizen science species distribution models and stable isotopes reveals migratory connectivity in the secretive Virginia rail	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Stable hydrogen isotope (delta D) methods for tracking animal movement are widely used yet often produce low resolution assignments. Incorporating prior knowledge of abundance, distribution or movement patterns can ameliorate this limitation, but data are lacking for most species. We demonstrate how observations reported by citizen scientists can be used to develop robust estimates of species distributions and to constrain dD assignments. 2. We developed a Bayesian framework to refine isotopic estimates of migrant animal origins conditional on species distribution models constructed from citizen scientist observations. To illustrate this approach, we analysed the migratory connectivity of the Virginia rail Rallus limicola, a secretive and declining migratory game bird in North America. 3. Citizen science observations enabled both estimation of sampling bias and construction of bias-corrected species distribution models. Conditioning dD assignments on these species distribution models yielded comparably high-resolution assignments. 4. Most Virginia rails wintering across five Gulf Coast sites spent the previous summer near the Great Lakes, although a considerable minority originated from the Chesapeake Bay watershed or Prairie Pothole region of North Dakota. Conversely, the majority of migrating Virginia rails from a site in the Great Lakes most likely spent the previous winter on the Gulf Coast between Texas and Louisiana. 5. Synthesis and applications. In this analysis, Virginia rail migratory connectivity does not fully correspond to the administrative flyways used to manage migratory birds. This example demonstrates that with the increasing availability of citizen science data to create species distribution models, our framework can produce high-resolution estimates of migratory connectivity for many animals, including cryptic species. Empirical evidence of links between seasonal habitats will help enable effective habitat management, hunting quotas and population monitoring and also highlight critical knowledge gaps.					; Sullivan, Alexis/AAL-9893-2020; King, Stephanie/C-8633-2016	Fournier, Auriel M.V./0000-0002-8530-9968; Perkins, Marie/0000-0002-2101-6234; 													0021-8901	1365-2664				APR	2017	54	2					618	627		10.1111/1365-2664.12723	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12723													WOS:000397930300029

Earlier research results (1960, 1981 and 1988) were applied to discuss the different trophic stages of the lake. The species composition in the lake was more closely related to eutrophication level than to lake-size, shallowness, or turbidity. Each summer, a single peak of phytoplankton biovolume appeared in Meiliang Bay. The results of principal components analysis showed a distinct temporal shift in species composition between summer and winter. A clear spatial difference in phytoplankton occurred between Meiliang Bay and the lake centre. Wind speed and direction affected the horizontal distribution of phytoplankton, especially Microcystis, in the lake. Temperature, underwater light climate, nutrients and grazing by zooplankton and by fish were discussed to explain the overwhelming dominance of Microcystis. Four nutrient-phytoplankton stages were identified in the lake: an oligo-mesotrophic stage with low algal biomass until 1981, a eutrophic situation with blooms of Microcystis during 1988-1995, hypertrophic conditions with the dominance of Planctonema and total phosphorus up to 200 mg m(-3) from 1996 to 1997 and the restoration period after 1997. The wax and wane of the phytoplankton assemblages were mainly controlled by temperature, wind and turbidity while long-term biomass dynamics were influenced by the level of nutrients.					; Teubner, Katrin/AAC-1224-2021; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013; Dokulil, Martin/J-3464-2019	Teubner, Katrin/0000-0002-3699-2043; Dokulil, Martin/0000-0002-6369-1457; 													0142-7873					APR	2003	25	4					445	453		10.1093/plankt/25.4.445	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/25.4.445													WOS:000182045700010

Young of 21 fish species were collected. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens), white bass (Morone chrysops), buffaloes (2 Ictiobus spp.) and centrarchids were significantly more abundant in net catches in 1975 than 1974. Flooded shoreline vegetation in 1975 apparently enhanced spawning success by providing a more suitable substrate and protective cover for early life stages. First-summer growth of the 4 most abundant fish (yellow perch, buffaloes and white bass) did not change significantly between years. Standing crops of the larger zooplankton (calanoids and daphnids) decreased during the high-water year, perhaps because of predation by age-0 fish. Standing crops of the smaller zooplankton species such as Bosmina longirostris and Chydorus sphaericus increased during the high-water year, as did the overall diversity of the zooplankton community. Management of water levels in Missouri River main-stem reservoirs to include 1 high-water year out of every 3 would greatly enhance the lake''s fishery resources.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1981	110	3					370	381		10.1577/1548-8659(1981)110<370:SASWLI>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1981)110<370:SASWLI>2.0.CO;2													WOS:A1981LU90100007

Natural phytoplankton assemblage responses to nutrient enrichment were determined from chlorophyll production in laboratory incubations under seasonally varied light and temperature conditions. Experimental treatments included a complete treatment containing P, N, Si, EDTA, vitamins and trace metals; treatments with deletions from the complete treatment; complete treatments with different P concentrations; and treatments with single nutrient additions. Effects were most pronounced during summer and fall when P, EDTA, FeEDTA, vitamins, and SI were added simultaneously. The intensity of the effect resulting from additions of P and other nutrients varied seasonally. Individual additions of EDTA, N and Si had little effect as did deletion of N from the complete treatment. Addition of P alone resulted in limited growth. Deletion of P from the complete enrichment reduced growth drastically during most experimental periods. In the complete treatment, the minimum levels of P that caused significant chlorophyll production ranged from 1-3 .mu.g l-1. Chelate (EDTA), chelated iron and vitamins were important secondary limiting nutrients during the summer months. There was a small effect due to Si in July, Sept. and Oct., and no indication of deficiency in trace metals. Trace metals, when deleted, frequently produced greater chlorophyll than the complete treatment, but growth was sharply reduced by deletion of trace metals and EDTA combined. Large increases in chlorophyll production in southern Lake Huron require simultaneous additions of the primary limiting nutrient (P) and secondary limiting nutrients (EDTA, FeEDTA and vitamins) which vary seasonally.

Comparing Spatial and Temporal Variation of Lake-Atmosphere Carbon Dioxide Fluxes Using Multiple Methods	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Lakes emit globally significant amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere, but quantifying these rates for individual lakes is extremely challenging. The exchange of CO2 across the air-water interface is driven by physical, chemical, and biological processes in both the lake and the atmosphere that vary at multiple spatial and temporal scales. None of the methods we use to estimate CO2 flux fully capture this heterogeneous gas exchange. Here, we compared concurrent CO2 flux estimates from a single lake based on commonly used methods. These include floating chambers (FCs), eddy covariance (EC), and two concentration gradient-based methods labeled fixed (F-pCO(2)) and spatial (S-pCO(2)). At the end of summer, cumulative carbon fluxes were similar between EC, F-pCO(2), and S-pCO(2) methods (-4, -4, and -9.5 gC m-2), while methods diverged in directionality of fluxes during the fall turnover period (-50, 43, and 38 gC m-2). Collectively, these results highlight the discrepancies among methods and the need to acknowledge the uncertainty when using any of them to approximate this heterogeneous flux. Plain Language Summary Lakes comprise a small percentage of the landscape, but they are active and complex areas of carbon cycling. Lakes receive mixed carbon inputs from upstream sources, process this carbon internally, store it in sediments and biomass, and export it downstream. In addition, some fraction of the carbon in lakes exchanges into and out of the atmosphere, linking lakes with the global atmosphere. The exchange of carbon dioxide across lake surfaces has globally significant implications, but quantifying these rates has yet to be fully resolved. Here, we compared four methods of estimating diffusive carbon dioxide exchange between the atmosphere and the lake surface. Flux rates generally agreed during the summer, but estimates diverged in the fall, a critical time period with elevated carbon cycling rates. These discrepancies among methods may arise because of the high degree of spatial and temporal variability in gas exchange and our limited ability to portray and scale these processes accurately. In the future, we need to improve both the resolution of observations and how we process those observations to better measure carbon gas exchange between lakes and the atmosphere.

Ninety-three species were identified and their relative abundance and biomasses evaluated, both at the surface and at the bottom levels of four different stations (placed in the lake close to the shore of Piaggetta, Burlamacca canal, Collettore canal, and in one small shallow pond called Chiaro). The most interesting results are: (a) the great biodiversity of the ciliate communities found in Lake Massaciuccoli likely depends upon the wide range of different microhabitats available for these communities and present in the four stations chosen; (b) the communities of the Piaggetta and Burlamacca stations are similar to each other, mainly characterized in their seasonal dynamics at the surface level (open water); (c) the communities of the Collettore and the Chiaro stations are typical of shallow waters, characterized by very large amounts of organic debris on the bottom, as shown by the rich populations of filter-feeders and thigmotactic species which, in turn, constitute a good pabulum for the carnivorous species; (d) the major peaks of specimens density and biomass values were found during autumn 1992 and in early spring 1993.																			1125-0003	1748-5851					1998	65	2					191	202		10.1080/11250009809386746	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11250009809386746													WOS:000074440000010

Influence of Variable Interannual Summer Water Temperatures on Brook Trout Growth, Consumption, Reproduction, and Mortality in an Unstratified Adirondack Lake	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Stressful water temperatures negatively affect physiological processes in fishes, yet evidence for how elevated temperatures influence population-level characteristics is rare. An 8-year field study of brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis in an unstratified Adirondack lake revealed that an aggregate measure of chronically stressful summer water temperatures strongly influenced brook trout population-level characteristics. We quantified chronic thermal stress using the cumulative degree-days over which bottom temperatures exceeded a range of thresholds (18-22 degrees C) and found that the strongest relationships were with cumulative degree-days over 20 degrees C (DD>20). Across years with similar brook trout densities, warmer summer water temperatures resulted in decreased brook trout growth, but growth was not reduced in a year with high water temperatures and low density. Maximum stomach fullness was negatively related to water temperature. Reproductive activity was negatively correlated with stressful summer thermal conditions and was less dependent on female brook trout density. Periods of chronically stressful summer water temperatures resulted in the apparent mortality of age-2 and older fish during a moderately stressful summer (156 DD>20) and apparent mortality of age-1 and older fish during the most stressful summer (210 DD>20). In contrast, extensive mortality was not evident in any year-classes when DD>20 was less than 115. Anthropogenic impacts on the thermal conditions of aquatic ecosystems occur at small (hydrology) and large (climate change) spatial extents, and in situ studies at the margin of an organism's thermal range can provide important insights into changes that will occur if temperatures increase.

Oxygen isotope composition of diatoms from sediments of Lake Kotokel (Buryatia)	RUSSIAN GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS												This is a summary of new oxygen isotope record of diatoms from Lake Kotokel sediments, with implications for responses of the lake system and its environment to global change over the past 46 kyr. Fossil diatoms in all samples are free from visible contamination signatures and contain no more than 2.5% Al2O3, which ensures reliable reconstructions. The delta O-18 values in diatoms vary between +23.7 and +31.2 parts per thousand over the record. The results present mainly diatom assemblages of summer blooming periods, except for the time span between 36 and 32 kyr, when the isotopic signal records mainly a shift from summer to spring blooming conditions. Possible water temperature changes only partly explain the changes in the isotopic record. The observed isotopic patterns are produced mainly by isotope changes in lake water in response to variations in air temperature, hydrology, and atmospheric circulation in the region. During Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2 (Last Glacial maximum), high delta O-18(diatom) resulted from rapid evaporation and low fluvial inputs. The high delta O-18(diatom) values of about +29 to +30 parts per thousand during the first half of MIS 1 (Holocene interglacial) suggest an increased share of summer rainfalls associated with southern/southeastern air transport. The delta O-18(diatom) decrease to +24 parts per thousand during the second half of MIS 1 is due to the overall hemispheric cooling and increased moisture supply to the area by the Atlantic air masses. The record of Lake Kotokel sediments provides an example of complex interplay among several climatic/environmental controls of delta O-18(diatom) during the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene.

Carrie`re. This climatic impact ultimately led to the extinction of all Tsuga species in Europe. Today, there are ten recognized species of Tsuga worldwide, one of listed as a vulnerable species and four as near-threatened species. The genus Tsuga exhibits a disjunctive distribution in East Asia (EA), eastern North America (ENA), and western North America (WNA). It is crucial to comprehend the mechanisms underlying these distributional changes and to identify key climate variables to develop effective conservation strategies for Tsuga under future climate scenarios. In this study, we applied the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model by combining distribution data for Tsuga with abundant pollen fossil data. Our objective was to investigate the climate factors that shape the distribution of Tsuga, identify climate thresholds, and elucidate distribution dynamics in the context of significant climate changes over the past 1070 thousand years (ka). Our findings highlight the pivotal role of precipitation as the key climate factor affecting the distribution of Tsuga. Specifically, in EA, summer precipitation was the key driver, while in North America (NA), winter precipitation exerted greater importance. Moreover, we observed similarities in climatic requirements between Tsuga species in Europe and EA, and declines in summer precipitation and winter temperature were major factors contributing to the extinction of Tsuga species in Europe. Quaternary glacial and interglacial fluctuations exerted substantial impacts on Tsuga distribution dynamics. The disappearance of Tsuga species in the Korean Peninsula may have occurred during the LGM (Last Glacial Maximum). The potential suitable area for Tsuga species in EA expanded during the cold periods, while in NA, it contracted. In the future, climate change may result Tsuga distribution area contraction in both the EA and NA. Our study has identified distinct response patterns of Tsuga in various geographic regions to Quaternary climate change and offers corresponding suggestions for Tsuga conservation. In the future, it will be imperative to prioritize the conservation of natural Tsuga distributions in EA and NA, with a focus on the impacts of precipitation fluctuation on the dynamic distribution of this genus.					; WANG, Xiao-Jun/L-7196-2018; Karim, Rizwan/JCE-1311-2023; Xiao, Shumei/OHV-1766-2025; Wu, Mengxiao/GZM-3849-2022	Wang, Xiaojun/0000-0002-4572-3742; Li, Shufeng/0000-0002-5144-4432; Su, Tao/0000-0002-9148-6127; Karim, Rizwan/0000-0001-9451-6080; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				JAN	2024	158								111533	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111533	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111533		JAN 2024											WOS:001154258600001

A total of 42 taxa (including larval stages) were identified, among them 21 species of copepods, 6 rotifers, 5 cladocerans, 1 chaetognath and 1 urochordate. Copepods represented the predominant component (77.7% of the total community), followed by rotifers, molluscs, cladocerans and (9.2, 4.7 and 3.9% respectively), while other groups collectively formed about 4.5% of the total zooplankton population. Summer was the most productive season with an average count of 40 864 individuals m(-3). The dominant copepod species were Paracalanus crassirostris and Oithona nana representing 28.3 and 24.3% of the total zooplankton respectively. The total zooplankton count, including copepods, and its dominant species showed significant positive correlations with temperature, pH and total phytoplankton density. However, negative correlations were detected between densities of rotifers, and salinity and dissolved oxygen.

Local diversity in phenological responses of migratory lake sturgeon to warm winters	OIKOS												Rich intraspecific diversity in traits that shape responses to environmental conditions implies that effects of climate change will differ within species or even populations. Nevertheless, few studies investigate how different groups within species respond to climatic fluctuations, and most risk assessments rely upon species-wide generalizations. We studied effects of among-year variation in air temperature on the spring migratory phenology of a metapopulation of lake sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens within waters connecting Lake Huron and Lake Erie of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Sturgeon here express multiple migratory phenotypes that all spawn in either the St. Clair River or Detroit River but differ in their use after spawning of more than 86 000 km(2) of accessible lake and river habitat. Acoustic tracking over nine years (2012-2020) revealed mixed phenological responses to late-winter air temperatures, with three migratory groups arriving at rivers earlier during warm years and one whose arrival was consistent across years regardless of temperature. Notably, two groups that spawn in the same river but overwinter in different lakes entered the river with greater synchrony during warm years because one advanced its phenology while the other did not. The results indicated warm weather could alter the dynamics of the metapopulation and broader community, and exemplify the complexity hidden beneath broadscale generalizations of species' response to climate change.

These values of [Cu2+] are much lower than literature values for the open sea. Equilibrium models of titration data indicate the presence of very strong ligands with conditional stability constants of 10(13.9)-10(14.9) and corresponding concentrations of 40-90 nM. Measured [Cu2+] was especially low during the algal bloom in spring and was higher in winter. p[Cu] and ratios Of [CU]T to [Cu2+] thus exhibit a seasonal pattern similar to that of algal productivity, suggesting that the Cu-complexing ligands are produced by algae.					; Sigg, Laura/AAI-3504-2020	Sigg, Laura/0000-0002-2210-2951; 													0024-3590					SEP	1993	38	6					1200	1213		10.4319/lo.1993.38.6.1200	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1993.38.6.1200													WOS:A1993ME14700009

BLACK BASS: ECOLOGY, CONSERVATION, AND MANAGEMENT	AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY SYMPOSIUM				Black Bass 2000 Symposium	AUG 21-24, 2000	ST LOUIS, MO	Amer Fisheries Soc, Bass Pro Shops, In Fisherman				Current management strategies for largemouth and smallmouth bass sometimes incorporate seasonal closures in spring/early summer to protect bass during their reproductive periods. Our 12-year (1990-2001) field study investigated how well southern Ontario's closed bass fishing season matched the reproductive periods of nesting male largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides and smallmouth bass M. dolomieu in two lakes and two rivers in the region. Study areas within each system consisted of two-kilometer stretches of shoreline in which bass reproductive activity was monitored visually by divers. The data collected for each nesting male included species, egg deposition date, level of mating success, duration of parental care, and whether that male was successful or unsuccessful at producing surviving offspring to the free-swimming independent fry stage. Our results demonstrate that the extent of protection afforded nesting male bass through the use of the closed season varied significantly among water bodies and among years, reflecting the variation in spring warming rates. Smallmouth bass guarded their broods at the nest site significantly longer than largemouth bass and were, therefore, vulnerable to anglers longer. In addition, visual surveys of angling activity revealed that angler noncompliance with this regulation was common and even pervasive at some sites. The annual and geographic variation in the extent of protection afforded by the uniform seasonal closure indicates that a refinement of that regulation may be beneficial. Furthermore, the substantial levels of preseason angling observed in several of the study sites indicate that some other method of protection (e.g., sanctuaries or total closed seasons) may be more effective in many instances.

J	Kosa, JT; Mather, ME				Kosa, JT; Mather, ME			Processes contributing to variability in regional patterns of juvenile river herring abundance across small coastal systems	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Many populations of anadromous herring, (e.g., alewives Alosa pseudoharengus and blueback herring A. aestivalis, collectively referred to as river herring) are in decline. To help understand the various processes influencing their relative abundance, we studied juvenile river herring populations in ii small, coastal Massachusetts systems. We examined diel and seasonal movements, variation in patterns of abundance, and relationships between juvenile river herring numbers and seven abiotic and biotic factors (stream discharge, pond temperature, habitat availability, pond transparency, pH, food availability, and spawning stock size). Seasonally, juvenile downstream migration peaked in early summer, and most juvenile river herring emigrated between 1200 and 1600 hours. Little or no emigration occurred in late summer when stream channels were often dewatered, although several streams experienced a smaller, more variable emigration peak in the fall. In univariate regressions, stream discharge, pond volume, surface area, depth, transparency, and pH were significantly related to variation in juvenile abundance across systems. Multiple regression models that integrated discharge, volume, and transparency, as well as multivariate models that included abiotic and biotic influences, trophic effects, and system size, explained 32-82% of the variability in juvenile abundance across systems. Thus, stream discharge, pond volume, transparency, pH, trophic effects, and system size contribute to heterogeneity across systems and may influence the abundance of these fish during freshwater residence. Increased understanding of the sources of heterogeneity in movement patterns and causes of variability in abundance across systems can help to implement more effective monitoring protocols, more informed land-use decisions. and improved management of river herring.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JUL	2001	130	4					600	619		10.1577/1548-8659(2001)130<0600:PCTVIR>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2001)130<0600:PCTVIR>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000169852700007

In one stock (derived from Lake Michigan and introduced annually into Trout Run, Fairview, Pennsylvania, by the Pennsylvania Fish Commission) the mortality of the embryos and yold sac fry was significantly higher and the weight of yolk sac fry and parr was smaller than in a second self-reproducing stock which spawns in Young and Fishers creeks, Ontario. The gonadosomatic indices and number of eggs per unit weight of female were larger in the Pennsylvania stock, although carcass weights, weight of unfertilized eggs, and number of eggs per female were similar in the two stocks; secondary sexual characteristics were poorly exhibited in both stocks. There were no differences in plasma thyroid hormone levels or the degree of thyroid hyperplasia in the two stocks, suggesting that the low survival of the embryos and poor growth of the yolk sac fry in the Pennsylvania stock cannot be attributed directly to thyroid dysfunction, as had been proposed previously. Plasma thyroid hormone levels fell from relatively high levels in sexually immature salmon collected in summer to near zero levels in the pre-ovulatory to post-ovulatory salmon collected in the fall. Moreover, there was a significant decrease in plasma triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) levels in males during the period between early October and early December. No such decline was seen in females, which had low plasma T3 levels by the first (early October) fall collection.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				NOV	1987	65	11					2780	2785		10.1139/z87-419	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z87-419													WOS:A1987L725200031

However, they are not yet fully integrated in carbon global budgets, and the carbon cycle in the water is still poorly understood. In freshwater ecosystems, productivity studies have usually been carried out with traditional methods (bottle incubations, C-14 technique), which are imprecise and have a poor temporal resolution. Consequently, our ability to quantify and predict the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is limited: the estimates are prone to errors and the NEP cannot be parameterised from environmental variables. Here we expand the testing of a free-water method based on the direct measurement of the CO2 concentration in the water. The approach was first proposed in 2008, but was tested on a very short data set (3 days) under specific conditions (autumn turnover); despite showing promising results, this method has been neglected by the scientific community. We tested the method under different conditions (summer stratification, typical summer conditions for boreal dark-water lakes) and on a much longer data set (40 days), and quantitatively validated it comparing our data and productivity models. We were able to evaluate the NEP with a high temporal resolution (minutes) and found a very good agreement (R-2 >= 0.71) with the models. We also estimated the parameters of the productivity-irradiance (PI) curves that allow the calculation of the NEP from irradiance and water temperature. Overall, our work shows that the approach is suitable for productivity studies under a wider range of conditions, and is an important step towards developing this method so that it becomes more widely used.					; Mammarella, Ivan/E-7782-2016; Vesala, Timo/C-3795-2017; MAMMARELLA, IRENE/D-1375-2014	Kohonen, Kukka-Maaria/0000-0001-9258-1225; Mammarella, Ivan/0000-0002-8516-3356; 													1726-4170	1726-4189				APR 9	2018	15	7					2021	2032		10.5194/bg-15-2021-2018	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-2021-2018													WOS:000429474600001

Interstudy and Intrastudy Temporal Trends of Polychlorinated Biphenyl, Pesticide, and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Concentrations in Air and Precipitation at a Rural Site in Ontario	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY LETTERS												Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), organochlorine pesticide, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAR) concentrations were measured in air (in the vapor and particle phases) and in precipitation samples collected at Point Petre on the northeastern shore of Lake Ontario as a part of the Integrated Atmospheric Deposition Network. These data were measured in two separate studies, one running from 1992 to 2003 (inclusive) and the other from 1998 to 2011 (inclusive). Having these two independent studies is a direct way of measuring changes in atmospheric concentrations and comparing interstudy changes to intrastudy changes. The concentrations of almost all pesticides declined between the two studies with halving times of 3-6 years; the concentrations of PAHs and PCBs did not change much between the two studies. This suggests that there are continuing sources of PAHs and PCBs to the Great Lakes atmosphere. PAR concentrations were elevated in the winter when space heating consumes greater amounts of fuel and emits larger amounts of PAL-Is. Pesticide and PCB concentrations were elevated in the summer because of enhanced volatilization from terrestrial or aquatic surfaces during hot summer days. Although there were a few exceptions (notably lindane), in general, the data from the two study periods gave similar results.

Catherine			Complex patterns of phosphorus delivery in the Lake of the Woods watershed	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake of the Woods (LoW) is a large, transboundary lake that continues to experience harmful algal blooms despite large declines in phosphorus (P) inputs from point sources. Tributary runoff is considered the largest source of P to the lake; however, there are few monitoring data within the Canadian portion of the basin (-60% of total area), to guide management. To address this gap, we monitored five rivers of con-trasting land use within the lower Rainy River region, an acknowledged "hot spot" of P delivery in the basin. Total P (TP) concentrations were consistently high at all five rivers (volume-weighted range: 19-215 lg/l) despite differences in agriculture across sites (7-27%), suggesting 'natural' background P levels are high in this landscape. Furthermore, TP concentrations were strongly correlated with total sus-pended sediment and geogenic metals, iron (Fe) and aluminum, and TP was especially high during events (>400 lg/l) indicating erosion is an important source of P delivery. However, equally high TP and Fe dur -ing periods of slow, stagnant flow in the summer and under winter ice suggest erosion is not the only source of P. Instead, we suggest redox release of P from streambed sediment is also important. This obser-vation is significant, because internal P release within the tributaries, especially during the summer could 'seed' downstream algal blooms. The strong sensitivity of TP to both high and low flow conditions indi-cates that frequent, all-season, multi-year measurements are needed to understand the mechanisms of P delivery in this basin.Crown Copyright & COPY; 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Alien rotifer K. bostoniensis has been found not only simultaneously with indigenous rotifer species but also separately, in more shallow water bodies. Alien species is more tolerant to bathymetry, basin form, transparency, and the trophic state of the water body. Probably, these features facilitate wider distribution of K. bostoniensis in the Sura basin water bodies compared to indigenous species. Alien K. bostoniensis spread relatively quickly in the Sura basin without affecting closely related indigenous species, to which it is not a competitor.

In the past these were poorly known botanically because of the ruggedness and inaccessibility of the area. The varied climatic conditions and habitat types have a main role to play in establishing the vegetation of these zones. A total of 122 taxa were identified from collections made during the summer months (July-Sept.) of 1976. These areas fall in an altitudinal range of 4000-5000 m. Fifteen taxa are reported as new records for this region. Six different habitat types were recognized on the basis of local distribution of these taxa: rocky and gravelly sites; alkaline swamps; silty and clay sites; stream sites; meadow and shrub fields; and cultivated field sites. A comprehensive inventory of the flowering plants of this region is given.																			0015-5551						1983	18	3					301	308		10.1007/BF02855674	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02855674													WOS:A1983RE39800004

From 1991, periodical eel mortality occurred in Lake Balaton, Hungary. However, eels with a worm burden of 20 to 50 parasites did not show severe swimbladder lesions, which observation cast doubts on the primary aetiological role of the parasite in the eel kill. In order to study the pathology of the infection, from the spring of 1996 until October of the same year, 51 eels were collected from two regions of Lake Balaton and examined for swimbladder changes. To detect humoral antibodies, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed, using cuticular-oesophageal worm antigen. The results of the test show the applicability of the method. However, no direct correlation was found between antibody levels or the intensity of infection and the swimbladder lesions. The low level of specific antibodies and the increasing severity of swimbladder changes in the autumn suggest that parasite-induced immunity is insufficient to prevent reinfection.

D. pulicaria co-exists with an abundant Cyclops population. In contrast to the non-abundant small-bodied D. longispina, which reproduces year-round in the lake with fish, D. pulicaria in the fishless lake was found to reproduce only once a year over a short period of time, suggesting strong stabilizing selection for the precise timing of reproductive effort and hatching from diapausing eggs in the clones inhabiting the lake. This is conceivably due to the exceptionally long lifespan of Daphnia, which can over-winter either in ephippia or in the form of active adults that have restrained from reproduction until the next year, when, almost I year old, they produce eggs. The new-year generation starts from both the ephippial eggs and eggs released by the over-wintering, adults. Only a small fraction of the population is recruited as the second new-year generation from eggs released by a few new-generation females that succeed in growing and maturing early. In each of the two generations, reproductive effort is restricted to a short period, evidently the only time window when (1) food levels are high enough to allow juvenile growth and (2) predation by Cyclops is low enough for high survival of eggs and neonates. No immediately hatching eggs are produced outside this reproductive window, even when the body lipids of the adult Daphnia are as high as at the time of summer reproduction, suggesting a deliberate halt to reproduction and its postponement until the following summer.

Uncomfortably large discrepancies between vegetation-based summer temperature reconstructions (mainly based on pollen) and climate model results have been reported for the current interglacial, the Holocene. For the Mediterranean region these reconstructions indicate cooler-than-present mid-Holocene summers, in contrast with expectations based on climate models and long-term changes in summer insolation. We present new quantitative and replicated Holocene summer temperature reconstructions based on fossil chironomid midges from the northern central Mediterranean region. The Holocene thermal maximum is reconstructed 9,000-5,000 years ago and estimated to have been 1-2 degrees C warmer in mean July temperature than the recent pre-industrial period, consistent with glacier and marine records, and with transient climate model runs. This combined evidence implies that widely used pollen-based summer temperature reconstructions in the Mediterranean area are significantly biased by precipitation or other forcings such as early land use. Our interpretation can resolve the previous discrepancy between climate models and quantitative palaeotemperature records for millennial-scale Holocene summer temperature trends in the Mediterranean region. It also suggests that pollen-based evidence for cool mid-Holocene summers in other semi-arid to arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere may have to be reconsidered, with potential implications for global-scale reconstructions.					; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023; Tinner, Willy/F-6727-2013; Brönnimann, Stefan/A-5737-2008; Joos, Fortunat/B-4118-2018; Franke, Joerg/N-7819-2013	Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Tinner, Willy/0000-0001-7352-0144; Bronnimann, Stefan/0000-0001-9502-7991; Joos, Fortunat/0000-0002-9483-6030; 													1752-0894	1752-0908				MAR	2017	10	3					207	+		10.1038/NGEO2891	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/NGEO2891													WOS:000395791400013

We hypothesized that pronounced seasonality in physical and biological forcing and strong vertical gradients of chemical, physical, and biological parameters in this meromictic lake would result in dramatic temporal and spatial variability in concentrations of viruses and viral infections of prokaryotes. To test this, we investigated the temporal, vertical, and horizontal variability in hydrography, microbial concentrations, and viral infections of prokaryotes at 4 stations over a 10 mo period in Mono Lake. The infection parameters quantified included the frequency of visibly infected cells (FVIC), burst size, intracellular virus diameter, and volume of infected cells. Concentrations of chlorophyll a (chl a), prokaryotes, and viruses in individual samples ranged from 3.3 to 150 mu g l(-1), 0.10 to 1.2 x 10(11) l(-1), and 0.14 to 1.9 X 10(12) l(-1), respectively, with the highest concentrations of each occurring in the spring. For all data combined, concentrations of viruses were significantly correlated with concentrations of prokaryotes (r = 0.68, p < 0.001, n = 68), but not with chl a. FVIC ranged from < 0.1 to 3.5% for the community, but reached as high as 13% for coccoid cells in 1 sample. Averaged over the water column, the estimated fraction of prokaryote mortality due to viral lysis ranged from a low of 3.7% in September, to a high of 16% in July. Burst size, intracellular virus diameters, and volumes of infected cells were temporally variable with a trend of decreasing burst size through the spring and summer as a result of larger viruses infecting smaller cells. In contrast, these parameters did not differ systematically among stations or between the anoxic and oxic layers of the lake. The data suggested that seasonal forcing is the primary source of variability in viral infections in the lake. Overall, viral lysis appeared to make a modest contribution to the mortality of prokaryotes, but high virus-host contact rates suggested that viruses are likely to influence the clonal diversity of picoplankton in the lake.

Dissolved organic matter from surface and pore waters of a discontinuous permafrost watershed in central Alaska reveals both compositional and seasonal heterogeneity	AQUATIC SCIENCES												In areas of active permafrost thaw, changes in organic carbon pools may significantly impact water quality and ecosystem services across the landscape. Surface and pore waters were collected from streams and lakes in the Goldstream Valley near Fairbanks Alaska over a period of three years, 2016-2018, to compare and contrast different thermokarst regimes, their water quality, and dissolved organic matter (DOM). Waters were characterized by elemental analysis, major ions, and optical characterization of DOM. We found DOM composition to be spatiotemporally heterogeneous, and influenced by complex hydrology. This result is evidenced by analyzing DOM character between differing water bodies and depths, seasonality, as well extent of metal association with DOM. Pore water DOM overall varied from the surface waters, with respect to both optical metrics and seasonality. Optical parameters typically associated with terrestrial signals were observed to become more prevalent in pore waters as summer progressed toward winter in an active thermokarst lake, potentially corroborating a hypothesis of downward flow into the talik or rapid turnover of authochthonous-sourced DOM. In addition, winter sampling, where surface inputs were assumed to be frozen, is essential to observe annual patterns of DOM composition. A principal components analysis separated water bodies based on their thermokarst activity and by season. Dissolved organic matter in these permafrost-impacted systems was found to be more complex than simply terrestrial or microbial, and extracted isolates from these waters were not necessarily bounded by existing end-member references.

Daily weather data associated with a relatively ''wet'' climate (years with extreme increases in annual rainfall, similar to 33 cm/yr) and ''dry'' climate (historic average annual rainfall, similar to 15 cm/yr) was used to simulate the affects of Pleistocene and Holocene climate change on soil-water balance. Linkages among atmospheric circulation patterns, regional increases in precipitation, and historic flooding in the Mojave Desert, California, suggest that historic wet years provide an analog for wetter climates that occurred during the last glacial period (latest Pleistocene) and episodically during Holocene periods of pluvial activity. Modeling results indicate that soil-water balance for dry and wet years strongly corresponds with the upper and lower zones of carbonate accumulation respectively. Soil-water only reached the lower zone of carbonate during a wet year when extreme increases in winter/spring storm activity resulted in a significant increase in precipitation and the downward flux of soil water. The linkage between increases in frontal storm activity and pluvial events suggests that the shallow zone of the bimodal distribution of carbonate is a result of periods of significant decreases in winter and spring rainfall and not primarily due to increases in Holocene temperature or the development of clay-rich horizons. Calculation of carbonate solubility and accumulation rates suggests that the bimodal distribution of carbonates in soils may have also been impacted by episodic periods of extreme increases in precipitation associated with perennial lakes during the Holocene. Results suggests that much of the carbonate in the upper 75 cm of Pleistocene soils may have accumulated during the late Holocene rather than throughout the entire Holocene.

Fifteen month simulations (October 2004 to December 2005) were performed to investigate where and to which extent the tagged evapotranspired water from the Poyang Lake region returns to the land surface as precipitation. The contributions of direct evaporation and transpiration were estimated separately using an extended ET-Tagging partitioning algorithm. In 2005, the contribution of moisture originating from the Poyang Lake region to the local annual precipitation in Southeast China reaches a value of up to 1.2%. A maximum contribution of 6% is found near the Poyang Lake region in August. In 2005, 69% of total tagged precipitation originates from direct evaporation of water whereas 31% from transpiration. In winter, precipitation originating from transpired moisture only accounts for around 10% of the total tagged precipitation, but in the summer season the contribution of transpiration increases up to 50%. To explore the source-target relations under consideration of the respective precipitation regime, we introduce source-specific precipitation efficiencies. For the period under investigation, the efficiency for direct evaporation generally dominates, except during the comparatively dry August and in the winter months. Our study shows that the location and the magnitude of tagged precipitation show large spatial and temporal variations. The comprehensive interactions between land surface characteristics and synoptic weather conditions control the annual cycle of the individual contributions to precipitation, emphasizing the important impacts of vegetation cover and land use on the atmospheric hydrological cycle.

Regional potentiometric head maps of the shallow aquifer suggest that Prairie Lake, an artificial lake built between 1954 and 1982, could represent this component. Isotopic, biological and chemical tracing of the spring conclusively verify the hypothesis that this lake has impacted Weldon Spring. Mixing calculations indicate that Weldon Spring is now comprised of approximately 80% lake water and 20% groundwater. Recent measurements indicate that the discharge rate of the spring is now approximately 10 times the rate prior to the construction of the lake, confirming the augmentation of flow by a new source. Analysis of the isotopic trends indicates that the subsurface travel time is short, and suggests that the conduits connecting the lake and the spring may be progressively enlarging.

Results showed that the monthly average fluxes of NH4+-N and SRP were 31.38 and 6.98 mg m(-2) d(-1), respectively, both of which were higher than those in many other hyper-eutrophic lakes around the world. The exchanges of NH4+-N and SRP were both closed related to the oxygen penetration. Low oxygen penetration depth and generally negative oxygen uptake rates provoked the dissolution of redox sensitive phosphorus and labile NH4+-N in the sediment and increased the fluxes. In addition, the generally higher fluxes during late spring to autumn should be noted during the reduction of internal loadings, when applicable techniques should be implemented accordingly to achieve better reduction effects.					; Liu, Cheng/AAC-5395-2020; Gu, Xiaozhi/E-7506-2013; Huang, Wei/L-7090-2019	Liu, Cheng/0000-0002-3526-7026; 													1061-4303	1554-7531				NOV 1	2018	90	11					1956	1963		10.2175/106143017X15131012188079	http://dx.doi.org/10.2175/106143017X15131012188079								30486923					WOS:000451629800004

Based on the contemporary understanding of the species' ecology in Boreal Shield rivers, it was hypothesized that poststocking survival and/or within-reach retention could be improved via release of hatchery-reared fish directly into the deepwater habitats that are preferred by juvenile and subadult life stages. Acoustic telemetry and mark-recapture methods were used to evaluate this hypothesis. In total, 390PIT-tagged age-1 Lake Sturgeon (mean +/- SDof length measured 1 week prior to stocking = 242 +/- 29 mmFL) were released during spring 2015 from shore at the base of a set of falls on the Nelson River, Manitoba (mimicking the status quo stocking procedure for the reach), and 391PIT-tagged individuals (240 +/- 27 mmFL) were released approximately 4.2 river kilometers downstream of the shore release location into an approximately 750-m-long patch of deepwater habitat (maximum depth = 15 m) using the deepwater release method. Of the released fish, 30 (15 per stocking method) were implanted with acoustic transmitters. In total, 23% and 22% of the stocked fish were recaptured in gill-net surveys conducted during fall 2015 and 2016, respectively. Recapture proportions associated with the two release types were not significantly different. Acoustic telemetry revealed considerable variation among individuals and offered general insight into poststocking behavior but provided no direct support for the primary hypothesis. Despite the null results of the current study, optimization of release methods for Lake Sturgeon may warrant further investigation.

It regulates the population size of potential prey and at the same time decreases competitiveness between them. Among predators inhabiting water environments, especially notable predators are water beetles, particularly adults of Dytiscidae. The results presented herein are an attempt to learn the trophic relations between adult Dytiscidae and non-biting midges (Diptera: Chironomidae). The studies were conducted in one-month intervals from April to September 2012-2013. In the diet structure of adult Dytiscidae of two size categories, the genus Glyptotendipes was found to be prevalent. The largest beetles tended to choose Chironomidae larvae significantly larger than those selected by medium-sized beetles. The diet was mainly composed of Chironomidae larvae related to aquatic vegetation, while larvae inherently connected with detritus were fewer. Statistically significant correlations were confirmed between the population size of Chironomidae larvae and adult insects consumed by beetles of medium body size. No such correlation was found in case of the largest beetles. The study revealed that despite the unquestionable influence of body size and the predation environment on the dietary selectivity of predatory Dytiscidae, the structure of consumed food is subject to noticeable seasonal variations, occurring from spring to autumn.					; Pakulnicka, Joanna/N-5889-2018; K, J/HJP-6006-2023	Koszalka, Jacek/0000-0003-3434-2036; Pakulnicka, Joanna/0000-0003-4823-7253; 													0006-3088	1336-9563				AUG	2016	71	8					931	940		10.1515/biolog-2016-0115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2016-0115													WOS:000384603500010
J	ELLIOTT, JM				ELLIOTT, JM			GROWTH, SIZE, BIOMASS AND PRODUCTION FOR DIFFERENT LIFE-STAGES OF MIGRATORY TROUT SALMO-TRUTTA IN A LAKE DISTRICT STREAM, 1966-83	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												The objective was to identify the chief factors affecting growth variations in 16 year-classes of migratory trout, Salmo trutta L., in Black Brows Beck [England]. Mean sizes and mean specific growth rates for different life stages varied considerably between year-classes, and were not density dependent. Water temperature and, to a lesser extent, alevin weight were the chief factors affecting growth in fresh water; food was not a limiting factor, except for c. 6 months in the first autumn-spring period of the life cycle and for first-year trout in 2 summer droughts (1976, 1983). Mean sizes of adults returning to spawn in fresh water were directly related to mean sizes of juveniles at the start of their migration to the sea/estuary. Mean sizes of trout caught in 1933-34 and in this investigation were similar; therefore growth rates have not changed markedly in over 50 years. The relative variation in individual fish size (measured by C.V.) in each year-class was inversely related to initial density of eggs or alevins and was thus density depehndent. Variations in biomass were chiefly due to variations in growth rather than numbers. Most of the variation in total freshwater production in the different year-classes (range 17.43-33.88 g m-2) was due to the combined effect of density-dependent survival (38%) and density-independent growth (30%). Annual production over 16 years (range 12.17-33.90 g m-2, mean 24.39 g m-2) was higher than that recorded for most, but not all, trout streams. The problems of modelling growth are discusssed; the model used in this investigation adequately predicted the growth pattern of trout in Black Brows Beck, but only if growth was estimated in small increments. Emphasis on mean size and growth rates can be misleading because the relative variation in individual size is not a stable characteristic of the population but is density dependent, its magnitude being established in the first month of the life cycle and then remaining fairly constant throughout a year-class to the start of spawning.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1985	54	3					985	1001		10.2307/4392	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4392													WOS:A1985ARB4400022

We collected water samples from a series of alpine rivers and lakes (two valleys and their rivers, an artificial pond, and a natural lake system) in Obergurgl, Austria in June 2016, July 2016, November 2016, and May 2017. Each alpine river and lake was sampled multiple times across different seasons, depending on site access during different times of the year. Water samples were filtered through a 0.22 mu m membrane filter to separate microbial INPs from the water, and both fractions were analyzed for ice nucleation activity (INA) by an emulsion freezing method. Microorganisms were cultured from the filters, and the cultures then analyzed for INA. Portions of the filtered samples were con-centrated by lyophilization to observe potential enhancement of INA. Two sediment samples were taken as ref-erence points for inorganic INPs. Sub-micron INPs were observed in all of the alpine water sources studied, and a seasonal shift to a higher fraction of microbial ice nucleators cultured on selective media was observed during the winter collections. Particles larger than 0.22 mu m showed INA, and microbes were cultured from this fraction. Re -sults from 60 samples gave evidence of a seasonal change in INA, presence of submicrometer INPs, and show the abundance of culturable microorganisms, with late spring and early summer showing the most active biological INPs. With additional future research on this topic ski resorts could make use of such knowledge of geographical and seasonal trends of microbial INPs in freshwater habitats in order to improve the production of artificial snow.

Formulation, validation, and soil moisture simulation	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												[1] In this second part of the two-part series, we discuss the formulation and implementation of groundwater processes into an existing climate model, by linking a groundwater reservoir and a rivers-lakes reservoir with its land surface scheme. We present the parameterization and validation of these processes with river flow and soil moisture observations. We use the new scheme as a tool to investigate the role of the groundwater reservoir in controlling the spatial and temporal structure of large-scale soil moisture fields. We find that where the water table is shallow, the groundwater reservoir is linked to the soil water reservoir through two-way fluxes. At these locations, the role of the groundwater shifts from being primarily a sink to being primarily a source for the soil, as the season progresses from the wet spring to the dry autumn. Through the two-way fluxes, groundwater exerts a certain degree of control on the root zone soil moisture fields; there is an apparent spatial correlation between the distribution of shallow water table and wet soil. Since the water table reflects long-term climatic and topographic forcing and exhibits strong spatial organization, its link to the soil moisture gives the latter a certain degree of spatial organization as well. The slow changing nature of the water table acts to stabilize the temporal variations in soil water, giving the latter stronger seasonal persistence.

Water Isotopic-Geochemical Composition in the Trekhtsvetnoe Meromictic Lake on the White Sea Coast	WATER RESOURCES												The isotopic features of Lake Trekhtsvetnoe in the White Sea coast area were studied in 2012-2015 in both winter and summer. Lake Trekhtsvetnoe is a water body, separating from the sea, with constant vertical stratification throughout the observation period. Its isotopic, hydrophysical, and biological characteristics have been studied. By the isotopic profile of lake water body, three zones can be identified in the lake: (1) 0-1 m: mixolimnion zone with delta O-18 varying from -12 to -11.1 parts per thousand; (2) 1.0-3.0 m: zone with transitional properties with delta O-18 varying from -11.1 to -5.5 parts per thousand; (3) 3.0-7.6 m: monimolimnion zone with highest values of delta O-18-from -5.5 to -4.7 parts per thousand.

However, its influence on the local climate remains poorly understood. By using an atmosphere-lake coupled model, we investigated the impact of the lake on the local climate. After the adjustment of four key parameters, the model reasonably reproduced the lake-air interaction. Superimposed by the orographic effects on lake-land breeze circulation, the presence of the lake enhanced precipitation over the southern part of the lake and its adjacent land, while slightly reduced precipitation along the northern shore of the lake. The lake effect on local precipitation revealed a distinct seasonal and diurnal variability, reducing precipitation in May (-6.6%) and June (-4.5%) and increasing it from July (5.7%) to November (125.6%). During the open water season, the lake's daytime cooling effect weakened and the nighttime warming effect strengthened, affecting spatial distribution and intensity of lake-induced precipitation. In early summer, precipitation slightly decreased over the north part of the lake due to the lake's daytime cooling. In turn, lake-induced nighttime warming increased precipitation over the southern section of the lake and its adjacent land. With the start of the autumn cooling in September, heat and moisture fluxes from the lake resulted in precipitation increase in both daytime and nighttime over the entire lake. In October, the background atmospheric circulation coupled with the strong lake effects lead to a small amount but high proportion of lake-induced precipitation spreading evenly over the lake.					; Gao, Xiaoqing/AAE-5934-2019; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010; Su, Dongsheng/AAI-1211-2019	Su, Dongsheng/0000-0002-1546-4524; Kirillin, Georgiy/0000-0001-7337-3586; gao, xiao qing/0000-0003-0806-2014; Wen, Lijuan/0000-0001-9243-9499; 													2169-897X	2169-8996				NOV 27	2020	125	22							e2020JD033396	10.1029/2020JD033396	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JD033396													WOS:000595725700031

In this study, water samples were collected from autumn 2006 to summer 2007 at five positions in Chaohu Lake with different trophic status. BCC of these samples was determined by both the PCR amplification of the 16S rDNA gene and the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The abundance and diversity of bacterioplankton communities at different sampling positions showed similar seasonal patterns. The BCCs in the samples varied substantially, and the pattern of changes indicated that the seasonal difference might have a significant impact on the BCC's structure in the lake. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) on the DGGE patterns and physicochemical parameters indicated that the temperature and the levels of 5-d biochemical O-2 demand (BOD5), NH3-N, CODMn, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, and dissolved oxygen significantly influenced the BCC, and four of the seven variables were related to the level of eutrophication. Our results indicate that eutrophic status and season are the most influential factors in determining BCC in Chaohu Lake.

The results reveal four distinctive horizons in each of which the different lines of evidence point to deposition during a single, major flood event. The magnetic evidence shows that the sediment deposited in each event included a high proportion of surface-soil-derived material and this inference is consistent with the geochemical and pollen records from these layers. No firm dates can be ascribed to these inwash events at present, but a tentative chronology derived for the core from Pb-210 measurements, varve counting where possible, and correlation with a nearby, previously dated core, suggest that these hood events date from the late seventeenth to early nineteenth centuries. A tentative correlation is suggested between the single-event deposits and the record of summer/autumn floods during the period.

Seasonality and trends in the Secchi disk transparency of Lake Ladoga	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Data on Secchi disk transparency in Lake Ladoga, the largest lake in Europe, collected between 1905 and 2003, were used to detect climatic (interannual) trends for lake regions with various depths. The seasonal variations in Secchi depth (D (s)) during the ice-free period both for limnetic regions with large differences in bathymetric characteristics and for the whole lake were estimated by more than 7000 transparency measurements. The two-dimensional data sets have a spatial resolution of approximately 20 km and are geo-referenced by latitude and longitude in Lake Ladoga. Monthly mean spatial transparency distributions and their variances were calculated from May to October. The spatial distributions of the transparency for each month are discussed within the context of lake bathymetric patterns. The maximum values of Secchi depth (more than 4 m) occur during May and October in deep regions. Both the minimum mean value of water transparency and minimum horizontal gradients of D (s) for the lake occur in August. The regions with significant interannual (climatic) decreasing trends of D (s) have been identified. These areas increase in summertime and cover approximately half the lake area. In spring and autumn the areas decrease and occur in the southern near-shore regions. The mean downward climatic trend of water transparency in Lake Ladoga is 0.02 m/year.

The proportion of heterocyst-bearing cyanobacteria was positively correlated to the TN: TP ratio and nitrate. Dinophyta and/or non-heterocystous cyanobacteria were prevalent in lakes with the highest epilimnion nutrient concentrations, whilst heterocystous cyanobacteria predominated in lakes with moderate nutrient concentrations. It is argued that the ability of Dinophyta to migrate vertically and to supplement their nutrient requirements though heterotrophy may enable them to be at least as successful as cyanobacteria in high nutrient lakes and in overcoming nitrogen-scarcity. Our findings provide evidence that Dinophyta can be used as indicators of water quality.

Climate control of the spring clear-water phase through the transfer of energy and mass to lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We analyzed decade-long time series of water transparency, algal abundance, zooplankton density, heat income, hydrology, and climate from six polymictic lakes of the northern Great Plains to determine how energy and mass transfers interact to regulate lake structure during the spring clear-water phase (CWP). Timing (date of occurrence) and intensity (Secchi transparency) of CWP were highly variable among lakes (mean lake-pair synchrony, S = 0.072, p = 0.53); however, CWP occurred in all lakes when water overlying the sediments reached 16.1 degrees C +/- 3.7 degrees C and Daphnia cleared the water column of diatoms. At a decadal resolution, timing and intensity of CWP were correlated strongly and positively (r(2) > 0.90, p < 0.05) with the net heat income (theta) and lake volume, but not with other independent lake, catchment, or climate features. Instead, at an annual resolution, the strength of correlations between CWP characteristics and heat income (r(CWP-theta)) was itself correlated inversely with the winter index of the North Atlantic Oscillation (r < -0.55, p < 0.05) and with precipitation during February-April (r(2) < -0.675, p < 0.05). We conclude that the transfer of energy interacts with lake volume to regulate differences in timing and intensity of CWP among lakes, whereas the transfer of mass overrides energetic regulation to introduce temporal variation in CWP characteristics among years.

The aeolian deposits around Qinghai Lake hold significant value in tracking the paleowind direction, which is crucial to reconstruct paleo-atmospheric circulations. In this paper, a systematic study of anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS), rock and environmental magnetism, grain size distribution, and X-ray diffraction was conducted on a loess sequence (named Heimahe) in the Qinghai Lake area. The AMS results of the Heimahe section reveal two prevailing winds of NE-SW and NW-SE orientations during the last deglacial in the Qinghai Lake area. Grain size distribution and mineral composition analyses suggest that the NE-SW and NW-SE winds are respectively associated with the winter monsoon and the Westerlies. Moreover, the variations in magnetic lineation as well as other AMS parameters indicate that the dominant paleowind direction in the Qinghai Lake region during the last deglacial changed periodically with a similar to 300 yr frequency. It appears that magnetic fabric is capable of recording rapid changes in paleowind direction.

Distribution of quagga mussel veligers, Dreissena bugensis, in the reservoirs of the Colorado River Aqueduct	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												This study examined the distribution of quagga mussel veligers, Dreissena bugensis, in Copper Basin Reservoir and Lake Mathews, the 2 deepest reservoirs on the Colorado River Aqueduct system in California. Density stratification, driven by temperature differences, was a critical factor in controlling vertical distribution of veligers within the water column. Copper Basin Reservoir had the strongest stratification from May to August, with veliger concentrations higher than 80/L near the thermocline but much lower in the epilimnion and hypolimnion. Veliger concentrations were also elevated near the thermocline in Lake Mathews in late summer 2008 and spring 2009, although operation of a bubble aeration system later in 2009 eliminated the strong thermocline and may have influenced veliger abundance generally present there. Average chlorophyll a concentrations were low (< 5 mu g/L) in both reservoirs, although an increase in chlorophyll a concentration (to similar to 10 mu g/L) was observed within the spring thermocline in Lake Mathews; a chlorophyll a maximum near the thermocline was not present in Copper Basin Reservoir. These observations suggest that stratification, and not chlorophyll a concentration, determined the vertical distribution of veligers. The thermocline is a zone of increasing density that often concentrates particles. Statistically significant horizontal gradients in veliger concentrations were absent, suggesting that lateral currents mix and distribute veligers across these basins.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2010	26	4					328	335		10.1080/07438141.2010.542878	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2010.542878													WOS:000288117800011

Data were collected in 2011-2018 within the Poyang Lake area (Jiangxi Province, China), where agricultural landscapes prevail. The soil and groundwater samples were taken in different periods of an agricultural season at the beginning of the agricultural season (spring) and after harvesting (autumn). The combined geochemical data on the chemical and microbiological composition of the soils and shallow groundwater and isotopic data on dissolved nitrate allowed researchers to resolve that nitrogen enters the system in the form of organic compounds, particularly, due to the soil fertilization at the beginning of the agricultural season. Organic nitrogen compounds transform into nitrate under the influence of nitrifiers in the soil before getting the shallow aquifer, where the occurrence of denitrification is suggested. Within the Ganjiang and Xiushui interfluve, reducing conditions, together with the formation of clay minerals from the aqueous solution, may serve a geochemical barrier for the accumulation of nitrogen compounds preventing the transformation of ammonium to nitrate and providing its sorption. It also should be noted that bacterial diversity in the shallow groundwater has a strong relation with the amount of nitrate in the system, whereas in the soil, it is connected with sampling depth.

On the mechanism of the enrichment in radiocesium of near-bottom water in Lake Juodis, Lithuania	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY												Evidence of the thermodynamic origin of a mechanism for radiocesium enrichment of near-bottom water based on the analysis of vertical profiles of standard water variables (pH, temperature, oxygen concentrations and conductivity) in Lake Juodis is presented. This mechanism is shown to be related to disturbances in the thermohalinic stability (buoyancy effects) of sediment interstitial liquids inducing their interfacial transfer. The mechanism reveals itself even in aerobic waters during cooling processes in autumn under weather conditions inducing the formation of a steep temperature gradient in the surface sediments. These gradients may be formed due to intense sediment cooling as well as in cases of cooling interruptions owing to the arrival of warm air masses inducing temperature stratification of the water column. In the latter case, a sharp decrease in the heat flux from sediments through the stagnant water column promotes relative overheating of the sediment surface layer and the consequent initiation of buoyancy forces inducing interfacial transfer of sediment interstitial liquids enriched in dissolved material. Intrusions of interstitial liquids and their vertical thermodynamic transfer through the water column are followed by the formation of a specific vertical structure consisting of a set of evenly mixed water layers which are especially distinctly observable under ice cover in winter. The mechanism is responsible for lake water contamination by radiocesium and other pollutants dissolved in interstitial liquids. The investigation results explain the phenomenon of "super warm" lakes where temperatures of near-bottom waters under ice in winter are higher than 4 degrees C. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hao, LS; Li, T; Zhang, LJ; Ma, N				Hao, Lisheng; Li, Tim; Zhang, Lujun; Ma, Ning			Influence of boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation on summer precipitation in North China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												To understand the impact of the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO) propagation on summer precipitation in North China, this study analysed the quantitative relationship between the BSISO and summer precipitation in North China and its influence mechanism using summer precipitation data from 1981 to 2020, the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and the NOAA outgoing longwave radiation (OLR). The results show that there is a strong correlation between summer precipitation in North China and the BSISO. Over the past 40 years, the variance in summer precipitation anomalies in North China caused by BSISO1 accounted for 16.8%, whereas the impact of BSISO2 accounted for 13.1%. Their combined impact accounted for 30% of the variance in summer precipitation in North China. The BSISO influences summer precipitation process in North China primarily through upper tropospheric circulation and lower-level water vapour transport. At 500 and 200 hPa, the BSISO excited some disturbance centres of a deep barotropic structure propagating from west to east along the upper-tropospheric westerly jet. North China is controlled by the blocking circulation pattern of "high in the east and low in the west" while there is a negative (positive) anomaly near Lake Baikal and a positive (negative) anomaly near the Korean Peninsula. At 850 hPa, the BSISO stimulates an anticyclonic circulation anomaly on the north side of its convective area, and the southerly winds on the west side of the anticyclone enhance water vapour transport to North China. This high- and low-level circulation configuration is favourable for precipitation processes in North China. The results suggest that the influence of both low-frequency signals in the middle and high latitudes and the BSISO signal in the tropics should be considered to make extended-range forecasts of precipitation processes in North China.					; Li, Timing/IXD-9493-2023	Hao, Lisheng/0000-0002-1680-0382; Li, Tim/0000-0002-8733-4438													0899-8418	1097-0088				SEP	2023	43	11					4816	4834		10.1002/joc.8118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.8118		JUN 2023											WOS:001000835000001
J	Martin, JP; Germain, D				Martin, Jean-Philippe; Germain, Daniel			Large-scale teleconnection patterns and synoptic climatology of major snow-avalanche winters in the Presidential Range (New Hampshire, USA)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												The relationships between the synoptic climatology, large-scale teleconnections and the regional avalanche activity index (RAAI) inferred from tree-rings were evaluated for the Presidential Range in the White Mountains (New Hampshire, USA). During the period 1936-2012, 18 years of regional avalanche activity were compared with the winter-scale prevailing joint temperature/climatic modes (cold/wet (CW), cold/dry (CD), warm/wet (WW) and warm/dry (WW)), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the 500-mbar composite anomaly maps and the ratio of snow from different storm tracks. The total winter snowfall and the NAO negatively correlate with the RAAI. There is also a significant difference in avalanche activity between winters with a NAO under or above -3. Winters of regional avalanche activity were present in the four climatic modes, albeit the ratio of avalanche/non-avalanche years is superior for CW winters compared to the three other modes, as well as for wet winters compared to dry winters. CW, CD and WW winters exhibit a negative NAO anomaly, which is eastbound for the wet years. Cold winters (CW, CD) receive more snow from the Great Lakes, whereas coastal depressions are more important during wet winters (CW, WW). The NAO is an adequate predictor of snowfall, but does not provide information about the storm tracks. On the contrary, the ENSO is poorly correlated with snowfall, but its relationship is significant with the ratio of snow produced by coastal depressions (positive relationship) and Great Lakes storms (negative relationship). These are the first results quantifying the atmospheric circulation - synoptic meteorology - snow avalanche relationships in Northeastern North America.

However, the sources of these springs and the hydrological delivery mechanisms have yet to be identified. To determine the sources of spring water of Lake Kawaguchi, samples were collected directly from lake bottom springs, and oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope ratios were obtained, along with vanadium concentrations. Visual observations and water-quality analyses of the samples reveal that cold and oxygen-rich water is discharged from the lake floor, which is covered by gravel with diameters of 10-50 cm over an area of approximately 9 m (east-west) by about 13 m (north south). The water temperature of the springs remained relatively constant at around 11.3 degrees C during the stratified period in 2016; however, the temperature fluctuated significantly in 2017, even during the stratified period, suggesting a temporary decrease or stoppage of water being discharged from springs into the lake. Oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopic ratios of lake bottom springs were determined to be higher than those of groundwater in the southern part of Lake Kawaguchi; however, they displayed values close to those of groundwater in the northern part of Lake Kawaguchi, suggesting that spring water primarily originated from groundwater in the Misaka Mountains.

J	GILBERT, R; CHURCH, M				GILBERT, R; CHURCH, M			CONTEMPORARY SEDIMENTARY ENVIRONMENTS ON BAFFIN ISLAND, NWT, CANADA - RECONNAISSANCE OF LAKES ON CUMBERLAND PENINSULA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Studies were made of 4 lakes receiving significant quantities of glacial sediment, and of 5 lakes receiving no glacial sediment. All waters contain less than 10 mg l-1 dissolved sediment, with highest values in the glacial lakes where ion scavenging can occur from fine suspended sediment. Zooplankton abundance and total C content of sediments are an order of magnitude higher in the nonglacial lakes. Shallow box cores were taken in order to study the recent sediments. Two depositional environments can be recognized, one dominated by physical processes with higher rates of clastic sedimentation, and one dominated by chemical processes, especially Fe/Mn concentration. In the former, which occurs in both glacial and nonglacial lakes, periodic high sediment inflow associated with glacial or nival melt, or with summer precipitation, produces distinct laminae. Although they contain less than 10% sand, grading and load structures indicate that these beds were probably deposited from underflows or interflows in the lake. Fe bands containing up to 39% by weight Fe form where sedimentation occurs slowly and continuously under redox conditions which change as deposition occurs. Despite a very pronounced difference between winter and summer inflow to the lakes, varves could not be recognized in any of the sediments.																			0004-0851						1983	15	3					321	332		10.2307/1550828	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1550828													WOS:A1983RN52100004

The rising of temperatures in the last decades is threatening this sensitive and peculiar ecosystem, by causing also damages to the local farmers. This contribute represents an experimental study of climate change effect monitoring in mussel farming using combined instrumental and sensor surveys. A preliminary survey of the Faro Lake was performed in spring and summer seasons, by measuring the main physico-chemical parameters with probes and instrumental analysis. Based on the results obtained, a network of high-resolution sensors and a fixed weather station were installed in strategic points within the lake. The study represents a model of approach for the development of continuous and real-time observatory monitoring system in sensitive areas as support of the scientific research (as early warning systems) and of productive activities.

Here, lake pelagic diatoms were monitored covering both the open-water season and two ice-covered winter seasons in three alpine lakes on the Chinese Loess Plateau to track diatom succession dynamics and assess the potential influences of under-ice light and nutrient availability on diatom community. The results show clearly that diatom compositional changes during the open-water season in all the lakes were simply linked with lake physical mixing/stratification regimes, while diatom community composition was not consistent between the two winter seasons in each lake under the combined influence of changing under-ice nutrient and light conditions. In deep Lake Gonghai, total phosphorus (TP) explained equally the changes in winter diatom community with temperature, ice cover and associated light availability; in shallow Lake Pipahai, total nitrogen (TN) functioned as the major nutrient factor but was less important than light penetration through the ice; and in Lake Mayinghai, dissolved silica (DSi) outweighed the light effect of winter temperature and ice cover. Despite differing relative importance of nutrient factors between the different morphological types of lakes, winter diatom community changes in each lake were significantly linked with temperature, ice cover and associated changes in under-ice light availability. This study provides a detailed picture that winter temperature and under-ice limnological processes play a substantial role in diatom community dynamics in the alpine lakes of the Chinese Loess Plateau, and improves the understanding of limnological and ecological processes under ice and their driving mechanisms.

Acidic and basic species were determined in all samples. Examination of the concentration vs. depth profiles of snow cores showed that all species were stable in the snowpack until the spring thaw period. During the thaw, 50-70% of the stored acids were released during the 1st 20% of the snowmelt. Rainfall during the melt period contributed as much acidity to the environment as the snowmelt. Study of runoff showed that only 30% of the nitrate originally present in the snowpack appeared in the Little Pigeon River. H2SO4 dominated the runoff acidity at the Little Pigeon River. Nitrate and sulfate were responsible for the slight acidification of McNearney Lake during the snowmelt period.																			0049-6979	1573-2932					1984	22	3					303	319																WOS:A1984SG78200007

In particular, the decreasing tendency of rainfall in summer in North Korea is more definitely observed during the 2 nd rainy season (late August - mid September) in intraseasonal variation. Such a feature is also confirmed in the spatial distribution of oscillation pattern between South and North Korea on the basis of 1996 which is obtained by empirical orthogonal function analysis using the summer rainfall observed in all weather observation stations in South and North Korea. For the decreasing tendency of rainfall in North Korea, it is found that northeasterlies from anticyclonic circulation centered on around Baikal Lake weaken convective activity during summer. On the contrary, the increasing tendency of rainfall in South Korea is related to the strengthened cyclonic circulation in the southern region of China and accordingly, enhances southwesterlies in South Korea.																			1598-3560	2288-3266				JUN	2010	20	2					91	100																WOS:000422546500003

Temporal changes in echo power from all depths were highly correlated, indicating a strong effect from varying amounts of near-surface water. Evaluation of bed reflectivity was corrected for this effect based on the time variation of spatially stable patterns of internal scattering identified using principal component analysis. Hourly time series collected at two fixed locations over the deepest part of two valley cross sections showed no detectable change in bed reflection power (<5%) or phase (<0.05 rad). Reoccupation of fixed locations toward the margins at several-day intervals revealed changes in bed power reflectivity up to 50%, but with no definable relation to lake drainages. Theoretical analyses indicate that changes in reflectivity of <5% from a rock bed constrain basal water thickness changes to centimeter scale or less. Conductive basal till degrades the constraint to decimeter scale or more. Changes in bed reflectivity of 50% indicate probable absence of thick conductive till at such locations, and that the changes were caused by centimeter to decimeter changes in equivalent water thickness.

J	BARTON, BA				BARTON, BA			SPAWNING MIGRATIONS, AGE AND GROWTH, AND SUMMER FEEDING OF WHITE AND LONGNOSE SUCKERS IN AN IRRIGATION RESERVOIR	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												During the upstream spawning migration in spring 1978 of suckers into an irrigation reservoir diversion canal [in Alberta, Canada], the best correlation was between movement and stream temperature .times. discharge. White suckers (C. commersoni) remained in the canal longer than longnose suckers (C. catostomus), and males of both species remained longer than females. The rates of white and longnose suckers returning downstream were 52.4 and 59.2%, respectively, indicating high mortality, possibly from predation during spawning. Minimum age of spawning was 5+ for males and 6+ for females of white suckers, and 4+ for males and 5+ for females of longnose suckers. In the lake, both species approached maturity at age 2 in males and age 3 in females. Annual growth in females was greater than in males after the age of 1st spawning. Cladocerans, mostly Daphnia, were major food items in the reservior during the summer 1977, being 33.7% of white sucker diet and 74.2% of longnose sucker diet over a 4 mo. period. Tendipedidae were more important for white suckers, contributing 21.0% of their food volume compared to 4.7% of food volume in longnose suckers. Feeding selectivity for Daphnia by both sucker species was apparent.																			0008-3550						1980	94	3					300	304																WOS:A1980KF24000009
J	FOY, RH				FOY, RH			PHOSPHORUS INACTIVATION IN A EUTROPHIC LAKE BY THE DIRECT ADDITION OF FERRIC ALUMINUM SULFATE - IMPACT ON IRON AND PHOSPHORUS	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Following addition of ferric aluminum sulphate (FAS) in February 1980 to a eutrophic lake, White Lough, Northern Ireland [UK], the cycles of phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) over 34 months were compared to those in the 18 months preceding the application. 2. During the summer of 1980, P release to the hypolimnion was reduced by 92% compared to 1979 but by 1982 had returned to pre-treatment levels. Phosphorus budget calculations for the post-treatment period indicated that P was accumulating in the sediment at a rate sufficient to permit the recovery of P release. 3. In the three summers following FAS addition, Fe released into the hypolimnion increased by 56-71% compared to 1979 but this increase represented less than 10% of Fe added in the FAS. 4. Prior to FAS treatment, hypolimnetic Fe and P were mixed throughout the lake at overturn, resulting in high winter concentrations, but after treatment, overturn was accompanied by large reductions in the lake Fe and P content due to precipitation. As a result, overwintering P concentrations in 1980/81 and 1981/82 were in the range 31-53 .mu.g Pl-1 compared to 111-194 .mu.g Pl-1 in 1978/79 and 1979/80. 5. The reduction of hypolimnetic P release in 1980 and 1981 and lower overwintering P had little impact on summer epilimnetic P concentrations which for 1979-82 were 51, 36, 47 and 48 .mu.g Pl-1, respectively. Phosphorus concentrations in the epilimnion were raised between April and June in each year by a release of P into the epilimnion. August and September was the only period when reductions in hypolimnetic P were reflected in lower P concentrations in the epilimnion.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1985	15	5					613	629		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1985.tb00232.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1985.tb00232.x													WOS:A1985ASE8000010

First year growth and survival of common carp in two glacial lakes	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Cohorts of common carp, Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, were monitored from hatch through the next spring in two South Dakota, USA lakes to identify factors affecting year-class strength. Hatching occurred over 37- and 47-day periods in the two lakes. Common carp that hatched earlier achieved greater total lengths at the end of the first growing season (Brant Lake: r = -0.84, d.f. = 77, P < 0.001; Campbell Lake: r = -0.87, d.f. = 78, P < 0.001). Mean daily growth rates were approximately 1.0 mm day(-1) and similar between lakes. Total length was positively related to daily growth rate in the two lakes, indicating that members of the cohort that grew faster achieved greater total lengths by time of capture. Hatch date was inversely related to daily growth (fish hatched earlier grew faster) in one lake (r = -0.44, d.f. = 77, P < 0.001) but not the other (r = -0.04, d.f. = 78, P = 0.678), suggesting that length at the end of the growing season can be affected by length of growing season and growth rate. Overwinter survival of age-0 fish appeared to be size dependent because age-1 common carp length-frequency distributions from both lakes comprised only of the larger cohort members present the previous autumn.

Effects of a Personal Narrative in Messages Designed to Promote Healthy Fish Consumption Among Women of Childbearing Age	HEALTH COMMUNICATION												Women of childbearing age (WCBA) can attain health benefits of fish consumption while minimizing risks by following state and federal fish consumption guidelines, but many women avoid fish out of concerns about mercury exposure. This study tested the impact of brochures, informed by communication theory and research, to promote healthy fish consumption among licensed female anglers. We conducted a randomized, two-wave longitudinal experiment between May 2014 and September 2015 among 1,135 women ages 18-48 years (at baseline), drawn from a sample of licensed anglers in the Great Lakes region of the United States. We randomly assigned women to one of five groups, to either be sent one of four brochures in spring 2015 using a two (including a short personal narrative or not) by two (using certain or uncertain language) factorial design, or to a no-exposure control arm. Participants reported their fish consumption in summer 2014 and summer 2015 via an online diary. Exposure to brochure versions that included a short personal narrative helped move women whose baseline levels of fish consumption were furthest from federal recommendations closer to these guidelines; effects were clearest among women confirmed, by self-report or web tracking, to have seen the brochure. Narratives hold promise as a strategy to communicate effectively about the benefits of healthy fish consumption and risks of overconsumption among WCBA, but widespread dissemination may be necessary to achieve these effects.																			1041-0236	1532-7027				JUL 3	2019	34	8					825	837		10.1080/10410236.2018.1437526	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2018.1437526								29482372					WOS:000472051900004

Identifying temporal bottlenecks for the conservation of large-bodied fishes: Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) show highly restricted movement and habitat use over-winter	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												The relationship between species' size and home range size has been well studied. In practice, home range may provide a good surrogate of broad spatial coverage needed for species conservation, however, many species can show restricted movement during critical life stages, such as breeding and over-wintering. This suggests the existence of either a behavioral or habitat mediated `temporal bottleneck,' where restricted or sedentary movement can make populations more susceptible to harm during specific life stages. Here, we study over-winter movement and habitat use of Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), the largest freshwater fish in North America. We monitored over-winter movement of 86 fish using a hydro-acoustic receiver array in the South Saskatchewan River, Canada. Overall, 20 fish remained within our study system throughout the winter. Lake Sturgeon showed strong aggregation and sedentary movement over-winter, demonstrating a temporal bottleneck. Movement was highly restricted during ice-on periods (ranging from 0.9 km/day in November and April to 0.2 km/day in mid-November to mid-March), with Lake Sturgeon seeking deeper, slower pools. We also show that Lake Sturgeon have strong aggregation behavior, where distance to conspecifics decreased (from 575 to 313 m) in preparation for and during ice-on periods. Although the Lake Sturgeon we studied had access to 1100 kilometers of unfragmented riverine habitat, we show that during the over-winter period Lake Sturgeon utilized a single, deep pool (<0.1% of available habitat). The temporal discrepancy between mobile and sedentary behaviors in Lake Sturgeon suggest adaptive management is needed with more localized focus during periods of temporal bottlenecks, even for large-bodied species.

Limnodrilus spp. worms were found down to 33 cm in the sediment but in great numbers in the upper zone in June and October. Worms confined to the top 15 cm of sediment accounted for 53-92% of the total number. There were two annual maxima in population density and biomass, one in late spring (66000 inds m-2, 27 g wet wt m-2) and the other in mid autumn (97 000 inds m-2, 176 g wet wt m-2). Two regression lines describing the effect of temperature on faecal production rate were obtained; Log F = 0.0604 T (.degree.C) - 0.7660 (below 15.degree.C), Log F = 0.0266T - 0.2170 (above 15.degree.C). In total 26.8 kg dry wt m-2 of sediment was defecated annually by Limnodrilus spp. The sediment in the 0-10 cm stratum may pass through the guts of the worms 2.3 times a year. Sedimentation rates in profundal region were very low with respect to the faecal production rates of the tubificids.																			0105-9327					MAR	1987	10	1					8	13																WOS:A1987H170300002

Pelagic zonation of water quality and phytoplankton in the Great Lakes	LIMNOLOGY												Analysis of aquatic ecosystem data collected from large water bodies must consider spatial variations. A suite of pelagic survey stations exists for the Laurentian Great Lakes, but little is known about their redundancy. We present a strategy to delineate the lakes into zones based on water quality and phytoplankton biovolume. Water samples were collected from 72 sites in two seasons (spring and summer) from 2007 to 2010 in all five lakes. Integrated samples were analyzed for phytoplankton biovolume and nine water quality parameters. We conducted cluster analysis, principal components analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling methods for water quality and phytoplankton taxon-specific biovolume for the Great Lakes basin and for each lake separately. There were significant lake-to-lake differences, and based on lake-specific analyses, Lake Superior, Lake Michigan and Lake Erie were each divided into three zones; Lake Huron and Lake Ontario were each grouped into two zones. The zones identified by water quality and phytoplankton provide an understanding of spatial distributions for evaluating monitoring data.					; Cai, Meijun/OKT-2059-2025	Cai, Meijun/0000-0001-5081-131X; Reavie, Euan/0000-0001-8871-5809													1439-8621	1439-863X				JAN	2018	19	1					127	140		10.1007/s10201-017-0526-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-017-0526-y													WOS:000418965400012

Influence of surface water on coarse resolution C-band backscatter: Implications for freeze/thaw retrieval from scatterometer data	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												The freeze/thaw state of permafrost landscapes is an essential variable for monitoring ecological, hydrological and climate processes. Ground surface state can be obtained from satellite data through time series analysis of C-band backscatter from scatterometer and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations. Scatterometer data has been used in a variety of studies concerning freeze/thaw retrieval of the land surface. Coarse spatial resolution scatterometer data has great potential for application in this field due to its high temporal resolution (approx. daily observations). In this study, we investigate the influence of sub-grid cell (12.5 km) surface water (ice free and ice covered) on freeze/thaw retrieval based on ASCAT data using a threshold algorithm. We found discrepancies related to the surface water fraction in the detected timing of thawing and freezing of up to 2 days earlier thawing for spring and 3.5 days earlier freezing for autumn for open water fractions of 40% resulting in an overestimation of the frozen season.

A total of 278 clones were obtained. The actinobacterial communities in the Tibetan hot springs were diverse, and most of the retrieved clones were affiliated with Actinobacteridae, Acidimicrobidae, and unclassified Actinobacteria. The Actinobacteridae sequences were distributed into seven suborders (e.g., Frankineae, Corynebacterineae, Micromonosporineae, Pseudonocardineae, Propionibacterineae, Micrococcineae, and Actinomycineae) and unclassified Actinobacteridae. The actinobacterial composition varied among different hot springs. Statistical analysis showed that the actinobacterial diversity in the investigated Tibetan hot springs was not significantly correlated with temperature, suggesting that temperature is not a key factor in shaping the actinobacterial diversity in hot springs.					fang, bin/MSW-9286-2025; Zhang, Chuanlun/U-8181-2017; Jiang, Hongchen/Y-9471-2018	Dong, Hailiang/0000-0002-7468-1350; Jiang, Hongchen/0000-0003-1271-7028													0149-0451	1521-0529					2012	29	6					520	527		10.1080/01490451.2011.590872	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2011.590872													WOS:000303591100003

Semiannual measurements from 1991 to 1994 of dust deposition rates (dust flux) and composition 2 m above the ground at seven sites in Owens Valley show that (I) dust in Owens Valley is derived mainly from the playa, although areas closer to the sites can also be sources; (2) south of the playa, dust flux is higher in the winter than in the summer, but north of the playa, dust flux is about the same or slightly lower in the winter; (3) on the playa, interannual variation in dust flux is large (factors of 5-10 during the 3 years), but at downwind sites, the variation is much smaller; (4) the dust typically has total soluble salt content as high as 30%, generally much higher than that of dust elsewhere in southern Nevada and California; and (5) to a distance of at least 40 km south of the playa, soluble salt flux is significantly higher than regional rates. The dust flux measurements indicate that significant quantities of salt-rich dust are probably being added to the soils in the region around Owens Lake playa; these dust additions may affect soil pH and vegetation.																			2169-897X					NOV 27	1997	102	D22					25999	26008		10.1029/97JD01967	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/97JD01967													WOS:A1997YH59300023

Use of a small, intermittently-open estuary by waterbirds: a case study of the East Kleinemonde Estuary, Eastern Cape, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Little is known of the use and importance of South African small, intermittently-open estuaries to waterbirds. Waterbird activities were monitored in a section of the East Kleinemonde Estuary on the south-east coast of South Africa from June 2004 to May 2005. Counts along the whole estuary were conducted approximately weekly from March 2005 to November 2006, and numbers were related to daily water level measurements. The estuary was used mainly for roosting and maintenance (81% of all records), the majority of which was by wading piscivores (50%). Herbivores were largely absent in summer, when submerged macrophyte cover was zero. There was a significant difference in activity patterns between summer and winter for all feeding guilds except aerial diving piscivores. Most birds probably overnighted elsewhere. Pursuit-swimming piscivore numbers increased and wading and aerial-diving piscivores decreased with rising water levels. This study showed that intermittently-open estuaries are primarily utilised by resident piscivorous birds and are an important habitat, not only for feeding, but also for resting purposes. Changes in water level affected feeding guilds differently by changing habitat availability.

Moving forward: how best to use the results of waterbird monitoring and telemetry studies to safeguard the future of Far East Asian Anatidae species	WILDFOWL												This special issue of Wildfowl has summarised our knowledge of the biogeographical populations of ten key Anatidae species in East Asia, their current and recent estimated abundance and distributions, their migration routes and movements, and sites of importance to these populations at key stages of their annual cycles. The analysis was possible only through the active cooperation of the many biologists and site managers involved in studies of these species in different countries participating in a collaborative programme of monitoring, research and analysis. Development of new telemetry and bio-logging technology has played a key role in our ability to describe linkages between the breeding, moulting, staging and wintering areas used by individual waterbirds. Compilation of movement data recorded for tracked individuals of each species has provided initial information on flyway delineation and range definition, which forms the basis for future identification of biogeographical populations. Additionally, the tracking data have identified critical stopover and wintering sites for the different species which, when overlaid upon site protection boundaries, has enabled a preliminary appraisal of the effectiveness of current site safeguarded networks in providing adequate protection for waterbird populations along their flyways. Synthesis and analysis of new count data has permitted a description of recent population trends and a reassessment of their current size, together with recommendations for improving population monitoring into the future. High rates of utilisation of farmland habitats during staging periods within China, especially during spring migration, contrast with low levels of winter use, when most species are largely confined to natural habitats. We discuss the significance of these facets of habitat use and the need for improved study of feeding ecology throughout the non-breeding periods, to determine optimal land management and thus inform their conservation requirements at different times of year. Finally, we consider the way forward, with a view to maintaining and building on the impressive international collaboration established to date, in order to ensure that these long distance migratory waterbirds are safeguarded for future generations.

We aimed to detect human adenovirus (HAdV) in the Wadi Hanifah (WH) and Wadi Namar (WN) lakes, King Saud University wastewater treatment plant (KSU-WWTP), Manfouha-WWTP, irrigation water (IW), and AnNazim landfill (ANLF) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. HAdV hexon sequences were analyzed against 71 HAdV prototypes and investigated for seasonal influence. ANLF had the highest HAdV prevalence (83.3%). Remarkably, the F species of HAdV, especially serotype 41, predominated. Daily temperature ranges (22-45 degrees C and 10-33 degrees C) influenced the significance of the differences between the locations. The most significant relationship of ANLF and IW to WH and KSU-WWTP was found at the high-temperature range (p = 0.001). Meanwhile, WN was most correlated to ANLF at the low-temperature range (p < 0.0001). Seasonal influences on HAdV prevalence were insignificant despite HAdV's high prevalence in autumn and winter months, favoring low temperatures (high: 22-25 degrees C, low: 14-17 degrees C) at five out of six locations. Our study provides insightful information on HAdV prevalence and the circulating strains that can address the knowledge gap in the environmental impacts of viruses and help control viral diseases in public health management.					; Nour, Islam/LZH-6548-2025; AL-ASHKAR, IBRAHIM/AAN-9858-2020; Zakri, Adel/HCH-9926-2022	Nour, Islam/0000-0002-6661-0982; AL-ASHKAR, IBRAHIM/0000-0001-5022-1555; Alhetheel, Abdulkarim/0000-0001-9257-1385; 														1660-4601				MAY	2021	18	9							4773	10.3390/ijerph18094773	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18094773								33947135					WOS:000650279300001

To assess their effects on coastal ecosystems, the scope and extent of their impacts must be understood. We aimed to quantitatively assess the SST increases caused by thermal discharge under climate warming by comparing SSTs between control and test groups and among different offshore buffer zones based on daily MODIS SST data from 2002 to 2017. The results showed that (1) a good correlation occurred between the CNATPP installed capacity and SST increase in the 0-2 km offshore waters; (2) the SST increase caused by thermal discharge was the largest in summer and the smallest in winter; and (3) the effect of thermal discharge occurred within 2 km offshore when the installed capacity exceeded 2000 MW and extended to 5 km when it reaches more than 4000 MW.

Spring Mill Lake is a man-made reservoir built in the late 1930s and is located in Spring Mill State Park. Within the park, ground water from subsurface conduits issues as natural springs and then flows in surface streams to Spring Mill Lake. Waters flowing from the springs in the park were analyzed to determine potential nonpoint-source contaminants entering Spring Mill Lake from 1998 to 2002. For this project, data-collecting sites were selected within the several subwatersheds of the Spring Mill Lake watershed, including the springs discharging from Donaldson Cave, Hamer Cave, Upper Twin Cave, Whistling Cave, Wind Cave, and the Rubble site. This paper reports on Escherichia coli concentrations and ambient water quality parameters of the springs, a stream, and the lake within Spring Mill State Park. Water samples for the analysis of K coli were collected at the monitoring sites once during each quarter from August 1998 through February 2002. Ambient water-quality measurements were taken quarterly at the monitoring sites from August 1998 through May 2000. E. coli concentrations from the monitoring sites within the Spring Mill Lake watershed varied greatly from concentrations below the detection limit, <1 most probable number (MPN) of organisms per 100 milliliters (mL) of water, to 980,000 MPN/100 mL. K coli appears to be a potential health risk at several of the springs within the park, particularly at the spring at the Rubble site.																					0-7844-0698-7				2003		122					309	320																WOS:000222363700028

Using multiple gears to assess acoustic detectability and biomass of fish species in Lake Superior	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Recent predator demand and prey supply studies suggest that an annual daytime bottom trawl survey of Lake Superior underestimates prey fish biomass. A multiple-gear (acoustics, bottom trawl, and midwater trawl) nighttime survey has been recommended, but before abandoning a long-term daytime survey the effectiveness of night sampling of important prey species must be verified. We sampled three bottom depths (30, 60, and 120 m) at a Lake Superior site where the fish community included all commercially and ecologically important species. Day and night samples were collected within 48 h at all depths during eight different periods (one new and one full moon period during both early summer and late summer to early fall over 2 years). Biomass of demersal and benthic species was higher in night bottom trawl samples than in day bottom trawl samples. Night acoustic collections showed that pelagic fish typically occupied water cooler than 15 degrees C and light levels less than 0.001 1x. Using biomass in night bottom trawls and acoustic biomass above the bottom trawl path, we calculated an index of acoustic detectability for each species. Ciscoes Coregonus artedi, kiyis C. kiyi, and rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax left the bottom at night, whereas bloaters C. hoyi stayed nearer the bottom. We compared the biomass of important prey species estimated with two survey types: day bottom trawls and night estimates of the entire water column (bottom trawl biomass plus acoustic biomass). The biomass of large ciscoes (> 200 mm) was significantly greater when measured at night than when measured during daylight, but the differences for other sizes of important species did not vary significantly by survey type. Nighttime of late summer is a period when conditions for biomass estimation are largely invariant, and all important prey species can be sampled using a multiple-gear approach.

The euphotic zone of dimictic, meso-oligotrophic Castle Lake [California, USA] is characterized by a rapid depletion of nitrate and ammonium soon after spring thaw. External inputs of N are minimal during this period and levels of inorganic N remain low until fall overturn. The rate of ammonium assimilation was high relative to nitrate assimilation and was significantly correlated with the rate of ammonium regeneration. The importance of this rapid turnover of N to phytoplankton growth is consistent with the results of previous Castle Lake studies and with the current conceptual model of primary production in the mixed layer of N-deficient marine ecosystems.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1981	62	2					345	354		10.2307/1936709	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1936709													WOS:A1981LS18800008

Thermal habitat use and juvenile growth of Svalbard Arctic charr: evidence from otolith stable oxygen isotope analyses	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Stable oxygen isotopes (d18O) derived from otoliths were used to estimate mean annual water temperatures experienced by individual Svalbard Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (L.), during their first four growth seasons. The analysed Arctic charr experienced a high variety of temperatures, indicating the use of different thermal habitats. A higher proportion of the juveniles experienced warmer temperatures during their first summer compared with later summers, suggesting the selective use of the shallowest littoral areas of the lake. Although the estimated temperatures were consistent with water temperatures found in High Arctic rivers and lakes during summer, they did not represent the annual variation in air temperature registered over the 20 years of otolith measurement. Furthermore, summer otolith increment width did not correlate with the experienced temperature. However, after the second year, otolith increment width was highly dependent on increment width during the previous summer. This study estimated mean summer water temperatures experienced by individual Arctic charr during the first four growth seasons providing additional evidence that stable oxygen isotope analysis can be used to provide insight into the thermal habitat use by juvenile Arctic charr.					; Svenning, Martin/JGT-7784-2023	Godiksen, Jane Aanestad/0000-0001-5491-2433; 													0906-6691	1600-0633				JAN	2012	21	1					134	144		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00533.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2011.00533.x													WOS:000297634700013

Basic physical parameters in the lake-air interaction processes, such as surface albedo of the lake, aerodynamic roughness length, bulk transfer coefficients, etc., were investigated using the EC data in 2012. The characteristics of turbulence fluxes over the lake including momentum flux, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, and CO2 flux, and their controlling factors were analyzed. The total annual evaporation of the lake was also estimated based on the artificial neural network (ANN) gap-filling technique. Results showed that the total annual evaporation in 2012 was 1165 +/- 15 mm, which was larger than the annual precipitation (818 mm). Local circulation between the lake and the surrounding land was found to be significant throughout the year due to the land-lake breeze or the mountain-valley breeze in this area. The prevailing winds of southeasterly and northwesterly were observed throughout the year. The sensible heat flux over this plateau lake usually had a few tens of W m(-2), and generally became negative in the afternoon, indicating that heat was transferred from the lake to the atmosphere. The sensible heat flux was governed by the lake-air temperature difference and had its maximum in the early morning. The diurnal variation of the latent heat flux was controlled by vapor pressure deficit with a peak in the afternoon. The latent heat flux was dominant in the partition of available energy in daytime over this lake. The lake acted as a weak CO2 source to the atmosphere except for the midday of summer. Seasonal variations of surface albedo over the lake were related to the solar elevation angle and opacity of the water. Furthermore, compared with the observation data, the surface albedo estimated by CLM4-LISSS model was underestimated in winter and overestimated in summer.					; Wang, Lei/A-7836-2018; Liu, Huizhi/AAH-6107-2020	Xu, Anlun/0000-0003-1966-4627; 													1674-7313	1869-1897				MAR	2015	58	3					317	328		10.1007/s11430-014-4828-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-014-4828-1													WOS:000349767600001

According to the Droop cell-quota model it is possible for algae to exhibit this chemical composition while growing slowly because of light limitation. This is demonstrated by the results of an experiment with the haptophyte Pavlova lutheri in continuous culture, and by observations made on natural populations of phytoplankton: the blue-green alga Oscillatoria bourrellyi in the freshwater English [UK] lake, Windermere in summer; and a spring bloom dominated by the diatom Skeletonema costatum in the Scottish sea-loch Creran.

Major and trace element geochemistry of neutral and acidic thermal springs at El Chichon volcano, Mexico Implications for monitoring of the volcanic activity	JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH												Four groups of thermal springs with temperatures from 50 to 80 degrees C are located on the S-SW-W slopes of El Chichon volcano, a composite dome-tephra edifice, which exploded in 1982 with a 1 km wide, 160 m deep crater left. Very dynamic thermal activity inside the crater (variations in chemistry and migration of pools and fumaroles, drastic changes in the crater lake volume and chemistry) contrasts with the stable behavior of the flank hot springs during the time of observations (1974-2005). All known groups of hot springs are located on the contact of the basement and volcanic edifice, and only on the W-SW-S slopes of the volcano at almost same elevations 600-650 m asl and less than 3 km of direct distance from the crater. Three groups of near-neutral (pH approximate to 6) springs at SW-S slopes have the total thermal water outflow rate higher than 300 I/s and are similar in composition. The fourth and farthest group on the western slope discharges acidic (pH approximate to 2)saline (10 g/kg of CI) water with a much lower outflow rate (< 10 I/s). Water-rock interaction modeling of main types of the El Chichon thermal waters using regular log Q/K graphs (saturation indices vs temperature) showed maximum equilibrium temperature slightly higher than 200 degrees C. Acidic waters are equilibrated with some clay minerals at about 120 degrees C. Three main sources of the salinity of thermal water are suggested on the basis of mixing plots and isotopic data: a magmatic source for CO2, boron, sulfur and a limited part of Cl; volcanic rock source for the major cations and trace elements: the oil-bearing evaporitic basement source (oil-field brine?) for NaCl, Br, a part of Ca and some trace elements. All flank thermal springs end up in the river Rio Magdalena that has a variable seasonal flow rates from 4 to 20 m(3)/s. Any changes in the chemistry of springs must notably change the composition of the streams draining hot springs and eventually, Rio Magdalena. A monthly geochemical monitoring of Rio Magdalena and streams draining main hot springs would be a useful tool for surveying the activity of the volcano. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We grew two single-bacterial strains from different lifestyles, the copiotrophic Photobacterium angustum and the oligotrophic Sphingopyxis alaskensis, and natural HP communities collected in fall and spring from the Mediterranean Sea, on glucose under two treatments: P-replete versus P-limiting. DOM release by HP comprised up to 30% of the initial carbon provided for growth. P-availability influenced carbon allocation to different cellular processes (respiration vs. growth), but did not significantly affect the net quantity of DOM released by HP. However, using fluorescence spectroscopy, we demonstrated an effect of P-limitation on DOM quality, with a predominance of humic-like compounds under P-limitation but protein-like compounds under P-repletion. Our results suggest that P-limitation could determine the fate of HP-derived DOM in the ocean, thus affecting the microbial carbon pump.

Reconstructing paleohydrology in the northwest Great Basin since the last deglaciation using Paisley Caves fish remains (Oregon, USA)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The arid northwest Great Basin underwent substantial hydroclimate changes in the past 15,000 years, greatly affecting its desert ecosystems and prehistoric people. There are conflicting interpretations of the timing of hydrologic changes in this region, requiring more records to resolve the dominant climatic drivers. The Paisley Caves archaeological site, located near former pluvial Lake Chewaucan, contains well dated, stratified sediments best known for evidence of early human occupation in North America. We present a novel paleohydrologic record for the Chewaucan basin based on the frequency of fish remains (Salmonidae and Cypriniformes, likely tui chub) and their carbon, oxygen, and strontium isotope compositions, from the Paisley Caves. Cypriniformes abundance peaks first at the start of the B & oslash;lling/Aller & oslash;d warm interval (-14.7 ka) and again during the early Younger Dryas (-12.8 ka). Isotope compositions indicate tui chub were derived from an expansive Lake Chewaucan throughout the B & oslash;lling/Aller & oslash;d, but mainly from spring-or stream-influenced sources by the late Younger Dryas to the present. Fish abundance dropped sharply through the Younger Dryas and early Holocene, when isotope compositions indicate a mix of habitats. Isotope compositions indicate the driest conditions during the middle Holocene, followed by slightly wetter conditions up to the present. This record agrees with recent pluvial lake reconstructions, supporting the hypothesis that a northward shift in the winter storm track supported deep lakes throughout the B & oslash;lling/Aller & oslash;d in the northwest Great Basin. Lake level decline during the Younger Dryas suggests drying climate, differing from more southerly records. During the Holocene, however, shifts in Chewaucan basin hydrology are consistent with the rest of the western U.S. This highlights the need for region-specific records to inform predictions of the hydrologic impact of climate change on arid regions.

Insights into the transfer of silicon isotopes into the sediment record	BIOGEOSCIENCES												The first delta Si-30(diatom) data from lacustrine sediment traps are presented from Lake Baikal, Siberia. Data are compared with March surface water (upper 180 m) delta Si-30(DSi) compositions for which a mean value of + 2.28 parts per thousand +/- 0.09 (95% confidence) is derived. This value acts as the pre-diatom bloom baseline silicic acid isotopic composition of waters (delta Si-30(DSi) (initial)). Open traps were deployed along the depth of the Lake Baikal south basin water column between 2012 and 2013. Diatom assemblages display a dominance (> 85 %) of the spring/summer bloom species Synedra acus var radians, so that delta Si-30(diatom) compositions reflect predominantly spring/summer bloom utilisation. Diatoms were isolated from open traps and, in addition, from 3-monthly (sequencing) traps (May, July and August 2012) for delta Si-30(diatom) analyses. Mean delta Si-30(diatom) values for open traps are + 1.23 parts per thousand +/- 0.06 (at 95% confidence and MSWD of 2.9, n = 10). Total dry mass sediment fluxes are highest in June 2012, which we attribute to the initial export of the dominant spring diatom bloom. We therefore argue that May delta Si-30(diatom) signatures (+ 0.67% +/- 0.06; 2 sigma) when compared with mean upper water delta Si-30(DSi) initial (e.g. pre-bloom) signatures can be used to provide a snapshot estimation of diatom epsilon(uptake) fractionation factors (epsilon(uptake)) in Lake Baikal. A epsilon(uptake) estimation of -1.61% is therefore derived, although we emphasise that synchronous monthly delta Si-30(DSi) and delta Si-30(diatom) data would be needed to provide more robust estimations and therefore more rigorously test this, particularly when taking into consideration any progressive enrichment of the DSi pool as blooms persist. The near-constant delta Si-30(diatom) composition in open traps demonstrates the full preservation of the signal through the water column and thereby justifies the use and application of the technique in biogeochemical and palaeoenvironmental research. Data are finally compared with lake sediment core samples, collected from the south basin. Values of + 1.30 parts per thousand +/- 0.08 (2 sigma) and + 1.43% +/- 0.13 (2 sigma) were derived for cores BAIK13-1C (0.6-0.8 cm core depth) and at BAIK13-4F (0.2-0.4 cm core depth) respectively. Trap data highlight the absence of a fractionation factor associated with diatom dissolution (epsilon(dissolution)) (particularly as Synedra acus var radians, the dominant taxa in the traps, is very susceptible to dissolution) down the water column and in the lake surface sediments, thus validating the application of delta Si-30(diatom) analyses in Lake Baikal and other freshwater systems, in palaeoreconstructions.					; Swann, George/B-2794-2011; Vologina, Elena/A-6414-2014	STURM, MICHAEL/0000-0003-2414-7894; Panizzo, Virginia/0000-0002-3411-9945; Swann, George/0000-0002-4750-9504; Horstwood, Matthew/0000-0003-4200-8193; 													1726-4170	1726-4189					2016	13	1					147	157		10.5194/bg-13-147-2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/bg-13-147-2016													WOS:000369524000010

A Study of the Meteorological Conditions Associated with Anomalously Early and Late Openings of a Northwest Territories Winter Road	ARCTIC												In the Canadian Arctic, winter roads are engineered across the frozen land, rivers, and lakes. The strength and longevity of these roads depend on particular weather conditions. Our research focuses on the winter road between Tulita and Norman Wells, Northwest Territories, which has been maintained officially by the territorial government since 1982. Statistical analysis of the opening dates for the winter road showed five seasons with extremely early dates and five with extremely late dates. The extremely early-opening seasons are distinguished by anomalously high sea-level pressures, anomalously cold tropospheric air, and northwesterly surface winds during the November prior to the road opening. The extremely late-opening seasons are characterized by an anomalously strong Aleutian low in the preceding November. The extremely late-opening years are correlated with strong El Nino seasons, whereas the extremely early-opening years are not systematically associated with teleconnection patterns. Our analysis of meteorological conditions near Norman Wells, associated with the extreme Opening dates for this winter road, may provide planners with more precise information germane to this road construction.

A re-evaluation and spatial analysis of evidence for a Younger Dryas climatic reversal in Beringia	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												An objective classification of paleoclimatic proxies from 75 lake and peat records is used to re-evaluate data quality and inferred climatic patterns in Beringia during the Younger Dryas. Mapped data reveal coherent but spatially-complex regional patterns, suggesting the Younger Dryas was characterized by: (1) cooling in Southern Alaska, Eastern Siberia, and portions of Northeastern Siberia; and (2) uniform to warmer-than-present conditions through most of Central Alaska, Northeastern Siberia, and possibly the Russian Far East and Northern Alaska. The Beringian patterns correspond to distinctive large-scale climatic forcings, although in some locations further modified by more local influences, such as topography. General circulation models and modern synoptic climatology provide a conceptual framework for exploring possible mechanisms responsible for the observed changes. Forcings and associated climatic responses consistent with the proxy data include: (1) lowered sea-surface temperatures in the North Atlantic and Pacific reducing temperature and precipitation in Eastern Siberia; (2) intensified Aleutian low and lowered sea-surface temperatures causing cooler summers and higher winter precipitation in Southern Alaska; (3) stronger Pacific Subtropical High and an eastward shift of the East Asian Trough reducing summer temperatures in Southern Alaska and causing relative warmth in Northeastern Siberia; and (4) strong high pressure system producing warm, dry conditions in interior Alaska.

Sedimentology, paleontology and geochemistry	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We have obtained a detailed paleoenvironmental record in the Summer Lake Basin, Oregon (northwestern Great Basin, US) spanning from 250ka-5 ka. This record is derived from core and outcrop sites extending from a proximal deltaic setting to near the modern depocenter. Lithostratigraphic, paleontologic (ostracodes and pollen) and geochemical indicators all provide evidence for hydroclimate and climate change over the study interval. Lithostratigraphic analysis of the Summer Lake deposits allows subdivision into a series of unconformity - or paraconformity-bound lithosomes. The unconformity and facies histories indicate that the lake underwent several major lake-level excursions through the Middle and Late Pleistocene. High stands occurred between 200 and 165 ka, between 89 and 50 ka and between 25 and 13 ka. Uppermost Pleistocene and Holocene sediments have been removed by deflation of the basin, with the exception of a thin veneer of late Holocene sediment. These high stands correspond closely with Marine Oxygen Isotope Stages 6, 4 and 2, within the margin of error associated with the Summer Lake age model. A major unconformity from 158 ka until 102 ka (duration varies between sites) interrupts the record at both core and outcrop sites. Lake level fluctuations, in turn are closely linked with TOC and salinity fluctuations, such that periods of lake high stands correlate with periods of relatively low productivity, fresher water and increased water inflow/evaporation ratios. Paleotemperature estimates based on palynology and geochemistry (Mg/Ca ratios in ostracodes) indicate an overall decrease in temperature from 236 ka-165 ka, with a brief interlude of warming and drying immediately after this (prior to the major unconformity). This temperature decrease was superimposed on higher frequency variations in temperature that are not evident in the sediments deposited during the past 100 ka. Indicators disagree about temperatures immediately following the unconformity (102-95 ka), but most suggest warmer temperatures between 100-89 ka, followed by a rapid and dramatic cooling event. Cooler conditions persisted throughout most of the remainder of the Pleistocene at Summer Lake, with the possible exception of brief warm intervals about 27-23 ka. Paleotemperature estimates for the proximal deltaic site are more erratic than for more distal sites, indicative of short term air temperature excursions that are buffered in deeper water. Estimates of paleotemperature from Mg/Ca ratios are generally in good agreement with evidence from upland palynology. However, there is a significant discordance between the upland pollen record and lake indicators with respect to paleoprecipitation for some parts of the record. Several possibilities may explain this discordance. We favor a direct link between lake level and salinity fluctuations and climate change, but we also recognize the possibility that some of these hydroclimate changes in the Summer Lake record may have resulted from episodic drainage captures of the Chewaucan River between the Summer Lake and Lake Abert basins.																			0921-2728					AUG	2000	24	2					151	182		10.1023/A:1008165326401	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008165326401													WOS:000088036400003

However, there is rather limited knowledge on heavy metal accumulation of micro algal species in their natural habitats. In this study, some heavy metal loads absorbed by C. glomerata which shows intensive population in late spring and early summer in the littoral zone of the Lake Hazar, which is a relatively oligotrophic, and has a high alkaline level, were investigated. Obtained data were compared with heavy metal loads of the water. Levels of heavy metals in the algae were found as 1,31-1,77 mg/g- C. glomerata for Cupper (Cu), 58,5-218 mg/g- C. glomerata for Iron (Fe), 2,75-4,99 mg/g- C. glomerata for Manganese (Mn) and 9,61-11,8 mg/g- C. glomerata for Zinc (Zn). In conclusion, C. glomerata absorbs some heavy metals which are dangerous for human health. Therefore, this species has a potential to be use as bio-absorbent in waste water treatments.

Metal accumulation in fish from different zones of a large, shallow freshwater lake	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												Metal (Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Mn, Cu, and Zn) concentrations in different fish species sampled from two distinct (phytoplankton- and macrophyte-dominated) lake zones of a large, shallow freshwater lake, Taihu Lake, were investigated. Concentrations of most metals in muscle of the small-sized fish (Protosalanx hyalocranius, Pseudorasbora parva, and Rhodeus ocellatus) were always significantly higher than those of the large-sized (Carassius auratus, Cyprinus carpio, and Aristichthys nobilis) and carnivorous fish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco, Cultrichthys erythropterus, and Erythroculter ilishaeformis). Metal accumulation in the small-sized fish from the phytoplankton-dominated lake zone was always greater than those from the macrophyte-dominated lake zone in summer. However, no significant differences were observed between the two lake zones for most metals in the small-sized fish collected in winter. Metal accumulation in gills, liver, and intestine of the large-sized fish from the phytoplankton-dominated lake zone was generally greater than those from the macrophyte-dominated lake zone in summer. The presence of distinct ecological regions in the lake might affect the metal distribution in the small-sized or large-sized fish. For the carnivorous fish, however, metal concentrations in fish tissues from the two different lake zones were not significantly different, suggesting that metal accumulation in carnivorous fish might be less influenced by the ecological status of the lake.

The water column supported a small phytoplankton community limited by temperature, nutrient availability and, seasonally, by low photosynthetically active radiation. Chlorophyll a concentrations were consistently low (< 1 mu g l(-1)) and showed no obvious seasonal patterns. Production rates were low, ranging from non-detectable to 0.56 mu g C l(-1) h(-1) with highest rates generally occurring towards the end of the austral winter and in spring. The pattern of carbon fixation indicated that the phytoplankton was adapted to low light levels. Chlorophyll a specific photosynthetic rates (assimilation numbers) ranged fi-om non-detectable to 1.27 mu gC (mu g chlorophyll a)(-1)h(-1). Partitioning of photosynthetic products revealed carbon incorporation principally into storage products such as lipids at high light fluxes with increasing protein synthesis at depth. With little allochthonous input the data suggest that lake dynamics in this Antarctic system are driven by phytoplankton activity.																			0722-4060					DEC	1997	18	6					363	370		10.1007/s003000050201	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s003000050201													WOS:A1997YJ51000001

A high-resolution multi-proxy lake record of Holocene environmental change in southern Iceland	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Vestra Gislholtsvatn, a non-glacial lake in southern Iceland, provides a continuous high-resolution multi-proxy paleoenvironmental record spanning more than 10 ka. It is characterized by an interplay between volcanic and climatic controls on the lake sediment environmental proxies. Initial lake ontogeny was disrupted by deposition of the Saksunarvatn tephra (approximate to 10.3 ka) followed by unusually slow ontogeny for 2 ka. Principal component analysis defines three climate zones between 8 and 1 ka. Quasi-stabilization and warm summer proxies between approximate to 8 and 5.7 ka define Holocene Thermal Maximum conditions. A subtle shift to cooler summers between approximate to 5.7 and approximate to 4.2 ka is interpreted as early Neoglaciation, intensifying after 4.2 ka. Following settlement of Iceland (approximate to 1.1 ka) anthropogenic signals overprint the climate record. Throughout the record short-term variability is attributed to tephra fall events in the catchment from nearby explosive volcanism, whereas centennial- and millennial-scale changes are attributed to climate. When compared with other Icelandic lakes, environmental proxies from Vestra Gislholtsvatn indicate less variability albeit similar timing of environmental change, suggesting a relatively stable flow of the Irminger Current along the south coast of Iceland compared with a more variable flow of warm Atlantic surface water along the western and northern coasts of Iceland after 8 ka.

Implementation of green and blue infrastructures can help alleviate urban overheat, especially during warm seasons. However, current studies scarcely considered the heterogeneity of water cooling effect, thus the planning strategies may not be consistent for a variety of situations. This study investigated the water cooling heterogeneity by three main aspects: waterbody, littoral zone, and background climate. The results confirmed the existence of the heterogeneity of water cooling effect, among three lake size groups, six littoral landscapes types and three warm seasons. Firstly, larger lakes presented lower WST (water surface temperature) and higher WCD (water cooling distance) than smaller lakes. Secondly, the Compact lowrise showed the highest mean temperature and lowest cooling distance in littoral areas among six landscapes. Threshold value of efficiency (TVoE) of WCD was much higher than that of WCI. Thirdly, summer period presented the greatest average WCI (water cooling intensity) for all lakes size groups, while spring had the highest average WCD for large and medium lakes. Given the revealed heterogeneity of water cooling effect in three aspects, this study proposed some specific strategies in urban planning for cooler cities.

These originated from the Middle to Upper Palaeozoic marble formations that overly low-permeability Lower Paleozoic basement schists. Pliocene lake sediments and younger alluvial sediments act as confining layers and contain low volume confined aquifers in their coarser materials to the east of the springs. These springs appear at the boundary of the confining units and along faults and fractures near the town of Orhangazi. Dye tracer experiments at Nadir Spring show that the source of water for Nadir spring is from a different direction than the other two springs, although the chemistry of the water for all three springs is similar. The effects of the Marmara 17 August 1999 Earthquake were relatively minor although temporary changes in flow and turbidity occurred almost immediately after the earthquake. Possible long-term changes may have occurred at a Keramet Hot Spring located approximately 15 km from northeast of Orhangazi, but this spring is not used for water supply. The aquifer that provides most of the water for Orhangazi is highly karstic in nature and has the potential for contamination in the recharge areas and along much of the flow path to the spring. Because of this potential for contamination, the recharge areas of the spring waters should be protected from degradation by uncontrolled land use. In addition, Ilipinar spring has great potential to contribute toward a solution for the chronic water supply problems in Orhangazi and nearby coastal towns.					; pasvanoglu, suzan/GXF-0587-2022; Rosen, Michael/D-6091-2015	pasvanoglu, Suzan/0000-0002-0026-9259; Rosen, Michael/0000-0003-3991-0522													0016-7622					MAR	2004	63	3					313	322																WOS:000220051000008

In addition, the summer (July) precipitation increment, effective precipitation, and monsoon strength index have been obtained from numerical modeling experiments. Both geological data and numerical modeling indicate that the Holocene optimum, as defined by peak East Asian summer monsoon precipitation, was asynchronous in central and eastern China, reaching a maximum at different times in different regions, e.g., ca. 10,000-8000 yr ago in northeastern China, 10,000-7000 yr ago in north-central and northern east-central China, ca. 7000-5000 yr ago in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and ca. 3000 yr ago in southern China. In southwestern China the maximum appeared ca. 11,000 yr ago, but probably was related to the maximum landward extension of the Indian summer monsoon. The regional shift in the maximum precipitation belt from northwest to southeast over the past 10,000 yr is interpreted as a response to changing seasonality related to orbital forcing of the climate. The southeastward shift of the East Asian summer monsoon maximum is consistent with the progressive weakening of the summer monsoon as the summer solar radiation anomaly decreased progressively through the Holocene and the East Asian monsoon index declined, while the early maximum in southwestern China matches the maximum of the Indian monsoon index.

We related Cladocera from surface sediments of Alpine lakes (1,502-2,309 m asl) to 29 abiotic environmental variables using statistical methods. The environmental dataset included water chemistry, lake depth, and bi-hourly water-temperature logs, which were used to assess mean monthly water temperatures, dates of freezing and breakup, spring and autumn mixing. We found 14 different Cladocera of the families Bosminidae, Daphniidae, and Chydoridae. Lakes without Cladocera (eight lakes) were cold and/or ultra-oligotrophic, whereas lakes with planktonic and littoral Cladocera (19 lakes) were warmer and/or less oligotrophic. Lakes with only littoral Cladocera (18 lakes) had intermediate water temperatures/trophy. Changes in Cladocera assemblages were related to changes in climate, nutrients, and/or alkalinity. We found a climate threshold at which Bosminidae disappeared in 95% of the lakes. For climate-change research, we propose studying Cladocera along transects that include climatic thresholds.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	2007	594						33	46		10.1007/s10750-007-9083-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9083-4													WOS:000250407500004
J	Salmaso, N; Decet, F				Salmaso, N; Decet, F			Interactions of physical, chemical and biological processes affecting the seasonality of mineral composition and nutrient cycling in the water column of a deep subalpine lake (Lake Garda, Northern Italy)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Causes for temporal variations and depth distribution of major ions and algal nutrients in the water column of the deep (Z(max) = 350 m) and large (49 km(3)) oligo-mesotrophic subalpine Lake Garda (Northern Italy) were investigated through monthly samplings from December 1994 to December 1996. The time course of vertical chemical gradients is mainly determined by the balance between algal activity and mineralisation and by the extent of vertical mixing in spring. The increase in calcite saturation (Ohm-values up to 9) due to algal CO(2) depletion and higher temperatures beginning in late spring is followed by a shift of about two months in triggering of CaCO(3) precipitation. Calcite saturation in the hypolimnion is near CaCO(3) solubility equilibrium (0.6<Ohm<1.3), and such as to favour an incomplete redissolution of the falling calcite crystals, resulting in weak [Ca(2+)] and alkalinity gradients along the water column. The incomplete mixing of the lake since 1992 appears mainly determined by climatic conditions. Consumption of O(2) in the hypolimnion is paralleled by an in crease of nutrients and dissolved inorganic carbon. However, this correspondence is clearly evident only for SRP, Si and CT whereas major [NO(3)(-)] gradients appear mainly confined to the superficial layers. In the hypolimnion, stoichiometric relationships among C(T) SRP and O(2) are characterised by slopes of the functional lines (inferred from reduced major axis regressions) approximating the Redfield ratios.

The Gardiner Dam, one of the structures that forms the Lake Diefenbaker reservoir located in the Canadian Prairies, is managed for hydropower generation and agricultural irrigation and is known to have widely altering temperature regimes and nutrient circulations. This study applies the hydrodynamic and nutrient CE-QUAL-W2 model to explore how various withdrawal depths (5, 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 m) influence the concentrations and distribution of nutrients, temperature, and dissolved oxygen (DO) within the Lake Diefenbaker reservoir. As expected, the highest dissolved nutrient (phosphate, and nitrate) concentrations were associated with hypoxic depth horizons in both studied years. During summer high flow period spillway operations impact the distribution of nutrients, water temperatures, and DO as increased epilimnion flow velocities route the incoming water through the surface of the reservoir and reduce mixing and surface warming. This reduces reservoir concentrations but can lead to increased outflow nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations. Lower withdrawal elevations pull warmer surface water deeper within the reservoir and decrease reservoir DO during summer stratification. During fall turnover low outflow elevations increase water column mixing and draws warmer water deeper, leading to slightly higher temperatures and nutrient concentrations than shallow withdrawal elevations. The 15 m depth (540 m above sea level) outflow generally provided the best compromise for overall reservoir and outflow nutrient reduction.

Multiproxy record of monsoon variability from the Ganga Plain during 400-1200 AD	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Understanding on the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) variability is chiefly based upon the marine proxies and a few continental records. The Ganga Plain, one of the most densely populated regions of the world marked by intensive cultivation of monsoon dependent crops and a rich cultural history, is not yet well understood in the context of monsoon variability. We present here a 400-1200 A.D. AMS radiocarbon dated record of Ropan Chhapra tal in the Central Ganga Plain using sedimentology, environmental magnetism, and stable isotope of oxygen for ISM variability. The environmental magnetic parameters (chi(1f), chi(ARM), SIRM/chi(1f), S-Ratio, B-(0)CR and HIRM) inferred antiferromagnetic mineralogy (hematite and/or goethite) independent of grain size variation during 400 -900 A.D., depicting climate variability within warm humid to warm arid conditions favouring stronger ISM seasonality. Prevalence of ferrimagnetic mineralogy under less oxygenated conditions intermittently demonstrates an altered catchment regime or possibly in response to stronger winter monsoon. The higher delta O-18 values around 500, 580 and 740 A.D. indicate warm and arid conditions under weak ISM. The lower delta O-18 values around 480, 540 and 700 A.D. and from 900 to 1200 A.D. occur during warm and humid conditions indicating maximum intensity of the ISM. Increased silt content from 800 A.D. onwards is due to increased surface runoff in response to enhanced precipitation, and the higher clay percentage around 500, 580 and 740 indicates low-energy (ponding) conditions under weak ISM. The well sorted nature of sediment indicates consistency of the lacustrine environments under fairly uniform energy and constant bottom water conditions, under varied monsoonal intensity. Combinations of sediment textures and stable isotope indicate intense ISM at similar to 480 and similar to 540 A.D. with flooding around similar to 700 A.D. and a weak monsoon at 580 and 740 A.D., with drought at 500 A.D. During similar to 900-1200 A.D. the multiproxy record suggests strong summer monsoon synchronous with Medieval Warm Period (MWP), whereas after 1200 A.D. the weak monsoon phase coincides with the onset of the Little Ice Age (LIA).

Deglacial and Holocene vegetation and climatic changes in the southern Central Mediterranean from a direct land-sea correlation	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Despite a large number of studies, the long-term and millennial to centennial-scale climatic variability in the Mediterranean region during the last deglaciation and the Holocene is still debated, including in the southern Central Mediterranean. In this paper, we present a new marine pollen sequence (core MD04-2797CQ) from the Siculo-Tunisian Strait documenting the regional vegetation and climatic changes in the southern Central Mediterranean during the last deglaciation and the Holocene. The MD04-2797CQ marine pollen sequence shows that semi-desert plants dominated the vegetal cover in the southern Central Mediterranean between 18.2 and 12.3 ka cal BP, indicating prevailing dry conditions during the deglaciation, even during the Greenland Interstadial (GI)-1. Across the transition Greenland Stadial (GS)-1 -Holocene, Asteraceae-Poaceae steppe became dominant till 10.1 ka cal BP. This record underlines with no chronological ambiguity that even though temperatures increased, deficiency in moisture availability persisted into the early Holocene. Temperate trees and shrubs with heath underbrush or maquis expanded between 10.1 and 6.6 ka, corresponding to Sapropel 1 (S1) interval, while Mediterranean plants only developed from 6.6 ka onwards. These changes in vegetal cover show that the regional climate in southern Central Mediterranean was wetter during S1 and became drier during the mid-to late Holocene. Wetter conditions during S1 were likely due to increased winter precipitation while summers remained dry. We suggest, in agreement with published modeling experiments, that the early Holocene increased melting of the Laurentide Ice Sheet in conjunction with weak winter insolation played a major role in the development of winter precipitation maxima in the Mediterranean region in controlling the strength and position of the North Atlantic storm track. Finally, our data provide evidence for centennial-scale vegetation and climatic changes in the southern Central Mediterranean. During the wet early Holocene, alkenone-derived cooling episodes are synchronous with herbaceous composition changes that indicate muted changes in precipitation. In contrast, enhanced aridity episodes, as detected by strong reduction in trees and shrubs, are recorded during the mid-to late Holocene. We show that the impact of the Holocene cooling events on the Mediterranean hydroclimate depend on baseline climate states, i.e. insolation and ice sheet extent, shaping the response of the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation.					; Desprat, Stephanie/N-7637-2013; Marie-Alexandrine, Sicre/AAR-1516-2020; BOUT-ROUMAZEILLES, Viviane/AAD-5259-2019	Combourieu-Nebout, Nathalie/0000-0002-3604-5986; Bout-Roumazeilles, Viviane/0000-0001-6917-818X; Siani, Giuseppe/0000-0002-2090-5320; Sicre, Marie-Alexandrine/0000-0002-5015-1400; Desprat, Stephanie/0000-0003-4400-679X; 													1814-9324	1814-9332					2013	9	2					767	787		10.5194/cp-9-767-2013	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-9-767-2013													WOS:000317009700017
J	Ejsmont-Karabin, J				Ejsmont-Karabin, J			Rotifera of lake psammon: Community structure. versus trophic state of lake waters	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Rotifer communities inhabiting wet sands of lake beaches are dependent in their functioning on permanent input of organic matter from neighbouring sites. The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that trophic state of lake waters may influence densities and structure of psammon communities of Rotifera. Studies were carried out in hydro-, hygro- and euarenal of 44 beaches in 18 lakes of different trophy in summer 1999 (since 2 till 17 July) and 38 beaches in 16 lakes in spring 2000 (since 10 till 23 May). Psammon was sampled always between 10a.m. and 2 p.m. at similar weather conditions (no shadow. rains and strong winds). Interstitial waters were mostly alkaline and contained less oxygen than lake ones and oxygen concentrations decreased upward water line. Very high variability of phosphate P content made differences between trophic groups of lakes not significant. Similarly, concentrations of 11 total were more or less similar in-all studied trophic groups of lakes. Total nitrogen values were increasing from meso-eutrophic to hypertrophic lakes in spring, whereas this trend was not observed in summer. Chlorophyll a concentrations were similar in meso, meso-eu-and eutrophic and markedly higher in hypertrophic lakes. In general, some tendency to increasing values of chemical parameters with increasing trophy may be seen if their ranking list is compared. Rotifers were present in all studied stations. In total, 110 species (i.e. ca. 26% of all records of rotifer species in Poland) were found with 22 species occurring exclusively in psammon. Three species new. in rotifer fauna of Poland were discovered Cephalodella psaminophila, Collotheca wisniewski and Euchlanis dapidula. Generally all trophic groups of lakes were relatively similar as regards species structure of rotifer communities with rotifers of the genus Lecane playing most important role. The index of Percentage Similarity of Community calculated for randomly-chosen 30 pairs of particular beaches from the same lake and for beaches of different lakes was in both cases almost identical.																			1505-2249						2003	51	1					5	35																WOS:000181793300001

Ice Cover Determination of the Lakes of Baltic and White Sea Basins on the Base of Jason-2 Satellite Observations	2014 IEEE/OES BALTIC INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM (BALTIC)					6th IEEE/OES Baltic International Symposium (BALTIC) - Measuring and Modeling of Multi-Scale Interactions in the Marine Environment	MAY 26-29, 2014	Tallinn, ESTONIA	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Ocean Engn Soc, Tallinn Univ Technol, Marine Syst Inst, Tallinn Univ Technol				Thy work aims to development of a simple method for distinction between open water and ice cover on the base of geophysical data record (GDR) of altimetry satellite Jason-2 for large and middle-sized freshwater inland water bodies. The method is applied to the lakes of Baltic and White Seas basins: Ladoga, Onega, Vygozero and Segosero. The method for ice-water discrimination based on data of altimetry satellites was initially developed for Topex/Poseidon satellite and was successfully applied to the Caspian, Aral and other Seas and Baikal Lake. This method was based on the joint analysis of the two parameters: the backscatter coefficient at 13.6 GHz and the average value of the brightness temperature at 18 and 37 GHz and the conclusion about the ice cover can be made when these parameters exceed a certain threshold. It is shown that the method works well for large water bodies such as Ladoga and Onega Lakes and experiences significant difficulties for the middle-sized water bodies, such as Vygozero, and Segosero. This is largely due to the small amount of valid data on the backscatter coefficient for not very large water basins, which is caused by the influence of the land on the shape of the reflected altimetry pulses. For the medium water basins more productive method is based on an analysis of the difference of brightness temperatures of land and water. Along track variation of the average brightness temperature at 18.7 and 34 GHz TB/2=(TB18.7+TB34)/2 for cycles 1-179 of Jason-2 observations, constructed for winter and summer periods showed that for all lakes the difference of brightness temperatures of land and water strongly reduced when the water freezes. This allows us to determine the freezing of water based on a decrease in difference of brightness temperatures of land and water areas. Based on the proposed method we constructed time series of brightness temperature differences and demonstrated that these dependences have a pronounced seasonal variation for all lakes considered. The transition from summer values (open water) to winter values (ice) is sharp enough, which allowed us to determine sufficiently accurately the date of freezing of the lakes.

J	Graynoth, E				Graynoth, E			Determination of the age of brown and rainbow trout in a range of New Zealand lakes	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) from eight New Zealand lakes were aged by length-frequency analysis and by examining otoliths, pectoral fin rays and scales. Bimonthly changes in the length frequency of age classes were used to age fish for their first 2 or 3 years of life. Growth rates were highest in spring and summer, when a single wide opaque band was laid down on otoliths and fin rays, followed by a narrow transparent band in winter. Age estimates from otoliths agreed with 94-97% of those from length-frequency methods and with the ages of 21 tagged fish. Otoliths were used to age fish up to 11 years old and were more accurate than fin rays and scales. Although fin rays could be used to age juvenile fish from Lake Coleridge, where there was 78-80% agreement between otolith and fin ray ages, they were of little value for older fish in Lake Alexandrina (28% agreement). Rainbow trout scales from all lakes were difficult to read because of indistinct annuli and the presence of false checks. Mature trout were also difficult to age owing to scale absorption and a cessation of scale growth. The degree of agreement between otolith and scale ages ranged from 83-84% for trout in Lake Coleridge to 32-38% for older rainbow trout in other lakes. This study supports the findings of other researchers that trout scales can provide inaccurate estimates of the age of trout in New Zealand and Australia. It is suggested that otolith examination, supported by length-frequency analysis of juvenile trout, be used to age trout from New Zealand lakes. In many cases, examination of otoliths will be cheaper and quicker than the release and later recapture of fin-clipped or tagged juvenile trout.																			1323-1650						1996	47	5					749	756		10.1071/MF9960749	http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF9960749													WOS:A1996VN50400009

Nitrogen affects in-lake processing and, potentially, atmospheric exchange of greenhouse gases, probably being most relevant in unproductive systems. Here, we test for the first time the effect of a whole-lake experimental increase (threefold) in external nitrate loads on the atmospheric exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) from N-limited unproductive boreal lakes. Nitrate enrichment effects were assessed within a paired Before/After-Control/Impact framework based on 2-hourly to biweekly surface-water sampling of dissolved gas concentrations, and monthly whole-lake inventory surveys, carried out over 4 yrs in six lakes. Nitrate enrichment did not affect gas exchange during summer stratification and whole-lake gas inventories during summer and winter stratification. This finding specifically emphasizes the modest role of internal carbon fixation for the CO2 dynamics of unproductive boreal lakes. A global synthesis of 52 published studies revealed a wide range of nutrient fertilization effects, both in systems similar to our experimental lakes, and other more productive systems. Effects depended mainly on the spatiotemporal scale of the study and became more pronounced when N enrichment was combined with phosphorous. Conclusively, although short-term and habitat-specific effects can occur, changes in N supply have only weak whole-ecosystem effects on greenhouse gas emissions from unproductive boreal lakes.					; Klaus, Marcus/AAL-1818-2021	Klaus, Marcus/0000-0003-0747-3524; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2018	63			1			S340	S353		10.1002/lno.10743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10743													WOS:000427077300023

Gordon; Wrubleski, Dale A.; Armstrong, Llwellyn M.; Page, Bryan			Improvements in water clarity and submersed aquatic vegetation cover after exclusion of invasive common carp from a large freshwater coastal wetland, Delta Marsh, Manitoba	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Once introduced to shallow aquatic ecosystems common carp (Cyprinus carpio) often degrade habitat, negatively impacting the native organisms that rely on these systems. Detrimental effects often observed following the introduction of carp include a reduction in water clarity as bottom sediments become disturbed and resuspended and phytoplankton blooms become more severe and frequent. This results in a reduction of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV), the effects of which are felt across multiple trophic levels. We sought to limit large carp (> 70 mm maximum body width) access to a culturally and biologically significant 18,500 ha freshwater coastal wetland located in Manitoba, Canada to restore pre-carp conditions which were characterized by clear water and abundant SAV. In winter 2012-2013, exclusion structures were built to limit access by large carp to Delta Marsh during the spring and summer. A monitoring program (2009-2018) compared marsh conditions before and after carp exclusion. Water clarity improved following carp exclusion, largely driven by a reduction of inorganic suspended solids (ISS) rather than phytoplankton biomass, indicating that maintaining clear water conditions might be supplemented by reductions in nutrient export from agricultural areas adjacent to the marsh. The decrease in ISS and phytoplankton varied spatially, with the greatest change observed in the westernmost area of the marsh which is more sheltered compared to the large open bays characterizing eastern areas of the marsh. SAV doubled in percent cover through the 6 years of monitoring post-carp exclusion and SAV cover and species richness in the marsh was comparable to what was present in the early 1970s when there was also partial carp exclusion. Similar to water clarity, the increase in SAV cover was most significant in sheltered areas of the marsh. Our results suggest that excluding large carp can improve water clarity, SAV cover, and SAV species richness in large freshwater wetlands, benefiting waterfowl and other species.

During two of the sampling periods, the H4IIE bioassay-derived TECs (BD-TECs) were compared directly with BD-TECs measured by a similar bioassay using a rainbow trout liver cell line (RTL-W1). Front 1989 to 1993, chemistry-derived TECs (CD-TECs) were calculated directly from measured polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) and dibenzofuran (PCDF) concentrations in liver tissue. Chemistry-derived TECs were compared to bioassay-derived TECs using toxic equivalent factors (TEFs) developed for these systems. During the study period, the pulp will began secondary treatment of effluent and increased the substitution of chlorine dioxide for molecular chlorine during bleaching. Significant reductions in H4IIE BD-TECs and CD-TECs were observed in liver tissue of both male and female white sucker during summer and fall sampling periods but not during spring sampling periods. Process and treatment improvements at this particular bleached kraft pulp mill appear to have been successful at reducing the levels of PCDDs and PCDFs found in white sucker exposed to the effluent. Despite the decreases in TECs, relative mixed function oxygenase (MFO) induction in the exposed white sucker did not decrease over the study period, suggesting the PCDDs and PCDFs are current not the dominant MFO-inducing compounds in the effluent of this mill.

Prokaryotic and eukaryotic community compositions were assessed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, while microalgal community composition was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography pigment analysis. The sensitivity of microphytobenthos to the herbicide Diuron was investigated in the laboratory by short-term photosynthesis inhibition assays. Spatial changes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic species compositions were found in spring and in winter. Community structures were significantly different between contaminated areas and those that were uncontaminated or less contaminated. Associated changes in biodiversity were not found. Community tolerance towards Diuron (based on EC50 values for photosynthesis) was significantly lower in upstream than in downstream photoautotrophic organisms. Pesticide concentration increased along the downstream gradient. These results strongly suggest contamination-driven changes in biofilm community structure and in the tolerance of the photoautotrophic community, confirming the Pollution-Induced Community Tolerance (PICT) hypothesis.

Also, the temperature profile evolution was registered with two thermistor chains at two stations (bottom depths of 7.6 and 11.5 m) until the time of ice breakup. Temperature gradients were measured just below the ice cover and in the upper 10-cm layer of the bottom sediments. The isotherms were found to be almost horizontal and evenly spaced vertically, so no conditions for large-scale, density-induced currents existed. The heat flux from sediments to water ranged from 0.6 to 2.0 W m(-2). These values were inversely related to the depth. The heat Aux from water to ice ranged from 0.7 to 1.2 W m(-2). When water heating from solar radiation penetration became apparent, this flux increased by a factor of two. When solar radiation increased, convection occurred in the upper layers of the water column. When solar radiation heating became significant at the beginning of spring, the average net heat flux at the ice-water interface during daytime was 7.7 W m(-2). Weak currents (few mm s(-1)) with a seiche-like character were observed, which most likely resulted from ice-cover oscillations.					; Malm, Joakim/JFA-2440-2023; Terzhevik, Arkady/L-7911-2013; Palshin, Nikolay/L-8634-2013	Palshin, Nikolay/0000-0003-1540-3788; Malm, Joakim/0000-0002-5755-3373; Terzhevik, Arkady/0000-0002-0837-9065; 													0024-3590					NOV	1996	41	7					1502	1513		10.4319/lo.1996.41.7.1502	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.7.1502													WOS:A1996WU27300013

These records include sequential lake sediment trap samples and cores, floodplain stratigraphies, dated landform assemblages, hydro-meteorological records, and documented histories of river channel and land-use change. Mineral magnetic measurements are used as the basis for classifying catchment sediment sources and tracing sediment movements through time. Records of magnetic susceptibility for monthly sediment trap samples (1998-99) track seasonal discharge, peaking in winter and spring. Magnetic records in lake sediment cores are compared against and tuned to precipitation records to provide dated proxy records for past discharge spanning sub-annual to decadal time scales back to 1826. Calculated sediment accumulation rates in lake sediment cores are used as proxies for time-averaged catchment sediment load. Analysis of the results reveals that climate and land-use controls on the hydrological and sediment system are complex and vary according to the time scale of observation. In general, cycles of agricultural expansion and deforestation appear to have been the major cause of shifts in the sediment system through the late Holocene. Deforestation in the 18th century may have caused a number of high-magnitude flood and erosion events. As the time scale of observation becomes shorter, changes in climate and hydro-meteorological conditions become progressively more important. Since the mid-19th century, smoothed records of discharge roughly follow annual precipitation; this is in contrast to sediment load, which follows the trend of declining land-use pressures. Episodic erosion events during this recent period seem to be linked to geomorphic evidence for slope instability in the montane and sub-alpine zones, triggered by intense summer rainfall. At the annual scale, changes in seasonal rainfall become paramount in determining sediment movement to downstream locations. The study demonstrates that the connections between forcings and responses span a four-dimensional array of temporal and spatial scales, with strong evidence for dominantly nonlinear forcing-response mechanisms.

ACTA PROTOZOOLOGICA												Myxobolus squamaphilus sp. n. (Myxosporea: Myxozoa) is a common parasite of bream (Abramis brama) in Lake Balaton and the River Danube. Its lentil-shaped, relatively small plasmodia develop in the connective tissue consisting of collagen fibrils on the surface of the cartilaginous plate of scales. Mature plasmodia containing only a few hundred spores can be detected in the fish in April and May. In March primarily the developing stages while in the early summer the traces left by excreted plasmodia can be detected in the scales. In the spring months, the prevalence of infection exceeds 50% while its intensity may reach 7 per scale. By its ellipsoidal, relatively large spores this species is well distinguishable from other species known from the bream and from other cyprinids.

HYDROLOGY												Spring waters (n = 103) from locations surrounding Great Salt Lake (GSL) were mapped, collected, and analyzed to determine their chemical compositions. A ternary Ca-SO4-alkalinity plot was used to group these waters into compositional types based on the principle of chemical divides. Different spring water types were mixed with Bear, Jordan, and Weber River waters to determine the amount of spring inflow needed to reproduce the chemical composition of GSL. The Pitzer-based computer program EQL/EVP was used to simulate evaporation of spring-river water mixtures. The goal was to find spring-river water mixtures that, when evaporated, reproduced the chemical composition of modern GSL. This approach yielded GSL brine composition from a starting mixture of 12% spring inflow and 88% river water, by volume. The calculated spring inflow-river water mixture contains, on a molar percentage basis, greater than 50% of the B, K, Li, Na, and Cl supplied by springs and greater than 50% of the Ba, Ca, Sr, SO4, and alkalinity derived from rivers. Understanding GSL spring inflow and brine evolution as lake elevation drops is critical to lake environments, ecosystems, and industrial brine shrimp harvesting and mineral extraction.																				2306-5338				JUN 19	2025	12	6							159	10.3390/hydrology12060159	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/hydrology12060159													WOS:001514832300001

Larval lake herring (Coregonus artedii) 8 to 25 mm occurred in densities of 0 to 1,450 larvae/1,000 m(3) and were most commonly found in shallow water (I to 2 m). Most lake herring hatching occurred during late April to early May, the first 3 wk after ice break-up, but there was no distinct hatching peak. Lake whitefish (C. clupeaformis) larvae, 12 to 23 mm, with densities of 0 to 600/1,000 m(3), were most common at I m being collected at all transects, except the transect in the Edison Hydropower Canal which passes Lake Superior water into the river. Densities of the two coregonine species were similar to densities observed in important nursery areas of Lake Huron. However, the contribution of lake herring to the Fiver population is not known. Burbot (Lota lota) larvae were common temporally and spatially, with higher abundances in the channel. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) larvae were absent in April and early May, and abundant in late May. Lake herring, lake whitefish, and burbot have the greatest probability of being affected by the proposed extension of the navigation season through resuspension of sediments, dislodgment of eggs, and premature emergence of larvae.																			0380-1330						1998	24	3					569	581		10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70845-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(98)70845-7													WOS:000076738000007

Human activity as a factor causing the biomass, structure and seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton in adjacent fishponds	RENDICONTI LINCEI-SCIENZE FISICHE E NATURALI												The role of phytoplankton as one of the main sources of energy entering the water food network is especially evident in fish-rearing ponds. Indeed, in these comparatively small ponds (unlike many lakes), variations in the abundance of phytoplankton can be extremely sensitive to the action of external factors, including human activity. Here, we present results of the analysis of the phytoplankton dynamics in adjacent fishponds and in supplying/recipient river courses upstream and downstream of the ponds during a growing season. In the grow-out ponds, phytoplankton biomass is shown to reach maximums in spring and in early autumn, while in the nursery pond, the phytoplankton dynamics is characterized by one long peak. The specificity of fish-rearing ponds as the human-regulated reservoirs clearly manifests itself under comparison of phytoplankton biomass of ponds with the biomass of phytoplankton inhabiting a nearby river. The averaged phytoplankton biomass in the ponds was 6.2-10.1 times higher than in the river. Besides, we show here that the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton in the river differs significantly from the composition of phytoplankton in the fish-rearing ponds. In particular, Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta were revealed as the major portion of the phytoplankton in the fish-rearing ponds, while in the river their abundances were low.

J	PASTOROK, RA				PASTOROK, RA			THE EFFECTS OF PREDATOR HUNGER AND FOOD ABUNDANCE ON PREY SELECTION BY CHAOBORUS LARVAE	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Laboratory experiments on prey selection by Chaoborus [C. triuittatus] larvae show that predator choice and differential encounter rates with prey determine the composition of the diet. As the larval crop and midgut become filled with food during a feeding bout, the predator avoids eating some available Daphnia [D. pulicaria] and specializes on Diaptomus [D. franciscannus]. After 3 days of starvation at 15.degree. C, the gut system is empty and Chaoborus attacks prey indiscriminately. Then, daphnids are overrepresented in the diet because the predator encounters them more frequently than copepods of equal size. Daphnia swims about twice as fast as Diaptomus and encounters a stationary electric eye at twice the rate measured for copepods. The strike efficiency of larvae for encountered prey is the same for both species. Since feeding selectivity is inversely proportional to larval hunger state, prey selection varies with the abundance of prey and season. Larvae collected during autumn have lower feeding rates and are more selective than larvae collected during summer. When food increases, previously opportunistic larvae may become selective within a few hours, but satiated larvae take several days to relax their preferences under a lowered food regime. [Larvae were collected from a lake in Washington, USA.].																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1980	25	5					910	921		10.4319/lo.1980.25.5.0910	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1980.25.5.0910													WOS:A1980KL33000014
J	Woolway, RI; Livingstone, DM; Kernan, M				Woolway, R. Iestyn; Livingstone, David M.; Kernan, Martin			Altitudinal dependence of a statistically significant diel temperature cycle in Scottish lochs	INLAND WATERS												Based on near-surface temperature measurements conducted at high temporal resolution in 16 Scottish lochs in 2001, a strong seasonal cycle was observed in the magnitude of the diel surface temperature range (DSTR). The influence of 5 site-specific potential predictor variables including altitude, latitude, longitude, lake surface area, and maximum lake depth on the timing of the start and end of a statistically significant DSTR was investigated. The DSTR is important because it is expected to have implications for many processes that affect biogeochemical cycling in lakes, including the rates of metabolic processes. The timing of the start of a statistically significant DSTR in spring showed a strong dependence on altitude, a much weaker dependence on latitude, but no dependence on any other predictor variable tested. The timing of the end of a statistically significant DSTR in autumn showed no dependence on any of the predictor variables tested. Because the start of a statistically significant DSTR is dependent on altitude but its end is not, its duration is also dependent on altitude. Because the start of a significant DSTR is related to the onset of thermal stratification, the results suggest that the altitude of a lake will affect the timing of the onset of thermal stratification and its duration.

High-mountain lakes show snow-rich ice covers that determine contrasting conditions between ice-off and ice-on periods. We characterized the bacterioplankton seasonality in a deep high-mountain lake ice-covered for half a year. The lake shows a rich core bacterioplankton community consisting of three components: (i) an assemblage stable throughout the year, dominated by Actinobacteria, resistant to all environmental conditions; (ii) an ice-on-resilient assemblage dominating during the ice-covered period, which is more diverse than the other components and includes a high abundance of Verrucomicrobia; the deep hypolimnion constitutes a refuge for many of the typical under-ice taxa, many of which recover quickly during autumn mixing; and (iii) an ice-off-resilient assemblage, which members peak in summer in epilimnetic waters when the rest decline, characterized by a dominance of Flavobacterium, and Limnohabitans. The rich core community and low random elements compared to other relatively small cold lakes can be attributed to its simple hydrological network in a poorly-vegetated catchment, the long water-residence time (ca. 4 years), and the long ice-cover duration; features common to many headwater deep high-mountain lakes.

Trophic ecology of two non-native cyprinid fish, the common carp Cyprinus carpio and the bleak Alburnus alburnus	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The introduction of non-native fish species poses a significant threat to biodiversity. In Spain, the common carp Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus, 1758) and the bleak Alburnus alburnus (Linnaeus, 1758) are both established and sometimes co-occurring non-native species. Here, we investigated the trophic ecology of these species using an integrative approach, combining dietary and stable isotope analyses, to understand seasonal variations in their feeding ecology and potential niche overlap. We found a variable pattern for the gonadosomatic index of the two species in spring and autumn, suggesting the occurrence of extended reproductive periods for both A. alburnus and C. carpio. The gut content and isotopic niche analyses showed seasonal niche shifts, as well as interspecific niche partitioning and potential feeding competition. Notably, we found remains of small fish in the gut of both species and one entire individual of Gambusia holbrooki (Girard, 1859) in the carp gut, highlighting the potential of both species to prey also upon native fish fry or juveniles. Moreover, A. alburnus showed an ontogenetic shift toward prey from higher trophic levels and from the littoral/benthic environment, while C. carpio showed an increase in the proportion of prey from the pelagic environment with size.

Classification of Springs in the Lake Baikal Region by Macroinvertebrate Communities	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The macrozoobenthos communities in 15 cold fresh, 12 mineral (sodium chloride), and 19 thermal springs of the Baikal Rift Zone and adjacent areas have been investigated. The classification of springs on the basis of quantitative indicators of abundance was proposed. According to the dominant group of fauna, three types of communities were identified for the cold springs; six types, for mineral springs; and four types, for thermal springs. It was established that communities with the dominance of Chironomidae, Turbellaria, and Oligochaeta are formed in cold springs and communities with the predominance of Gastropoda (one or two species) prevail in thermal springs. It was noted that mineral springs of medium mineralization are characterized by communities with a prevalence of Amphipoda (Gammarus lacustris); those with high salinity are dominated by Brachyceran flies (Diptera, Brachycera).

Reproductive pattern of the freshwater prawn Pseudopalaemon bouvieri (Crustacea, Palaemonidae) from hypo-osmotic shallow lakes of Corrientes (Argentina)	STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT												Pseudopalaemon bouvieri undergoes complete abbreviated development. The reproductive cycle (proportion and size of the sexually mature population and juvenile recruitment), fecundity and egg size of this prawn were examined in three subtropical shallow lakes. The reproductive cycle was seasonal; gonadal maturation occurred during the winter, ovigerous females were abundant in the spring and breeding occurred at the end of spring. Females produced small numbers of eggs (9-55) of relatively large sizes (1.0-2.1mm). The proportion of ovigerous females with respect to the total number of females, the fecundity and egg size differed among the lakes according to the trophic state of the environments. Pseudopalaemon bouvieri has a reproductive strategy similar to other Palaemonidae species that inhabit nutrient-poor inland waters.

El ciclo reproductivo fue estacional; la maduracion gonadal ocurrio durante el invierno, las hembras ovigeras fueron abundantes en primavera y las crias aparecieron a finales de la primavera. Las hembras producen un bajo numero de huevos (9 - 55) de tamano relativamente grande (1,0 - 2,1 mm). La proporcion de hembras ovigeras con respecto al numero total de hembras, fecundidad y el tamano de los huevos difirieron entre los lagos, de acuerdo al estado trofico de los ambientes.

Ice genesis and its long-term mass balance and dynamics in Scarisoara Ice Cave, Romania	CRYOSPHERE												The paleoclimatic significance of the perennial ice deposit in Scarisoara Ice Cave has been remarked on since the early 20th century, but a lack of understanding of the processes involved in the genesis, age and long-term dynamics and volume fluctuations of ice hampered all attempts to extract valuable data on past climate and vegetation changes. In this paper, we present a model of ice genesis and dynamics, based on stable isotopes, ice level monitoring (modern and archived) and radiocarbon dating of organic matter found in the ice. Ice in this cave mostly consists of layers of lake ice, produced as liquid water freezes from top to bottom in mid-autumn, and floor ice, produced as inflow water in winter freezes on top of the lake ice. This mechanism was also acting in the past, during the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age. The ice block is not stable in shape and volume, being continuously modified by ablation on top and sides, basal melting and lateral flow. Radiocarbon dating shows that the ice block is older than 1000 years, but ice flow and differential basal melting suggesting that the ice could be much older.

Yet little is known of the effect of recent climate change on carbon storage in lakes. We analyzed century-scale time series of climate variables (precipitation, temperature, NAO winter index) and profiles of sediment characteristics in a dated sediment core from shallow, eutrophic Lake Vrtsjarv, south Estonia. We used path analysis to evaluate the effect of climate conditions on phytoplankton biomass in the lake and accumulation of organic and inorganic carbon in the sediment. Changes in winter and spring climate influenced the lake's phytoplankton growth significantly. Carbon pathways in hard-water Lake Vrtsjarv were influenced by both hydrological (most significant in colder periods) and biogeochemical processes. Increased nutrient and water input to Lake Vrtsjarv, anticipated with projected climate warming, favours greater in-lake productivity, larger accumulation of inorganic carbon in sediments, and an increase in organic carbon mineralisation, which fuels atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions from the lake.

Samples were taken monthly between October 1996-September 1998 and January 2008-December 2008 revealed some chemical and physical characteristics. In the first sampling period 27 Rotifer species and in the second sampling period 24 Rotifer species were recorded. In both sampling periods increases were occurred in individual and taxon numbers of rotifers in spring and summer seasons. In the first and second sampling periods Keratella cochlearis and Polyarthra vulgaris were the most abundant species. The purpose of this investigation was to describe the species composition of rotifera and to compare two sampling periods results in order to determine how structure of rotifer populations has changed in past 10 years. In comparison with two sampling periods, some changes have been taken place in the composition of rotifers. The high species richness of rotifers; particularly members of the genera Brachionus suggested that the lake probably eutrophicated.					; SÖNMEZ, Feray/V-8331-2018; Saler, Serap/V-9012-2018	saler, serap/0000-0001-5900-491X; 													1680-5593						2010	9	14					1909	1912																WOS:000281923700004
J	Caine, N				Caine, Nel			Recent hydrologic change in a Colorado alpine basin: an indicator of permafrost thaw?	ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY												Hydrologic and hydrochemical studies have been conducted in Green Lakes Valley, Colorado Front Range, USA, above 3550 m since 1982. They show a classic seasonal hydrograph dominated by snowmelt and an earlier date for the start of spring flow and for peak flow over the period of record. This is consistent with patterns found at lower elevations in Colorado and throughout western North America. They also show an increasing trend in flows in September and October of 2.6 +/- 0.7 mm a(-1) which is not found elsewhere and cannot be accounted for by increased autumn precipitation and the melting of surface ice. Because this late-season increase is not found at the highest elevations or in basins in which there is no evidence of permafrost, it seems best explained by the thawing of alpine permafrost at intermediate elevations. This is corroborated by an increase in the concentration of base cations and silica, and particularly in Ca(2+) and SO(4)(-), in the stream discharge starting in 2000. As with the physical hydrology, the geochemical signals have not been detected at the higher elevations in the basin, though they have previously been associated with streamflow from a small rock glacier in the valley. The combined evidence suggests the degradation of ice-rich permafrost on the north-facing slopes of the valley below 3700 m, where it has been detected at 3 m depth by geophysical surveys.																			0260-3055						2010	51	56					130	134		10.3189/172756411795932074	http://dx.doi.org/10.3189/172756411795932074													WOS:000290290600016
J	Humphries, CF				Humphries, CF			An investigation of the profundal and sublittoral fauna of windermere	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												A quantitative and qualitative study of the distribution of the macrofauna of the sublittoral and profundal regions of this oligotrophic ("Sergentia") English lake was carried out by means of a dredge and especially a Petersen Grab. Of the bottom or mud fauna, Pisidia, Chironomidae. and Oligochaeta only were abundant, but these were supplemented by Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Neurop-tera, and Hydracarina. A definite depth zonation of spp. was evident, of which 88% occurred in the sublittoral and 12% were truly profundal. The abundance decrease with depth, being most variable at 3 meters. The fauna shows seasonal variation in abundance with the maximum in the winter and the minimum in summer. With increase in depth the animals become more restricted to the surface of the mud. The lower layers of the mud at all depths contain less oxygen than the surface. The decrease in abundance with depth of water was believed due to decreasing coarseness of the mud. although the indirect influence of decreasing light through affecting the plant food supply may also be important.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1936	5						29	52		10.2307/1090	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1090													WOS:000201317600004

Seasonal comparisons of the phytoplankton and decline in water transparency in the spring-fed Rainbow River, Florida	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Rainbow River is the fourth largest spring-fed river in Florida and is known for its outstanding water clarity, high rate of spring discharge, and recreational use. However, nitrate concentrations in the spring headwaters have increased 15-fold between 1957 and 2006 - from 0.08 mg L-1 to 1.22 mg L-1. More recently, a significant increase in chlorophyll a and decline in water transparency have been noted downstream of the springs. In a year-long study of phytoplankton, we found that the 79 taxa were similar to those of other spring-fed rivers, with pennate and centric diatoms dominating. The annual mean phytoplankton biovolumes at the six sampling stations ranged from 0.101 mu L L-1 (Jan. 2004) to 0.349 mu L L-1 (Jan. 2005). Three minor blooms occurred at downstream stations with species of Navicula and Synedra in May (0.348 mu L L-1), Fragilaria in September (0.272 mu L L-1), and Cyclotella and Navicula in January (L 190 mu L L-1). The decrease in water transparency and an increase in chlorophyll a downstream, shown by a parallel study, correlated significantly with an increase in phytoplankton that in turn was related to the volume of discharge during the year. During the dry season, lower discharge rates increased the water residence time in the main channel and increased phytoplankton biovolume. It appears that further increases in nutrients and the possibility of lower discharges from the headwater springs will probably result in increased chlorophyll a, more phytoplankton blooms, and additional decreases in water clarity downstream.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				JUN	2008	23	2					169	177		10.1080/02705060.2008.9664188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2008.9664188													WOS:000256166800001

The unique geomorphological, hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological phenomenon of Plitvice Lakes lies in the biodynamic process of forming tufa barriers. Freshwater network ecosystems consist of interconnected lotic and lentic environments within the same catchment area. Using Plitvice Lakes as an example, we studied the changes in environmental conditions and microbial communities (bacteria and fungi) that occur with downstream flow. Water samples from tributaries, interlake streams, connections of the cascading lakes, and the Korana River, the main outflow of the system, were characterized using amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS2 genes. Our results show that different environmental conditions and bacterial and fungal communities prevail among the three stream types within the freshwater network ecosystem during multiple sampling seasons. Microbial community differences were also confirmed along the longitudinal gradient between the most distant sampling sites. The higher impact of "mass effect" was evident during spring and winter, while "species sorting" and "environmental selection" was more pronounced during summer. Prokaryotic community assembly was majorly influenced by deterministic processes, while fungal community assembly was highly dominated by stochastic processes, more precisely by the undominated fraction, which is not dominated by any process. Despite the differences between stream types, the microbial community of Plitvice Lakes is shown to be very stable by the core microbiome that makes up the majority of stream communities. Our results suggest microbial community succession along the river-lake continuum of microbial communities in small freshwater network ecosystems with developed tufa barriers.IMPORTANCE Plitvice Lakes represent a rare freshwater ecosystem consisting of a complex network of lakes and waterfalls connecting them, as well as rivers and streams supplying water to the lake basin. The unique geomorphological, hydrological, biogeochemical, and biological phenomenon of Plitvice Lakes lies in the biodynamic process of forming tufa barriers. In addition to microbial communities, abiotic water factors also have a major influence on the formation of tufa. Therefore, it is important to understand how changes in environmental conditions and microbial community assembly affect the functioning of the ecosystem of a freshwater network with developed tufa barriers.					; Orlic, Sandi/AAE-6082-2019; Kajan, Katarina/IAQ-0470-2023; Pjevac, Petra/AAW-8737-2020	Pjevac, Petra/0000-0001-7344-302X; Markovic, Tamara/0000-0003-0572-0376; Kajan, Katarina/0000-0002-9266-7245; Orlic, Sandi/0000-0002-6339-4145; Cackovic, Andrea/0000-0002-9734-7494; 														2379-5042				JUN 22	2023	8	3								10.1128/msphere.00602-22	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00602-22		APR 2023						37097185					WOS:000975966400001
J	Sojka, M				Sojka, Mariusz			Assessment of Biogenic Compounds Eluted from the Catchment of Debina River	ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA												The aim of this research was an assessment of water quality and biogenic compounds loads eluted from the small catchment of the Debina River. The river flows through the Kleckie Lake which is strongly polluted and susceptible to degradation [5]. The basis of this paper were results of field study conducted in 2007 hydrological year in the catchment of the Debina River down to Borzatew cross-section. Assessment of a physico-chemical state of the river was made according to Polish river water quality standards [6, 7]. Annual loads of ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen and phosphorus were computed on the basis of statistical methods [4]. Total nitrogen and phosphorus loads were calculated as products of the mean flow and mean concentrations of N-og. and P-og. The water of Debina River were characterized by a high concentration of nitrate and low concentration of ammonium nitrogen. Mean concentrations of nitrite ranged from 6.0 mg NO3.dm(-3) in summer half year to 54.8 mg NO3.dm(-3) in winter half year. The annual loads of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds were differentiated. The nitrate nitrogen loads leaching from the catchment were the highest and equal to 10.25 N-NO3 kg.ha(-1) yr(-1), and nitrite nitrogen loads were the lowest and equal to 0.12 N-NO2 kg ha(-1) y(-1). Analyses of nitrogen compounds leaching from the catchment of the Debina River showed that in the winter half years they reached 83% of annual loads. In summer half year the loads were smaller and amounted 1.24 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). The load of total nitrogen leaching from the catchment achieved 11.54 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), in which nitrate nitrogen load amounted to 89% and nitrate nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen about 1% only. In order to reduce nitrate nitrogen loads flowing into the Klecko Lake it is necessary to decrease the use of fertilizers and to create biogeochemical zones along the river course and to build sewage networks.					; Sojka, Mariusz/AFN-8790-2022	Sojka, Mariusz/0000-0002-1453-0374; 													1506-218X						2009	11		2				1225	1234																WOS:000281370800042

Quantitative data on selected stream water parameters were collected for 3 yr (1972-1975) at 3 stations on Ward Creek, 2 on the main upper tributaries and 1 near the stream mouth. Comparative data were collected at a stream mouth station on adjacent Blackwood Creek in the 3rd yr. The parameters were selected on the basis of their significance to eutrophication of Lake Tahoe. Precipitation in a normal year is over 90% snow, but annual patterns vary widely and rainfall at any time of year can be highly important in sediment and nutrient transport. Water discharge and the flux of suspended sediments, NO3-N, P, Fe and trace metals were dominated by the spring snowmelt runoff from mid-April to mid-June. In 1974, heavy fall and summer rains accounted for a large percentage of the annual flux of sediments and nutrients in a total of only 14 d [day]. The spring runoff was characterized by distinct diel water discharge patterns. Similar but not coincident patterns existed for sediments and nutrients, including NO3-N, but not for soluble P. The Ward watershed has 87% the area of Balckwood but discharged proportionately much lower quantities of sediment and nutrients in comparable water yields per hectare in water year 1975. This contrast in fluxes was probably accounted for in the history of greater disturbance by man in Blackwood Canyon. The principal source of suspended sediments in Ward Creek was streambank erosion in the lower reaches of the channel. The dominant form of inorganic N in Ward was NO3-N derived from precipitation, symbiotic N fixation and nitrification of organic N in forest soil. P and Fe were almost entirely in particulate form and their periods of flux occurred during high flows and sediment transport. Sediment and nutrient loading of Lake Tahoe from the Ward and Blackwood watersheds reflect a history of soil disturbance and vegetation removal. Logging, fire and stream channel diversion have been the dominant perturbations. Conservative extrapolation of annual loading data from this study to the entire basin indicates that algal nutrient levels in the lake probably have increased sufficiently in the century of man''s intensive disturbance of the basin watersheds to account for increased phytoplankton and periphyton production that were measured and observed since 1958.																			0012-9615	1557-7015					1979	49	3					281	310		10.2307/1942486	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1942486													WOS:A1979JN47500003

(Peridiniales, Dinophyceae), a cryophilic dinoflagellate from Lake Erken, Sweden	PHYCOLOGIA												A new phototrophic species of freshwater dinoflagellates, Peridinium euryceps sp. nov., is described from Lake Erken, Sweden. It is a large and extremely flattened dinoflagellate with a characteristic shape and a tabulation that differs from known species of the same genus. Peridinium euryceps appears during winter underneath the ice, encysts at ice melt, and then remains dormant as cysts during summer. This new species has morphological and ecological similarities with Peridinium baicalense, a species endemic to Lake Baikal, Russia. The autoecology of P. euryceps is discussed, as well as the ecology of cryophilic and cold-stenothermic dinoflagellates in general. It is argued that these species have special adaptations for survival underneath the ice, such as a flattened shape and mixotrophic feeding.					; Rengefors, Karin/K-5873-2019	Rengefors, Karin/0000-0001-6297-9734; 													0031-8884					JUL	1998	37	4					284	291		10.2216/i0031-8884-37-4-284.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2216/i0031-8884-37-4-284.1													WOS:000075878100007

Seasonal variation in thermal plasticity of an alpine lake Daphnia population	EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH												Background: Temperature changes dramatically throughout the growing season in temperate latitudes, and seasonal changes in temperature are especially pronounced in alpine lakes where water stratifies into distinct thermal layers during summer. Hypothesis: Populations are expected to maintain a greater degree of plasticity in more heterogeneous environments, such as when lake stratification occurs. Organism: We studied seasonal variation in plasticity of a population of Daphnia, a key grazer in alpine lakes. Methods: We isolated maternal lines of Daphnia pulicaria from Blue Lake (Sierra Nevada, CA) at four different times throughout the growing season, then measured phenotypic traits and survivorship after individuals were reared at two temperatures (17 degrees C and 24 degrees C). Results: We found mixed evidence for the role of thermal variation in maintaining plasticity. Thermal plasticity for offspring number and age at maturity varied seasonally; however, inconsistent with our hypothesis, neither response was related to stratification. Similarly, we observed lower plasticity for the clutch interval when the lake experienced peak thermal stratification in mid-summer compared with early-fall conditions. In contrast, plasticity for critical maximum temperature (CTmax) was highest during peak stratification. As CTmax is a direct measurement of upper thermal limits, it should be related to maximum temperature experienced in the water column. Thus, this result is consistent with a positive correlation between thermal variation and plasticity. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the degree of plasticity in response to temperature varies throughout the season in relation to thermal stratification, with different life-history traits showing distinct seasonal patterns of plasticity.

Julio; Liang, Eryuan			Spring Hydroclimate Reconstruction on the South-Central Tibetan Plateau Inferred From Juniperus Pingii Var. Wilsonii Shrub Rings Since 1605	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Alpine regions on the Tibetan Plateau are sensitive to climate change, however, little is known about their long-term hydroclimate variability due to short and few instrumental records. Alpine shrub provides a rare opportunity to reconstruct past high-resolution hydroclimate conditions. Here, we used living and dead juniper shrubs (Juniperus pingii var. wilsonii) to develop a 537-year ring width chronology nearby the Nam Co Lake (4,725 m a.s.l.). The chronology explained 46% of variance in May-June Standardized Moisture Anomaly Index (SZI) in the period from 1970 to 2010. We reconstructed May-June SZI since 1605. The reconstructed SZI matched well with several tree-ring based moisture or drought reconstructions for the Tibetan Plateau. In particular, two long dry May-June periods of 1637-1683 and 1708-1785 during the Little Ice Age (LIA) implied that long-term cold temperature tends to slow down hydrological cycle in the margin areas of the Indian summer monsoon. Plain Language Summary As the Third Pole, the Tibetan Plateau is a core region for global change studies given that it is warming at twice the global average rate. The central Tibetan Plateau with an elevation above 4,500 m a.s.l. is characterized by extremely cold and dry treeless environment. However, very few alpine shrub species there provide a rare opportunity to retrieve changes of alpine ecosystem by shrub-ring analysis. In spite of their small basal diameters (mean of 12 cm), we established a 537-year standard shrub ring chronology by crossdating living and dead Wilson juniper shrubs sampled above 4,740 m a.s.l. on the central Tibetan Plateau. It is, to date, one of the world's longest shrub-ring chronologies. Shrub-ring chronology from 1605 to 2010 was then used to reconstruct mean May-June drought severity (Standardized Moisture Anomaly Index). Two long-term dry spring periods (1637-1683 and 1708-1785) occurred during the Little Ice Age (LIA), implying that cold temperature slows down hydrological cycle. This study highlights the importance of alpine juniper shrubs in understanding hydrological cycle in dry, continental alpine treeless areas.

J	Rodionov, S; Assel, R				Rodionov, S; Assel, R			Atmospheric teleconnection patterns and severity of winters in the laurentian Great Lakes basin	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												We analyzed the relationship between an index of Great Lakes winter severity (winters 1950-1998) and atmosphere circulation characteristics. Classification and Regression Tree analysis methods allowed us to develop a simpler characterization of warm, normal and cold winters in terms of teleconnection and their combinations. Results are presented in the form of decision trees. The single most important classifies for warm winters was the Polar/Eurasian index (POL). A majority of warm winters (12 out of 15) occurred when this index was substantially positive (POL > 0.23). There were no cold winters (12 out of 15) occurred when this index was substantially positive (POL > 0.23). There were no cold winters when this condition was in place. Warm winters are associated with a positive phase of the Western Pacific pattern and El Nino events in the equatorial Pacific. The association between cold winters and La Nina events was much weaker. Thus, the effect of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on severity of winters in the great Lakes basin is not symmetric. The structure of the relationship between the index of winter severity and telecommunication indices is more complex for cold winters than for warm winters. It takes two or more indices to successfully classify cold winters. In general, warm winters are characterized by a predominantly zonal type of atmospheric circulation over the Northern Hemisphere (type W1). Within this type of circulation it is possible to distinguish two sub-types, W2 and W3. Sub-type W2 is characterized by a high-pressure cell over North America, which is accompanied by enhanced cyclonic activity over the eastern North Pacific. Due to a broad southerly "anomalous" flow, surface air temperatures (SATs) are above normal almost everywhere over the continent. During the W3 sub-type, the polar jet stream over North America instead of forming a typical ridge-trough pattern, is almost entirely zonal, thus effectively blocking an advection of cold Arctic air to the south. Cold winters tend to occur when the atmospheric circulation is more meridional (type C1). As with warm winters, there are two sub-types of circulation, C2 and C3. In the case of C2, the jet stream loops southward over the western part of North America, but its northern excursion over the eastern part is suppressed. In this situation, the probability of a cold winter is higher for Lake Superior than for the lower Great Lakes. Sub-type C3 is characterized by an amplification of the climatological ridge over the Rockies and the trough over the East Coast. The strongest negative SAT anomalies are located south of the Great Lakes basin, so that the probability of a cold winter is higher for the lower Great Lakes then for Lake Superior.					; Rodionov, Sergei/KJL-0449-2024	Rodionov, Sergei/0000-0002-5318-9746; 													0705-5900	1480-9214				DEC	2000	38	4					601	635		10.1080/07055900.2000.9649661	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07055900.2000.9649661													WOS:000166406700004

Sixteen Milu adult individuals (5 male 11 female) were reintroduced from Jiangsu Dafeng Milu National Nature Reserve to Hunan East Dongting Lake National Nature Reserve on February 28, 2016, out of which 11 Milu individuals (1 male 10 female) were wearing GPS satellite tracking collars. Subsequently, with the aid of GPS collar technology, combined with on-ground tracking observations, we tracked the reintroduced Milu for one year from March 2016 to February 2017. We used the dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Model to estimate the individual home range of the 10 rewilded Milu (1 male 9 female, 1 female individual was eliminated because its collar fell off) and seasonal home range of 5 rewilded female Milu (all tracked for up to one year). 95% level represented the home range, and 50% level represented the core areas. Temporal variation in normalized difference vegetation index were used to quantify changes in food availability. We also quantified resource use of rewilded Milu by calculating the selection ratio for all habitats within their core areas. The results showed that: (1) a total of 52,960 coordinate fixes were collected; (2) during the early stage of rewilding, the average home range size of the rewilded Milu was 17.62 +/- 3.79 km(2) and the average core areas size was 0.77 +/- 0.10 km(2); (3) the annual average home range size of the female deer was 26.08 +/- 5.21 km(2) and the annual average core areas size was 1.01 +/- 0.14 km(2) at the early stage of rewilding; (4) during the early stage of rewilding, the home range and core areas of the rewilded Milu were significantly affected by season, and the difference between summer and winter was significant (home range: p = 0.003; core areas: p = 0.008); (5) home range and core areas of the rewilded female deer in the Dongting Lake area in different seasons showed significant negative correlation with NDVI (home range: p = 0.000; core areas: p = 0.003); (6) Most rewilded female Milu showed a high preference for farmland in all seasons except winter, when they focused on using lake and beach. The home range of the rewilded Milu in the Dongting Lake area at the early stage of rewilding experienced significantly seasonal changes. Our study reveals seasonal differences in the home ranges of rewilded Milu and the resource use strategies of individual Milu in response to seasonal changes. At last, we put forward the following management recommendations: (1) to establish habitat islands; (2) to implement community co-management; (3) to reduce human disturbance; (4) to strengthen population monitoring for formulating species conservation plans.
