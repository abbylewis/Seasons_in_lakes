Boat effects on lake water clarity and the efficacy of a no-wake zone policy	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Boating activity in shallow waters of lakes can lead to sediment resuspension and potential nutrient release, affecting water quality parameters. No-wake zones, to minimize boating-induced effects, are often defined based on distance from shore. This study assessed the effects of boating on shallow waters and the efficacy of an existing no-wake zone policy in a midsize lake. Two experiments were conducted: (1) Turbidity and pressure data were collected along a broad shallow shelf on the southern shore of Lake Tahoe in the summer of 2019 and (2) turbidity and pressure observations were conducted while boats traveled at speeds between 8 kmh-1 (5 mph) and 40 kmh-1 over a water depth of approximate to 2.5 m. Results showed that boat-induced sediment resuspension occurred at speeds exceeding 8 kmh-1, with turbidity increases of up to similar to 7 NTU. Boat-induced filtered pressure signal was a maximum of 40% of the total daily wave activity, with peaks observed between 10:00 and 12:00. Nevertheless, during the summer and fall of 2019, winds were the dominant driver of sediment resuspension, contributing around 80% of the total wavefield. An evaluation of the current no-wake zone policy at Lake Tahoe suggested that an 8 kmh-1 (5 mph) speed limit is suitable for preventing wake effects. However, the policy falls short in preventing sediment resuspension in the northwestern and southern shores of Lake Tahoe. This calls for the consideration of multiple variables, such as lakebed sediment type and water depth, when defining no-wake zone policies to effectively mitigate boating-induced effects.

Using a total of 15 mesocosms (3x3x1.5m, with similar to 10.8m(3) natural seawater containing phytoplankton assemblages for each), we found P-enrichment caused no obvious effect on phytoplankton (Chl a) growth across 8-day's cultivation in neither winter nor summer, while nitrogen (N)-enrichment greatly increased Chl a in both seasons. N plus P-enrichment further increased Chl a content. The N- or N plus P-enrichments increased the allocation of nano-Chl a but decreased micro-Chl a in most cases, with no obvious effect by P-alone. Coincided with nutrients effect on Chl a content, N- or N plus P-enrichments significantly enhanced the maximum photochemical quantum yield of Photosystem II (F-V/F-M) and maximum relative electron transport rate (rETR(max)), but declined the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), as well as the threshold for light saturation of electron transport (E-K); again, P-enrichment had no significant effect. Moreover, the absorption cross section for PSII photochemistry (sigma(PSII)) and electron transport efficiency () increased due to N- or N plus P-enrichments, indicating the increased nutrients enhance the light utilization efficiency through promoting PSII light harvesting ability, and thus to enhance phytoplankton growth. Our findings indicate that N- or N plus P-enrichments rigorously fuel phytoplankton blooms regardless of N:P ratios, making a note of caution on the expected P-deficiency or P-limitation on the basis of Redfield N:P ratios in Daya Bay. HighlightsMesocosm P-enrichment have no effect on photosynthetic performance and growth of phytoplankton assemblages in both winter and summer periods;Nitrogen (N) enrichment enhanced photosynthetic capacity of phytoplankton and fueled their blooms;Nitrogen (N) or N plus phosphorus (P) enrichments induced an increase of allocation of nanophytoplankton, but a decrease of microphytoplankton in most cases.

Although the underlying mechanisms are yet unclear, an analysis of local meteorological data suggests that this phenomenon is unlikely to be related to any change in air temperature associated with the eruptions, but instead may be related to an increase in autumn precipitation subsequent to the eruptions that led to the erosion and fluvial transport of particles larger than normal.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2008	39	1					35	42		10.1007/s10933-007-9093-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-007-9093-2													WOS:000251730600004

THE BAROCLINIC CASE	DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS					SYMP AT THE 14TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE EUROPEAN GEOPHYSICAL SOC - THE MEDITERRANEAN BASIN : A CASE STUDY FOR GENERAL CIRCULATION, MESOSCALE DYNAMICS AND CONVECTION	MAR, 1989	BARCELONA, SPAIN	EUROPEAN GEOPHYS SOC				Compared with other interesting parts of the World Ocean, little is known of the eastern Mediterranean and major issues of the Mediterranean circulation are still unsolved. Among them, the most crucial one is: what is the dominant driving mechanism of the eastern Mediterranean general circulation: (1) the wind stress; (2) the thermohaline surface fluxes; (3) the inflow forcing at the Sicily Straits? What is the relative importance of these three forcing functions? Is it the same in the different sub-basins comprising the eastern Mediterranean? What modelling factors are important for the simulation of the seasonal cycle and is the general circulation overall dominated by the annual mean or seasonal signal? To answer the above questions we have carried out an extensive and thorough series of numerical experiments using a multilevel model of the circulation, suitable for coarse-resolution studies but endowed with active thermodynamics and allowing for realistic geometry (coastlines, islands, bottom relief). The model is used in a three-level version as the minimum one capable of simulating the vertical superposition of different water masses observed in the eastern Mediterranean. The climatological monthly averages of wind-stress, thermal and evaporative fluxes and inflow at Sicily are used to drive the model. In Part I of the present study it was shown that the seasonal cycle present in the wind-stress curl induces a strongly seasonal barotropic circulation comprising the entire eastern Mediterranean. This seasonal gyre reverses from being cyclonic in winter to anticyclonic in summer. The inclusion of baroclinicity, however, profoundly modifies the purely wind-driven, barotropic circulation, eliminating the strong seasonality and the winter-to-summer reversal. The first important result is that the general circulation pattern now consists of a succession of sub-basin-scale gyres, with a seasonal modulation emphasizing the cyclonic centres in winter and the anticyclonic ones in summer, according to the vorticity input by the wind. When surface thermal forcing is included, the winter-to-summer differences become very small and the yearly pattern is dominant. The second important result is that the intercomparisons of the various numerical experiments in which each driving mechanism is studied in isolation from the others allows us to classify unambiguously the three forcing mechanisms in order of relative importance in driving the circulation in the different sub-basins of the eastern Mediterranean. Specifically, for the Ionian Sea and Sea of Crete the dominant forcing is the inflow at the Straits of Sicily while for the Levantine Sea thermohaline fluxes are the main driving function. The wind-stress forcing induces a seasonal fluctuation only in the meandering path of the Atlantic jet entering the Ionian Sea through the Sicily Straits. We finally carry out a 'central experiment', the most realistic one in which all forcing functions drive the circulation that we compare quantitatively with other model results and qualitatively with observations. Major features can be recognized and are shown to be persistent all year long. These features are also found in the dynamic heights of the general hydrographic surveys of the Physical Oceanography of the Eastern Mediterranean (POEM) programme. The only POEM feature not reproduced by the model, an intense anticyclonic region in the south eastern Levantine, may be attributed to errors and specifically underestimates, of the available thermal fluxes whose effect is partially overcome by the wind-stress forcing. This anticyclonic cell is in fact obtained when the model is driven by the thermal fluxes alone. Overall, the model results compare well with the observational evidence provided by the POEM surveys and the thermohaline vertical circulation cell reproduced by the model is consistent with the preliminary results of the transient-tracer survey POEM-V-87. Finally, many of the persistent features found in the model circulation patterns can be related to the strong control exerted by the ambient potential vorticity f/H upon the eastern Mediterranean circulation.

J	HILSENHOFF, WL				HILSENHOFF, WL			GYRINIDAE OF WISCONSIN, WITH A KEY TO ADULTS OF BOTH SEXES AND NOTES ON DISTRIBUTION AND HABITAT	GREAT LAKES ENTOMOLOGIST												More than 25,000 adult gyrinids that include 24 species were studied from all areas of Wisconsin. Dineutus discolor, Gyrinus aeneolus, G. analis, G. bifarius, and G. marginellus are lotic; D. assimilis, G. aquiris, G. confinis and G. dichrous apparently breed in both lotic and lentic habitats; and the remaining species probably breed primarily in deep ponds or littoral areas of lakes and impoundments. Most collections were from streams in late summer and autumn because adults of almost all lentic species fly to streams to overwinter and these overwintering aggregations were easily collected. A key to adults of Wisconsin species was developed, and by using the gonocoxae and secondary sexual characters, females can be identified as accurately as males.																			0090-0222					SUM	1990	23	2					77	91																WOS:A1990DX58200003

In this study, we took China's Taihu Lake as the research area, using multi-source satellite imagery data to monitor the information of algal blooms from 2008 to 2017. Following the analyses of the temporal and spatial variation trends of the blooms, water quality and meteorological data from land observation stations were employed to investigate the main environmental driving forces of the algal bloom outbreaks. The results show that, over the decade, the blooms with medium and higher hazard degrees mainly occurred in summer and autumn, and especially in autumn. From 2008 to 2016, the algal blooms outbreak degree was relatively stable, but, in 2017, it was severe, and the Northwest Lake area and the northern bays had heavier blooms than the other lake areas. From the analyses of the environmental driving forces, the variation trend of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in Taihu Lake from 2008 to 2017 was moderate, and the minimum concentrations of TN and TP both exceeded the threshold for algal bloom outbreaks. It was also found that the algal bloom area had notable correlations with the sunshine duration, wind speed and direction, precipitation, and air pressure. The research results of this paper will provide a theoretical basis for the scientific prediction of the occurrence of algal blooms in Taihu Lake.

Recently, the occurrence of odor compounds geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB), in Lake Paldang has adversely affected the drinking water supply. The causative organisms of odor compounds have not been identified. Thus, this study analyzed the correlation between odor compounds and microorganisms and identified the odor-producing microorganisms in the Han River system. Odor compounds were primarily detected in the Bukhan River system but not in the Namhan River system. Geosmin was detected at high concentrations in summer, whereas 2-MIB was detected at high concentrations in summer and autumn. Microorganisms that appeared at the time of geosmin occurrence were actinobacteria (0.317, p < 0.01) and Dolichospermum (0.326, p < 0.01) among cyanobacteria, and the correlation was significant. The occurrence of 2-MIB mainly coincided with actinobacteria (0.745, p < 0.01) and Pseudanabaena (0.321, p < 0.01) among cyanobacteria, and the correlation was significant. Therefore, to manage the odor compounds in Lake Paldang, which is a drinking water source, it is important to control the appearance of actinobacteria and cyanobacteria in the Bukhan River system.					; Kim, Baik-Ho/D-9356-2011	BYEON, Myeongseop/0000-0003-0997-2415; 													1606-9749	1607-0798				MAR	2023	23	3					1081	1093		10.2166/ws.2023.037	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/ws.2023.037		FEB 2023											WOS:000934477300001

Identifying Environmental Cues for Atlantic Sturgeon and Shortnose Sturgeon Spawning Migrations in the Savannah River	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We investigated environmental cues for spawning migration behavior of Atlantic Sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus and Shortnose Sturgeon A. brevirostrum in the lower Savannah River, South Carolina and Georgia, from January 2013 to May 2018. Sturgeon were implanted with acoustic transmitters and detected on an array of 45 stationary receivers located every 5-10 km between Savannah Harbor and the upstream-most barrier to movement (301 fluvial kilometers). Throughout the study period, we observed six Atlantic Sturgeon attempting nine fall migrations (n = 918 records), four Atlantic Sturgeon attempting eight spring migrations (n = 257 records), and 15 Shortnose Sturgeon attempting 29 spring migrations (n = 3,542 records). Cues for the initiation of migration and upriver movement were species-specific. We observed significance in the main effects of water temperature, 3-d lagged temperature, maximum discharge, and 3-d lagged discharge, as well as in the interaction effect of 3-d lagged temperature x 3-d lagged discharge. Water temperature was the primary predictor of sturgeon migrations, which can be used to determine spawning season, but discharge also played a significant role in predicting upriver movement, particularly when high flows began to diminish. Directed flow regulation (e.g., intermittent flood pulsing) during key temperature thresholds may better facilitate the upriver movement of sturgeons and aid in the conservation of these imperiled species.

Observations of Thermally Driven Wind Jets at the Exit of Weber Canyon, Utah	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Thermally driven valley-exit jets were investigated at Utah's Weber Canyon, a main tributary of the Great Salt Lake basin. An intensive measurement campaign during July-September 2010 supplemented longer-term measurements to characterize the wind and temperature structure in the vicinity of the canyon exit. Exit jets at Weber Canyon are most frequent in late summer or early fall. Strong low-level-wind jets formed at the canyon exit on 75 of 90 nights (83%) during the measurement campaign, with the best-developed winds forming during synoptically undisturbed, clear-sky periods. Winds inside the canyon consisted of a weak down-valley flow layer that occupied most of the 1000-m depth of the canyon. The flow was observed to descend, thin, and accelerate at the valley exit, producing winds that were typically 2.5 times as strong but much more shallow than those inside the canyon. Maximum nighttime jet-axis wind speeds of 15-20 m s(-1) are typically found about 80-120 m above the ground at the canyon exit on clear undisturbed nights in the late summer and fall. The jets form 1-3 h after sunset, approach a near-steady state during the late night, and continue until 5-6 h after sunrise, although slowly losing speed after sunrise. The jet is a local modification at the canyon exit of the thermally driven down-valley flow. Its continuation after sunrise is thought to be caused by the nighttime buildup and persistence of a cold-air pool in the Morgan Basin at the east end of the canyon. The potential for utilizing the exit jet for wind power generation is discussed.																			1558-8424	1558-8432				MAY	2013	52	5					1187	1200		10.1175/JAMC-D-12-0221.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAMC-D-12-0221.1													WOS:000319057700011

The glacial kettle lakes range in area from 2.6-25 ha and in depth from 9.1-19.2 m. The lakes have several things in common: long periods of ice and snow cover, poor O2 conditions in their lower waters, thin epilimnia, cold lower hypolimnetic waters, a slightly stained dystrophic appearance, and relatively low Secchi disk values. Richter Lake was selected for the most detailed studies. If its vernal and autumnal mixing are fairly representative, then problems of aperiodic winterkill in these small but relatively deep lakes are more easily understood. Richter has a strong winter and summer stratification, an incomplete vernal mixing, and only a brief period of complete autumnal mixing. Because of this, the poor or marginal conditions in the lower waters are perpetuated from season to season without an adqeuate mixing or breathing spell for the lake. Lake Kathryn winterkills to some extent nearly every winter. Lake Thirty-three has some meromictic characteristics.																			0003-9136						1983	98	2					250	264																WOS:A1983RN59800008

Pollen-based climate quantification provides a reconstruction of seasonal parameters. The development of in-situ water-dependant plants and of forests at lower altitude at 8200 cal a BP echoes the shift from an arid and cold [annual precipitation (P-ann)=452mm; mean temperature of the coldest month (MTCO)=-11.1 degrees C)] Early Holocene to a more humid and warmer (P-ann=721mm; MTCO=-6.8 degrees C) Mid-Late Holocene. This marks the onset of lower seasonality, in particular more effective precipitation brought during late spring by the Westerlies. Paralleling the Mediterranean precipitation pattern, precipitation in the Near East and Central Asia decreased during the Mid-Late Holocene in favour of higher seasonality controlled in winter/spring by the Siberian High. Fire history and sedge-based fen development record drier phases at approximately 6400, 5300-4900, 3000, 2200-1500 and 400 cal a BP, which resemble the precipitation pattern of the South-Western Mediterranean and contrast with the Holocene pattern in the South-Central and South-Eastern Mediterranean regions. Arid phases in Armenia are believed to be related to multi-centennial-scale variation of Westerly activity (North Atlantic Oscillation-like).

Shot ingestion in scaup on the lower Great Lakes after nontoxic shot regulations in Canada	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Use of lead shot for waterfowl hunting was banned in the United States in 1991 to reduce the incidence of lead toxicosis in waterfowl. In 1999 Canada implemented a similar ban. The lower Great Lakes (LGL) are important migratory areas for greater (Aythya marila) and lesser scaup (A. affinis). Prior to the implementation of the Canadian ban, 11% and 8% of greater and lesser scaup harvested in the LGL, respectively, had ingested lead shot We collected greater and lesser scaup on the Canadian side of lakes Erie, Ontario, and St. Clair during autumn 1999 and spring 2000 to determine if lead shot ingestion declined 1 year after the ban in Canada. There were no intraspecific (lake, season, sex, or age) or interspecific differences in proportion of birds containing ingested shot. Overall, only 0.6% of birds (n = 4 of 722) contained lead shot and only 3.1% contained nontoxic shot. The low frequency of toxic relative to nontoxic shot ingestion suggests that shot may quickly become inaccessible to scaup on lacustrine areas of the Great Lakes. Thus, the risk of lead toxicosis to scaup migrating through the LGL appears low at this time. Pre- and postban differences in overall ingestion frequencies (8-11% vs. 3.7%) suggests that preban numbers may have been biased (elevated) because lead shot ingestion can increase harvest susceptibility. However, recent scaup dietary shifts may also have contributed to overall declines in shot consumption. Low postban lead shot ingestion may also be indicative of high hunter compliance with nontoxic shot regulations in Canada.																			1938-5463					NOV	2006	34	4					1101	1106		10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[1101:SIISOT]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[1101:SIISOT]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000243173600026
J	Ronconi, RA				Ronconi, Robert A.			Predicting bird oiling events at oil sands tailings ponds and assessing the importance of alternate waterbodies for waterfowl: A preliminary assessment	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Tailings ponds are an integral part of oil sands mining development in northeastern Alberta, but waterfowl and shorebirds often land in these ponds during spring migration where they may become covered with oil. For decades, managers have developed and implemented methods for deterring birds from landing in these ponds, yet no deterrent strategy is fully effective. Therefore, to enhance deterrence strategies, it will be important to understand the environmental conditions that influence bird use of tailings ponds. This study quantified waterfowl flights over, and use of, tailings ponds and compared this use to waterfowl activity at natural waterbodies in the region over a single spring migration period. Results suggest that waterfowl are most likely to land on tailings ponds before lakes have thawed, after which migratory ducks appeared mainly to use natural waterbodies for migratory stopover sites. Very high numbers of waterfowl were observed on one waterbody, Kearl Lake, suggesting that this lake may be of greater importance to spring staging waterfowl than previously thought. A small sample of birds oiled at tailings ponds were examined in relation to spring weather conditions. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the probability of birds being oiled tended to increase with precipitation levels. Results of this study suggest that (1) preservation of natural waterbodies may play an important role in minimizing bird use of tailings ponds, and (2) future bird deterrence efforts should especially aim to deter birds during rainy weather conditions when birds may be more likely to become oiled. These results were from a small sample size, are preliminary in nature, and should be interpreted with caution.

Seasonal refugia and trophic dormancy in Gulf sturgeon: Test and refutation of the thermal barrier hypothesis	ANADROMOUS STURGEONS: HABITATS, THREATS, AND MANAGEMENT	American Fisheries Society Symposium				Symposium on Anadromous Sturgeons - Status and Trends, Anthropogenic Impacts, and Essential Habitats	AUG 11-13, 2003	Quebec City, CANADA					During summer, anadromous Gulf sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi in the Suwannee River congregate in several localized areas, termed holding areas. While they are residing in these areas, their movement and feeding activity appear to be limited. Holding areas have been hypothesized to be areas under the cooling influence of Floridan Aquifer spring water, which forms cool thermal refugia relative to the main-stem river and the Gulf of Mexico. According to the thermal barrier hypothesis, (1) Gulf-sturgeon in the Suwannee River become restricted to local coolwater refugia; (2) within these refugia, benthic prey rapidly become depleted, such that Gulf sturgeon cannot feed and lose weight as summer progresses; and (3) confined to the thermal refugia, sturgeon cannot gain access to macrofaunal prey in other (warmer) reaches of the river. No aspect of the thermal barrier-spring water refuge hypothesis has ever been tested, and scant supporting evidence has been presented. Given that important Gulf sturgeon population management and critical habitat protection decisions depend on an accurate knowledge of sturgeon life history in relation to critical habitats, we tested this hypothesis. Two major Suwannee River Gulf sturgeon holding areas were compared with nonholding areas in terms of three parameters: water temperature, macrolaunal benthos prey availability, and within-year and within-summer movement patterns. The results for all three parameters refute the thermal barrier hypothesis. Furthermore, the literature on the world's sturgeon species establishes that prolonged periods of trophic dormancy and residence in local holding areas within rivers are common life history attributes of many sturgeon species, Occurring under greatly varying temperature conditions. The common attribute of holding areas is that they provide refuge from high-velocity currents within deep holes, depressions, or back eddies. Sturgeon seek out low-velocity microhabitats within high-velocity, big-river macrohabitats. Residence in a refuge and limitation of swimming activity are probably important to energy conservation during normal periods of trophic dormancy and/or when environmental conditions are physiologically limiting. In the Suwannee River, a typical Gulf sturgeon holding area consists of a 500-2,000-m-long, 3-4-4-in-deep, sand-bottom run lying just below a 4-7-m-deep scour hole that is limited downstream by a 1-2-m-deep sand shoal.																			0892-2284		978-1-888569-91-9				2007	56						19	+																WOS:000247562200002

The Snagov Lake is a natural lake located at 25-30 km North from Romania's capital, Bucharest. The study was conducted during a five years period, from April 2010 until October 2014. The measurements used (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, transparency, chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus, TN/TP ratio) are presented in the form of spatial and temporal evolutions. For self-purification identification the aerobic mineralization degree, biological deputation factor and TN/TP ratio were used. The trophic stage of Snagov Lake in the range and in all the points of sampling is eutrophic-hipereutrophic for all the parameters used for assessment, excepting several short periods of time (fall of 2010, spring and fall of 2011) when the lake was in mesotrophic state.

Evaluating stocking success and angler use of Yellow Perch in marginal waters	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective: Marginal waters, or waters that do not maintain consistent fisheries and may be more susceptible to fish kills, present opportunities for angler recruitment, retention, and reactivation through stocking. However, higher potential for fish kills make marginal waters difficult to manage, as there may be limited time for fish survival and growth and angler utilization. This study aimed to evaluate the success of Yellow Perch Perca flavescens marginal water stockings at producing fisheries in southeastern South Dakota. Our objectives were to evaluate if (1) stocking these waters could produce populations of catchable-sized Yellow Perch, (2) angler use was related to Yellow Perch relative abundance on these waters, and (3) these populations would persist without substantial fish kills. Methods: Yellow Perch were stocked at various sizes in 2019 and 2020 in nine marginal waters. Gill-net catch was evaluated in the fall at ages 0, 1, and 2. Angler use was quantified using trail cameras during the winter angling period after the fall age-1 and age-2 sampling. We evaluated the influence of age-1 and age-2 gill-net catch and age-2 mean total length on total angler use in the subsequent winter using linear regression. Results: Angler use was low at all waters when stocked Yellow Perch were age 2 going into winter, but angler use showed a positive response to increasing age-2 gill-net catch. Waters stocked with low densities of age-1 Yellow Perch produced higher age-2 gill-net catch than waters stocked with age-0 products (eyed eggs, fry, or small fingerlings). At least eight of the nine study waters experienced a fish kill event during or immediately after the conclusion of the study. Conclusions: Even though our results suggest that stocking advanced hatchery products may produce fisheries, low angler use and the high incidence of fish kills limit recommendation of this action.

Last glacial hydrological variations at the southern margin of sub-tropical North America and a regional comparison	JOURNAL OF QUATERNARY SCIENCE												Geochemical and magnetic characteristics of sediments from paleolake La Salada provide information about the last glacial hydrological conditions at the southern margin of sub-tropical North America. Proxy records of runoff, lake water salinity, brine composition and provenance of organic matter are based on multi-element concentration, magnetic susceptibility, mineralogy, carbonate content and C/N relation. Runoff was higher than average during ca. 43-36k cal a BP and at ca. 33k cal a BP. A shift in mineralogical assemblage from calcite > protodolomite-halite to protodolomite-gaylussite suggests that the brine composition changed from Ca-(Mg-Na)-HCO3-(Cl) to Mg-Na-Ca-HCO3 because of more runoff after the desiccation event at ca. 28k cal a BP. In general, organic matter deposited during the intervals of more runoff and deeper lake conditions were sourced from lacustrine phytoplankton. The contribution of terrestrial vegetation dominates during the intervals of reduced runoff. Comparison with other records provides a regional perspective of moisture variability. Humid conditions at ca. 33k cal a BP could be due to more summer precipitation in northern Mexico as well as increased winter rainfall in the south-western USA.

J	KRANTZBERG, G				KRANTZBERG, G			SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN METAL BIOAVAILABILITY AND TOXICITY OF SEDIMENT FROM HAMILTON HARBOR, LAKE-ONTARIO	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Trace metals in sediment from nearshore urban and industrialized centres of the Great Lakes are frequently at concentrations well above geological background values. Total metal content in sediment, however, is a weak predictor of sediment toxicity. This study examined the bioavailability of metals from Hamilton Harbour in Lake Ontario and considered variability in metal forms on a temporal basis. Sediment from regions within Hamilton Harbour is highly contaminated with metals; nevertheless, not all metal-contaminated sites were toxic to test organisms. Most sediment did elicit sublethal and/or lethal responses in bioassay organisms. Metal bioavailability, as measured by weak acid extractions, metal bioaccumulation by fathead minnows, and sediment toxicity, was greater in sediment collected in the fall as compared to sediment collected in the spring. Results of analyses of tissue residues in test organisms and the reduced toxicity observed in sediment collected from some stations in the spring as compared to the fall implicate trace metals and sediment oxygen demand as contributing to sediment toxicity. The suitability for colonization by benthic invertebrates of sediment in some areas of Hamilton Harbour appears to be limited by both contaminants and high sediment oxygen demand. Improving the oxygen regime of the harbour should result in improvements in the benthic invertebrate community directly, by providing a suitable oxygen regime for organisms less tolerant of temporal anoxia, and indirectly by decreasing metal bioavailability, possibly through the co-precipitation of trace metals with iron and manganese hydroxides.					krantzberg, gail/A-5404-2008														0730-7268	1552-8618				OCT	1994	13	10					1685	1698		10.1002/etc.5620131019	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620131019													WOS:A1994PH80300019
J	Jara, IA; Maldonado, A; de Porras, ME				Jara, Ignacio A.; Maldonado, Antonio; Eugenia de Porras, Maria			Late Holocene dynamics of the south American summer monsoon: New insights from the Andes of northern Chile (21°S)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The South American summer monsoon (SASM) is the most important climate system of tropical South America, transporting moisture from the tropical Atlantic Ocean to the core of the continent during the austral summer. Recent paleoclimate studies suggest that past variability of the SASM has been more heterogenous in space and time than previously thought, implying that different atmospheric drivers controlled its long-term evolution. Unfortunately, past SASM reconstructions are largely limited to the last 2000 years and mainly focused on the core of the monsoon domain where precipitation does not fall exclusively during the monsoon season, thereby limiting our understanding of its long-term changes, drivers and mechanisms. Here we present a new 4000-year SASM precipitation reconstruction based on a high-resolution pollen sequence from a mountain lake in the dry Andes of northern Chile (21 degrees S). We provide evidence for two centennial-scale intervals of enhanced SASM precipitation between 4000 -3400 and 2300-1900 cal yr BP. These intervals are replicated in records from the southern portion of the central Andes (>18 degrees S) but not clearly detected further north, suggesting the existence of a monsoon dynamics largely decoupled from latitudinal shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. A comparison with precipitation reconstructions from the entire SASM domain and modern climate datasets suggests a teleconnection with the Southern Hemisphere circulation through the intensification of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone and/or the intrusion of extra-tropical Atlantic moisture. Our results highlight that significant spatial and temporal variability of the SASM occurred during the most recent millennia, and therefore social and environmental forecast should consider that similar variations will likely occur in the future.

We compared summer CO2 and CH4 fluxes (diffusion and ebullition) in littoral and pelagic zones of three subtropical shallow lakes with contrasting regimes: clear-vegetated, phytoplankton-turbid, and sediment-turbid, and assessed fluxes in different seasons in the clear-vegetated system. Significant differences among the lakes occurred only for CH4 fluxes. In the sediment-turbid lake we found undersaturated CH4 concentrations were below atmospheric equilibrium, implying CH4 uptake (< 0 mg m(-2) day(-1)), likely due to low availability of organic matter. Differences between zones occurred in the clear-vegetated and phytoplankton-turbid lakes, with higher total CH4 emissions in the littoral than in the pelagic zones (mean: 4342 +/- 895 and 983 +/- 801 mg m(-2) day(-1), respectively). CO2 uptake (< < 0 mg m(-2) day(-1)) occurred in the littoral of the phytoplankton-turbid lake (in summer), and in the pelagic of the clear-vegetated lake even in winter, likely associated with submerged macrophytes dominance. Our work highlights the key role of different primary producers regulating carbon fluxes in shallow lakes and points out that, also in the subtropics, submerged macrophyte dominance may decrease carbon emissions to the atmosphere.

In both species, decline in incidence of infection with increasing eel size was because of a similar decline in occurrence of the amphipod host, Paracalliope fluviatilis, in the diet. Similarly, an increasing infection rate in longfinned eels from spring to summer is also thought to be because of dietary changes. There was no evidence that H. spinigera reduced conditions in either eel species.																			0301-4223	1175-8821					1989	16	2					185	189		10.1080/03014223.1989.10422567	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03014223.1989.10422567													WOS:A1989AT95100003

Northern rivers and their deltas are particularly vulnerable due to the disproportionate warming of the Northern Hemisphere compared with the Southern Hemisphere. Of special interest is the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) in western Canada, a productive deltaic lake and wetland ecosystem, which has been recognized as a Ramsar site. Both climate- and regulation-induced changes to the hydrological regime of the Peace River have raised concerns over the delta's ecological health. With the damming of the headwaters, the role of downstream unregulated tributaries has become more important in maintaining, to a certain degree, a natural flow regime, particularly during open-water conditions. However, their flow contributions to the mainstem river under future climatic conditions remain largely uncertain. In this study, we first evaluated the ability of a land-surface hydrological model to simulate hydro-ecological relevant indicators, highlighting the model's strengths and weaknesses. Then, we investigated the streamflow conditions in the Smoky River, the largest unregulated tributary of the Peace River, in the 2071-2100 versus the 1981-2010 periods. Our modelling results revealed significant changes in the hydrological regime of the Smoky River, such as increased discharge in winter (+190%) and spring (+130%) but reduced summer flows (-33%) in the 2071-2100 period compared with the baseline period, which will have implications for the sustainability of the downstream PAD. In particular, the projected reductions in 30-day and 90-day maximum flows in the Smoky River will affect open-water flooding, which is important in maintaining lake levels and connectivity to perimeter delta wetlands in the Peace sector of the PAD. The evaluation of breakup and freeze-up flows for the 2071-2100 period showed mixed implications for the ice-jam flooding, which is essential for recharging high-elevation deltaic basins. Thus, despite projected increase in annual and spring runoff in the 2071-2100 period from the Smoky sub-basin, the sustainability of the PAD still remains uncertain.

J	Stich, HB				Stich, HB			Back again:: The reappearance of Diaphanosoma brachyurum in Lake Constance	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Diaphanosoma brachyurum disappeared from the cladoceran community of Lake Constance in 1962 but reappeared in 2001. The disappearance coincided with eutrophication and the reappearance with oligotrophication of the lake. This was surprising, as Diaphanosoma brachyurum is often characterized as a species that favours meso- to eutrophic habitats. In 2001, the cladoceran occurred from late summer until autumn reaching maximum density in September that coincided with a high density of small algae. Vertical distribution of Diaphanosoma brachyurum was typically restricted to the upper 10 m to 20 m of the water column. Besides oligotrophication, the reappearance coincided with a low abundance of whitefish, Leptodora kindtii and Daphnia galeata. Although the ultimate cause is unknown, reduced predation and competition likely contributed to the reappearance of Diaphanosoma brachyurum in Lake Constance.																			0003-9136					MAR	2004	159	3					423	431		10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0159-0423	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0159-0423													WOS:000220868000008

Therefore, it is difficult to study how coastal forests respond to climatic change or their resilience to human impact. We developed new sedimentary record of Holocene vegetation and fire history at Lago Preola, a coastal lake in southwestern Sicily (Italy). In order to verify the existence of forest at large scale on the coast, we compare pollen from Lago Preola, a medium-sized lake (33 ha), to Gorgo Basso, a small lake (3 ha) located nearby with the aim of separating local from extra-local vegetation dynamics through time using pollen percentages and influx. We then compare Lago Preola pollen to the record from Biviere di Gela, a large lagoon (120 ha) situated 160 km to the east in southern Sicily, to examine differences in vegetation dynamics between the two coastal areas during the Holocene. Lake-level reconstructions and ostracode analyses from Lago Preola provide vegetation-independent evidence of climate change, and help to disentangle human and climatic impacts on vegetation. Pollen data indicate Pistacia-dominated shrublands replaced open grasslands in the region surrounding Lago Preola by 9500 cal yr BP. This change coincided with rising lake levels and the development of an ostracode fauna typical of fresh waters. Evergreen forest dominated by Quercus ilex and Olea europaea started to expand by 7000 cal BP and consolidated at 6500 cal yr BP, when lake levels were near their Holocene high. Similarities between pollen from Lago Preola and Gorgo Basso demonstrate that forest was the dominant vegetation type in coastal Sicily during the middle Holocene at both regional and local scales, and even developed in the drier climatic setting around Biviere di Gela. Lake levels fell at Lago Preola after 7000 cal yr BP, with a strong decline accompanied by increasing salinity after 4500 cal yr BP. However, no transition in vegetation matched these inferred hydrological changes. Instead, forests persisted in the surrounding region until 2200 cal BP when human disturbance intensified. We propose that different climatic factors control lake levels and vegetation in coastal Mediterranean ecosystems. Whereas lake levels are most sensitive to the abundance of winter precipitation, coastal forests depend on spring precipitation and are limited by the length of summer drought. Moisture availability remained suitable for evergreen forests in coastal Sicily during the late Holocene, and humans, not a drier climate drove the regional forest decline. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Norrgård, S; Helama, S				Norrgard, Stefan; Helama, Samuli			Tricentennial trends in spring ice break-ups on three rivers in northern Europe	CRYOSPHERE												At high latitudes, long-term changes in riverine ice break-ups are exemplary measures of climatic change and variation. This study compares cryophenological trends, patterns and changes for the rivers Aura (1749-2020), Torne (1693-2020) and Kokemaki (1793-2020); all sites are located in Finland. The Kokemaki River series is a new series from the city of Pori. The findings show statistically significant cross-correlations between the Aura and Kokemaki rivers but weaker cross-correlations with the Torne River. We attribute the latter to climatic differences caused by the higher latitude of the Torne River. Taken together, the many results of this study suggest that the spring climate in the south has changed more rapidly and become less predictable than in the north Climatic extremes - warmer and wetter winters - in the 2000s resulted in the first recorded no-freeze events on the Aura and Kokemaki rivers. This was the culmination of a rapid increase in early ice break-up events and interannual variability over the last 30 years. The number of early events has increased in all three rivers since the early or mid-1900s, but the earliest recorded break-up day on the Torne River has changed only marginally in the last 100 years. Our dynamic temperature analysis shows that the ice break-up on the Torne River requires higher temperatures than in the south, and future changes in the timing of the break-up depend on April temperatures. In the south, on the other hand, future changes concerns the return period of no-freeze events, which depend on temperature and precipitation during winter.

Climatology of Banded Precipitation over the Contiguous United States	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												A climatology of banded-precipitation features over the contiguous United States from 2003 to 2014 is constructed. A band is defined as a precipitation feature with a major axis of 100 km or greater and a ratio of major axis length to minor axis length (hereafter, aspect ratio) of 3: 1 or greater. By applying an automated feature-based detection algorithm to composite radar imagery, a database of 48 916 844 precipitation features is created, of which 7 213 505 (14.8%) are bands. This algorithm produces the first climatology of precipitation bands over the contiguous United States. Banded-precipitation occurrence is broadly similar to total precipitation occurrence, with a maximum of 175 h of banded precipitation annually over the Ohio River valley. In the warm season, there is a strong diurnal signature associated with convective storm development for both the precipitation feature area and total area covered by precipitation, but little diurnal signature in aspect ratio. Strong west-east gradients in both precipitation occurrence and banded-precipitation occurrence exist, as areas west of the Rockies receive less frequent precipitation, which is much less likely to be banded. East of the Rockies, precipitation features are banded 30% of the time, versus 10%-15% west of the Rockies. Areas downwind of the Great Lakes show prominent late autumn and winter maxima in banded precipitation associated with lake-effect snowbands. Local maxima of banded-precipitation percentage occur in the Dakotas and east of the Colorado Rockies during winter. Although banded-precipitation features compose only 14.8% of all precipitation features, they contribute 21.9% of the annual precipitation occurrence over the contiguous United States.					; Gray, Suzanne/J-6485-2016; Barrett, Andrew/L-5596-2015; Schultz, David M./A-3091-2010	Kirshbaum, Daniel/0000-0001-8748-3700; Gray, Suzanne/0000-0001-8658-362X; Barrett, Andrew/0000-0001-6967-7106; Schultz, David M./0000-0003-1558-6975													0027-0644	1520-0493				DEC	2016	144	12					4553	4568		10.1175/MWR-D-16-0015.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-16-0015.1													WOS:000390687200003

However, data regarding the spatiotemporal variation in isotopic composition of macrophytes are generally missing. We measured the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios of Charophytes at Lake Constance, where they constitute a major food source for waterbirds. Our data reveal seasonal and site-specific differences as well as depth-specific variations in isotopic carbon values within the littoral zone. Charophytes were enriched in C-13 at sites of higher productivity: the delta C-13 values were high in summer, at shallow and at relatively nutrient-rich sites, and comparatively low in winter, and in deeper and nutrient-poorer sites. In contrast, no temporal or spatial trend was found to explain the variability in the isotopic nitrogen values. These results imply that the seasonal timing of food intake (relative to turnover rates of consumers tissue) and the potential depth of foraging need to be taken into account when calculating the relative contribution of energy sources to diets of consumers such as waterbirds.

Hydrogen and oxygen in brine shrimp chitin reflect environmental water and dietary isotopic composition	GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA												Hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of the common structural biopolymer chitin are a potential recorder of ecological and environmental information, but our understanding of the mechanisms of incorporation of H and 0 from environmental substrates into chitin is limited. We report the results of a set of experiments in which the isotopic compositions of environmental water and diet were varied independently in order to assess the contribution of these variables to the H and O isotopic composition of Artemia franciscana chitin. Hydrogen isotope ratios of chitin were strongly linearly correlated with both food and water, with approximately 26% of the hydrogen signal reflecting food and approximately 38% reflecting water. Oxygen isotopes were also strongly correlated with the isotopic composition of water and food, but whereas 69% of oxygen in chitin exchanged with environmental water, only 10% was derived from food. We propose that these observations reflect the position-specific, partial exchange of H and O atoms with brine shrimp body water during the processes of digestion and chitin biosynthesis. Comparison of culture experiments with a set of natural samples collected from the Great Salt Lake, UT in 2006 shows that, with some exceptions, oxygen isotope compositions of chitin track those of water, whereas hydrogen isotopes vary inversely with those of lake water. The different behavior of the two isotopic systems can be explained in terms of a dietary shift from allochthonous particulate matter with relatively higher delta H-2 values in the early spring to autochthonous particulate matter with significantly lower delta H-2 values in the late summer to autumn. These results suggest oxygen in chitin may be a valuable proxy for the oxygen isotopic composition of environmental water, whereas hydrogen isotope values from the same molecule may reveal ecological and biogeochemical changes within lakes.

In the profundal of dimictic lakes, the density and biomass of macrobenthos (especially the burrowing forms) tend to decrease when the trophic state increases. With the advancing trophic state and the increase in depth, the benthic fauna became less varied.

Lake littoral zones are found to be hotspots for N removal from both the basin and receiving waters. However, the environmental factors that drive the distribution of microorganisms are diverse and unclear. Here, we examined the differentiation of nitrogen and microbial community between the littoral and limnetic sediments to explore their interactions.Materials and methodsSediment samples were collected in the littoral and limnetic zones of Chaohu Lake in winter (ca. 7 degrees C) and autumn (ca. 22 degrees C). Abundances of the bacterial and archaeal genes amoA (ammoxidation), nirS and nirK (denitrification), hzsB (anaerobic ammonium oxidation; anammox), and nrfA (dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium; DNRA) were measured via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Clone libraries were constructed for further phylogenetic analysis to study the community composition.Results and discussionWe observed significant higher concentration values in terms of sedimentary NH4+-N and NO3--N in the limnetic zone than littoral zone (p<0.05; n=12). In general, abundance values of the above six genes in the littoral zone were all higher than those in the limnetic zone, while higher in winter (7 degrees C) than in autumn (22 degrees C) (p<0.05; n=6). The spatial heterogeneity had the most significant effect on the distribution of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and anammox bacteria abundance. Both temporal (temperature) and spatial heterogeneity affected the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). The variation in the abundance of denitrifying bacteria and DNRA bacteria mainly reflected the temporal (temperature) heterogeneity.ConclusionsThe six N-cycle-related microorganisms were affected by different environmental factors and presented different distribution patterns. The lower nitrogen content and the higher microbial abundance and diversity showed that the littoral zone was the hotspot of N-cycling-related microorganisms in a large, eutrophic, and turbid lake. It is suggested that increasing the area and restoring the ecological function of the littoral zone was effective and significant in eutrophic lake management.					; Zhu, Guibing/C-2905-2013	Zhu, Guibing/0000-0001-7227-8157; 													1439-0108	1614-7480				FEB	2019	19	2					1005	1016		10.1007/s11368-018-2090-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-018-2090-4													WOS:000457745700042

Mark-recapture surveys affect nest site fidelity but not reproductive timing of male Smallmouth Bass	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Objective: Fish population surveys in north-temperate lakes are often conducted in the fall or spring when individuals are easy to capture with traditional fisheries techniques. Because some fishes are preparing to spawn or are spawning during these seasons, there is a critical need to better understand the potential influences of these surveys on decisions that are related to fish reproduction. Methods: We tested whether spring mark-recapture surveys using fyke nets followed by electrofishing affect the reproductive behaviors of male Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu in a northern Wisconsin lake. Fyke netting, electrofishing, and whole-lake nest snorkeling surveys were conducted during 2001-2008, and Floy-tagged males were tracked across years to test whether capture in the fyke nets only or capture in the electrofishing survey influenced interyear nest site fidelity and reproductive timing. Result: The mark-recapture surveys were conducted preceding the spawning of Smallmouth Bass, and returning males that were caught in the electrofishing survey nested similar to 50 m farther from their prior year ' s nest than both males that were captured only in fyke nets and males that were captured by neither method. Average interyear nest distances were similar to 200 m, and median interyear nest distances were similar to 90 m for males that were not captured in the electrofishing survey. Electrofishing and fyke netting did not influence the timing of reproduction. Conclusion: Spring electrofishing surveys for Smallmouth Bass have the potential to displace breeding males from preferred nesting habitats. If displacement negatively influences fitness (i.e., age-0 survivorship to maturation), spring electrofishing surveys would not be recommended for assessing Smallmouth Bass populations. However, spring population surveys often occur soon after ice off, and surveys that are conducted at these colder temperatures are typically less stressful and less likely to result in mortality. Future research should test for fitness implications of reduced nest site fidelity following electrofishing in Smallmouth Bass while considering potential fitness trade-offs if surveys are moved later in the year.

Lakes and wetlands are common features in the low-gradient Putuligayuk River watershed in northern Alaska, with important implications for the annual water balance. Evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation over the summer, and there is a gradual reduction in wetland extent. Total inundated area derived from RADARSAT ScanSAR synthetic aperture radar images throughout 1999 and 2000 varied from 15 to 67 percent of the 471 km(2) watershed. The hydrological system becomes disconnected within 2 weeks of snowmelt, and overland flow largely ceases. End-of-winter snow water equivalent and discharge during the melt period for 1999, 2000, and 2001 were used to estimate that between 30 and 37 mm (24-42 percent) of snow meltwater serves to recharge the evaporation deficit of the previous summer. The percent of snowmelt entering storage is dependent on the available surface storage.

Breeding occurs in late April in Little Minnow Lake, Algonquin Park. Juveniles are released from the female marsupium in mid-June and adults die soon afterwards. Immatures reach a peak of abundance in mid-July and gradually decline to a constant level in Oct. The summer generation does not breed until it reaches maturity the following spring. Curves of growth in length are linear during the growing season. Egg numbers increase faster than the volume of the females, and the sex ratio appears to be displaced toward the male.																									1967	45	5					877	+		10.1139/z67-095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z67-095													WOS:A19679908200021

Characterizing winter season severity in the Midwest United States, Part I: Climatology and recent trends	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Severe winter weather is a staple of Midwest United States (U.S.) climate and is an important natural hazard that has significant economic and environmental impacts. Winter season severity varies both spatially and temporally in the Midwest, and past studies have documented significant changes in Midwest winter characteristics, including increases in temperature and decreases in snow depth. In this study, we use the Accumulated Winter Season Severity Index (AWSSI) to characterize winter severity across the Midwest and assess its variability and change on various spatial and temporal scales during the 1951-2020 period. AWSSI is derived from daily records of snowfall (SF), snow depth (SD), maximum surface air temperature (TMAX), and minimum surface air temperature (TMIN) during the winter season. The daily total AWSSI index value reflects the sum of points accumulated from daily values of each of these four variables surpassing pre-determined thresholds, and the total season sum reflects the overall winter season severity. We find AWSSI provides a unique perspective by which to describe climatological differences in winter season character in the Midwest. Namely, over three quarters of winter season days accumulate points in the northern Midwest, compared to just over half in the southern Midwest. Meanwhile, the relative contribution of extreme winter days to total winter severity is much larger in the southern Midwest than farther north. In addition, we find overall winter season severity has significantly decreased at only a quarter of stations and the frequency of extreme winter days has significantly decreased at only a fifth of stations, despite widespread increases in winter daily maximum and minimum temperature. The results suggest Midwest U.S. winter season severity as described by the AWSSI has not significantly changed over the past 70 years.

The summer equilibrium phase of phytoplankton results in the development of an Aphanizomenon flos-aquae dominated assemblage which, in some years, progresses towards a Microcystis dominated assemblage. Continuously high flushing (in range of 1%-2% of lake volume day(-1)) does not prevent Aphanizomenon development but its biomass remains at low levels as compared to other summers with smaller average flushing. In such years (flushing remains < 1% of lake volume day(-1)) a flushing pulse of 1%-2% of lake volume day(-1) has been effectual to break development of cyanoprokaryotes and to decrease their biomass to low levels. The major reason of the decrease is not the dilution effect of flushing pulses but the intolerance of cyanoprokaryotes to sudden environmental changes. Considering the case of Muggelsee from the point of view of reservoir ecology it can be concluded that reservoirs with pulsed use are less exposed to development of cyanoprokaryotes if pulses occur in a sufficient frequency (20-30 days) and their intensity falls to the range of 1%-2% of reservoir volume day(-1). Reservoirs with continuous takeoff of water are more exposed to cyanoprokaryota development with all the consequences for water use.

Here we show that forest regeneration practices may act as an important additional source of TotHg and MeHg to forest lakes. TotHg and MeHg in runoff from two small forested catchments were monitored during the period 1994 to 2001. In the autumn of 1997, one of the catchments was clear-cut. Soil preparation (mounding) was carried out in the autumn of 1998 and replanting in the summer of 1999. During the 3 years after the silvicultural treatment, medians of monthly flow-weighted TotHg and MeHg concentrations (12.02 ng L-1 and 0.35 ng L-1, respectively) and output loads (0.80-0.97 g km(-2) a(-1) and 0.011-0.036 g km(-2) a(-1), respectively) increased significantly compared to the 3 years calibration period (8.13 ng L-1 and 0.15 ng I-1; 2.0-5.3 g km(-2) a(-1) and 0.11-0.16 g km(-2) a(-1), respectively). These results indicate that clear-cutting and/or soil treatment significantly increases the mobility of TotHg and MeHg accumulated in forest soil and may thus be an important factor for the total input of Hg to boreal freshwater ecosystems.					; Munthe, John/AEX-9259-2022	Munthe, John/0000-0001-6118-5561; Porvari, Petri/0000-0002-0709-7218													0013-936X					JUN 1	2003	37	11					2389	2393		10.1021/es0340174	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es0340174								12831022					WOS:000183242300034

MC increased during summer, ranging from 20 to 1220 ng/L. Seasonal patterns in MC corresponded with chlorophyll > 35 mu m (Net Chl) and cyanobacterial biovolume associated with increased dominance by Microcystis and Anabaena. MC showed strong negative correlations with dissolved nitrogen (r=-0.95) and cations (r=-0.98), and strong positive correlations with Net Chl (r=0.91). Once the lake stratified, MC and Net Chl remained uniform throughout the photic zone and decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in the aphotic zone. Field experiments indicated MC did not change independently of Net Chl in response to decreased light or increased nutrients; however, enclosure effects may have substantially influenced experimental results. Mozingo Lake MC was tightly coupled with seasonal lake processes, including stratification and nutrient loss from the epilimnion, and cyanobacterial community composition, abundance and distribution in the water column. MC was detected in all monthly samples suggesting the potential for problems associated with MC exists year round, but peaks in early fall presented the greatest concern in Mozingo Lake.

J	Pothoven, SA; Vanderploeg, HA				Pothoven, SA; Vanderploeg, HA			Diet and prey selection of alewives in Lake Michigan: Seasonal, depth, and interannual patterns	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												To evaluate the current diet of alewives Alosa pseudoharengus and interactions with their prey in light of recent changes in Lake Michigan, we determined the seasonal diet and prey selectivity of large (> 100 own total length) and small (< 100 mm) alewives in southeastern Lake Michigan. Selectivity and diet were evaluated on a biomass basis for alewives collected near Muskegon, Michigan, during June, July-August, and October 1999-2001. Fish were sampled from three depth zones: shallow (15-25 m), transitional (35-55 m), and deep (65-90 m). Prey selectivity and diet patterns indicated that alewives had considerable flexibility in adjusting to prey availability, which varied by season, depth zone, and year. Although small copepods were an abundant prey item throughout the year and in all depth zones, they were mainly important in the diet (large and small alewives) in June and at the shallow stations, where many of the other prey types were not available. Despite declining numbers, Diporeia continued to be important for large alewives in spring, particularly at the transitional and deep stations, where their biomass was many times higher than that of other prey. During summer, large alewives selected either Bythotrephes longimanus or Mysis relicta in all depth zones and years. The diet of large alewives consisted mainly of Mysis in July 1999 and August 2001, whereas in August 2000 mainly Bosmina were eaten. During October, Mysis and Bythotrephes, along with large zooplankters (Daphnia spp. and large calanoid copepods), were selected and were most important in the diet of large alewives. In contrast, only the large zooplankton were selected and were important prey for the small alewives in fall. Annual, seasonal, and depth differences in prey biomass as well as differences in alewife size all influenced diet and selectivity patterns.

Results showed that the average concentrations of each metal in the surface sediments generally exceeded their corresponding background values. Higher values were observed in deeper zones, supporting the retention and accumulation of heavy metals in the core sediments. The spatial distributions of metal averages, pollution load index (PLI), and combined ecological risk index (RI) revealed that ecological risks were highest in the west lake, followed by middle lake, and were lowest in the east section. For the temporal variations of metal contents, the highest concentration was usually observed in the winter. However, the seasonal dynamics of Hg showed a different pattern with higher values in the autumn and lower values in the winter. According to contamination factor (CF), the Hg and Sb contaminations were considerable, while the other metals were moderate contamination. In terms of geoaccumulation index (I-geo) values, sediments were moderately-heavily polluted by Sb and moderately polluted by Hg, Cd, and Ni. Meanwhile, Hg exhibited a considerable health risk, while Cd and Sb were moderate risks, based on single ecological risk index (Er) values. Significant positive correlations among heavy metals and principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that anthropogenic activities were major sources. The source of Sb might be different from other metals, with industrial discharge as the main loading. This study highlighted the urgency of taking measures to prevent Hg, Sb, and Cd pollutions in Lake Yangcheng, especially the west region of this lake.

A gene with major phenotypic effects as a target for selection vs. homogenizing gene flow	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Genes with major phenotypic effects facilitate quantifying the contribution of genetic vs. plastic effects to adaptive divergence. A classical example is Ectodysplasin (Eda), the major gene controlling lateral plate phenotype in three-spined stickleback. Completely plated marine stickleback populations evolved repeatedly towards low-plated freshwater populations, representing a prime example of parallel evolution by natural selection. However, many populations remain polymorphic for lateral plate number. Possible explanations for this polymorphism include relaxation of selection, disruptive selection or a balance between divergent selection and gene flow. We investigated 15 polymorphic stickleback populations from brackish and freshwater habitats in coastal North-western Europe. At each site, we tracked changes in allele frequency at the Eda gene between subadults in fall, adults in spring and juveniles in summer. Eda genotypes were also compared for body size and reproductive investment. We observed a fitness advantage for the Eda allele for the low morph in freshwater and for the allele for the complete morph in brackish water. Despite these results, the differentiation at the Eda gene was poorly correlated with habitat characteristics. Neutral population structure was the best predictor of spatial variation in lateral plate number, suggestive of a substantial effect of gene flow. A meta-analysis revealed that the signature of selection at Eda was weak compared to similar studies in stickleback. We conclude that a balance between divergent selection and gene flow can maintain stickleback populations polymorphic for lateral plate number and that ecologically relevant genes may not always contribute much to local adaptation, even when targeted by selection.

It can be used as a source of forage and its residual biomass at the end of the season can be used by fish to lay their eggs during the spring flood. A more intensive management favours forage production (6974 kg DM/ha), while a less intensive management produces lower forage yields (2600 kg DM/ha) but maximizes residual biomass in the fall (6271 kg DM/ha). The management to be favoured in the littoral will have to take into account the agricultural needs and the wildlife needs.

J	Liang, RN; Harbaugh, BK				Liang, RN; Harbaugh, BK			Evaluation of trachelium cultivars as cut flowers	HORTTECHNOLOGY												Trachelium caeruleum has been grown in the United States as a cut flower for about a decade. Only two cultivars, 'White Umbrella' and 'Purple Umbrella', were readily available for commercial use before 1997, but nine new cultivars became available in the last few years. Comparative performance trials have been lacking for these cultivars in the United States. This trial evaluated 11 cultivars of trachelium for cut flower production performance (vegetative and flowering characteristics) and postharvest longevity. The evaluation was in the spring of 1999 at Bradenton, Fla. (27.4 N, 82.5 W; AHS Heat Zone 10; USDA Cold Hardiness Zone 9b). Plant height for all cultivars except 'White Umbrella' was above 30 inches (76 cm), a height required for acceptance as a high quality cut flower. 'Summer Lake' had the smallest inflorescence diameter of 3.9 inches (10.0 cm) and 'Lake Powell' the largest at 6.1 inches (15.4 cm). 'White Umbrella' (160 days from seed to flower) was the earliest to flower and 'Lake Powell' (169 days) the last to flower. Vase life was as short as 7 days for 'Summer Lake' to as long as I I days for 'White Umbrella'. 'Lake Powell' (white color group), 'Summer Blue Wonder' (blue color group), and 'Lake Superior' (purple color group) had the highest overall rankings.																			1063-0198					APR-JUN	2001	11	2					316	318		10.21273/HORTTECH.11.2.316	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH.11.2.316													WOS:000173927200032

We evaluated the contribution of stocked largemouth bass to the 2002 year-class at age 0 in September 2002 and at age 1 in May 2003. Stocked largemouth bass comprised 15% in pool 5 and 20% in pool 9 of the 2002 year-class at age 0 and 10% in pool 5 and 13% in pool 9 at age 1. Contributions of stocked largemouth bass to the year-class did not differ significantly between pools (P = 0.2850 in pool 5 and 0.1824 in pool 9) or years (P 0.3521 in fall and 0.5061 in spring). Mean lengths of stocked and wild largemouth bass did not differ significantly in either pool during fall 2002 (P = 0.2863 in pool 5 and 0.9281 in pool 9) or spring 2003 (P = 0.4809 in pool 5 and 0.1233 in pool 9). However, largemouth bass were significantly longer in pool 9 than in pool 5 at age 0 (181 mm TL versus 172 mm TL, respectively; P = 0.0113) and age 1 (204 rum TL versus 182 turn TL, respectively; P < 0.0001). Largemouth bass stocked into the Arkansas River, an open system, contributed to year-class strength to a similar degree as fish stocked into closed reservoirs and lakes.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2006	26	1					175	179		10.1577/M04-214.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M04-214.1													WOS:000236430500021
J	Urban, NR; Jeong, J; Chai, YT				Urban, NR; Jeong, J; Chai, YT			The benthic nepheloid layer (BNL) north of the Keweenaw Peninsula in Lake Superior: Composition, dynamics, and role in sediment transport	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												As part of the Keweenaw Interdisciplinary Transport Experiment in Superior (KITES) project, measurements were made of the extent and the composition of the BNL in Lake Superior off the northwest coast of the Keweenaw Peninsula. Between 1998 and 2000, transmissometer profiles were obtained frequently along three transects oriented perpendicularly to the coast. Large-volume water samples were filtered, and the BNL particles were analyzed for major elements (C, N, P) and Pb-210. In 1998 and 1999, an ROV was deployed to facilitate sampling of this layer. These measurements together with ancillary data from the KITES project show that the BNL develops each summer when the lake is stably stratified and disappears in early fall as the thermocline erodes. Particles within the BNL are enriched in biogenic elements and Pb-210 relative to material in surface sediments and relative to material collected in sediment traps, but are enriched in phosphorus relative to epilimnetic seston. There is a large inventory of solids suspended within the BNL (approximately 100,000 metric tons in a 20-km band along the Keweenaw Peninsula); this inventory appears quickly (1-2 weeks) in summer and disappears equally quickly via settling in fall. The large inventory of organic carbon indicates that particles are concentrated from a large area of surface waters into a considerably smaller region where the BNL exists.

Warren			Effects of Structural and Spatiotemporal Factors on Fish Use of Artificial Habitat in a Texas Reservoir	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We evaluated fish use of artificial habitat in relation to structure size and shape and the spatiotemporal factors of season, diel period, and reservoir region in Striker Reservoir, Texas. Recycled Christmas trees were used to construct three sizes of cluster- and linear-shaped structures; fish at each were sampled seasonally during the day and night with electrofishing. Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides and Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus comprised 57% of the fish collected; other centrarchids comprised an additional 33%. Overall fish assemblages at the habitat structures were not related to the factors we examined. However, species-specific analyses indicated that the percentage of structures occupied, catch per unit effort (CPUE), and mean size of Largemouth Bass and Bluegills were influenced by the factors we examined. Largemouth Bass exhibited a greater percent occupancy of the largest structures and a higher CPUE in small structures; the mean size (TL) of Largemouth Bass was lower in cluster-shaped structures at night. Bluegill percent occupancy and CPUE were significantly greater in cluster-shaped structures than in linear-shaped ones; however, larger individuals were more often found in linear-shaped structures. Spatiotemporal differences in percent occupancy, CPUE, and mean TL were apparent, with greater abundance of both species during summer and fall and larger mean TL of Largemouth Bass during spring. The percentage of structures occupied by Largemouth Bass was significantly higher in the lower reservoir; however, mean TL was higher among structures in the upper reservoir. The percentage of structures occupied by Bluegills, as well as CPUE, was greater in the lower reservoir. Our results suggest that both the size and shape of artificial habitats, as well as spatiotemporal factors, should be considered when planning habitat enhancement efforts.

Relationships between temperature responses and bacterial community structure along seasonal and altitudinal gradients	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY					International Conference on Polar and Alpine Microbiology	MAR 27-31, 2006	Innsbruck, AUSTRIA	Inst Microbiol, Leopold Franzens Univ, Free Univ Bozen Bolzano, Canadian Studies Ctr, LEU, FEMS				In this study, soil bacterial communities and the temperature responses (Q(10)) of substrate-induced respiration were compared between an alpine dry meadow and a subalpine forest in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Bacterial communities in three seasons from each environment were described with 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. The main goal of this comparison was to relate phylogenetic differences among bacterial communities with variation in soil respiratory temperature sensitivities along seasonal and altitudinal gradients. The warmer, lower elevation, subalpine forest soil exhibited large seasonal variations in Q(10). Subalpine Q(10) values were highest in summer, and were higher than alpine values in all seasons except winter. Q(10) in alpine soils were consistently low throughout the year. Alpine and subalpine bacterial communities both varied seasonally, and were markedly distinct from each other. Based on F-st analysis, subalpine communities from colder times of year were more similar to the alpine communities than were subalpine summer communities. Principle component analysis of the pairwise genetic distances (F-st) between communities produced two factors that accounted for 69% and 22% of the total variance in the data set. These factors demonstrated a significant relationship between bacterial community structure and temperature response when regressed on log-transformed Q(10) data.																			0168-6496	1574-6941				FEB	2007	59	2					418	427		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2006.00240.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6941.2006.00240.x								17328121					WOS:000243506800020

J	Kirby, ME; Mullins, HT; Patterson, WP; Burnett, AW				Kirby, ME; Mullins, HT; Patterson, WP; Burnett, AW			Late glacial-Holocene atmospheric circulation and precipitation in the northeast United States inferred from modern calibrated stable oxygen and carbon isotopes	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												As global climate changes because of anthropogenic influences, it has become critical to better understand past climate and its various forcing mechanisms as a baseline for future comparison. To this end, we present a continental isotopic record from an 11.2-m-long wetland piston core sampled at 10-50 yr resolution; the core was taken in the heavily populated, economically vibrant northeastern United States (adjacent to Fayetteville Green Lake) and spans 14,600-3200 cal. yr B.P. We use a historically based correlation between delta(18)O(calcite) obtained from individual varves in a box core from Fayetteville Green Lake and winter atmospheric circulation over the northeast United States to examine the way in which changes in winter circulation have influenced delta(18)O in precipitation from 14,600 to 3200 cal. yr B.P. Our correlation analysis suggests that in periods during which the circumpolar westerlies are expanded, storms track more frequently from the Gulf of Mexico region, delivering precipitation with relatively high 81110 values to the study site. By contrast, contracted westerlies result in more frequent low-delta(18)O(precipitation) cross-continental storms. By using this relationship we model winter-vortex latitudes over the northeast United States for the prehistoric oxygen isotope record, focusing on millennial-scale change, abrupt transitions, and multidecadal- to centennial-scale variability. The delta(18)O(calcite) and winter-vortex latitude records are characterized by a long-term asymmetric change interrupted by two notable, abrupt transitions at ca. 11,600 cal. yr B.P. and ca. 5200 cal. yr B.P. Several forcing mechanisms are considered including precession of the equinoxes (millennial-scale), ice-sheet-margin retreat (millennial-scale), thermohaline circulation (abrupt transitions), and ocean-atmosphere linkages (decadal to centennial scale). Analysis of historical delta(13)C(calcite) values from a box core of varved Fayetteville Green Lake sediment and correlation of these values to early summer precipitation amounts reveal a relationship in which high delta(13)C(calcite) values (usually attributed to greater primary productivity) correspond with low annual precipitation amounts. From this relationship, we propose a climate-control hypothesis in which less early summer precipitation enhances productivity by increasing sunlight availability through reduced total cloud cover. We use this relationship to interpret early summer precipitation and cloud cover for the period from 14,600 to 3200 cal. yr B.P. The delta(13)C(calcite), precipitation and cloud-cover data are characterized by fluctuations about a mean value with multiple abrupt transitions occurring throughout the length of the record; there is no obvious trend in the delta(13)C(calcite) data. Spectral analysis indicates that both the delta(13)C(calcite) and delta(18)O(calcite) data are characterized by a variety of time scales with the most significant periods in the multidecadal- to centennial time frame, corroborating other research that has determined a strong multidecadal to centennial periodicity in late glacial-Holocene climate proxy records.					; Patterson, William/J-6473-2012; Burnett, Adam/ABE-4249-2020	Patterson, William/0000-0003-3387-708X; 													0016-7606	1943-2674				OCT	2002	114	10					1326	1340		10.1130/0016-7606(2002)114<1326:LGHACA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/0016-7606(2002)114<1326:LGHACA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000178490000008

Ellen			Contributions of winter foraging to the annual growth of thermally dissimilar fish species	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The seasonal energy dynamics of temperate fishes will likely be affected by climate change, especially during the winter. Few studies, however, have focused on winter. Fishes are more active in winter than previously thought, thus, an inquiry into the energetic contributions of winter foraging to the annual growth of fishes is needed given expected changes in winter conditions. We used stomach content data, total lipid analyses, and bioenergetics modeling to assess the effects of winter foraging on three species in Lake Champlain, Vermont, USA. We compared species in two thermal guilds, the cool-water species yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and two warm-water species, pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). Our results indicate that winter energy dynamics likely depend on the thermal preference of individual fish species - the cool-water species foraged in all seasons whereas the two warm-water species foraged only in the open-water seasons. In addition, winter foraging provided sufficient energy for overwinter growth in cool-water species but not in warm-water species. Climate change will affect the seasonal energy dynamics that these species have evolved to survive winter conditions in temperate lakes. Thus, we expect climate change to affect individual survival and reproductive success.					; Stockwell, Jason/HSC-4786-2023; Marsden, Ellen/JVO-2249-2024	Marsden, J.

During these intervals, small water droplets (fluid inclusions, FIs) were entrapped in the halite crystals which serve as windows to estimate the chemistry and physical properties of the primary lake water conditions. Brillouin spectroscopy is used here to reconstruct annual resolution temperatures from a halite core section in the Dead Sea Basin during the onset of Marine Isotope Stage 5e (ca 130 ka) of the Last Interglacial. Lake bottom temperatures can be inferred based on the occurrence of coarse/fine halite facies, as observed today with the formation of equivalent halite facies during winter/summer seasons in the Dead Sea. A recurring increase in lake bottom temperatures is found along the direction of coarse halite layers in three successive years. Moreover, low FI entrapment temperatures were detected in layers of fine (cumulate) halite facies. These results imply a twofold stronger seasonality in the Dead Sea Basin compared to today, with colder winters at the onset of Marine Isotope Stage 5e. The results therefore highlight the potential of using cyclic salt deposits to reconstruct seasonal temperature variability for numerous evaporitic environments in the geological record.					; Caupin, Frédéric/ABG-2589-2021; Ariztegui, Daniel/AFU-2302-2022	Ariztegui, Daniel/0000-0001-7775-5127; Brall, Niels/0000-0001-8345-4793; Caupin, Frederic/0000-0002-8892-2514; Sorrel, Philippe/0000-0003-0074-5961; Guillerm, Emmanuel/0000-0002-2725-9229														2055-4877				JUN	2022	8	2					616	627		10.1002/dep2.185	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/dep2.185		FEB 2022											WOS:000760061400001

SPRING MIGRATION	CYTOBIOS												Ultrastructural features of the cell types in the adenohypophysis of the Canada goose (B. canadensis interior) were studied with reference to its annual spring migration from its wintering area at Swan Lake Refuge in Missouri, USA, to its breeding grounds at Fort Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, in the subarctic region of Canada. The study was conducted during the periods before and afer the spring migration. Prolactin (PRL) cells were present in both the cephalic and caudal lobes of the pituitary but did not show any significant qualitative differences between the pre- and post-migratory periods. Two types of gonadotropic cells (TGH-1 and GTH-2) were distinguished. During the premigratory period, the GTH-1 cells appeared more active than the GTH-2 cells. However, both the types appeared more active in the postmigratory period. In some males, during the postmigratory period, the numerous mitochondria in the GTH-1 cells were surrounded by cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) suggesting microsequestration. ACTH cells were present only in the cephalic lobe and appeared to be hypertrophied in the postmigratory period. The hypertrophied state was characterized by numerous swollen mitochondria and prominent ER with dilated cysternae. TSH cells could only be observed in the cephalic lobe. In the postmigratory period they were larger in size with prominent ER showing enlarged cisternae. The so-called intracytoplasmic filamentous masses were often present in these cells during this period. Somatotropic (STH) cells were located only in the caudal lobe and were occasionally found to contain the intracytoplasmic filamentous masses in the premigratory period.																			0011-4529						1983	38	151-					187	208																WOS:A1983RP70800006

Phosphorus export from a restored wetland ecosystem in response to natural and experimental hydrologic fluctuations	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Wetland restoration is a commonly used approach to reduce nutrient loading to freshwater and coastal ecosystems, with many wetland restoration efforts occurring in former agricultural fields. Restored wetlands are expected to be effective at retaining or removing both nitrogen and phosphorus (P), yet restoring wetland hydrology to former agricultural fields can lead to the release of legacy fertilizer P. Here, we examined P cycling and export following rewetting of the Timberlake Restoration Project, a 440 ha restored riverine wetland complex in the coastal plain of North Carolina. We also compared P cycling within the restored wetland to two minimally disturbed nearby wetlands and an adjacent active agricultural field. In the restored wetland we observed increased soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations following initial flooding, consistent with our expectations that P bound to iron would be released under reducing conditions. SRP concentrations in spring were 2.5 times higher leaving the restored wetland than a forested wetland and an agricultural field. During two large-scale drawdown and rewetting experiments we decreased the water depth by 1 m in similar to 10 ha of inundated wetland for 2 weeks, followed by reflooding. Rewetting following experimental drainage had no effect on SRP concentrations in winter, but SRP concentrations did increase when the experiment was repeated during summer. Our best estimates suggest that this restored wetland could release legacy fertilizer P for up to a decade following hydrologic restoration. The time lag between restoration and biogeochemical recovery should be incorporated into management strategies of restored wetlands.

The Present-Day Structure of the Temperature and Current Fields in Lake Sevan	WATER RESOURCES												Long-term features of the vertical and horizontal structure of water temperature field in Lake Sevan are discussed. It is shown that the climate warming has led to an increase in epilimnion temperature in Bol'shoi Sevan in July by 2.0-3.0 degrees C. The increase in water temperature in hypolimnion was not greater than 1.1 degrees C. In autumn (October), the epilimnion became 1.2 degrees C warmer, while hypolimnion temperature practically has not changed on the average over years. Temperature fields were used to calculate the density currents in summer and autumn periods. A dominating cyclonic water circulation was revealed all over the lake, confirmed by chlorophyll distribution by satellite image data. In the case of large horizontal gradients of water density, the flow velocity can reach 50 cm/s. Autonomous buoy stations revealed a wide range of water temperature variations due to internal waves of different nature. The reversible vertical mixing of water mass by internal waves plays an important role in the distribution of nutrients and plankton within the water mass. The water level rise by similar to 3 m, unlike it drop by 1981 by 18.48, has not caused any significant changes in lake hydrological regime.

Contrasting Patterns of the Resident and Active Rhizosphere Bacterial Communities of Phragmites Australis	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Rhizosphere microbes play a key role in maintaining plant health and regulating biogeochemical cycles. The active bacterial community (ABC) in rhizosphere, as a small fraction of the rhizosphere resident bacterial community (RBC), has the potential to actively participate in nutrient cycling processes at the root-sediment interface. Here, we investigated the ABC and RBC within the rhizosphere of Phragmites australis (P. australis) subjected to different environmental conditions (i.e., seasons and flooding conditions) in Lake Taihu, China. Our results indicated that RBC exhibited significantly higher alpha diversity as well as lower beta diversity than ABC. The active ratios of 16S rRNA to 16S rDNA (also RNA/DNA) of the bacterial communities in summer and winter suggested a lower proportion of potential active taxa in the rhizosphere bacterial community during summer. Network analysis showed that negative correlations in each network were observed to dominate the species correlations between the rhizosphere and bulk sediment bacterial communities. Our results revealed that niche differentiation and seasonal variation played crucial roles in driving the assembly of ABC and RBC associated with the rhizospheres of P. australis. These findings broaden our knowledge about how rhizosphere bacterial communities respond to environmental variations through changing their diversity and composition.					; Wu, Qinglong/B-7625-2011; Zeng, Jin/AAQ-7810-2020	Zeng, Jin/0000-0002-3298-4820; 													0095-3628	1432-184X				FEB	2022	83	2					314	327		10.1007/s00248-021-01767-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-021-01767-y		MAY 2021						33956174					WOS:000648012900001

Assessment of potential hydrological climate change impacts in the Kastoria basin (Western Macedonia, Greece) using EURO-CORDEX regional climate models	GLOBAL NEST JOURNAL												The Mediterranean region is expected to present reduced availability of water resources due to climate change. This study aims to assess the potential hydrological responses to climate change in the Kastoria basin (Western Macedonia, Northern Greece) for the period 2019-2078. Climate projections from eight regional climate models from EURO-CORDEX were bias-adjusted using the linear scaling method. The bias-adjusted climate data were used to force the FeFLOW hydrological model to predict the discharge of the Kastoria aquifer towards lake Orestiada along with the projected groundwater level distribution. Precipitation (temperature) shows a tendency to decrease (increase) mainly in late spring to early autumn while increase (decrease) in the other seasons. Moreover, results indicate a significant increase in temperature and a slight decrease in precipitation towards 2078, while the predicted groundwater level of Kastoria aquifer will reduce slightly. However, the future hydrological behavior of the basin indicates a substantial reduction by approximately 15% of total water yield towards the end of the century.

Comparative decay of culturable faecal indicator bacteria, microbial source tracking marker genes, and enteric pathogens in laboratory microcosms that mimic a sub-tropical environment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Enteric pathogens can be present in drinking water catchments due to several point and non-point sources of faecal contamination. Pathogen and contaminant signatures will decay due to environmental stresses, such as temperature, Ultra Violet (UV) radiation, salinity, and predation. In this study, we determined the decay of the culturable faecal indicator bacterium (FIB) Escherichia coli (E. coli), two sewage-associated marker genes (Bacteroides HF183 and crAssphage CPQ_056), and enteric pathogens (Campylobacter spp., human adenovirus 40/41, and Cryptosporidium parvum) in two freshwater laboratory microcosms using culture-based, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and vital dye (determine the fraction of viable Cryptosporidium oocysts) assays. Freshwater samples from the Lake Wappa and Lake Wivenhoe (Australia) were seeded with untreated sewage and C. parvum oocysts, and their declining concentrations were measured over a 28-day period. Moreover, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was also undertaken to determine the change/shift in sewage-associated bacterial communities using SourceTracker. Overall, culturable E. coli and the HF183 marker gene decayed significantly (p < 0.05) faster than did the qPCR measured enteric pathogens suggesting that the absence of culturable FIB or qPCR HF183 in water samples may not indicate the absence of pathogens. The decay of crAssphage was similar to that of HAdV 40/41 and other pathogens tested, suggesting crAssphage may be a better surrogate for enteric viruses in sub-tropical catchment waters. The decay rates were greater at 25 degrees C compared to 15 degrees C, suggesting that FIB and pathogens persist longer in the winter season compared to summer. Overall decay rates of the tested microorganisms in this microcosm study suggest that sub-tropical conditions, especially temperature, have a negative impact on the persistence of tested microorganisms. Sewage-associated bacterial communities also showed similar patterns. Based on the results, which showed differences in simulated summer and winter temperatures for pathogen decay, corresponding management options and treatment need to be adjusted accordingly to minimize human health risks effectively.

J	Lobyrev, F; Gallagher, CP; Emeliyanenko, P				Lobyrev, Feodor; Gallagher, Colin P.; Emeliyanenko, Pavel			A mathematical model predicting the abundance and spatio-temporal dispersal of adfluvial salmonid (Salvelinus malma) fry in a stream	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Models describing the spatial and temporal distributions of fishes are necessary for conservation and management of populations and their habitats. The early life stages of fishes are a particularly important period that can influence population dynamics and fisheries productivity. The fry of riverine migratory fish species are particularly influenced by downstream transport although relatively few models have been used to predict spatiotemporal abundance and dispersion of fry in combination with life history parameters in unperturbed habitats. We present a novel model predicting the downstream dispersal of age-0 adfluvial Dolly Varden in a spawning stream draining into Kronotskoye Lake basin, Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia. The model accounted for the number of and distance between known spawning grounds, diel activity, daily fish growth, and intra-specific diversity (i.e., morphotype) to describe how fry abundance changed at a specific stream location over the course of spring and summer. Data were collected using a trapnet monitored periodically during spring and summer to record changes in abundance, size (growth), and life history composition ('nosed' or 'white' morphotype) of fish between age-0 and -2. The experimental data were fitted to the model using a gradient descent optimization algorithm and a mean squared error loss function was used to verify how well experimental data fit to the theoretical model. The predicted abundance of age-0 fish was 18,831 with a mean dispersion rate of similar to 36 m/day and a transit time between spawning area and stream mouth ranging 32-76 days. The catch was mainly comprised (81%) of the slower growing 'nosed' morphotype and exhibited variation in abundance over time and decreased considerably by the end of summer. Our comprehensive model will be useful to simulate the downstream dispersal of salmonid fishes whose early life stages inhabit riverine systems.																			1574-9541	1878-0512				DEC	2023	78								102359	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102359	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2023.102359		NOV 2023											WOS:001110168800001

Impact of bottom sediments on water quality of Vistonis lagoon	Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology, Vol A - Oral Presentations, Pts A and B	Proceedings of the International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology				9th International Conference on Environmental Science and Technology	SEP 01-03, 2005	Rhodes Isl, GREECE	Global Network Environm Sci & Technol, Univ Aegean, Dept Environm Studies				Nutrient concentrations were measured seasonally in the water column and in bottom sediments of Vistonis, a shallow lagoon located in Northern Greece (41 degrees 02' N, 25 degrees 08' E). The lagoon is supplied with freshwater by three main streams and communicates with seawater through two tidal channels. The mean depth of the lagoon is about 3.0 m, while the maximum depth reaches 3.8 m. The lagoon is eutrophic to hypereutrophic, depending on the method of determination. This work emphasizes on the evaluation of internal phosphorus and nitrogen loading to the lagoon, examining the seasonal nutrient variations in the water column and in the bottom sediments. Water and bed sediment samples were collected from 5 stations along the lagoon at 1 m depth interval. Physicochernical parameters (transparency, temperature, salinity, pH and dissolved oxygen) were measured in situ, while the water samples were analyzed for the determination of nitrates, total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a. The sediment samples were analyzed for the determination of nitrates and total phosphorus. Mean spatial (average of all stations) transparency varied between 0.38 m and 0.97 m. Minimum temperature was 6.4 degrees C, while maximum was 28.6 degrees C. Salinity values ranged on the average between 0.4 psu in the early spring and 14.0 psu at the end of the summer period, due to the elimination of freshwater inflow. At the bottom, water pH values varied from 7.66 to 8.70, while dissolved oxygen ranged between 2.2 and 8.4 mg l(-1). While freshwater inflow decreased during the summer period, nitrate and total phosphorus concentrations increased in the water column, but decreased in the bottom sediments. Additionally, mean spatial values of total phosphorus concentrations measured in surface water were generally lower than those in bottom water. This trend demonstrates the influence of internal loading that comes from bottom sediments on phosphorus concentration of the water body of the lagoon. On the contrary, nitrate concentrations were higher at the surface water. Mean spatial chlorophyll-a concentrations were higher in May 2003 and May 2004 (spring), while the lower values were recorded in June 2003 and August 2004 (summer). The paper describes the methodology used and presents results and conclusions from a two-year monitoring of the lagoon.

All airborne samples were analyzed for crustal (Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe) and anthropogenic (Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ph) trace metals. A TSP sampler was employed using glass and quartz fiber filters to collect air samples. Average individual trace element concentrations fluctuated between 4896.3 +/- 3754.3 ng/m(3) (Ca) and 0.7 +/- 0.9 ng/m(3) (Cd). The measured concentrations of the trace elements were within the ranges of previously reported values obtained from different places including Turkey, Argentina, Spain, Korea, and Brasil. The concentrations were arranged according to day and night, weekend and weekdays, spring and summer samples. Concentrations were also evaluated based on the filter types used, glass fiber and quartz filters. Enrichment factors (EFs) were calculated to identify anthropogenic versus natural emission sources of trace elements. The prevailing winds from various sectors were examined to determine the transport of metal particles from different districts. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to define the possible origins of trace elements in airborne particulate matter. The result suggested that industrial activities along with traffic emissions and suspension of street dusts have important effects on ambient air concentrations of trace metals. Dry deposition fluxes were estimated using documented dry deposition velocities in the literature and concentrations measured in this study. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wu, B; Zhang, R; Ding, Y; D'Arrigo, R				Wu, Bingyi; Zhang, Renhe; Ding, Yihui; D'Arrigo, Rosanne			Distinct modes of the East Asian summer monsoon	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Resolution of a complex Hermitian matrix derived from monthly mean 850-hPa wind fields during the summer season (June-August) from 1968 to 2004 revealed four different modes of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) variability. The leading EASM mode, accounting for 19.6% of the variance, is characterized by two different modes (M11 and M12) or their combination. Both portray a closed cyclonic or anticyclonic circulation anomaly over the western North Pacific (WNP), South China Sea (SCS), and southeastern China; corresponding anomalous geopotential height fields show a wave train structure from the WNP across Japan, the Okhotsk Sea, and Alaska to North America. Thus, the leading EASM mode characterizes the teleconnection pattern of the WNP-EASM. The correlation between M11 (M12) and the dynamic index for the WNP-EASM is 0.85 (0.51). M11 has leading spectral peaks at 15 and 3 yr, whereas M12 displays a predominant peak at 2 yr. It is found that M11 has interdecadal variations, with the transition years being circa 1973 and 1989, respectively. M11 is closely related to air-sea interactions in the SCS and the northwestern Pacific, and its association with the convective heat source over the northwestern Pacific is secondary. In contrast, M12 is closely related to the tropical convective heat source rather than tropical western Pacific sea surface temperature (SST). The second EASM mode, accounting for 12.8% of the variance, is identified and characterized by two distinct and alternating modes or their linear combination (M21 and M22). One mode (M21) closely relates to the dual blocking high pattern detected in anomalous sea level pressure (SLP) and 500-hPa geopotential heights over the Ural Mountains and the Okhotsk Sea. The other (M22) corresponds to a dipole blocking anomaly in anomalous SLP and geopotential heights, with opposing anomalous centers in the south of Japan and the Korean peninsula, and the area between Lake Baikal and the Okhotsk Sea. M22 shows significant correlations with summer mean rainfall in southern and southeastern China. Thus, a single index of EASM is inappropriate for investigating and predicting the EASM.

Characterisation of hydrogeological connections in a lowland karst network using time series analysis of water levels in ephemeral groundwater-fed lakes (turloughs)	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												This research has used continuous water level measurements five groundwater-fed lakes (or turloughs) in a linked lowland karst network of south Galway in Ireland over a 3 year period in order to elucidate the hydrogeological controls and conduit configurations forming the flooded karstic hydraulic system beneath the ground. The main spring outflow from this network discharges below mean sea level making it difficult to determine the hydraulic nature of the network using traditional rainfall-spring flow cross analysis, as has been done in many other studies on karst systems. However, the localised groundwater-surface water interactions (the turloughs) in this flooded lowland karst system can yield information about the nature of the hydraulic connections beneath the ground. Various different analytical techniques have been applied to the fluctuating turlough water level time series data in order to determine the nature of the linkage between them as well as hydraulic pipe configurations at key points in order to improve the conceptual model of the overall karst network. Initially, simple cross correlations between the different turlough water levels were carried out applying different time lags. Frequency analysis of the signals was then carried out using Fast Fourier transform analysis and then both discrete and continuous wavelet analyses have been applied to the data sets to characterise these inherently non-stationary time-series of fluctuating water levels. The analysis has indicated which turloughs are on the main line conduit system and which are somewhat off-line, the relative size of the main conduit in the network including evidence of localised constrictions, as well as clearly showing the tidal influence on the water levels in the three lower turloughs at shallow depths similar to 8 km from the main spring outfall at the sea. It has also indicated that the timing of high rainfall events coincident with maximum spring tide levels may promote more consistent, long duration flooding of the turloughs throughout the winter.

As part of the multi-university Atmospheric Exchange Over Lakes and Oceans Study (AEOLOS) the dry deposition fluxes and atmospheric size distributions (SDs) of trace elements were measured over the southern basin of Lake Michigan, USA during summer and fall of 1994 and winter of 1995, concurrently, in Chicago, IL, over Lake Michigan, onboard the USEPA R/V Lake Guardian, and in South Haven, MI. Trace elements included in this study were Pb, Cu, and Zn which are primarily of anthropogenic origin and Al and Mg which are primarily of crustal origin. The flux of the crustal elements were at least an order of magnitude larger than anthropogenic elements. The average fluxes ranged from 0.003 mg/m(2)-day for Pb over Lake Michigan to 5.32 mg/m(2)-day for Mg in Chicago. When the wind was from Chicago over the lake, the fluxes measured over the lake were larger than when the wind was from other directions. Size distributions were also strongly influenced by wind direction, when the wind was from the north, the SDs had relatively flat profiles, and concentrations were smaller than when the wind was from over the land. Concentrations in the coarse fraction were high in Chicago compared to the SDs measured over the lake.

J	Kragh, T; Sand-Jensen, K; Petersen, K; Kristensen, E				Kragh, Theis; Sand-Jensen, Kaj; Petersen, Kathrine; Kristensen, Emil			Fast phosphorus loss by sediment resuspension in a re-established shallow lake on former agricultural fields	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Lake restoration on fertilized agricultural fields can lead to extensive nutrient release from flooded soils which can maintain a poor ecological quality in the new lake. The period with high sediment release is poorly understood due to few detailed lake restorations studies. We conducted such a study of phosphorus (P) mass balance and sediment dynamics in the large (889 ha) and shallow (avg. 1.03 m) Lake Filso, Denmark to evaluate when and how fast P was removed from the lake during the first three years after establishment in autumn 2012. The results revealed that P release was high and temporally dynamic due to strong wind and wave exposure, frequent sediment resuspension and a short water retention time (WRT: 20-183 days). To quantify sediment pools across the entire lake, we performed broad-scale sonar measurements of sediment density and established close relationships to organic carbon and P contents. This enabled estimate of the loss of sediment P with high spatial resolution by comparison with the initial homogeneous P content in the soils. The approach was advantageous as P pools were highly heterogeneously distributed depending on water depth and wave exposure. We found that 65 tons P of the initial 163 tons P in the top 9 cm of the sediment had been lost from the lake between October 2012 and September 2015. Detailed measurements of P stream input and output, initiated 7 months after establishment of the lake, showed that sediment release peaked during winter when mean WRT was much shorter (40 days) than during summer (92 days). Phosphorus concentrations in the water were closely related to wind speed which caused resuspension of P-containing sediment particles particularly from shallow areas. The excess stream output relative to stream input from May 2013 to November 2015 was much smaller than the broad-scale estimate from sediment analysis suggesting that extensive P pools had already been lost from the lake during the first winter after lake establishment. We conclude that high wind exposure, shallow water and short water retention time can be a useful combination in future lake restorations on former agricultural land by facilitating fast and profound sediment P loss lowering subsequent internal loading in the following years. Keeping the water level low during the earliest phases could increase P loss by enhancing both sediment resuspension and hydraulic flushing.

J	Fornarelli, R; Antenucci, JP				Fornarelli, Roberta; Antenucci, Jason P.			The impact of transfers on water quality and the disturbance regime in a reservoir	WATER RESEARCH												The effect of water transfers between two reservoirs on the water quality of the receiving reservoir was investigated over a 9-year period (2000-2008). Different management strategies were implemented in term of the magnitude and timing of water transfers, i.e. the amount of transferred volume and the frequency at which transfers occurred. These different operational modes were analysed to determine changes in nutrient and metal concentrations, chlorophyll a, algal genera and biovolume. During high water transfers, chlorophyll a and total algal biovolume increased, with larger diatoms preferentially selected due to the high silica content of the pumped inflow and a significant shift in cyanobacteria genera occurring from Microcystis to nitrogen-fixing genera. The magnitude and timing of water transfers exerted a strong control on phytoplankton competition and disturbed the typical seasonal succession during low pumping years of a spring diatom bloom followed by summer cyanobacteria dominance: intensive and frequent water transfers resulted in dominance by diatoms for the whole year and effectively limited cyanobacteria summer growth. From this analysis, we identified iron concentration and diatom biovolume as the key water quality indicators to be included in any optimal management, able to control the transfer regime from both a water quantity and water quality prospective.

J	Kong, MX; Guan, Q; Feng, L; Zheng, CM; Tang, J				Kong, Mengxiang; Guan, Qi; Feng, Lian; Zheng, Chunmiao; Tang, Jing			Changes in land-leaching nitrogen and its linkages to lake algal blooms in China	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH: ECOLOGY												Over the past 50 years, nutrient discharge into freshwater ecosystems has significantly increased due to intensive fertilizer application in China. This has led to frequent environmental issues associated with nutrient enrichment, such as algal blooms, in a number of individual lakes. However, the linkages between terrestrial nutrient sources and algal bloom occurrence (BO) at large scales remains under-explored. Here, we simulated the long-term changes in nitrogen (N) leaching from terrestrial ecosystems using a dynamic vegetation model Lund-Potsdam-Jena general ecosystem simulator at the national scale from 1979 to 2018, and examined its connection to satellite-derived BO in 56 large lakes across China. Our findings reveal that N leaching exhibited significantly increasing trends in 74.5% of the national landmass, with an overall rate of 0.40 kg N ha-1 yr-2 for the past four decades. Using a 95% quantile regression model, we analyzed the linkage between N leaching and BO from 2003 to 2018. The results indicated significantly positive correlations in the lakes of the Yangtze Plain during autumn and the lakes of northern China and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau during both summer and autumn. These findings suggest that terrestrial N discharge critically contributes to algal bloom variations in warmer seasons. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of escalating N discharge from terrestrial ecosystems and highlights the potential benefits of fertilization management in mitigating and controlling inland water eutrophication in China.

J	Pine, WE III; Allen, MS				Pine, WE III; Allen, MS			Differential growth and survival of weekly age-0 black crappie cohorts in a Florida lake	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Black crappies Pomoxis nigromaculatus exhibit highly variable survival to adulthood because of their varying larval and juvenile abundance, growth, and mortality during early life. We examined how growth and mortality changed with hatch date, prey density, and water temperature for 7-d cohorts of juvenile black crappies in Lake Wauberg, Florida (a 150-ha hypereutrophic natural lake) during spring and summer 1998. Fish were collected once per week from March through June and twice per month during July and August by means of an otter trawl. Based on daily otolith rings, hatching occurred over a 12-week period (1 March-18 May). The mean daily growth rate (DGR) was positively related to water temperature, which increased over the hatching season. Common prey taxa included calanoid copepods, Daphnia and Bosmina spp., and cyclopoid copepods. The total density of these taxa did not differ significantly among collection dates. Mean hatching date shifted from mid-March for fish collected in mid-April to early April for fish collected in late May. Early-hatched fish had lower DGRs (0.72 mm/d, compared with 0.76 mm/d for fish hatched in midseason and 0.82 mm/d for those hatched late in the season), higher mean daily instantaneous mortality rates (0.25, compared with 0.09 for the other two groups), and lower survival to the end of the first summer. As a result, the 1998 year-class of black crappies in Lake Wauberg was probably dominated by middle- and late-hatched individuals by the end of the first summer.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				JAN	2001	130	1					80	91		10.1577/1548-8659(2001)130<0080:DGASOW>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2001)130<0080:DGASOW>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000168553700007

High-resolution environmental magnetic study of a Holocene sedimentary record from Zaca Lake, California	HOLOCENE												Mineral magnetic studies of Holocene lake sediments recovered from Zaca Lake, in coastal southern California have yielded a 3000-year high-resolution record of terrestrial hydrologic variability and paleolimnology. Samples for magnetic analysis were obtained from an 8.73 m core recovered from the central region of Zaca Lake. Ages, constrained using a combined paleomagnetic and radiocarbon chronostratigraphy, yield sedimentation rates of 2-10 mm/yr with an average rate of 3 mm/yr over the 3000-year interval. Parameters reflecting decadal-scale variability in magnetic concentration (susceptibility, ARM, SIRM) and grain size (ARM/Chi) were measured every 2 cm. Additional rock magnetic tests on whole rock samples and magnetic separates indicate that magnetite and an iron sulfide are the chief magnetic carriers. Detailed analysis of the rock magnetic record reveals four major temporal intervals: 0-135 cm (similar to AD 2009-1757) the period of European settlement; 135-270 cm (similar to AD 1757-1275) the period of Native American, Chumash occupation of the watershed encompassing the bulk of the wet interval known as the little ice age (LIA); 270-600 cm (AD 1275-100) encompassing the drier Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA); and 600-875 cm (2000-3000 ybp) an era dominated by a long interval of low magnetic mineral intensity and concentration that has been interpreted as a time of epic drought. Beginning with the cessation of drought conditions at Zaca Lake around similar to 2000 ybp, the magnetic proxy record of rock magnetic cyclicity and hydrologic variability shows a pronounced decadal to centennial-scale periodicity. We interpret these periodicities as oscillations between summer-dominated sedimentary sequences, characterized by whiting events with their resulting carbonate deposits, and winter dominated sedimentary sequences, typified by sulfide-rich clastics, reflecting lacustrine overturn and enhanced advection of detrital flux during winter storm events. The long-term variation of summer versus winter-dominated weather patterns reflects the climate variability of central California coast-ranges.																			0959-6836	1477-0911				JAN	2019	29	1					17	25		10.1177/0959683618804636	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683618804636													WOS:000454992800002

Preferential Partitioning of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Freshwater Ice	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Millions of lakes worldwide freeze, yet the fate of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in ice in freshwater systems is poorly understood. We quantified concentrations of 36 PFAS, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and inorganic ions in ice and water in seven freshwater lakes to investigate the preferential exclusion of ions during freezing. PFAS concentrations in ice are typically lower than in the water column, demonstrating that these chemicals are excluded from ice as it freezes. However, there is preferential partitioning of both PFAS and DOC relative to cations with average sodium-normalized enrichment factors (EF) ranging from 2.74 for perfluorobutanoate (PFBA; a C-4 perfluorocarboxylic acid) to 4.01 for perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS; a C-8 perfluorosulfonic acid), with a similar EF value of 4.14 for DOC. Laboratory experiments and seasonal measurements of PFAS in the water column indicate that PFAS concentrations in ice are a function of aqueous PFAS concentrations, with lower EF values observed in waters with higher PFAS concentrations. Understanding PFAS behavior in freshwater ice is important for predicting contaminant fate during winter and spring periods, with implications for exposure to PFAS during the winter and release of PFAS when ice melts in freshwater systems.

J	Conant, B Jr				Conant, B Jr			Delineating and quantifying ground water discharge zones using streambed temperatures	GROUND WATER												Streambed temperature mapping, hydraulic testing using minipiezometers, and geochemical analyses of interstitial water of the streambed were used to delineate the pattern of ground water discharge in a sandy streambed and to develop a flux-based conceptual model for ground water/surface water interactions. A new and simple empirical method was used to relate fluxes obtained from minipiezometer data to streambed temperatures. The relationship allowed flux to be calculated at locations where only streambed temperature measurements were made. Slug testing and potentiomanometer measurements at 34 piezometers indicated ground water discharge ranged from 0.03 to 446 L/m(2)/day (and possibly as high as 7060 L/m(2)/day) along a 60 m long by 11 to 14 m wide reach of river. Complex but similar plan-view patterns of flux were calculated for both summer and winter using hundreds of streambed temperatures measured on a I by 2 m grid. The reach was dominated by ground water discharge and 5% to 7% of the area accounted for similar to20% to 24% of the total discharge. < 12% of the total area consisted of recharge zones or no-discharge zones. A conceptual model for ground water/surface water interactions consisting of five different behaviors was developed based on the magnitude and direction of flux across the surface of the streambed. The behaviors include short-circuit discharge (e.g., high-flow springs), high discharge (e.g., preferential flowpaths), low to moderate discharge, no discharge (e.g., horizontal hyporheic or ground water flow), and recharge. Geological variations at depth played a key role in determining which type of flow behavior occurred in the streambed.																			0017-467X	1745-6584				MAR-APR	2004	42	2					243	257		10.1111/j.1745-6584.2004.tb02671.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2004.tb02671.x								15035588					WOS:000189360900010

Species and Trophic Structure of Macrozoobenthos Community in Different Types of Littoral Zones in a Mesotrophic Lake	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												This article presents the results of a study of the species and trophic structure of the macrozoobenthos community in the littoral zone of mesotrophic Lake Obsterno (Republic of Belarus) having different macrophyte beds (Chara, reeds, and lily). The results of ANOVA have shown the influence of studied biotopes on the number of species and Shannon index. The number of species increased from summer to autumn, but the Shannon index was minimal in the middle of summer. Significant differences in species abundance between biotopes have been obtained for oligochaetes, chironomids, active filter feeders, and predators. There are no differences for Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera. The mean values of species similarity for the studied period are 68.9, 74.1, and 70.0% for reeds, lily, and Chara, respectively. The trophic similarity between groups were 66.3, 54.1, and 69.7%. Significant differences between species and trophic similarity are noted only for the lily beds. The values of variability of species structure during the period are higher than trophic structure; i.e., trophic structure is more stable when compared with species structure.																			1995-4255	1995-4263				JAN	2021	14	1					20	26		10.1134/S1995425521010066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995425521010066													WOS:000619822700003

Samples were collected at Inchon, Seoul, Yangsuri, and Yangpyoung between 21 and 25 February, and between 12 and 16 May 2000. Ambient size distributions were measured with a cascade impactor and a coarse particles rotary impactor. Dry deposition fluxes of particles were measured with dry deposition plates. The total particulate PAHs concentrations are between 22.9 and 410 ng m(-3), with an average of 139 ng m-3. The total particulate PAHs dry deposition fluxes were between 10 and 24 mug m(-2) day(-1) in winter, and between 4.1 and 8.2 mug m(-2) day(-1) in spring. Both the ambient concentrations and dry deposition fluxes of PAHs in winter are higher than spring mainly due to higher fuel consumption. The ambient concentrations of PAHs in Inchon were the highest followed by Yangpyoung, Yangsuri, and Seoul. The PAHs concentrations and fluxes of Yangsuri and Yangpyoung, rural areas in Korea, are higher than the rural areas in USA. It suggests a serious PAHs pollution level of rural areas in Korea. Based on the PAHs individual compounds' levels and size distributions, it was suggested that Yangpyoung and Yangsuri have local PAHs sources in addition to transport from urban areas.

J	Zhou, BT; Wang, ZY				Zhou, Botao; Wang, Zunya			Enlightenment from heavy autumn rain of West China in 2017: synergic role of atmospheric circulation at mid-high latitudes and oceanic background	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Autumn rain of West China (ARWC), a typical climate phenomenon characterized by continuous rainfall, is prone to flooding and secondary disasters. The ARWC in 2017, the greatest one since the last 30 years, resulted in an economic loss of 1.9 billion dollars and serious social impacts. It is thus urgent to understand the cause for this anomaly. In this article, the atmospheric circulations affecting the 2017's ARWC are identified. They are (1) a dipole pattern with the blocking over Europe and the trough over Lake Balkhash, which favors the southward outbreak of cold airs into West China, (2) increased water vapor transportation toward West China from the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and (3) a strengthening and northward displacement of the East Asian jet stream. The cold sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) in the equatorial central Pacific provides a superimposed effect. Further analysis reveals a synergic role in the interannual variability of the ARWC from the anomalies of the atmospheric circulation over Lake Balkhash and the SST in the equatorial central Pacific. The combination of anomalous trough over Lake Balkhash with cold SSTA in the equatorial central Pacific is most favorable for the increase of ARWC, while that of anomalous ridge with warm SSTA generally results in a decrease of ARWC. The combination of anomalous ridge with cold SSTA or that of anomalous trough with warm SSTA has no specific indication for ARWC anomalies.						zhou, Botao/0000-0002-5995-2378													0177-798X	1434-4483				OCT	2019	138	1-2					263	274		10.1007/s00704-019-02809-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-02809-9													WOS:000491945900018

With the lowest density in the open lake, the bacterial abundance showed a clear trend in relation to trophic status. The carbon content per cell was higher in autumn and winter, and the opposite was true for bacterial biomass. Bacterial (3)[H]-TdR and (14)[C]-Leu incorporation rates, cell production, turnover times and carbon production varied during the annual cycle at different sites. The ratio of bacterial production to primary production was high, independently of the method used, indicates that the microbial food web in Lake Taihu is an important component of the total food web of the lake and dominated by external inputs.

Rotifer peaks were correlated with rainy periods and relatively clear water, which coincide with the European spring and autumn. All species were able to deal with hypoxic conditions. A clear niche separation can be observed between different genera and between species of the same genus. The population dynamics of the rotifers seem to be ruled by repeated irregular environmental fluctuations. Rainfall appears to be a primary steering factor.																			0018-8158					NOV 3	1995	313						303	312		10.1007/BF00025962	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00025962													WOS:A1995TR66600039

In this study, we outline the characteristics of Fuente de Piedra Lake for two years that had different hydrological budgets. The high precipitations in 1989-90 caused the lake not to dry as usual, and decreased both salinity and the amplitude of changes. There were also differences in nutrient dynamics, with generally lower concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus and ammonium, whereas in the more humid year nitrate showed a distinct maximum in winter. Winter bloom chlorophyil a concentrations were also much higher in 1989-90 (>600 mu g 1(-1)) but there was also a winter productive phase that was presumably poorly coupled with consumption processes that predominate in spring. Planktonic assemblages were different between years. Highly halotolerant phytoplankton species (Dunaliella salina and D. viridis) became scarcer, and especially two previously unrecorded diatoms (Cyclotella sp. and Chaetoceros sp.) became dominant in the bloom time in the wet year. The species richness of the zooplankton increased in the wet year, with new species appearing that were not collected during 1987-88 (Branchinectella media, Daphnia mediterranea, Macrothrix sp., Arctodiaptomus salinus, Cyclops sp., Sigara sp...). There was also a much higher development of macrophytes (Ruppia drepanensis, Althenia orientalis, Lamprothamnium papulosum) and bird populations, especially flamingoes (Phoenicopterus ruber). Important interannual variations in this sort of system point to the need for long term studies to observe the whole range of states that define the lake as an entity.

A total of 165 species were recorded during the study. Diatoms and Cyanobacteria were the dominant taxa at most stations. Nitrate and phosphate values showed a decreasing gradient with the distance from Sigirci Inlet to Karadere Outlet. Bacillariophyta dominated the phytoplankton in spring, while Cyanobacteria prevailed in summer. Each summer, a peak of Euglenophyta was also observed at Sigirci Inlet. Nutrient gradients seemed to have a greater control over overall density than of species composition. The size distribution of the Cyanobacteria showed positive correlations with nutrient levels, while green algae and diatoms did not. There was a negative correlation between the average cell dimension of the phytoplankton cells and the surface area to volume ratio in general. The objective of this study was to determine the seasonal dynamics of species composition, abundance and size distribution of phytoplankton assemblages across nutrient gradients along a distance in the shallow hypertrophic Lake Manyas, Turkey.					; ÇELİK, KEMAL/I-5815-2017; TUNCA, Hatice/GOP-3221-2022	ONGUN SEVINDIK, Tugba/0000-0001-7682-0142; 													1040-2381	2151-5530				SEP	2006	22	3					250	260		10.1080/07438140609353903	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140609353903													WOS:000243027700009

The dominant zooplankton species were D. connexus, Brachionus plicatilis, Hexarthra fennica and Daphnia similis. Diaptomus had a 1 yr life cycle. Overwintered late-stage copepodites molted into adults in May and June and were followed by sequential peaks in numbers of eggs, nauplii and copepodites. The estimated annual production of this species was 0.6 g dry wt/m2 or 0.3 g C/m2. About 4% of the annual planktonic primary production would be required to support Diaptomus if it is 10% efficient. The standing crop of Brachionus and Hexarthra was highest in the spring and declined thereafter; Hexarthra was more abundant than Brachionus. The standing crop of Daphnia was much lower than that of either rotifer and showed a spring and fall peak in abundance. Differences in vertical distribution were present among the zooplankton species but no real vertical migrations were observed.																									1979	36	12					1431	1438		10.1139/f79-209	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f79-209													WOS:A1979HW53300002

The Freshwater Copepod Limnocalanus macrurus in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago: Numbers, Weights, and Respiration Observed from September 1961-July 1962	ARCTIC												Numbers, weights, and oxygen consumption of the copepod Limnocalanus macrurus were measured through the winter 1961-62 under the ice of Immerk Lake on Devon Island, Arctic Canada. Maximum abundance was 2361 animals per m(3) found under ice in mid June, average adult wet weight was 65 mu g, and hourly oxygen Consumption per adult ranged from 0.26 mu g in late summer to 0.03 mu g in early winter. The results are compared with results from Char Lake and Resolute Lake on Cornwallis Island, Arctic Canada. The Immerk population was more stable than those at the other lakes, and weights and oxygen consumption appear to be comparable. The seasonal breeding cycle at Immerk Lake was different from that at Char Lake and similar to that at Resolute Lake. A comparison of Immerk Lake data from 1961-62 and 1972-73 showed almost identical levels of total oxygen metabolism. Immerk Lake copepod oxygen consumption was 6.5% of the total lake metabolism, while that at Char Lake was 6%.

At present, there are few examples where this approach has been applied to environmental monitoring or assessment. Here we 1) present a case study that used a fixed antenna array and continuously scanning coded receiving system to monitor the movement of radio-tagged smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) in a thermal discharge canal on Lake Erie during the winter of 1998/1999, and 2) evaluate the use of fixed telemetry arrays for environmental monitoring. Although the number of radiotagged bass in the canal decreased gradually over time, fish spent the majority of the winter in the canal. When in the canal, bass selected areas upstream of the tempering pumps where water was the warmest. This region was also high in habitat complexity, had adequate velocity refuges, and abundant forage. Despite residing in the thermal effluent throughout the winter, none of the fish monitored were observed to participate in reproductive activities in the canal in the Spring. Interestingly, during a biofouling chlorination pulse in May, 50% of radiotagged fish still residing in the canal left and did not return during the monitoring period. Utility infrastructure accessible to fish, including thermal effluents, should be considered as fish habitat and managed accordingly to minimize mortality and sublethal effects on resident and transient fish. Fixed telemetry arrays that permit the continuous monitoring of fish behavior as described in this paper are widely applicable to many issues in environmental management, monitoring, and conservation.

Acute Air Pollution Exposure and Risk of Suicide Completion	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY												Research into environmental factors associated with suicide has historically focused on meteorological variables. Recently, a heightened risk of suicide related to short-term exposure to airborne particulate matter was reported. Here, we examined the associations between short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and sulfur dioxide and completed suicide in Salt Lake County, Utah (n = 1,546) from 2000 to 2010. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design to estimate adjusted odds ratios for the relationship between suicide and exposure to air pollutants on the day of the suicide and during the days preceding the suicide. We observed maximum heightened odds of suicide associated with interquartile-range increases in nitrogen dioxide during cumulative lag 3 (average of the 3 days preceding suicide; odds ratio (OR) = 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.39) and fine particulate matter (diameter <= 2.5 mu m) on lag day 2 (day 2 before suicide; OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.10). Following stratification by season, an increased suicide risk was associated with exposure to nitrogen dioxide during the spring/fall transition period (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.66) and fine particulate matter in the spring (OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.61) during cumulative lag 3.

Remarkable seasonal and spatial differences in the total amounts and ratios between both fractions were observed. Equally low concentrations of dissolved and particle-bound geosmin were found in the winter season during turnover conditions (maximum total geosmin 3.1 ng l(-1)). In the clear-water period the dissolved fraction of geosmin increased dramatically (93% of the total) whereas the particle-bound geosmin showed. only minor changes. In the autumn and first part of the winter surface films contributed essentially to the particle-bound fraction of geosmin exhibiting maximum concentrations of 21 ng l(-1). Possible producers of geosmin in Lake Zurich (Aphanizomenon, Oscillatoria, Planktothrix) were cultivated and their content of geosmin was determined. Feeding experiments with Daphnia and Simocephalus simulating the phenomenon of the clear-water period clearly demonstrated that grazing can be regarded as a major mechanism for the Liberation of geosmin from particles. The mean degradation rate in a microcosm experiment caused by pelagic bacteria was 3.1 ng l(-1) d(-1); this rate was high enough to explain the concentration differences between consecutive sampling dates.

Especially the Alpine region is affected by changing conditions, which do not only have ecological but also economic impacts in respect to winter sports tourism. Due to higher environmental temperatures and less precipitation, artificial snow making is becoming increasingly important and consequently, mountain reservoirs for water storage are built. In these systems, planktonic communities are not only influenced by the naturally harsh environmental conditions of the alpine region, but also by severe changes in water level fluctuations due to water withdrawal and re-filling within short time periods. Information on planktonic communities and species traits in such man-made water bodies is nonexistent. Here, we focused on ciliates, a group of unicellular protists known to adapt and respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions. Simultaneously, we identified abiotic and other biotic factors that shaped these microbial communities. We investigated the species composition, abundance and species traits of ciliates in eleven mountain reservoirs in the Tyrolean Alps, Austria, and hypothesized that these communities differed significantly from natural ones. The mountain reservoirs were investigated twice during the ice-free season and water chemistry, chlorophyll a, bacteria, zooplankton, and ciliates were sampled. We detected 48 ciliate taxa in total, with an average of five taxa per mountain reservoir. A wide range of abundance (summer: 24 to >15,600 Ind L-1; autumn: 38 to similar to 7,500 Ind L-1) and no clear pattern in the community composition was found, most likely due to water level fluctuations and the source of water used for filling the mountain reservoirs. The ciliate abundance was significantly affected by pH, nutrients, but also water transparency and potential predators (crustaceans). Planktonic ciliates dominated the mountain reservoirs and, surprisingly, mixotrophic species, typically found in natural (alpine) lakes, were only rarely observed. Our data suggest that in these fast-changing systems, local factors seem to be more important than regional ones.					; Summerer, Monika/JAZ-1817-2023	Sonntag, Bettina/0000-0001-7065-522X; 														2296-665X				JUL 22	2022	10								903095	10.3389/fenvs.2022.903095	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2022.903095													WOS:000868160000001

The simulated thermal profiles were compared to 78 measured profiles from 1972-1977. The simulator which employs a simple thermal diffusion-density mixing algorithm appears to mimic the thermal regime of the lake to a considerable degree but often fails to produce complete correspondence in the epilimnion during spring-summer warming. The similarity between the simulated and observed profiles suggests that the natural mixing process in this calm sheltered lake may be similar to the quantized model employed in the simulations.																			0003-9136						1981	91	2					181	191																WOS:A1981LX22000004

Seasonal variation in physicochemical characteristics and lead contamination of Lake Tonga and their effects on waterbird populations	UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Being the Ramsar site, Tonga Lake is one of the most important wetlands in Numidia for its habitat diversity and its fauna and flora richness. It is known as a wintering and breeding site for many waterbirds species. However, it is confronted with an increasing pressure linked to various anthropogenic activities. This study was carried out between December 2015 and August 2016 to assess the physicochemical quality and lead contamination of the surface waters and their impacts on the waterbirds population dynamic. Seven physicochemical parameters were considered (Temperature, pH, Electrical Conductivity, Turbidity, Dissolved Oxygen, TDS, and Salinity). Waterbirds monitoring revealed that 43 species were counted in winter and 26 in summer, with some endangered ducks, such as White-headed Duck, Marbled Teal, and Ferruginous Duck. The highest number of abundances was recorded in January (27,507 individuals). The results of water physicochemical parameters measurements showed strong mineralization, neutral to alkaline pH values, and high turbidity. The high lead values obtained from water samples have exceeded WHO standards. During the two seasons studied, correlations were identified, indicating a probable seasonal association between studied parameters (limnological and lead concentrations) and Lake Tonga waterbirds population dynamics.

Here, by using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the 16S and 18S rRNA gene fragments, we compared free-living (FL) and particle-associated (PA) bacterial communities and microeukaryotic communities in the areas with different nutrient intakes in freshwater Lake Baikal during the ice-covered and summer periods. Samples were taken at the inflow of the Selenga River, which is the main tributary of the lake, and at several established coastal research stations. The metabolic potential of the bacterial communities was predicted using PICRUSt. Differences were found in both FL and PA communities of the river mouth compared to the photic zone of the lake. The composition of FL communities was significantly different between the sampling sites in the ice-covered period, which is most likely influenced by different hydrochemical conditions. In contrast, the PA communities were more similar during the ice-covered period, but they changed considerably from spring to summer and their diversity increased. The diversity of the microeukaryotic communities also increased in summer, which may have contributed to the increase in bacterial diversity. In co-occurrence networks analysis, the number of interconnected bacterial OTUs in FL exceeded those for PA. The FL communities were dominated by Actinobacteriota, while the major PA OTUs belonged to a mixed cluster, which were mainly assigned to the phyla Bacteroidota and Verrucomicrobiota. As a result, PA communities were enriched in pathways responsible for the metabolism of sulfur, fucose, cellulose and urea. Our results confirm the difference between the FL and PA bacterial communities in Lake Baikal. These results also highlight the complex pattern of interactions between bacteria and microeukaryotes in a natural freshwater ecosystem across spatial and temporal scales.

We explore how the local climate was affected by the construction of one of North America's largest reservoirs, the Williston Hydropower Reservoir, in British Columbia's Rocky Mountain Trench. High-resolution simulations of the Weather Research and Forecasting model over a 10-year period were used to analyze differences in mean meteorological states with and without the reservoir represented in the landscape. Relative to terrain without the Williston Reservoir, autumn precipitation increased by up to 30 mm (11.5%); however, a substantial precipitation decrease in summer results in a 15% reduction of mean annual precipitation over ridges east of the reservoir. The presence of the reservoir with high thermal inertia in place of vegetated soil reduced convection in the warm season so that heavy precipitation events (> 20 mm) become fewer. An increase in mean annual air temperature within 10 km of the reservoir by 0.2-0.5 degrees C due mainly to significant warming in autumn was also detected. Overland wind increased by 0.5 m s(-1) up to 13 km from the reservoir. We highlight the social importance of these results on the perception of environmental change.

J	Somay-Altas, AM				Somay-Altas, A. Melis			Hydrogeochemical fingerprints of a mixohaline wetland in the Mediterranean: Gulluk coastal wetland systems- GCWS (Mugla, Turkey)	TURKISH JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The Gunk coastal wetland system (GCWS), which is located at the contact point of the Menderes Massif and Lycian Nappe, consists of both brackish karstic [Gulluk Lagoon wetland (GLW)] and saline [Bogazici-Tuzla (Bargylia) coastal wetland (BTW) ecosystems in western Turkey, and is under protection as a national wetland of importance. This area is important for its unique wetland features, aquaculture, tourism, agriculture, Bodrum airport, and Ulla port facilities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the GLW and BTW, both hydrogeologically and hydrogeochemically, for the first time together. The mixohaline GCWS is recharged from precipitation, streams, and brackish karstic springs. The electrical conductivity (EC) values of Limni Lake and the Tuzla salt pan were measured as 15,330 and 41,000 mu S/cm, respectively. The EC value of the brackish karstic springs was similar to 17,310 mu S/cm. From the coast to inland, the mixing ratio increases to a maximum of 45% in Savrankoy Spring, which discharges from the contact point between Milas Formation and alluvium. The relationship between Na-Cl, SO4-HCO3, and Mg/Ca-Cl showed a weathering by ion exchange and/or seawater intrusion process. All of the groundwater samples comprised NaCl water. In parallel with these results, the diagrams of Gibbs et al. supported the same seawater intrusion phenomena. Brackish karst springs first roseand then fell below sea level with epirogenic movements during the geological period, and therefore, karstification progressed. The samples were oversaturated with calcite, dolomite, and quartz, whereas they were undersaturated with gypsum and halite. The Al, Cu, and Zn values of some of the water samples exceeded the tolerance limit of aquatic life standards. When the samples were evaluated in terms of irrigation water, brackish springs, and streams at Avsar and located near the aquaculture farm, Lake Limni and saltpan had a harmful effect on the plants due to their high Na concentration. These results suggested that the wetland was vulnerable because it was both in a sensitive karstic and a lagoon area. Hydrogeological protected zones should be determined to ensure the sustainability of groundwater resources and provide the economy of the country.

Metalimnetic oxygen minima alter the vertical profiles of carbon dioxide and methane in a managed freshwater reservoir	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Metalimnetic oxygen minimum zones (MOMs) commonly develop during the summer stratified period in freshwater reservoirs because of both natural processes and water quality management. While several previous studies have examined the causes of MOMs, much less is known about their effects, especially on reservoir biogeochemistry. MOMs create distinct redox gradients in the water column which may alter the magnitude and vertical distribution of dissolved methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The vertical distribution and diffusive efflux of CH4 and CO2 was monitored for two consecutive open-water seasons in a eutrophic reservoir that develops MOMS as a result of the operation of water quality engineering systems. During both summers, elevated concentrations of CH4 accumulated within the anoxic MOM, reaching a maximum of 120 mu M, and elevated concentrations of CO2 accumulated in the oxic hypolinin ion, reaching a maximum of 780 mu M. Interestingly, the largest observed diffusive CH4 effluxes occurred before fall turnover in both years, while peak diffusive CO2 effluxes occurred both before and during turnover. Our data indicate that MOMs can substantially change the vertical distribution of CH4 and CO2 in the water column in reservoirs, resulting in the accumulation of CH4 in the metalimnion (vs. at the sediments) and CO2 in the hypolimnion.

J	Curtiss, ER; Weldon, RJ II; Egger, AE				Curtiss, Elizabeth R.; Weldon, Ray J.; Egger, Anne E.			Paleoseismic Investigation of the Thousand and Range, Oregon	BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA												Earthquake recurrence intervals, surface-rupture extents, and interactions between faults provide insight into how faults behave and are critical for seismic hazard mitigation and earthquake forecasting. Investigating the paleoseismology of spatially related faults can reveal strain distribution and whether faults rupture as a system or independently. Summer Lake basin, a graben in the northwestern Basin and Range with four active faults (three of which have prior paleoseismic investigations), provides an opportunity to investigate fault interactions. To expand the paleoseismic record, two trenches were excavated across the previously undocumented Thousand Springs fault, exposing a normal fault zone that offsets a sequence of deep- to shallow-water lake sediments, sand dunes containing reworked Mazama ash, and other Cascades-sourced tephra. Tephra units were correlated to known units by their physical characteristics, stratigraphic sequence, glass chemistry, and two new radiocarbon dates from the uppermost lake sediments. Using trench exposures, measured vertical separations through auguring, colluvial wedges, and extrapolated offsets based on a constant sedimentation rate, we identified at least five surface-rupturing earthquakes with a total offset of 3.4 + 2/-1 m in the past similar to 65 ka. The oldest event (EH5) occurred at 63.8 +/- 1.5 ka, event horizon 4 at 36.2 +/- 12.7 ka (which could be more than one event), and event horizon 3 at 24.6 +/- 0.3 ka. Event horizon 2, a warping event at our site, is likely more than one event and occurred between 7.5 and 10 ka; and the most recent event (EH1+), most likely more than one event, occurred between 3.3 and 7.7 ka. Several events correlate, within error, with events on other faults in the Summer Lake basin, suggesting that (1) the faults generally rupture together as a system, (2) the most recent earthquake may have ruptured all faults in the region, and (3) fault rupture is influenced by the rapid regression of Lake Chewaucan (similar to 13 ka).

In the present study, cluster analysis and factor analysis are used to support the hydrochemical characterization of groundwater and surface water in an area located in the Oglio River basin (N Italy). During a field survey performed in Fall 2015, 58 groundwater, 20 river (Oglio River and its main tributaries), 1 Lake Iseo and 7 spring samples were collected for chemical analysis. Results of multivariate statistical analysis led to the identification of the following 5 main clusters which characterize the hydrological system: (1) higher plain groundwater and springs, characterized by an oxidized hydrofacies with higher NO3, (2) lower plain groundwater, characterized by a reduced hydrofacies with higher As, Fe and Mn, (3) Oglio River, (4) Oglio River tributaries and (5) outliers. This characterization will bear the improvement of the hydrogeological conceptual model of the area, also oriented to groundwater/surface water interactions, that, in turn, will support the numerical flow modeling of the system.

Shortterm and acute aquatic bioassays using Ceriodaphnia dubia and a green alga (Selenastrum capricombtum) as test organisms have been in use for many yearn in the regulation of wastewater effluents. These tests have,been employed in the present study to compare the toxicity of water extracts of atmospheric particulate mattor and dichloromethane (DCM) extracts that have been transferred to dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted in water. Atmospheric PM was collected at four sites located near the south shore of Lake Michigan and one site in Michigan's: Upper Peninsula at discrete events during three seasons. Parallel chemical analyses of the two extracts directly assessed the relation between the chemical composition and the toxicity of the extract. Inductively coupled plasma, analysis of the metals in the water extract and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy of the organics in the DCM extract showed a relationship between high toxicity and high water-soluble copper concentration and high secondary,organic aerosol tracers in the extracted aerosol. Although previous fractionation studies have not looked at water-soluble copper, significant toxicity has been measured in the semipolar and polar organic fractions of ambient aerosols and diesel exhaust particles, which are the fractions in which secondary organic aerosol components would be expected. For the water extracts, the summer samples were consistently more toxic than the autumn or spring samples. There was not a seasonal pattern for the toxicity of the DCM extracts; however, spatial differences were apparent. The toxicity end points of select samples from one site qualitatively correlate with the high polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations. Additionally, high toxicity in the July DCM extracts from another site may be tied to the presence of the insecticide carbaril. The seasonal and spatial variations captured in the toxicity results in this study tend to qualitatively correlate with trace organic components and metals and not bulk particulate matter composition.					; Sheesley, Rebecca/I-6655-2015	Sheesley, Rebecca/0000-0002-8187-0571; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				FEB 15	2005	39	4					999	1010		10.1021/es049873+	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es049873+								15773471					WOS:000227001700013
J	Koppel, LL; Bosart, LF; Keyser, D				Koppel, LL; Bosart, LF; Keyser, D			A 25-yr climatology of large-amplitude hourly surface pressure changes over the conterminous United States	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												Hourly surface pressure observations for a 25-yr period (1949-63; 1984-93) for the conterminous United States have been used to map the distribution of large hourly pressure changes defined as falls or rises in excess of 4.25 hPa. Initially, 8431 reports satisfying this pressure change threshold were obtained. After error checking, this number was reduced to 5380 occurrences. Large hourly surface pressure changes are most common over the Great Plains and New England and least common over the Southeast and Southwest. Large pressure falls are confined almost exclusively to the Plains, upper Midwest, and New England, and are virtually absent over the Intermountain West and parts of the Appalachians. A manual (subjective) analysis identified 1038 inertia-gravity wave (IGW) occurrences from the 5380 large hourly surface pressure change occurrences. IGW occurrences are most common across the Plains and from the Great Lakes toward western New England, and are virtually absent across the Intermountain West. A partitioning of IGW occurrences on the basis of weather type reveals that IGWs associated with cyclones occur preferentially from Nebraska eastward across the Great Lakes to New England, while IGWs associated with convection are mostly confined to the Plains. IGW occurrences are most likely seasonally in winter and spring and diurnally near 0300 and 1200-1300 LST. Considerable interannual variability is seen in the distribution of 579 IGW events (an event may include IGW occurrences at several stations). Twenty-three IGW events (roughly 2 events per month) occur each pear over the conterminous United States and 8 of the 23 events involve multiple stations. IGW events are most prevalent during the March-June period. Representative composites of mean sea level pressure, 1000-500-hPa thickness, 500-hPa geopotential height, and 500-hPa geostrophic wind are shown for cool season (November-April) IGW events associated with cyclones and early warm season (May-June) IGW events associated with convection. The composites show that IGWs occur preferentially in a warm air advection region to the northeast of the surface cyclone center poleward of a frontal zone and beneath a band of relatively strong southwesterly flow at 500 hPa. The composite results are in broad agreement with the signatures identified by Uccellini and Koch as generally common to occurrences of large-amplitude IGW events identified in the literature.																			0027-0644					JAN	2000	128	1					51	68		10.1175/1520-0493(2000)128<0051:AYCOLA>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0493(2000)128<0051:AYCOLA>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000084609300003

A North European pollen-climate calibration set: analysing the climatic responses of a biological proxy using novel regression tree methods	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We present a new pollen climate calibration data-set from northern Europe consisting of 583 modern pollen samples and high-resolution, GIS-based modern climate data. The pollen data are characterised by high taxonomic resolution (167 taxa) and homogenous taphonomy (all samples are from small-to-medium-sized lakes). To assess the potential of this calibration set for the reconstruction of different climatic parameters, we use novel regression tree methods to analyse the effect on pollen composition and variability of four parameters: summer temperature, winter temperature, water balance, and continentality index. We use multivariate regression trees to analyse the variation in pollen assemblages in modern climate space, while boosted regression trees are used to analyse the relative influence of different climatic parameters on each taxon. We find taxon responses to be relatively individualistic. While most taxa (65%) are most responsive to summer temperature, other parameters are either primary determinants or significant secondary determinants for many taxa. At the assemblage level, significant variation is found in assemblages from similar summer temperature regimes, with distinct clusters of assemblages also identified along the continentality gradient. As a multivariate method, we consider boosted regression trees highly effective in describing and modelling modern climate taxon relationships. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Data were collected ro monitor mysids relative to ongoing ecological changes in Lake Michigan and as a comparison to studies from the 1970s and 1980s. Mean densities of M. relicta during May through September each year were higher offshore (210/m(2) to 373/m(2)) compared to nearshore (41/m(2) to 168/m(2)). Growth rates ranged between 0.026 to 0.041 mm/day and did not differ between stations or with age. Juvenile mysids (< 10 mm) dominated the population, and accounted for 30 to 90% of the catch. The size distribution of M. relicta suggested that reproduction occurred year-round with the most consistent influxes of juveniles in the spring (April through June) each year; winter (February and March) and summer (July through September) influxes of juveniles did nor occur consistently each year. Mean length of females with broods differed between nearshore (14 mm) and offshore (16 mm). Brood size and the proportion of females with broods did not differ between stations. Abundance estimates were equal or higher and life history characteristics were similar to reported data from the 1970s and 1980s. However ongoing declines in the benthic macroinvertebrate Diporeia may result in higher fish predation pressure on M. relicta in the near future.					; Fahnenstiel, Gary/ABD-6133-2020	Pothoven, Steven/0000-0002-7992-5422; Vanderploeg, Henry/0000-0003-1358-8475													0380-1330						2000	26	4					357	365		10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70700-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70700-3													WOS:000166155600002
J	Liao, JT; Ye, H; Huang, TF; Peng, GH				Liao, Jun-tao; Ye, Hui; Huang, Ting-fa; Peng, Gui-hong			Seasonal waterbird population changes in Lashihai Lake in northwest Yunnan, China	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												We studied the waterbird population at Lashihai Lake, Yunnan Province, China, which is a Ramsar Site (Wetland of International Importance), to determine seasonal variation in the species composition and size of the waterbird population. The study was conducted at five selected spots along Lashihai Lake at the same time each week from August 2011 to September 2013. In total, 62 waterbird species were recorded, of which 38.71%, 35.48%, 16.13%, and 9.68% were winter migrants, passage visitors, residents, and summer migrants, respectively. We found important seasonal changes in waterbird species composition and population size. Waterbird species richness was highest from September to the following April, with the total species numbers peaking in December. Total individual numbers peaked twice from late November to early December and mid-to-late February. However, waterbird species and individual numbers were comparatively lower from May to August. The change in species composition was determined by the arrival and departure dynamics of winter migrants and passage visitors. Winter migrants primarily caused the periodic changes in population size. Of concern, species and overall waterbird numbers seemed to be lower than the numbers in historical records. The decline of waterbird numbers implies that environmental changes caused by the implementation of the dam upstream of Lashihai Lake may have had adverse effects on this waterbird population. This study confirms the existence of major seasonal changes in species composition and size of the waterbird population at Lashihai Lake. Furthermore, the findings demonstrate that this wetland is of high conservation importance for waterbirds using the Central Asian-Indian and Asian-Pacific migratory routes.																			1672-6316	1993-0321				SEP	2017	14	9					1852	1862		10.1007/s11629-016-4164-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-016-4164-3													WOS:000409490000015

As a result of the study, seasonal changes in ACTH and cortisol levels were found statistically significant (p <0.05). It was suggested that ACTH and cortisol levels may increase due to reproductive activities in spring and rising water temperature in summer. It was concluded that animals have physiologically adaptive arrangements on the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis to overcome stress and survive.					erdogan, kenan/KFB-5801-2024	Erdogan, Kenan/0000-0003-0447-1582													1018-4619	1610-2304					2021	30	11A					12107	12110																WOS:000716443600004

Invasive aquatic neophytes can cause serious ecological and economic problems in lakes and other freshwater ecosystems. In the presented study, a species distribution model was used to identify possible habitats for neophytes in Bavaria (Southern Germany) and to predict which Bavarian lakes might become suitable habitats for neophytes due to climate change. A total of 55 Bavarian lakes were fitted with high-resolution temperature loggers as part of this monitoring programme. Furthermore, the physical and chemical properties of the lakes were determined and verified in regular intervals. The presence or absence of the native thermophilic macrophyte Najas marina L. was used as an indicator to determine whether a lake was a suitable habitat for neophytes. The results revealed that the spread of neophytes in Bavaria is mainly limited by spring and summer water temperature. In contrast, nutrient concentrations in the water showed no significant influence. Suitable lakes reached temperatures of at least 15 degrees C for 2 months during spring and at least 20 degrees C for 2 months during summer. By comparison, the water temperatures in lakes classified as not suitable for neophytes were 2-5 degrees C lower. The computed predictions for the estimated temperature increase of 1.4 degrees C, for the period between 2021 and 2050, indicate that up to 70 % of Bavarian lakes might become suitable habitats for neophytes.

This change was evident during the Peridinium bloom period and was caused by a decrease in both cell number and size. Other changes were observed in the composition of the algal assemblage. Throughout the year, the relative proportion of small Chlorophyta and Cyanophyta increased, the latter especially in late summer and fall. Chlorophyll concentrations did not decrease correspondingly because of a general increase in the cellular chlorophyll content of algae. The primary production was maintained, despite the fall-off in algal biomass as freshweight, because of the shift to more rapidly metabolizing species. As a result, assimilation numbers, turnover times and algal growth rates were observed to be higher than previously (1969-1972). These changes suggest a trend away from a detrital food web dominated by Peridinium to a pattern of greater zooplankton grazing.																			0030-1299	1600-0706					1977	29	3					418	428		10.2307/3543582	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3543582													WOS:A1977ES03700005

To deal with such difficulties, the conditional probability of streamflow's being below a critical magnitude, given a prior observation of SOI, can be considered a random variable, with its probability density function (pdf) estimated by Bayesian analysis of existing observations of streamflow and SOI. The conditional pdf can yield a probabilistic forecast of critically low streamflows given a precursor value of SOI. In the Clutha River basin of New Zealand, average austral summer inflow to the headwater lakes has an unconditional probability of nonexceedance of 360 m3/s of approximately 17%. However, during a moderate La Nina, average austral spring SOI = 12, the conditional probability of nonexceedance has an expected value of 55%. For an El Nino with a spring SOI of -12, the expected probability of nonexceedance is 18%; for a neutral SOI of 0, the expected probability is 10%. Thus, the probability of nonexceedance of seasonal streamflow can be seen to vary by a factor of more than 5 as a function of the SOI.																			0043-1397					OCT	1994	30	10					2717	2723		10.1029/94WR01308	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/94WR01308													WOS:A1994PJ32500006

Zooplankton and environmental data were sampled at 52 sites forming 16 transects along the fluvial section zone (FSZ), the fluvial estuary zone (FEZ) and the estuarine transition zone (ETZ) of the St. Lawrence River in May and August 2006. We compared zooplankton community composition among biogeographical zones and fluvial lakes and across the fluvial estuarine continuum. Analyses were carried out using asymmetric eigenvector maps (AEM), redundancy analysis (RDA), and variation partitioning. Spatial distribution patterns revealed a complex river model. Riverscale discontinuities between the fluvial and estuarine transition zones, and the hydrological network of water masses in the fluvial zones, explained better the spatial zooplankton distribution patterns along the fluvial estuarine continuum than the local environment. Spatial variation in the flow network and environmental conditions were the main drivers of zooplankton distributions in spring whereas the flow network of water masses was the most influential factor in summer.

PHYTOPLANKTON RESPONSE TO CHANGES OF PHYSICOCHEMICAL VARIABLES IN LAKE NASSER, EGYPT	JOURNAL OF ELEMENTOLOGY												Seasonal and spatial changes of phytoplankton in relation to environmental variables affecting the water quality were investigated along the main channel of Lake Nasser throughout 2013. In total, 104 phytoplankton species, belonging to 7 classes, were identified. Phytoplankton assemblages were dominated by Bacillariophyceae, Cyanophyceae and Chlorophyceae, whereas Dinophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Chrysophyceae and Cryptophyceae were infrequent. Cyclotella glomerata, C. ocellata and Aulacoseira granulata represented the most abundant species among Bacillariophyceae. Cyanophyceae was dominated by Planktolyngbya limnetica and Eucapsis minuta, and Chlorophyceae by Ankistrodesmus fusiformis and Staurastrum paradoxum. The water column was thermally stratified during summer, while being mixed throughout winter. Phytoplankton features and physicochemical variables were analyzed with the principal component analysis. Electrical conductivity and water temperature were the most common factors negatively controlling phytoplankton density. Phytoplankton density was positively associated with NO3, whereas it was negatively correlated with PO4 and HCO3. Cyanophyceae were strongly adapted to the environmental variables and NO2 was limiting their growth. Chlorophyceae were more dependent on PO4 than NO3. The vertical distribution of Chl a was associated with the summer thermal stratification and its concentration increased southwards. Chl a was affected by NO2 and linked to Chlorophyceae. The regional variations of phytoplankton reflected its response to varying environmental conditions. The annual average of the trophic state index indicated eutrophic waters of Lake Nasser.

Muhammad; Ullah, Zahid			Prediction of Paleoclimate of Eocene Salt, Kohat Basin, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan	EPISODES												Fluid inclusion analysis is a significant tool to evaluate the paleoclimate reconstruction of ancient evaporite pre-cipitation. The current study is a significant research to evaluate the ancient climate of Eocene salt. The thin sections petrography, XRD, SEM, Laser raman spectroscopy, and Microthermometric analysis have been used to evaluate the prediction of paleoclimate of Eocene salt. Two sections were measured and samples were collected for thin sec-tions analysis. Under thin section, halite is mainly cubic shape euhedral form and also consists of other minerals like gypsum, anhydrite, polyhalite, sylvite, and dolomite. Geochemical data obtained from XRD, indicates the presence of Na and Cl as major ions, with subordinate Ca, SO4, Mg, etc. Laser raman spectroscopy analysis reveals that water and CO2 fluids are trapped within the inclusions. Generally, fluid inclusion analysis and geochemistry are useful tools to evaluate the origin and paleoclimate of Eocene Salt. Geo-chemical data shows that the Eocene salt is not a product of marine water but it also consists of meteoric and sur-face water. Low concentration of Br- and presence of SO4 shows that halite is precipitated from SO4 type water. Homog-enization temperature (Th) ranges from 14 & DEG;C to 43 & DEG;C. Microthermometric data shows that fluids were entrapped during and after salt precipitation. Histogram of fluid inclusions also shows that primary and secondary inclu-sions have discontinuous behavior that shows inclusions were not trapped at the same time of deposition. Some are formed at the time of precipitation and some are formed after precipitation. The presence of impurities like Fe, Mg, Ca, and other ions within the halite show that halite was exposed to the atmosphere by tectonic activities and meteoric water/surface water percolates through fractures and is trapped as inclusion along with the micro fractures. So the Th variation indicates that fluid was trapped at various seasons. Low temperature show inclusions were trapped in winter/spring seasons and high temperatures indicates inclusions were trapped in the summer season. The maximum homogenization temperature of fluid inclu-sions in halite is 43 & DEG;C which is closed to the maximum cli-matical temperature of the present summer. The result shows that Eocene salt has been deposited in hot, arid, and dry conditions during Eocene time. The alternating period of desalination and evaporation is responsible for the for-mation of soluble halite.

J	Ferencz, B; Dawidek, J; Toporowska, M				Ferencz, Beata; Dawidek, Jaroslaw; Toporowska, Magdalena			Instability of Water Quality of a Shallow, Polymictic, Flow-Through Lake	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												This paper describes catchment processes that favor the trophic instability of a shallow polymictic lake, in which a shift from eutrophy to hypertrophy occurs rapidly. In the lake, in 2007, the winter discharge maximum and an intensive precipitation (monthly sums exceeded 60 mm) in a vegetation season were observed. In 2007, the cyanobacterial blooms disappeared and the water trophy decreased. Total phosphorus (TP) was the main factor determining the high trophic status of the lake. The TP retention resulted from a quick flow of two inflows: QI1 (r = 0.64) and QI2 (0.56), and the base flow of tributary 1 (0.62). A significant negative correlation between TP and precipitation (r = - 0.54) was observed. Both the surface and the groundwater inflow of I4 showed a positive correlation with the retention of PO4 (r = 0.67 and r = 0.60, respectively), whereas the outlet discharge determined RNO3 (r = 0.57). The trophy of Lake SyczyA"skie was determined by the relationship between nutrient input and export, expressed as the ionic retention, Carlson's trophic state index (TSI), and phytoplankton abundance. The results showed that many factors influence the stability of water quality in small, polymictic lakes. However, in the studied lake, intense precipitation and winter discharge maxima (particularly base flow) prevented summer cyanobacterial blooms.

The bacterial plankton constitutes a key component in the water column and bacterial metabolic activity has direct consequences for water quality. In order to understand bacterial response to global temperature rise in five alpine lakes located in the Austrian Alps (1700-2188 m a.S.L.) water temperature was compared within a decadal period. Depth-integrated samples were characterized in community composition by 16S rDNA deep-amplicon sequencing early [56 +/- 16 (SD) days after ice break up] and later (88 +/- 16 days) in the growing season. Within the 10 years period, temperature rise was observed through reduced ice cover duration and increased average water temperature. During the early growing season, the average water temperature recorded between circulation in spring until sampling date (WAS), and the day of autumn circulation, as well as chemical composition including dissolved organic carbon influenced bacterial community composition. In contrast, only nutrients (such as nitrate) were found influential later in the growing season. Metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) was applied to explain the dependence of taxonomic richness on WAS in mathematical terms. The calculated activation energy exceeded the frequently reported prediction emphasizing the role of WAS during early growing season. Accordingly, the relative abundance of predicted metabolism related genes increased with WAS. Thus, the dominant influence of temperature after ice break up could be explained by overall climate change effects, such as a more intense warming in spring and an overall higher amplitude of temperature variation.

Total 196 varve units were recognized in the upper 2 in horizon of the sediment core. Sedimentation rates in the core have some high peaks, indicating increments of elastic particles supplied to the lake owing to natural disasters including floods and earthquakes, and the artificial construction around Lake Fukami. The results of the correlation between the meteorological records in lida meteorological station and the total carbon flux change based on the varve chronology, indicates that the total carbon flux shows an inverse relationship to February mean temperature and precipitation. February mean temperature controlled the vertical mixing of lake water column that affects the productivity of phytoplankton in the epilimnion or decomposition of organic matter in the hypolimnion. February precipitation probably has affected the activity of denitrifying bacteria in the stagnation period. Pyrite and siderite minerals are recognized in the core by observation of thin sections and X-ray powder diffraction analysis. The pyrite was deposited in summer, and the siderite was deposited in summer and winter. These iron minerals indicate the decomposition processes of organic matters in the water column in each season. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Malcolm; Prowse, Terry			Modelling climate change impacts in the Peace and Athabasca catchment and delta: III - integrated model assessment	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												This study utilized the hydrodynamic model, ONE-D, coupled to the distributed hydrological model WATFLOOD, to evaluate the potential effects of a shift in climate on the hydrological regimes of three large lakes (Athabasca, Claire, and Mamawi), and two important sources of inflow (the Peace and Athabasca rivers) in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD). The coupled WATFLOOD/ONE-D system was forced by current climatology and downscaled climate change scenarios from five selected general circulation models (GCMs). Under the selected climate change scenarios, water levels in Lakes Athabasca, Claire, and Mamawi peaked, on average, 40-50 days earlier than at present. Some GCM scenarios predicted an increase in peak lake levels while others predicted suppressed lake levels. Inter-annual water level variability was also sensitive to predicted changes in precipitation and temperature, increasing in winter and decreasing in summer. Water level fluctuations in the major input rivers of the PAD were found to be more variable under the climate change simulations. Moreover, spring freshet peaks were estimated to occur earlier (20-30 days) and to be considerably reduced (up to 1.0 m reductions). Although the simulations converged towards the same general results in seasonality shift, flow level amplitude was GCM-dependent. Simple downscaling methods may well be too coarse to adequately address the important spatial variations that can occur in the long-term climate signal. It is therefore important to understand the sensitivity of this regime to local climatic influences to produce more reliable, quantitative results. An ensemble of approaches that provide meaningfully downscaled results should be considered to confirm the results presented.

In the Arctic, ice caps provide an alternative to lake sediments, in that the annual snow layers reflect atmospheric deposition. As a result of the remoteness of the ice cap and the limited summer melt, annual layers undergo little chemical change, especially after the first summer season, and therefore provide a well-defined historical record. Initial work was undertaken at the Agassiz Ice Cap (80 degrees 49'50'' N, 72 degrees 56'30'' W) beginning in 1986, but a major effort was undertaken in 1993, during which snow samples covering 30 years were taken from a snow pit. Large volume snow samples were obtained for the determination of PCB congeners. Mean Sigma PCB deposition to the ice cap ranged from 930 ng/m(2)/year in the winter of 1967-1968 to a minimum of 91 ng/m(2)/year in 1980-1981. Since 1980-1981, deposition has again increased to a local maximum of 848 ng/m(2)/year (in 1989-1990). Tile mean deposition for the 30 years of record was 406 ng/m(2)/year, with no evidence of a consistent long-term trend.																			0048-9697					JAN 15	1995	160-61						117	126		10.1016/0048-9697(95)04349-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(95)04349-6													WOS:A1995QD14300012

Waterfowl use of the Great Lakes has declined dramatically from presettlement times; the obvious cause is human encroachment on coastal wetlands and destruction of river delta and embayed wetland complexes. Loss of wetland habitats from diking and filling above the average water level constitutes a permanent habitat loss, especially during high water cycles. The greatest number of species and individuals use 15 concentration areas during the spring and fall migratory periods when use by diving ducks, sea and stiff tailed ducks, and swans and geese predominates. Lesser numbers of species use the coastal wetlands for breeding. Large concentrations of dabbling ducks, primarily mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and American black ducks (A. rubripes), and mergansers (Mergus spp.) are found on ice-free areas during winter. Wetland habitats have become more favorable, due to human modifications, to dabbling duck species found in the prairie habitats of North America. Mallards have become the most numerous species breeding in coastal wetlands along with a concomitant decline in black ducks, which may be a consequence of introgression. Habitat modifications, degradation, and loss have great potential to affect existing waterfowl populations negatively and to point the way toward future research.																			0380-1330						1992	18	4					673	699		10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71329-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(92)71329-X													WOS:A1992KJ74600013
J	Rossier, O				Rossier, O			Comparison of gillnet sampling and night visual census of fish communities in the littoral zone of Lake Geneva, Switzerland	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Gillnet sampling and night visual census of fish communities in the littoral zone of Lake Geneva were compared in order to assess the efficiency of these two methods for the estimation of the composition and abundance of fish assemblages in lake littoral zones. For adult fishes, the relative efficiency of both methods varied according to the sampling period. In summer, night visual census appeared to be a more efficient method than gillnets to assess community composition. Sixteen species from a total of 17 were observed by visual census and II with gillnets. In winter, visual census and gillnets were complementary, species composition being very different in the two methods. For several species observed with both methods, both occurrence per sampling session and abundance differed greatly. The most abundant species caught with gillnets in summer appeared to be highly underestimated by visual census. The efficiency of these two methods for the census of young fishes (0+) is also discussed.																			0003-9136						1997	139	2					223	233																WOS:A1997XC27100007

Thermal effluent increased the rate of development of eggs and the growth of P. gyrina and allowed continuous reproductive activity throughout the year. These changes and the increased period of growth of aquatic macrophytes resulted in increased population densities of P. gyrina in the heated area during summer. Temperatures below 10.degree. C or small amounts of vegetation appear to limit the population of P. gyrina in winter.																			0008-4301	1480-3283					1976	54	4					582	590		10.1139/z76-068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z76-068													WOS:A1976BN70400020

Unusually short spring overturn, high algal mass in spring and certainly the overflooding of the sediment, which had not been removed, caused a tremendous oxygen deficit in early summer. The whole hypolimnion turned anoxic and even in the metalimnion oxygen declined to a minimum. Manganese and iron reached high concentrations. Despite the poor water quality, raw water was urgently needed for the water supply and was pumped from the epilimnion during the dear water phase and in July when algal biomass was low. in the middle of August holomixis was induced artificially in order to improve water quality. The decline in algal production during and after artificial mixing was probably caused by light limitation of the algae. (C) 1998 IAWQ.

Different land use and climate change scenarios were used and the streamflow, nitrate and ammonium in the future period (2020-2049) under these scenarios were simulated by Integrated Catchment Model for Nitrogen (INCA-N). Results indicated that climate change will increase streamflows and decrease nitrate and ammonium concentrations in summer and autumn. Land use changes were found to have a little impact on streamflows but a significant impact on water quality, particularly under an urban development scenario. Under combined scenarios, larger seasonal changes in streamflows and mixed changes of nitrate and ammonium concentrations were predicted.					; Asadi Vaighan, Amir/GRS-7894-2022; Asadi Vaighan, Amir/K-6846-2018	Talebbeydokhti, Nasser/0000-0002-9322-2416; Massah Bavani, Ali Reza/0000-0002-5433-1791; Asadi Vaighan, Amir/0000-0003-1642-2315													2040-2244					DEC	2019	10	4					818	834		10.2166/wcc.2018.098	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2018.098													WOS:000502089700008
J	Terry, J; Lindenschmidt, KE				Terry, Julie; Lindenschmidt, Karl-Erich			Water Quality and Flow Management Scenarios in the Qu'Appelle River-Reservoir System Using Loosely Coupled WASP and CE-QUAL-W2 Models	WATER												The water bodies of the Saskatchewan Prairies suffer multiple stressors, and demand for water is expected to increase. Water quality models can help evaluate water management strategies and risks such as climate change. This study assesses the impact of interbasin water transfers on the water quality of a strategic, eutrophic prairie reservoir that receives poor-quality watershed run-off. A one-dimensional WASP model was used to estimate nutrient transformations in the transfers along a 97 km river channel. The WASP model was then loosely coupled to a two-dimensional CE-QUAL-W2 model of the downstream receiving reservoir. Output from the WASP model was manually transformed into boundary conditions for the CE-QUAL-W2 reservoir model. This method improves on an earlier attempt to estimate nutrient transformations in the transfers using linear regression. Results from the loosely coupled models suggest Buffalo Pound Lake would respond well to the interbasin transfers. The number of threshold exceedances decreased for all modeled water quality variables. Nutrient concentrations were most influenced in the open water season following spring freshet. Any additional reduction of threshold exceedances during winter was minimal in comparison. These results are interesting from a management perspective as increased transfers under winter operations risk ice damage to the river channel.

Here we present the results of measurements of climatically-sensitive magnetic properties and soil color from four well-dated loess-paleosol sequences from the northern slopes of the Tienshan Mountains and the Yili River valley, Xinjiang, China, in the core area of ACA. Our results demonstrate that the characteristic Holocene paleosol, indicating relatively moist conditions, generally formed after similar to 6 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP) in the study region, and that the accumulation of unweathered loess prevailed during the early Holocene, indicating a dry climate at that time. The magnetic proxies further reveal a trend of generally increasing moisture since the Last Glacial Maximum, with the wettest climate occurring during the late Holocene. This trend of increasing moisture during the Holocene is representative of the Xinjiang region and possibly of the whole of the core area of ACA, and is in marked contrast both to the mid-Holocene moisture maximum observed in the East Asian summer monsoon region and to the general decrease in the strength of the Indian summer monsoon since the early Holocene. Our findings are supported by the results of a climate simulation which indicate a trend of increasing summer and winter precipitation during the Holocene in the core area of ACA, caused mainly by an increase in the strength of the westerlies effected by an increasing latitudinal insolation gradient and by a negative trend of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) or North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).

J	Costa-Cabral, M; Roy, SB; Maurer, EP; Mills, WB; Chen, LM				Costa-Cabral, Mariza; Roy, Sujoy B.; Maurer, Edwin P.; Mills, William B.; Chen, Limin			Snowpack and runoff response to climate change in Owens Valley and Mono Lake watersheds	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Precipitation from the Eastern Sierra Nevada watersheds of Owens Lake and Mono Lake is one of the main water sources for Los Angeles' over 4 million people, and plays a major role in the ecology of Mono Lake and of these watersheds. We use the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model at daily time scale, forced by climate projections from 16 global climate models under greenhouse gas emissions scenarios B1 and A2, to evaluate likely hydrologic responses in these watersheds for 1950-2099. Comparing climate in the latter half of the 20th Century to projections for 2070-2099, we find that all projections indicate continued temperature increases, by 2-5 A degrees C, but differ on precipitation changes, ranging from -24 % to +56 %. As a result, the fraction of precipitation falling as rain is projected to increase, from a historical 0.19 to a range of 0.26-0.52 (depending on the GCM and emission scenario), leading to earlier timing of the annual hydrograph's center, by a range of 9-37 days. Snowpack accumulation depends on temperature and even more strongly on precipitation due to the high elevation of these watersheds (reaching 4,000 m), and projected changes for April 1 snow water equivalent range from -67 % to +9 %. We characterize the watershed's hydrologic response using variables integrated in space over the entire simulated area and aggregated in time over 30-year periods. We show that from the complex dynamics acting at fine time scales (seasonal and sub-seasonal) simple dynamics emerge at this multi-year time scale. Of particular interest are the dynamic effects of temperature. Warming anticipates hydrograph timing, by raising the fraction of precipitation falling as rain, reducing the volume of snowmelt, and initiating snowmelt earlier. This timing shift results in the depletion of soil moisture in summer, when potential evapotranspiration is highest. Summer evapotranspiration losses are limited by soil moisture availability, and as a result the watershed's water balance at the annual and longer scales is insensitive to warming. Mean annual runoff changes at base-of-mountain stations are thus strongly determined by precipitation changes.

Numerical Simulation of Ice Cover of Saline Lakes	IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS												A new version of the one-dimensional thermo-hydrodynamic and biogeochemical model LAKE2.1 is presented. The model is supplemented with a description of the dynamics and vertical distribution of salinity in an ice cover. Simulation results are compared to in situ and satellite data of water temperature and ice cover at Uvs Nuur Lake (Mongolia) from 2000 to 2015. It is shown that underestimating the mixed-layer depth by the model with standard turbulence closure k-epsilon during summer and autumn leads to a significant shift in the timing of the onset of ice. It is also demonstrated that, while neglecting the salinity of the lake, the freeze-up according to the model happens 16-17 days earlier than in reality. This error is removed if the effect of salinity on water density and freezing temperature is included. However, in this case, the model underestimates the maximal seasonal ice thickness on average by approximate to 0.2 m. In turn, this error decreases an order of magnitude if the dynamics and vertical distribution of salinity in ice are simulated in the model.

These conditions can cause drought in northern Europe and extreme rainfall in the Mediterranean region. Uncertainties in the spatiotemporal patterns of these predictions can be partially addressed with records of past climate response to rapid change. The early Holocene collapse of the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets provides a natural experiment to evaluate the climate response to rapid changes in boundary conditions. We analyzed lipid biomarker distributions and hydrogen isotope (delta H-2) values from Lake Imandra, Kola Peninsula, to infer Holocene summer temperature and summer precipitation delta H-2 values. Sensitivity tests of a lake model suggest summer precipitation delta H-2 values are the main mechanism influencing Lake Imandra delta H-2 values. Summer precipitation isotope values exhibited a nearly 20 parts per thousand H-2-depletion between 8.6 and 8.0 ka, with H-2 -enriched values before 8.6 ka and H-2 -depleted values 8.0 ka to present. Maximum warmth occurred from 8.5 to 7.0 ka. Climate model experiments suggest that the early Holocene Laurentide Ice Sheet collapse caused a westward shift of the Fennoscandian summer high-pressure center. This caused a decrease in the proportion of local, H-2-enriched precipitation falling throughout Fennoscandia and an increase in far-traveled, H-2-depleted precipitation from the mid-latitudes, circulation that persisted throughout the Holocene. These results illustrate the sensitivity of climate in Fennoscandia and show that circulation regime shifts can occur in response to changes in boundary conditions far upwind.

J	Suursaar, Ü; Meitern, H				Suursaar, Ulo; Meitern, Helve			Contribution of winter upwelling in the Gulf of Finland to lake-effect snow in Estonia	BALTICA												The aim of the study was to analyse the sequence of winter ("warm") upwelling and lake-effect snow (LES) events that deposited up to 50 cm of snow along the North Estonian coast in January-February 2021. Based on weather and aerological data, four episodes of LES were documented. Heavy, localized lake-effect enhanced precipitation occurred along a 30-50 km wide coastal strip bordering the Gulf of Finland when a cold air mass from the north advected over the wanner, unfrozen sea surface. A temperature difference of up to 20 degrees C was revealed between the air mass temperatures measured at the 850 hPa level and at the sea surface. The LES events, in turn, were preceded by upwelling in the southern Gulf of Finland, which was generated by persisting easterly winds. Even when occasionally interrupted by a wind change, the upwelled water still kept sea surface temperature (SST) in the southern half of the Gulf higher, as documented by the water temperature records from the coastal stations of Estonia, SST and salinity imagery retrieved from the SatBaltyk system, and sea ice distribution charts. Differently from summer (cold) upwelling, winter upwelling brought up warmer (2-4 degrees C) water from the sub-surface layers replacing the already cooled down (0-1 degrees C) surface water. Thus, winter upwelling enhanced LES in two ways. Firstly, by not letting the Gulf freeze over, and therefore by providing a fetch. And secondly, by increasing the SST (and therefore also the 850 hPa level - surface temperature difference) by up to 4 degrees C.

In temperate zones, shallow lakes show significant differences in thermal stratification compared to deep lakes. Here, the variation in thermal stratification in Lake Taihu, a shallow fresh water lake, is studied systematically. Lake Taihu is a warm polymictic lake whose thermal stratification varies in short cycles of one day to a few days. The thermal stratification in Lake Taihu has shallow depths in the upper region and a large amplitude in the temperature gradient, the maximum of which exceeds 5 degrees C m(-1). The water temperature in the entire layer changes in a relatively consistent manner. Therefore, compared to a deep lake at similar latitude, the thermal stratification in Lake Taihu exhibits small seasonal differences, but the wide variation in the short term becomes important. Shallow polymictic lakes share the characteristic of diurnal mixing. Prominent differences on the duration and frequency of long-lasting thermal stratification are found in these lakes, which may result from the differences of local climate, lake depth, and fetch. A prominent response of thermal stratification to weather conditions is found, being controlled by the stratifying effect of solar radiation and the mixing effect of wind disturbance. Other than the diurnal stratification and convection, the representative responses of thermal stratification to these two factors with contrary effects are also discussed. When solar radiation increases, stronger wind is required to prevent the lake from becoming stratified. A daily average wind speed greater than 6 m s(-1) can maintain the mixed state in Lake Taihu. Moreover, wind-induced convection is detected during thermal stratification. Due to lack of solar radiation, convection occurs more easily in nighttime than in daytime. Convection occurs frequently in fall and winter, whereas long-lasting and stable stratification causes less convection in summer.

Quantification of virus genes provides evidence for seed-bank populations of phycodnaviruses in Lake Ontario, Canada	ISME JOURNAL												Using quantitative PCR, the abundances of six phytoplankton viruses DNA polymerase (polB) gene fragments were estimated in water samples collected from Lake Ontario, Canada over 26 months. Four of the polB fragments were most related to marine prasinoviruses, while the other two were most closely related to cultivated chloroviruses. Two Prasinovirus-related genes reached peak abundances of >1000 copies ml(-1) and were considered 'high abundance', whereas the other two Prasinovirus-related genes peaked at abundances <1000 copies ml(-1) and were considered 'low abundance'. Of the genes related to chloroviruses, one peaked at ca 1600 copies ml(-1), whereas the other reached only ca 300 copies ml(-1). Despite these differences in peak abundance, the abundances of all genes monitored were lowest during the late fall, winter and early spring; during these months the high abundance genes persisted at 100-1000 copies ml(-1) while the low abundance Prasinovirus- and Chlorovirus-related genes persisted at fewer than ca 100 copies ml(-1). Clone libraries of psbA genes from Lake Ontario revealed numerous Chlorella-like algae and two prasinophytes demonstrating the presence of candidate hosts for all types of viruses monitored. Our results corroborate recent metagenomic analyses that suggest that aquatic virus communities are composed of only a few abundant populations and many low abundance populations. Thus, we speculate that an ecologically important characteristic of phycodnavirus communities is seed-bank populations with members that can become numerically dominant when their host abundances reach appropriate levels.

These result from asymmetric intraspecific competition between age groups in which high numbers of the young-of-the-year suppress the reproduction of adult vendace. In Lake Pyhajarvi, changes in numerical fecundity are not sufficient to produce the oscillations, but variation in egg quality may be involved. We studied the variation in the dry mass of vendace eggs in 1987-1992, and wet mass data were available for 1978 and 1983. The mean dry mass of a single egg before spawning was a good predictor of the ensuing year-class size. Egg dry mass was inversely related to size-specific numerical fecundity and to autumn temperature. The direct effect of competitors (young-of-the-year) on the dry mass of eggs was not significant in this time series. Second summer growth and autumn condition of the spawning females were positively related to zooplankton biomass, which had a negative correlation with the abundance of the young-of-the-year. Simple correlations between egg dry mass and the resource levels or the growth or condition indices were not significant. However, multiple regression using egg numbers and August zooplankton biomass as the independent variables was significant and explained a high proportion of total variation in egg dry mass.

The values of the system parameters are determined on the basis of the observed data at Lake Biwa [Japan]in 1976. By regarding the influent N and P concentrations as the control variables of the system, an optimization problem is proposed for preventing eutrophication in bodies of water. Some numerical results of the optimization problem are obtained, which tells us that the influent N and P concentrations should be small in summer and may be large in winter.																			0020-7721	1464-5319					1981	12	5					565	585		10.1080/00207728108963766	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207728108963766													WOS:A1981LU59000003

Two preliminary experiments also were performed to evaluate the effect of sample volume, incubation time, and light regime on the results. Experimental results indicate a 'bottle effect' for the 3 smallest sample volumes employed (100, 200, 500 ml); lower grazing rates were always observed during 24 h incubations than during 48 h incubations. The light regime (continuous darkness, continuous light, 12L:12D) did not affect grazing rates during a 48 h experimental period. Bacterivory in the seasonal study in Vineyard Sound, Massachusetts (USA) was highly responsive to water temperature and was the primary factor determining grazing pressure over the winter-summer period. Samples incubated at 20-degrees-C during winter consistently exhibited higher rates of consumption of bacteria than a triplicate set of samples incubated at ambient water temperature or 5-degrees-C. Daily fluctuations in the rates of bacterivory during a 10 d period in May were significant, but were ca 1/10 the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuation. Maximal rates of bacterivory removed up to 60 % of the bacterial assemblage daily.

To better understand the dispersal and accumulation of bacteria, we determined contents and isotopic compositions of suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) and bacteria in a highly contaminated urban river (the Nanming) and effluents in winter and summer of 2013. Relative to SPOM, bacterial biomass in the river was depleted in C-13 and N-15 and its C/N ratio was lower (delta C-13: - 33.2aEuro degrees +/- 3.1aEuro degrees; delta N-15: - 1.5aEuro degrees +/- 1.2aEuro degrees; C/N: 4.8 +/- 0.6), while effluents showed higher C-13 and N-15 contents and C/N ratios (delta C-13: - 25aEuro degrees +/- 2.1aEuro degrees; delta N-15: + 8.5aEuro degrees +/- 1.1aEuro degrees; C/N: 8.1 +/- 1.2). Source recognition of SPOM was based on carbon isotopes because they are conservative and distinct between end-members (effluent detritus and bacterial biomass). Using a mixing model, bacterial biomass in the river was calculated to account for < 20% and < 56% of bulk suspended particulate organic nitrogen in winter and summer, respectively. An N budget showed that bacterial N was a small proportion of total nitrogen (< 7.4%) in the riverwater.

The pollen record from El'gygytgyn Lake: implications for vegetation and climate histories of northern Chukotka since the late middle Pleistocene	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Three types of pollen assemblages (shrub-dominated, mixed herb- and shrub-dominated, and herb-dominated) characterize the similar to 300,000 year palynological record from El'gygytgyn Lake. Despite major changes in global climatic forcings, all pollen spectra, with a few isolated exceptions, have strong to possible analogs in the modern plant communities of Northeast Siberia and Alaska. Paleoclimatic reconstructions based on squared chord-distance analog analyses indicate two periods (-8600-10,700 C-14 year B.P. and OIS 5e) when summers were perhaps similar to 2 to 4 degrees C warmer than modern. January temperatures were also warmer than present, and both July and January were wetter than today. Palynological data remain inconclusive as to the establishment of forests near El'gygytgyn Lake at these times. The wettest Julys occurred during OIS 5 d. July temperatures were near modern, and Januarys were colder and drier than now. January temperatures, even into the Middle Pleistocene, generally show little variability, suggesting that the suppression of arboreal taxa during glaciations was likely caused by cool summers with low effective moisture and not by frigid winters. Because age schemes that correlate magnetic susceptibility to variations in summer insolation or theta O-18 have cool plant taxa persisting in warm times (and vice versa), we propose an alternative age model based on the palynological data.

J	JOHANNSSON, OE				JOHANNSSON, OE			RESPONSE OF MYSIS-RELICTA POPULATION-DYNAMICS AND PRODUCTIVITY TO SPATIAL AND SEASONAL GRADIENTS IN LAKE-ONTARIO	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Spatial and temporal patterns of production, density, reproductive status, and size composition of Mysis relicta in Lake Ontario were analyzed in relation to predation and physical conditions. Two whole-lake (May, November) surveys and one partial (August) survey were-conducted in 1990. Spatial patterns were related to lake depth. Abundance increased with depth of sampling stations, particularly between 20 and 100 m. At station depths >100 m, the percentage of females carrying eggs and mean female size were constant, but the number of eggs per female increased with station depth. During the winter, the density-depth relationship weakened, apparently through the action of storms and currents, but strengthened again during the summer. Mysids >9 mm in length tended to move to deeper water during the summer. The distributions of predatory fish (alewife, smelt, and sculpin) suggest that depth-related patterns in the mysid population may be due to differences in predation rates with depth and season as well as to horizontal movement. Whole-lake production was estimated to be between 412.91 and 506.82 X 10(8) g dry weight: most production occurred between 100 and 200 m depth. Growth rate was similar in all regions of the lake.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUL	1995	52	7					1509	1522		10.1139/f95-145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-145													WOS:A1995TD86500016

Climate change projections of temperature and precipitation for the great lakes basin using the PRECIS regional climate model	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The Great Lakes Basin plays an important role in the economy and society of the United States and Canada, and climate change in this region may affect many sectors. In this study, six GCM simulations were downscaled to resolve the Great Lakes using a regional climate model (RCM) with 25 km x 25 km resolution. This model was used to project changes in temperature and precipitation during the mid-century (2040-2069) and late-century (2070-2099) over the Great Lakes basin region with reference to a baseline of 1980-2009. The whole-basin annual mean temperature is projected to increase 2.1 degrees C to 4.0 degrees C above the baseline during the mid-century, and 3.3 degrees C to 6.0 degrees C during the late-century. Summer temperatures in the southern portion of the basin are projected to increase more than the temperatures in the northern portion of the basin; whereas winter temperatures are projected to increase more in the north than in the south. Estimates of the whole-basin annual precipitation with respect to the baseline vary from -3.0% to 16.5% during the mid-century and -2.9% to 21.6% during the late-century, respectively. Future summer precipitation in southwestern areas of this region is expected to decrease by 20%-30% compared to the baseline, but winter precipitation (mostly snow) is expected to increase by 11.6% and 15.4% during the mid-century and late-century. This study highlights the effects of the large expanses of water (such as the Great Lakes) on regional climate projections and the associated uncertainties of climate change.

J	Halvorsen, G; Dervo, BK; Papinska, K				Halvorsen, G; Dervo, BK; Papinska, K			Zooplankton in Lake Atnsjoen 1985-1997	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The aim of this paper is to study long-term changes in the zooplankton of a subalpine locality unaffected by direct anthropogenic disturbances. The material has been collected during the period 1985-1997; since 1988 a standardised sampling program has been followed, with five sampling dates during the ice free period (June-October) at three fixed stations. Altogether 17 species of Rotatoria, 9 species of Copepoda and 11 species of Cladocera were recorded. Of these 10 species of Rotatoria, two species of Copepoda and five species of Cladocera occur regularly in the plankton. Polyarthra vulgaris dominate among the rotifers together with Kellicottia longispina and Conochilus unicornis. The crustacean community is dominated by the copepod Cyclops scutifer, and the cladocerans Bosmina longispina, Holopedium gibberum and Daphnia longispina. The cladocerans Bythotrephes longimanus, Polyphemus pediculus, and the copepods Arctodiaptomus laticeps and Heterocope saliens all occur regularly, but at low densities. The zooplankton density is low in May/June and peaks in August and September, but the timing of maximum densities varies from year to year. By numbers, the rotifers strongly dominate with densities 10-15 times higher than the crustaceans. The annual maximum density (rotifers plus crustaceans) ranged from 50 ind. l(-1) (1985, 1988) to 450 ind. l(-1) (1995). Mean density is about 140-150 ind. l(-1). By biomass (dry weight), the cladocerans constitute 60%, while the copepods and rotifers constitute 30% and 10% of the zooplankton, respectively. The annual maximum has varied between 70 and 260 mug dw l(-1), with 170 mug dw l(-1) as the mean level. C. scutifer usually has a one-year lifecycle without diapause, but a small fraction of the population has a two-year lifecycle. The life cycle in 1989 and 1990 differed strongly from the other years. The life cycles of B. longispina, D. longispina and possibly also H. gibberum and A. laticeps, indicate two generations during the summer. H. gibberum and H. saliens pass the winter as resting eggs. The other crustacean species, except C. scutifer, pass the winter mainly as resting eggs, but all have a small winter population in the water mass. C. scutifer is the only species without resting eggs. The vertical distribution normally shows highest density between 5 and 10 m depth. However, during some periods maximum density is observed close to the surface, while at other times it is seen deep in the hypolimnion. The vertical distribution is most pronounced when the thermocline is sharp, and less pronounced during the full circulation in autumn. The vertical migration may also be pronounced, especially in B. longispina, with high density near the surface during the night. The vertical migration is less pronounced among the rotifers and copepods. The degree of vertical migration varies with temperature and food conditions. There is little variation from year to year in species composition, but large variation in species dominance, seasonal development, population density, and vertical and horizontal distribution during the sampling period. Variations in temperature, food condition, predation, and water through-flow are possible causes for the observed differences between the years. Input of allochthonous material is especially important. However, no clear correlation have been found between the development of the plankton community and these environmental factors. Hence, these interactions are complex and multifactorial.																			0018-8158					JUN	2004	521	1-3					149	175		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000026357.80231.d2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000026357.80231.d2													WOS:000221177900013

The importance of these subsidies may increase as alder cover expands under climate warming at high latitudes. We assessed how landscape features and meteorological conditions affect aquatic N and phosphorus (P) availability and stoichiometry in 26 streams across natural gradients of alder cover in southwestern Alaska over the spring and summer, covering 4 years. Analyses of resin lysimeter samples from select watersheds showed that annually, soils under alder leached almost three times more N, and two times more P than under non-alder vegetation. Stream NO3- concentrations displayed a non-linear relationship with alder cover; NO3- was low where alder cover was < 30%, but increased markedly where alder cover was > 30%. Watershed elevation was inversely related to alder cover, stream NO3- concentrations, and stream NO3- yields. Dissolved and particulate stream P were unrelated to alder cover, watershed elevation or discharge, highlighting decoupling of controls on P between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Snowmelt-associated nutrient pulses and hydrology likely resulted in greater stream N and P in the spring, compared to the summer. However, weather parameters only impacted stream N via their interaction with alder. Stream DIN:TP increased with alder cover and decreased with elevation, suggesting that alder intensified P-limitation. Hence, aquatic P-limitation may become increasingly pronounced as climate-induced alder expansion continues. These results demonstrate that the elevational gradient in watershed alder cover determined spatial patterns in stream N availability and nutrient limitation.

Microbial community diversity and heterotrophic production in a coastal Arctic ecosystem: A stamukhi lake and its source waters	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Stamukhi lakes are vast but little-explored Arctic ecosystems. They occur throughout winter, spring, and early summer near large river inflows along the Arctic coastline, and are the result of freshwater retention behind the thick barrier of rubble ice (stamukhi) that forms at the outer limit of land-fast sea ice. We examined the molecular biodiversity within all three microbial domains (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota) and the heterotrophic productivity in Lake Mackenzie, a stamukhi lake in the western Canadian Arctic, and made comparative measurements in the freshwater (Mackenzie River) and marine (Beaufort Sea) source waters. Bacterial and eukaryotic communities in the stamukhi lake differed in composition and diversity from both marine and riverine environments, whereas the archaeal communities were similar in the lake and river. Bacteria 16S ribosomal RNA sequences from the lake were mostly within freshwater clusters of Betaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes and the Archaea were within the Lake Dagow sediment and Rice cluster-V clusters of Euryarchaeota. The eukaryotes were mainly ciliates from the subclass Choreotrichia, and there was a notable lack of flagellates. Heterotrophic production rates in the lake were lower than in the river and more similar to those in the sea, despite much higher bacterial concentrations than in either. The lake samples had markedly higher ratios of (3)H leucine to (3)H thymidine incorporation than in the river and sea, implying some physiological stress. Lake Mackenzie is an active microbial ecosystem with distinct physical and microbiological properties. This circumpolar ecosystem type, vulnerable to the ongoing effects of climate change, likely plays a key functional role in processing riverine inputs to the Arctic Ocean.					; Lovejoy, Connie/A-3756-2008; Galand, Pierre/A-1429-2014; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Galand, Pierre E./0000-0002-2238-3247; Lovejoy, Connie/0000-0001-8027-2281; 													0024-3590					MAR	2008	53	2					813	823		10.4319/lo.2008.53.2.0813	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2008.53.2.0813													WOS:000256498700036
J	Metzke, BA; Pederson, CL				Metzke, B. A.; Pederson, C. L.			Cladoceran Community Dynamics Reflect Temperature Gradients in a Cooling Water Reservoir	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Cladoceran community dynamics in limnetic systems often are correlated with temperature patterns. We sought to relate cladoceran temporal patterns and community composition to spatial and temporal temperature patterns in a cooling water reservoir (Newton Lake, jasper County, Illinois). Effluent released into Newton Lake creates a temperature gradient where portions of the reservoir experience summer maxima in excess of 35 C, while other portions resemble a typical temperate system. We measured temperature and collected zooplankton at four locations arranged at increasing distances from the power plant cooling water outfalls. Cladoceran community density was higher near the warm effluent during winter, although no statistically significant differences amongst sites were observed during summer. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity values and nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling suggest cladoceran communities in the reservoir respond to this altered temperature with respect to abundance and seasonality of species. Daphnia lumholtzi, an exotic cladoceran, also is present in Newton Lake and sometimes is the dominant cladoceran taxon. High abundance of D. lumholtzi seems to be unrelated to warm effluents as it occurs at all sampling locations. Although morphological features of D. lumholtzi are thought to deter depredation, temporal and spatial distance likely occurs between this species and gape-limited vertebrate planktivores, thereby reducing potential negative impacts of this species in Newton Lake.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				APR	2012	167	2					344	355		10.1674/0003-0031-167.2.344	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031-167.2.344													WOS:000302755600010

Collection of samples from natural sources was complemented by experiments in situ and in laboratory conditions, with the aim of characterizing the role of temperature, light and nutrients in the Vajgar locality. The genera Cyclotella and Stephanodiscus exhibited maxima at water temperatures from 10 to 15-degrees-C. Aulacoseira granulata was found to be a summer species (15-20-degrees-C). Cyclotella atomus and Cyclotella stelligera var. pseudostelligera showed the highest tolerance to light and temperature. The growth of diatoms was not limited by silicon but it was limited by phosphorus and nitrogen, especially in autumn. The growth was also suppressed if a higher pH (in excess of 8,3) was combined with low temperature (limitation by free CO2).																			0003-9136					MAR	1993				96			85	106																WOS:A1993LA58500007
J	WHITE, RG; TRUDELL, J				WHITE, RG; TRUDELL, J			HABITAT PREFERENCE AND FORAGE CONSUMPTION BY REINDEER AND CARIBOU NEAR ATKASOOK, ALASKA	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Habitat preference by caribou (R. tarandus grantii Allen.) and forage selection and consumption by tame reindeer (R. tarandus tarandus L.) were studied near Atkasook, Alaska, for 3 yr. Small groups of caribou were present in both winter and summer. Winter habitat use was associated with elevated areas with high lichen biomass, while summer habitat use was associated with landform units high in deciduous shrubs or lichens, e.g., upland tussock tundra, ridges and lake margins. These observations, and measurements of forage availability and digestibility, indicated that caribou preferred habitats that provided high availability of digestible forage. Intensive grazing studies with reindeer on several vegetation types indicated a high preference for forbs, deciduous shrubs (Salix spp.) and lichens. In high-center polygons, preference was shown for microhabitat units with high plant species diversity, i.e., wet, shallow troughs. Reindeer tethered on lake margin vegetation showed high preference for the willow strings. Selection of food by reindeer appeared to be related to plant availability, nutrient content, digestibility and secondary compounds. Forage consumed by reindeer was 10% higher in digestibility than was the available herbage. In 3 days of grazing on a 314 m2 study site a single reindeer consumed less than 10% of the aboveground standing crop, but standing declined over 30% due to excess clipping and trampling. Estimated daily dry matter intake was high when reindeer were feeding on landform units high in deciduous shrubs. When reindeer grazed exclusively on Salix pulchra a 30% increase in rumen turnover time was noted, which suggests a decline in food intake. Food intake also declined markedly over a 3 day grazing period as forage availability declined. The projected seasonal trends in dry matter, digestible dry matter, N, P and Ca intake of reindeer at Atkasook were compared with those projected for wet, coastal tundra at Prudhoe Bay. The inland tundra generally allows greater production of reindeer.																			0004-0851						1980	12	4					511	529		10.2307/1550498	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1550498													WOS:A1980KZ49300010

Vulnerability of northern water supply lakes to changing climate and demand	ARCTIC SCIENCE												Arctic regions face a unique vulnerability to shifts in seasonality, which influences the summer recharge potential of freshwater reservoirs caused by decreased precipitation and increased evaporative stress. This pressure puts small remote northern communities at risk due to limited existing freshwater supply. The lack of baseline knowledge of existing supply, demand, or reservoir recharge potential increases this risk. We therefore address this knowledge gap through a water resource assessment of municipal supply over a 20 year planning horizon in two communities in Arctic Canada using a novel heuristic model and existing data sources. We generated climate and demand scenarios to identify the mechanisms of drawdown as well as examine the influences on replenishment. We found a pronounced vulnerability to reduced winter precipitation and (or) increased ice thickness of reservoirs. Our heuristic supply forecasts indicate an immediate need for freshwater management strategies for northern communities in Canada.					; Medeiros, Andrew/I-1947-2019	Medeiros, Andrew/0000-0002-7743-2560; 														2368-7460				MAR	2017	3	1					1	16		10.1139/as-2016-0029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/as-2016-0029													WOS:000416398600001

Settling seston and vertical sediment core samples from highly eutrophic Lake Okaro, New Zealand, were collected during a mixed winter and stratified summer period, representing, respectively, when the water column was well oxygenated and when the bottom waters were anoxic. Samples were analysed with P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (P-31 NMR) spectroscopy, which showed that both bottom sediments and settling seston contained orthophosphate, orthophosphate monoesters and diesters, pyrophosphates, polyphosphates and phosphonates. Phosphorus concentration in settling seston increased similar to 2.5-fold in winter as a result of seasonally induced changes in phytoplankton biomass, with a marked increase in the concentration of orthophosphate. Several potentially bioavailable P compounds in the bottom sediments were identified that were likely to contribute to recycling of P from the sediment to the water column. An apparent half-life' was used to quantify the time scales on which these compounds were recycled to the overlying water column. Orthophosphate monoesters that include inositol phosphates were the most persistent P compound.

Lake Iznik is an oligohaline lake located in the southeast of the Marmara Sea. To decipher the long-term signals recorded in the sediment column requires better understanding of the processes in the modern lake environs. Seasonal limnological investigations were paired with geochemical and sedimentological analyses. Lake Iznik is an alkaline, warm monomictic lake. During warm seasons, a thermocline is established between 15 m and 20 m water depth. Anaerobic bottom water is mixed during spring. Surface water currents became visible during a whiting event in the summer, corresponding with spatial accumulation patterns found in geochemical proxies of the surface sediment.

LGM annual temperature was cooler by 3 degrees C with maximum cooling (as much as 6 degrees C) during the winter (Nov - Mar) while the LGM summer (May - Sep) is 1.5 degrees C cooler. Wet season precipitation (Nov-Mar) was two times higher for the LGM, while dry season (May-Sep) precipitation is estimated to be 175% higher. Runoff during the LGM was eight times higher during the warm season (May-Oct) but was almost absent during the cold season (Nov-April), which is expected if runoff is trapped as snowpack.																									1998							738	746																WOS:000078339600075

Populations of the stygobiotic amphipod Palearcticarellus pusillus (Martynov, 1930) maintain genetic connectivity between the mountain springs and the deep bottom habitats of Lake Teletskoye (Altai Mountains, Russia)	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPELEOLOGY												The diversity of underground fauna is often associated with the presence of karst areas, which have extensive underground cavities and connecting channels. Non-karst areas, however, make up a larger portion of the planet' surface, and our understanding of the distribution and dispersal abilities of underground fauna in these areas currently remains limited. During a recent study of the diversity of stygobiotic crustaceans in the mountain streams of the Kurai Mountain Range (Altai, Russia), a small-sized species of crangonyctid in high-altitude springs. This species has been previously known only from deep-water habitats in Lake Teletskoye, and molecular genetic analysis revealed that these amphipods maintain genetic connections between the springs and bottom lake habitats. We assume that individuals of this certainly stygobiotic species fall to the bottom of the lake as a result of leaching from tectonic faults connecting these habitats and are not permanent inhabitants of the lake bottom. This hypothesis also suggests that the very small body size of these animals may be related to the narrow crevices and pores of the tectonic faults, rather than neoteny, as it has been previously suggested. The estimated divergence time calculation has also revealed that P. pusillus obviously diverged from its sister species, Palearcticarellus mikhaili from valley springs in Kurai Steppe, similar to 5 Ma, at the beginning of the Pliocene, possibly due to the uplifting of the Kurai Mountain Range. Subsequent speciation occurred as a result of secondary tectonic activity and changes in groundwater flow, likely during the Pleistocene, approximately 2.7-0.7 Ma. Populations that were isolated for a long time continue to live near mountain springs in the study area.

Evidence for lasting alterations to aquatic food webs with short-duration reservoir draining	PLOS ONE												Large dams and their respective reservoirs provide renewable energy and water security, but also can profoundly alter riverine ecosystems. Here, we present evidence of changing aquatic food web structure in the seasons following short-duration, extreme manipulation of water levels in a reservoir (i.e., draining of the reservoir to the original riverbed during fall to assist outmigration of juvenile Chinook Salmon). We find unintended and lagged consequences of transitioning from a lake to a river, even temporarily, that resulted in trophic shifts away from piscivory and towards feeding at lower trophic levels for two common piscivorous fishes in reservoirs. Using natural abundances of nitrogen stable isotopes, we observed lower trophic level of feeding for invasive Largemouth Bass (Micropterus salmoides) and native Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during the summers following reservoir refilling than in nearby reference reservoirs that were not temporarily drained during fall. Declines in trophic levels of aquatic top predators have been rarely documented outside of controlled laboratory conditions. While useful for assisting outmigration of juvenile salmonids, the temporary draining of a reservoir to riverbed can also result in novel shifts in food-web dynamics including reduced piscivory. As large dams continue to be operated and constructed worldwide, increased understanding of the community and ecosystem-level effects of reservoir management will be critical to evaluating trade-offs between human water needs, conservation of high value species, and ecosystem services impacted by river fragmentation.

A Multiplex Analysis of Potentially Toxic Cyanobacteria in Lake Winnipeg during the 2013 Bloom Season	TOXINS												Lake Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada), the world's 12th largest lake by area, is host to yearly cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) dominated by Aphanizomenon and Dolichospermum. cHABs in Lake Winnipeg are primarily a result of eutrophication but may be exacerbated by the recent introduction of dreissenid mussels. Through multiple methods to monitor the potential for toxin production in Lake Winnipeg in conjunction with environmental measures, this study defined the baseline composition of a Lake Winnipeg cHAB to measure potential changes because of dreissenid colonization. Surface water samples were collected in 2013 from 23 sites during summer and from 18 sites in fall. Genetic data and mass spectrometry cyanotoxin profiles identified microcystins (MC) as the most abundant cyanotoxin across all stations, with MC concentrations highest in the north basin. In the fall, mcyA genes were sequenced to determine which species had the potential to produce MCs, and 12 of the 18 sites were a mix of both Planktothrix and Microcystis. Current blooms in Lake Winnipeg produce low levels of MCs, but the capacity to produce cyanotoxins is widespread across both basins. If dreissenid mussels continue to colonize Lake Winnipeg, a shift in physicochemical properties of the lake because of faster water column clearance rates may yield more toxic blooms potentially dominated by microcystin producers.

Enhancement of Cloudless Skies Frequency over a Large Tropical Reservoir in Brazil	REMOTE SENSING												Several studies show the effects of lake breezes on cloudiness over natural lakes and large rivers, but only few contain information regarding large flooded areas of hydroelectric dams. Most Brazilian hydropower plants have large water reservoirs that may induce significant changes in the local environment. In this work, we describe the prevailing breeze mechanism in a Brazilian tropical hydropower reservoir to assess its impacts on local cloudiness and incoming surface solar irradiation. GOES-16 visible imagery, ISCCP database products, and ground measurement sites operated by INMET and LABREN/INPE provided data for the statistical analysis. We evaluate the cloudiness frequency assuming two distinct perspectives: spatial distribution by comparing cloudiness over the water surface and areas nearby its shores, and time analysis by comparing cloudiness prior and after reservoir completion. We also evaluated the solar irradiance enhancement over the water surface compared to the border and land areas surrounding the hydropower reservoir. The results pointed out daily average cloudiness increases moving away from the reservoir in any of the four cardinal directions. When looking at the afternoon-only cloudiness (14 h to 16 h local time), 4% fewer clouds were observed over the flooded area during summer (DJF). This difference reaches 8% during autumn (MAM) and spring (SON). Consequently, the irradiance enhancement at the water surface compared to external areas was around 1.75% for daily average and 4.59% for the afternoon-only average. Our results suggest that floating solar PV power plants in hydropower reservoirs can be an excellent option to integrate both renewable energy resources into a hybrid power generation due to the high solar irradiance in Brazilian territory combined with the prevailing breeze mechanism in large tropical water reservoirs.

Differences in the frequency and fecundity of PGI-marked genotypes in a natural population of Daphnia magna Straus (Crustacea: Cladocera)	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												Previous laboratory studies on the cyclic parthenogen, Daphnia magna Straus, demonstrated marked differences in the survivorship and fecundity of clones in response to temperature. Here, I examine the extent to which similar ecological differentiation exists within a natural population by using isozymes as genetic markers to distinguish clonal groups. The frequency and fecundity (parthenogenetic and sexual) of Daphnia magna genotypes that were electrophoretically marked at the phosphoglucose isomerase locus (PGI, E. C. 5.3.1.9) were recorded for 2 years (July 1981-July 1983) at six sites within a lake. Fecundity was estimated by determining the absolute fecundity (mean number of parthenogenetic eggs per adult female) and reproductive ratios (the proportion of adult females with eggs) of each PGI genotype. There were extensive fluctuations in genotype frequency during each year, but changes were remarkably uniform throughout the lake, suggesting selective responses to seasonal variables. Two of the PGI genotypes (Pgi(110/110) and Pgi(100/100)) exhibited seasonal succession over 2 years, predominating respectively in summer and winter, and changes in frequency were significantly correlated with genotypic differences in parthenogenetic egg production. At certain times of the year, up to 10-fold differences in the relative fecundity of genotypes were recorded, suggesting marked ecological differentiation between PGI genotypes. The persistence of PGI fitness differences was checked by re-sampling the population in January and July 1987. Genotype frequencies and fecundities were in keeping with predictions based on original samples: high fitnesses of Pgi(110/110) and Pgi(100/100) genotypes in summer and winter respectively. Findings demonstrate rapid responses to selection pressures, which in the present population were adaptively significant.																			0269-8463	1365-2435					1988	2	4					453	462		10.2307/2389388	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2389388													WOS:000208584600003

J	Jasechko, S; Wassenaar, LI; Mayer, B				Jasechko, Scott; Wassenaar, Leonard I.; Mayer, Bernhard			Isotopic evidence for widespread cold-season-biased groundwater recharge and young streamflow across central Canada	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Transformations of precipitation into groundwater and streamflow are fundamental hydrological processes, critical to irrigated agriculture, hydroelectric power generation, and ecosystem health. Our understanding of the timing of groundwater recharge and streamflow generation remains incomplete, limiting our ability to predict fresh water, nutrient, and contaminant fluxes, especially in large basins. Here, we analyze thousands of rain, snow, groundwater, and streamflow O-18 and H-2 values in the Nelson River basin, which covers 1.2millionkm(2) of central Canada. We show that the fraction of precipitation that recharges aquifers is similar to 1.3-5 times higher for precipitation falling during cold months with subzero mean monthly temperatures than for precipitation falling during warmer months. The near-ubiquity of cold-season-biased groundwater recharge implies that changes to winter water balances may have disproportionate impacts on annual groundwater recharge rates. We also show that young streamflowdefined as precipitation that enters a river in less than similar to 2.3monthscomprises similar to 27% of annual streamflow but varies widely among tributaries in the Nelson River basin (1-59%). Young streamflow fractions are lower in steep catchments and higher in flatter catchments such as the transboundary Red River basin. Our findings imply that flat, lower permeability, heavily tiled landscapes favor more rapid transmission of precipitation into rivers, possibly mobilizing excess soluble fertilizers and exacerbating eutrophication events in Lake Winnipeg.					; Wassenaar, Leonard/B-5996-2013; Mayer, Bernhard/G-6444-2012; Jasechko, Scott/I-5034-2012	Wassenaar, Leonard/0000-0001-5532-0771; Jasechko, Scott/0000-0001-6470-7708; 													0885-6087	1099-1085				JUN 15	2017	31	12					2196	2209		10.1002/hyp.11175	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.11175													WOS:000402884400005

Male bees defended territories along the periphery of a porch roof of an abandoned hotel. The focal point of a male was a nest entrance. Three types of aggressive behavior were elicited by intrusions into a territory: chase and return; circle, chase and return; and a circling followed by a towering flight to a height of over 100 ft. The last removed the defender from the territory for a long enough period of time to allow another male to occupy the territory. Hovering activity started as early as 9:00 A.M. and lasted till 5:00 P.M. Cloudiness decreased hovering activity sharply. Mating activity occurred in front of the nests and at a nearby population of Asclepias speciosa Torr. This plant served as a nectar source for both male and female X. c. californica. Territorial and possible mating behavior of X. tabaniformis orpifex Smith is briefly discussed.																			0031-0603	2162-0237					1966	42	2					111	+																WOS:A19667931300008

The early spring phytoplankton bloom was largely dominated by the: plastidic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium uberrimum. Because they were not efficiently removed by filtration through the 10 mum pore-size mesh, small ciliates (10 to 25 mum in length: Urotricha spp., Balanion planctonicum and Strobilidinm/Halteria) affected the growth rates of nanoflagellates in the <10 <mu>m samples. Low or negative growth rates were also found for oligotrichs and tintinnids, which appeared to be very sensitive to manipulation and incubation. Except for the latter 2 taxa, species-specific theoretical growth rates (derived from cell volume and temperature) were close to those calculated from changes in natural abundances. Our results suggest that the small ciliate Urotricha may act as an essential trophic link between autotrophic nanoflagellates (ANF) and metazooplankton, and that large ciliates may be able to efficiently transfer energy between heterotrophic nanoflagellate (HNF) prey and metazooplankton grazers during early spring in Lake Pavin. Our experiments highlight the importance of taking into account each individual protist species, and of not considering flagellates and ciliates as being a uniform group in pelagic systems. Because of the great diversity of shape, size and flexibility of these cells, it is essential during fractionation experiments to confirm the effectiveness of the experimental protocols so as to identify possible artefacts and to obtain a more reliable estimate of the flows of material and energy in aquatic ecosystems.

Interannual variation in diatom bloom dynamics: Roles of hydrology, nutrient limitation, sinking, and whole lake manipulation	WATER RESEARCH												Spring development of diatoms in Ford Lake, Michigan, USA was markedly different in 2004 from 2005 and 2006. In 2004, diatom biovolume surpassed 15 mm(3)l(-1) but in 2005 and 2006 maximum biovolume was less than 5 mm(3)l(-1). Soluble reactive silica (SRSi) in 2004 fell below 5 mu M whereas in 2005 and 2006, SRSi remained above 30 mu M. Taxonomic composition was similar among years and consisted mainly of Asterionella, Cyclotella, Fragilaria, Aulacoseira, and Synedra. Bioassay experiments in 2005 demonstrated that P rather than Si was the element most limiting biomass development. However, P supply rate did not account for the differences among years. Model simulations of Si uptake, washout rates, and sinking implicated hydrologic differences among years as the cause of differential success by diatom populations in April of each year. Bioassay experiments performed after overturn demonstrated that diatoms could grow well in unamended lake water, but they did not flourish in the lake; model simulations implicated sinking losses as the reason. In summer 2006, we performed a selective withdrawal of hypolimnetic water from the outlet dam and weakened density stratification. An Aulucoseira bloom resulted in early to mid-August, depleting SRSi to less than 30 mu M. The lake, which had been acting as a P source, changed to a P sink during the bloom, and cyanobacteria did not develop as they had in all previous years. Stoichiometric calculations indicate that the net SRSi uptake and the net DP uptake during the induced bloom were consistent with diatom production. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of climate on fall migration phenology of monarch butterflies departing the northeastern breeding grounds in Canada	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) undergo an iconic multi-generational migration, traveling thousands of kilometers from the summer breeding grounds in southern Canada to overwintering sites in central Mexico. This migration phenomena can be affected by climate change, which may have important implications on fitness and ultimately populations status. We investigated the long-term trends in fall migration phenology of monarchs using a 25-year dataset collected along the coast of Lake Erie in Ontario, Canada. We also investigated local long-term trends in weather covariates that have the potential to influence migration phenology at this site. Patterns in standardized daily counts of monarchs were compared with local weather covariates using two methods (i.e., monthly averages and moving windows) to assess difference in outputs between analytical approaches. Our results suggest that monarch migration timing (migration midpoint, average peak, first peak, and late passage) and weather covariates have been consistent over time, in direct contrast to a similar study in Cape May, New Jersey, which showed a significant increase in both fall temperature and a 16- to 19-day shift in monarch migration timing. Furthermore, our results differed between analytical approaches. With respect to annual variability in air temperature, our monthly average analysis suggested that for each degree increase in September air temperature, late season passage would advance 4.71 days (+/- 1.59 SE, p = .01). However, the moving window analysis suggested that this result is likely spurious and found no significant correlations between migration timing and any weather covariates. Importantly, our results caution against extrapolating the effects of climate change on the migration phenology of the monarch across study regions and the need for more long-term monitoring efforts to better understand regional drivers of variability in migration timing.

J	Ellingwood, K; Mohammadi, K; Powell, K				Ellingwood, Kevin; Mohammadi, Kasra; Powell, Kody			A novel means to flexibly operate a hybrid concentrated solar power plant and improve operation during non-ideal direct normal irradiation conditions	ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT												Hybridization of concentrated solar power (CSP) with other energy sources can drastically increase how much solar energy is harnessed and potentially expand the current geographical deployment of CSP installlations. In this study, a novel operation strategy referred to as flexible heat integration (FHI), is proposed and applied to a hybrid CSP-natural gas power plant. The proposed plant, modeled in Simulink, employs a solar central receiver (SCR) and dual-source gas boiler to drive a steam Rankine power cycle. FHI involves collecting and dispatching solar energy at modified temperatures during off-design direct normal irradiance (DNI). During low-grade ( < 100 W/m(2)) and medium-grade (100-500 W/m(2)) levels of DNI, molten salt is used for steam boiling and feedwater preheating, respectively, rather than superheating usually seen in SCR steam plants. Hybrid gas-firing supplies energy to bypassed systems. FHI is applied to a hybrid plant over the course of a day from each season for a plant located in Salt Lake City, Utah, an unconventional location due to off-design DNI variability. A spring day exhibiting variable DNI is used as the main case study to demonstrate the dynamics and robust operation under the FHI framework. The operation of the plant over the winter day shows the largest improvement in solar-to-electric (STE) efficiency whereas the summer day exhibits the smallest improvement. Monthly results follow a similar trend with FHI improving STE from 15.3% and 16.3% to 17.0% and 16.7% in January and July, respectively. Yearly results show FHI improving STE efficiency from 16.1% to 17.1% relative to standard hybrid operation. Overall, the proposed concept expands the current understanding of energy management in hybrid SCR-natural power plants under non-ideal DNI conditions and locations that have lower DNI by applying FHI.

In this paper we pay special attention to the shifts in relative distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus in the different trophic levels and to the changes in growth limitation of the autotrophs. Despite of the high external nutrient loads to the lake (ca 2.4 g P m-2 y-1 and 9.6 g N m-2 y-1), the effects of biomanipulation on the lake ecosystem were pronounced. Before biomanipulation no submerged vegetation was present in the lake and P and N were stored in the phytoplankton (44% N, 47% P), fish (33% N, 9% P) and in dissolved forms (23% N, 44% P). P and N contents in sediments were not determined. In the spring and summer following the biomanipulation (1987), zooplankton grazing controlled the phytoplankton biomass and about 90% of N and P were present in dissolved form in the water. From 1988 onwards submerged macrophyte stands continue to thrive, reducing the ammonium and nitrate concentrations in the water below detection levels. In July 1989 storage of N and P in the macrophytes reached 86% and 80%, respectively. Elodea nuttallii (Planchon) St.John, the dominant species in 1988 and 1989, acted as sink both for N and P during spring and early summer, withdrawing up to ca 60% of its N and P content from the sediment. At the end of the year only part of the N and P from the decayed macrophytes (ca 300, of N and 600, of P) was recovered in the water phase of the ecosystem (chiefly in dissolved forms). The rest remained in the sediment, although some N may have been released from the lake by denitrification. In summer 1990 only 30%, of the N and P was found in the macrophytes (dominant species Ceratophyllum demersum L.), while ca 30% of N and P was again stored in phytoplankton and fish.

In situ observations from 2001 and biannual survey data for 1996-2006 indicate that Lake Superior was, on average, supersaturated (annual mean = 46.7 +/- 17.3 Pa [461 +/- 171 mu atm]) with respect to atmospheric pCO(2) (mean = 38.3 +/- 0.6 Pa) in April and close to equilibrium (mean = 37.5 +/- 6.7 Pa) with respect to atmospheric pCO(2) (mean = 36.4 +/- 0.7 Pa) in August. Both data sets indicate that temporal variability in surface lake pCO(2) from weekly to interannual timescales was predominantly controlled by changing dissolved inorganic carbon and associated changes in pH. An unstratified water column appears to have limited pCO(2) fluctuations in spring. Through summer and into early fall, pCO(2) variability on a daily timescale at 12 m increased with time to a maximum amplitude of 19 Pa, likely as a result of internal waves on the thermocline. Year-to-year changes in mean surface lake pCO(2) and temperature were of the same sign and approximate magnitude at all observed points, consistent with the lake's small size relative to the synoptic-scale meteorological systems that force it. Variability in pCO(2) was not correlated with major climate indices. While these data provide a first large-scale overview of Lake Superior's pCO(2) and its temporal variability, their time-space resolution and accuracy are not sufficient to further refine previously imbalanced lake-wide carbon budgets.

The importance of nitrogen limitation in the restoration of Llangorse Lake, Wales, UK	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING												Llangorse Lake is the largest natural lake in South Wales, UK, and is of European conservation importance. The site has a long history of eutrophication problems and, in recent years, significant efforts have been made to meet water quality restoration targets at this site by reducing the input of phosphorus (P) from external sources. Although the lake has improved substantially in quality since the late 1970s, it is still not meeting its ecological targets. Phosphorus concentrations have remained high and there has been little reduction in algal biomass. Management decisions to reduce P input were originally based on the widely held assumption that shallow lakes are P-limited in summer. However, this study clearly shows that this is not always the case; Llangorse Lake, at least, is strongly nitrogen (N) limited over the summer months. As a result, bio-available P released from the sediments cannot be used by the phytoplankton Population. So, it accumulates in the water column, causing very high concentrations to occur in late summer. This puts the lake at very high risk of developing algal blooms when N availability increases, usually in early autumn. The study also found that the hydrology of the lake was strongly affected by sub-surface flow. This suggested that nutrients and water could be delivered to the lake from areas beyond the topographically defined surface water catchment. These findings have widespread implications for the successful management of external inputs to lakes, which currently tends to focus on management of the surface water catchment only. The results are discussed in relation to the restoration and management of nitrogen-limited lakes, and of those that are significantly affected by sub-surface flow.

This has consequently given rise to a range of ecological and environmental health issues. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive two-year investigation on the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of heavy metals in atmospheric deposition across China based on the Nationwide Nitrogen Deposition Monitoring Network (NNDMN). The atmospheric bulk deposition of Lead (Pb), Arsenic (As), Nickel (Ni), Selenium (Se), Chromium (Cr) and Cadmium (Cd) were 6.32 +/- 1.59, 4.49 +/- 0.57, 1.31 +/- 0.21, 1.05 +/- 0.16, 0.60 +/- 0.06 and 0.21 +/- 0.03 mg m(-2) yr(-1), respectively, with a large variation among the different regions of China. The order for atmospheric deposition flux was Southwest China > Southeast China > North China > Northeast China > Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and rural area > urban area > background area. The concentrations of heavy metals in bulk deposition exhibit seasonal variation with higher levels observed during winter compared to summer and spring, which are closely associated with anthropogenic activities. The Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) results indicated that combustion, industrial emissions and traffic are the primary contributors to atmospheric deposition of heavy metals. The single factor pollution index (P-i) of heavy metals is consistently below 1, and the composite pollution index (N-i) is 0.16 across China, indicating that atmospheric heavy metal deposition is at a pollution-free level. The comprehensive potential ecological risk index of heavy metals is 11.8, with Cd exhibiting the highest single factor potential ecological risk index at 7.09, suggesting that more attention should be paid to Cd deposition in China. The present study reveals the spatial-temporal distribution pattern of atmospheric heavy metals deposition in China, identifying regional source characteristics and providing a theoretical foundation and strategies for reducing emissions of atmospheric pollutants.

The study analyzed phytoplankton community variations in Lake Taihu over a 21-year period, focusing on realized niches and their impact on succession. The study developed a niche periodic table with 32 niches, revealing responses to environmental factors and the optimal number of niches. Results showed that the phytoplankton in Lake Taihu showed significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity, with biomass decreasing as one moved from the northwest to the southeast and expanding towards central lake area, and towards autumn and winter. Different phytoplankton groups in Lake Taihu occupied realized niches shaped by temperature, nitrate, and phosphate. To predict the response of eutrophic freshwater lake ecosystems to human activities and climate change, it is critical to interpret the law of phytoplankton bloom and niche succession.																			0013-9351	1096-0953				FEB 15	2024	243								117896	10.1016/j.envres.2023.117896	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2023.117896		DEC 2023						38081348					WOS:001138059500001
J	PERSSON, L				PERSSON, L			EFFECTS OF HABITAT AND SEASON ON COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ROACH (RUTILUS-RUTILUS) AND PERCH (PERCA-FLUVIATILIS)	OECOLOGIA												The competitive interactions between two distantly related fish species, roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis), were studied in enclosures in two habitats. In the open water habitat dominated by small planktonic prey perch grew more slowly and altered its diet from zooplankton to benthic macroinvertebrates when in the presence of roach. No effect, however, of perch on roach was observed. This was probably caused by the higher foraging efficiency of roach on zooplankton (laboratory experiments) and to the presence of a resource utilizable only by roach, bluegreen algae/detritus. In the littoral habitat no interspecific effects were detected even though resources were more limiting. This was probably a consequence of the higher densities of chironomids, on which perch fed more efficiently than roach, and of the presence of bluegreen algae/detritus. Roach, which consumed a larger spectrum of food types than perch, as a result was less affected by competition. The distributions of the species in the lake corresponded to what could be predicted from experiments. The degree of resource limitation varied with season and was highest in summer, while no resource limitation was observed in spring. This variation in resource limitation is probably caused by the increased metabolic demands of the fish in summer.

J	Hoff, MH				Hoff, MH			Biotic and abiotic factors related to Lake Herring recruitment in the Wisconsin waters of Lake Superior, 1984-1998	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Lake Superior lake herring (Coregonus artedi) recruitment to 13-14 months of age in the Wisconsin waters of Lake Superior varied by a factor of 5,233 during 1984-1998. Management agencies have sought models that accurately predict recruitment, but no satisfactory model had previously been developed. Lake herring recruitment was modeled to determine which factors most explained recruitment variability. The Ricker stock- recruitment model derived from only the paired stock and recruit data explained 35% of the variability in the recruitment data. The functional relationship that explained the greatest amount of recruitment variation (93%) included lake herring stock size, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) population size, slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) biomass, the interaction of mean daily wind speed in April (month of hatch) and lake herring stock size, and mean air temperature in April (when lake herring are 12-months old). Model results were interpreted to mean that lake herring recruitment was affected negatively by: slimy sculpin predation on lake herring ova; predation on age-0 lake herring by lake trout; and adult cannibalism on lake herring larvae, which was reduced by increased wind speed. April temperature was the variable that explained the least amount of variability in recruitment, but lake herring recruitment was positively affected by a warm April, which shortened winter and apparently reduced first-winter mortality. Stock size caused compensatory, density-dependent mortality on lake herring recruits. Management efforts appear best targeted at stock size protection, and empirical data implies that stock size in the Wisconsin waters of the lake should be maintained at 2.1-15.0 adults/ha in spring, bottom-trawl surveys.																			0380-1330						2004	30			1			423	433		10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70403-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(04)70403-7													WOS:000227991500031

Formation of pedestalled, relict lakes on the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												Surface debris covers much of the western portion of the McMurdo Ice Shelf and has a strong influence on the local surface albedo and energy balance. Differential ablation between debris-covered and debris-free areas creates an unusual heterogeneous surface of topographically low, high-ablation, and topographically raised ('pedestalled'), low-ablation areas. Analysis of Landsat and MODIS satellite imagery from 1999 to 2018, alongside field observations from the 2016/2017 austral summer, shows that pedestalled relict lakes ('pedestals') form when an active surface meltwater lake that develops in the summer, freezes-over in winter, resulting in the lake-bottom debris being masked by a high-albedo, superimposed, ice surface. If this ice surface fails to melt during a subsequent melt season, it experiences reduced surface ablation relative to the surrounding debris-covered areas of the ice shelf. We propose that this differential ablation, and resultant hydrostatic and flexural readjustments of the ice shelf, causes the former supraglacial lake surface to become increasingly pedestalled above the lower topography of the surrounding ice shelf. Consequently, meltwater streams cannot flow onto these pedestalled features, and instead divert around them. We suggest that the development of pedestals has a significant influence on the surface-energy balance, hydrology and flexure of the ice shelf.

Therefore, this study spectrally inverted and evaluated the water quality of the Poyang Lake in China by analysing the differences between the measured water quality parameters and the observed image spectra of Sentinel-2 remote sensing. This analysis was done using statistical regression models (SRMs) and various machine learning models (e.g., support vector machine [SVM] and random forest [RF]). The following major conclusions were drawn: (1) nutrients accumulated more in summer (June-August) than in winter (December-February). For example, in local areas of the main river, total nitrogen (TN) concentration reached 3.4 mg/L in summer of 2016, whereas total phosphorus (TP) concentrations were below 0.052 mg/L in winters of 2016 and 2017. (2) The three models, SRM, RF and SVM, achieved good results in the inversions of Secchi depth and permanganate index. However, differences were noted in the inversions of other parameters. For example, the goodness-of-fit (r(2)) between the inversion and measured values of TN concentration from RF was 0.81, while that from SR was 0.73. (3) The spatial distribution patterns of the water quality parameters showed differences. The ammoniacal nitrogen concentration was higher in the central region than that in the western region of the lake, whereas TP concentration was higher at the shoreline of the lake at 0.07 mg/L on 2 April 2017 but was relatively low in the main channel.

However, the underlying life history mechanism and distinct temporal dynamics (inter- and intra-annual) of Microcystis populations in different geographical locations and lakes remain unclear but is critical information needed for the development of robust prediction, prevention, and management strategies. Perennial observations indicate that temperature may be the key factor driving differences in the overwintering strategy. This study quantitatively compared the overwintering abilities of Microcystis aeruginosa (Ma) in both the water column and sediments under a gradient of overwintering water temperatures (i.e., 4, 8, and 12 & DEG;C) using the death and proliferation rates of Ma. The results show that the dynamics of the Microcystis overwintering strategy were significantly affected by water temperatures. At 4 and 8 & DEG;C, Ma mainly overwintered in sediments and disappeared from the water column after exposure to low temperatures for a long duration, although some Microcystis cells can overwinter in the water column for short durations at low temperatures. At 12 & DEG;C, most Ma can overwinter in the water column. Rising temperatures promoted the proliferation of pelagic Ma but accelerated the death of benthic Ma. With warmer winter temperatures, pelagic Microcystis might become the primary inoculum sources in the spring. Our study highlights the overwintering strategy flexibility in explaining temporal dynamics differences of Microcystis among in geographical locations and should be considered in the context of global warming.

During two ice-free seasons (1996-1997) investigations of biomass Structure in pelagic food webs were performed at 7 lakes in low-alkalinity mountain regions (Lake Districts). In 2000 (in some cases, 2001), late-summer (autumn) samples from 304 lakes from 10 Lake Districts were analysed for pelagic bacterial biomass (BAC), chlorophyll a (CHL) and zooplankton (ZOO) abundance. In two districts (Northern Finland-NF and Tyrolian Alps-TY), phytoplankton (PHY) species structure was also determined, together with ciliate (CIL) species structure in NF. BAC abundances (0.02-2.7 x 10(6) ml(-1)) generally corresponded to values found in other oligotrophic lakes, and to winter values from lowland meso- to eutrophic lakes. Values from two regions, the Julian Alps (JA) and Western Greenland (SS), however, were exceptionally high (0.10 - 25 x 10(6) ml(-1)). Here, bacterial cells often were large, elongated and even filamentous. Mean cell volumes (per sample) reached values up to 0.91 mu m(3) and cell lengths up to 4.1 mu m, thus surpassing the values known from lowland eutrophic lakes. Consequently, BAC biomasses frequently reached 40-50 mu g C L-1, and in lakes with filamentous bacteria up to 100 - 150 mu g C L-1. In Greenland lakes values of more than 200 mu g C L-1 were observed. Autotrophic picoplankton (APP) were scarce (<500 ml(-1)) or absent in 6 of the 7 low-alkalinity lakes studied. APP abundances regularly Surpassing 103 ml(-1) (biomass 15-150 mu g C L-1) were only observed in Lochnagar (Scotland), which is characterised by a high sodium and chloride concentration. APP biomass at this site surpassed that of BAC during late summer and autumn. Biomass of heterotrophic flagellates regularly reached 5-20% (exceptionally 50%) of BAC biomass, whereas CIL biomass usually reached only 1-8% of BAC biomasses, except for NF lakes (8 - 50% of BAC biomass). The most abundant CIL species belonged to five groups: large mixotrophic oligotrichs, algivorous prostomatids, large hymenostomatids, gymnostomatids and minute omnivorous oligotrichs. Besides heterotrophic protists, mixotrophic (containing Chl) bacterivores were always present. PHY biomass varied considerably among lakes and within individual lakes, and sometimes reached values found in meso- to eutrophic lakes. The smallest variation (0.3 - 153 mu g C L-1) was observed in lakes within a pH range of 5.3 - 5.9. In lakes with either lower or higher pH values (ranges 4.5 - 5.2 and 5.9 - 9.4), PHY biomass varied from 1.8 up to 1000 mu g C L-1. Among PHY species, motile and potentially phagotrophic bacterivorous taxa dominated from the Cryptophyceae, Chrysophyceae and Dinophyceae families. Representatives of Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae usually occurred in lower abundance. In Northern Finland Conjugatophyceae were frequent. Redundancy Analysis was applied to all lake districts except SS to test the response of BAC to chlorophyll a (CHL) and to the abundance of aggregated ZOO groups. 12.8% of variation in BAC abundances is explained by Daphnidae (mostly), Cyclopidae and Diaptomidae. Partial Redundancy Analysis proved that, though the BAC response to ZOO plus CHL is statistically significant, the majority of the explained variation is accounted for by proximal variables attributed to the physico-chemical environment of the lakes, such as nitrate, chloride andlittoral organic substrate. In the set of 7 intensely studied low-alkalinity lakes, the share of BAC in the total pelagic microbial biomass was significantly inversely correlated with trophy					Stuchlik, Evzen/I-1915-2017; Macek, Miroslav/B-5428-2015; Straskrabova, Viera/H-8406-2014; Tolotti, Monica/D-4441-2018; Fott, Jan/O-4261-2017	Stuchlik, Evzen/0000-0003-0200-5721; Macek, Miroslav/0000-0003-0600-3539; Tolotti, Monica/0000-0003-2674-8597; Fott, Jan/0000-0003-4066-9617													1612-166X		978-3-510-47064-8				2009	62						19	53				10.1007/978-1-84882-229-0												WOS:000273782900002

We tested for sex differences in stopover behavior, refueling rates, and postdeparture movements during spring migration in 2 consecutive years in wood-warblers (Parulidae) at a coastal site on Lake Erie, Ontario, using automated radio telemetry (black-throated blue warblers Setophaga caerulescens and magnolia warblers Setophaga magnolia) and analysis of plasma metabolites as indicators of refueling (magnolia warblers, American redstarts Setophaga ruticilla, and common yellowthroats Geothylpis trichas). We found no differences between sexes in stopover duration or refueling index, although we did find subtle sex differences in the onset and end of diel activity. Males of both species began to forage earlier in the morning than females in 2015, and adult males of both species ended diel activity later in the evening than adult females in 2014 and 2015. More obvious were annual differences in stopover duration and the timing of diel activity, with shorter stopovers and an earlier onset of diel activity in the year with a warmer spring. We also did not find any evidence that sexes differed in their postdeparture ground speeds or migration routes. In wood-warblers, males and females can differ in some aspects of their stopover ecology, but these differences are likely context dependent and likely do not drive protandry in a consistent way.

The lake concentrations were internally controlled during the summer season and by the inflowing river in winter, respectively. The lake acts as a sink of nutrients. 18 % of N and 3.5 % of P were retained in the 12-years-period. Phosphorus retention differed from year to year. The average retention rate of the investigated period was only 4 kgP/d, but in some years it was negative due to strong P-release from sediment. The P-retention rate was also influenced by bank filtration (withdrawal for a waterworks).																			0020-9309						1993	78	3					423	437		10.1002/iroh.19930780312	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19930780312													WOS:A1993MB33000008

Toxic elements in benthic lacustrine sediments of Utah's Great Salt Lake following a historic low in elevation	FRONTIERS IN SOIL SCIENCE												Terminal lakes (without outflow) retain elements and compounds that reach them through fluvial, point source or atmospheric deposition. If the lake sediment is exposed, some of these chemicals could become toxic dust particulates. The Great Salt Lake (GSL) in Utah is a terminal lake that experienced record-low lake elevation in 2021-22, exposing vast areas of playa. Here, we used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to analyze the environmental chemistry of GSL shallow sediment during historic lows in spring, summer, and fall of 2021. Contaminants at the subsurface interface are most able to influence diffusion into the water column and uptake by benthic biota. We focused our analysis on copper, thallium, arsenic, mercury, lead, and zinc, which have been historically deposited in this region and are toxic when at high concentrations. We compared records of regional mining activity to understand the current contamination and assess relevant spatial and temporal gradients. We also used two different extraction methods (EPA 3050b and NH4AcO at pH=7) that can distinguish "environmentally available" vs. tightly associated and less available fractions. We observed consistent concentration of copper across sites indicating a larger relative impact of atmospheric deposition, with some evidence indicating further impacts of point sources. Arsenic, on the other hand, is maintained at high levels in submerged sediments and is likely geologically- and fluvially- derived. Thallium and mercury fluctuate seasonally and correlate with lake elevation. Lead and zinc levels are relatively low in GSL sites compared with freshwater input sites, indicating the deep brine layer may sequester these heavy metals, preventing their release into the water column. Overall, the concentrations of most metals in GSL sediments have declined from historic highs. However, each contaminant has distinct sources, seasonality, mobility and transmission. Complete recovery (if possible) may require many more decades and individual remediation strategies.																				2673-8619				SEP 13	2024	4								1445792	10.3389/fsoil.2024.1445792	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fsoil.2024.1445792													WOS:001320243900001

Total alkaline phosphatase activity was determined seven times a year in these environments. The study on the water demonstrated that the top sublittoral layer (1 m) featured the highest alkaline phosphatase activity among all the analyzed zones. A study of seasonal fluctuations showed that a maximum total alkaline phosphatase activity, both in the water occurred in spring (May) and summer (July, August). Basing on this parameter no increase in eutrophication process in the lakes of Barlinek-Gorzow Landscape Park was determined in the course of a 5-year study.																			0970-7077	0975-427X				JUL	2014	26	13	A				3888	3890		10.14233/ajchem.2014.15994	http://dx.doi.org/10.14233/ajchem.2014.15994													WOS:000343763700028

In the lake, bacterioplankton net production, ranged between 5 and 70 .mu.g cl-1 d-1, and crustacean zooplankton > 200 .mu.m consumed from 23 to 66% of the bacterial production. Trophodynamic aspects of zooplankton consumption of bacteria were studied in enclosures manipulated with fish and nutrients. In enclosures without fish predation, the crustacean zooplankton ingestion balanced the bacterial net production. Small zooplankton (between 50 and 200 .mu.m, mainly rotifers) contributed only 20% of the total zooplankton (> 50 .mu.m) ingestion of bacteria in the lake. In the presence of planktivorous fish, however, small zooplankton gradually became the dominant bacterial consumers.																			0003-9136					OCT	1987	110	4					553	563																WOS:A1987K740600005

Yet, groundwater CH4 inputs and associated drivers are hitherto poorly constrained because their dynamics and spatial variability are largely unknown. Here, we unravel the important role and drivers of groundwater discharge for CH4 emissions from Arctic lakes. Spatial patterns across lakes suggest groundwater inflows are primarily related to lake depth and wetland cover. Groundwater CH4 inputs to lakes are higher in summer than in autumn and are influenced by hydrological (groundwater recharge) and biological drivers (CH4 production). This information on the spatial and temporal patterns on groundwater discharge at high northern latitudes is critical for predicting lake CH4 emissions in the warming Arctic, as rising temperatures, increasing precipitation, and permafrost thawing may further exacerbate groundwater CH4 inputs to lakes. CH4 inputs to Arctic lakes via groundwater discharge are an important pathway that links CH4 production in thawing permafrost to emission via lakes. Here the authors unravel the role and drivers of groundwater inflows for CH4 emissions from Arctic lakes.

J	Suchan, J; Azam, S				Suchan, Jared; Azam, Shahid			Effect of Salinity on Evaporation from Water Surface in Bench-Scale Testing	WATER												Freshwater and hypersaline lakes in arid and semi-arid environments are crucial from agricultural, industrial, and ecological perspectives. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the effect of salinity on evaporation from water surfaces. The main achievement of this research is the successful capture of simulated climate-surface interactions prevalent in the Canadian Prairies using a custom-built bench-scale atmospheric simulator. Test results indicated that the evaporative flux has a large variation during spring (water/brine: 1452/764 10(-4) g center dot s(-1)center dot m(-2) and 613/230 x 10(-4) g center dot s(-1)center dot m(-2) night) and summer (1856/1187 x 10(-4) g center dot s(-1)center dot m(-2) day and 1059/394 x 10(-4)g center dot s(-1)center dot m(-2) night), and small variation in the fall (1591/915 x 10(-4) g center dot s(-1)center dot m(-2) and 1790/1048 x 10(-4) g center dot s(-1)center dot m(-2) night). The primary theoretical contribution of this research is that the evaporation rate from distilled water is twice that of saturated brine. The measured data for water correlated well with mathematical estimates; data scatter was evenly distributed and within one standard deviation of the equality line, whereas the brine data mostly plotted above the equality line. The newly developed 2:1 water-brine correlation for evaporation was found to follow the combination equations with the Monteith model best matching the measurements.					; Azam, Shahid/C-6380-2009	Suchan, Jared/0000-0001-6891-7542; Azam, Shahid/0000-0002-8531-2577														2073-4441				AUG	2021	13	15							2067	10.3390/w13152067	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13152067													WOS:000682317400001

A detailed study was made of the 2nd summer generation of both species which consisted of a single, synchronized cohort in S. noelleri and overlapped cohorts in S. truncatum. Larvae of the 2 spp. also show differences in their habitat preference: those of S. noelleri predominate on the sluice which marks the beginning of the river and S. truncatum larvae just downstream from the sluice. In winter, the latter site was dominated by immature individuals of 2 other species, S. erythrocephalum de Geer and S. equinum L. which were found downstream from the 2 lake-outlet species during the summer. Adult females of S. noelleri are able to mature a 1st batch of eggs without taking a blood meal but those of S. truncatum need to feed on blood before eggs can be fully developed. The consequences of these different reproductive strategies on the ecology of individuals of the 2 spp. is discussed.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1982	96	3					243	251		10.1007/BF00010615	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00010615													WOS:A1982PS20900005

Determining the responses of riparian soil systems to surrounding hydrological flows is important for understanding seasonal changes in hydrological processes. In this study, one soil core from a polygon rim (close to the Taz River, TA) and two soil cores from a riverine terrace (close to the Syoyakha River, SY and Murtyyakha River, MU) in Western Siberia, Russia, and their suprapermafrost water, adjacent surface flows, and river water were sampled for analysis of geochemical elements. Results showed that most elements above their respective detection limits began accumulating in the underlying gleyed layer during September-October in response to the deepest thaw in the active layer. This study focused on the highly mobile elements in the deepest layer; and found that the transport of organic matter in the upper layer carried these elements to both surface water ponds/flows and suprapermafrost water, and further, to the rivers. The efflux of released elements from surface soil to surrounding surface water appeared to be low. The best linear correlation for both surface flows and river water was with Mn; therefore, Mn may be a proxy for predicting the processes occurring within the active layer during the annual summer-autumn thaw. Moreover, landscapes with different ice contents may experience changes in the elements transported to surface waters. A general conceptual model for the response of elements to the thawing-freezing process of the active layer is established. Plain Language Summary The rapidly increasing atmospheric temperature in the Arctic has led to the feedback of permafrost thawing, which increases the depth of the active layer and accelerates chemical weathering. These processes may cause a further release of chemical substances to adjacent aquatic landscapes. Here, we investigated the horizontal and vertical transport of geochemical elements through surface flow and suprapermafrost water to river water from three cryogenic soil cores in the Arctic tundra. The results showed that most elements accumulated in the gleyed layer, which was deepest in the active layer during the thawing season. Mn, Ca, Mg, Al, and Ti showed the highest mobility from soil to suprapermafrost water to the surface flows/rivers, while Mn was the only element that could migrate from topsoil and suprapermafrost water to surface water and river water, indicating that Mn may be a proxy for predicting the processes occurring in the active layer during summer-autumn thawing.

J	Piliposian, GT; Appleby, PG				Piliposian, GT; Appleby, PG			A model of the impact of winter ice cover on pollutant concentrations and fluxes in mountain lakes	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												High mountain lakes have been used in a number of recent studies concerned with measuring and modelling the dynamic response of remote ecosystems to environmental change ( the AL:PE, MOLAR and EMERGE projects). One of the important features that distinguishes these lakes from lowland lakes at similar latitudes is fact that they may be isolated from the atmosphere for six months or more during the winter by a thick ice cover. Pollutants deposited during the winter are locked up in the ice and snow and released only during the spring thaw. These processes generate a very strong seasonal variation of pollutant concentrations in the water column, and fluxes through the water column to the sediment record. This article presents a mathematical model of these processes, and uses the model to assess data on fluxes and concentrations of fallout radionuclides in the water column of Redo Lake in the Spanish Pyrenees. Using fallout Pb-210 as a tracer, the model results show that concentrations in the water column immediately after ice melt are enhanced by a factor of up to 70%. Fluxes through the watercolumn show a similar pattern to the empirical results, though the theoretical values tend to be a little more conservative. By comparing fluxes through the water column with the measured atmospheric flux it is estimated that between 4-6% of annual fallout of Pb-210 onto the catchment of Redo is delivered to the lake, and that the mean Pb-210 residence time in the catchment is between 500-750 yr.

Sweden)	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Organic carbon mineralization was studied. in a large humic lake (Lake Ortrasket) in northern Sweden during a well-defined summer stratification period following high water flow during snowmelt. Several independent methods including plankton counts, measurements of bacterioplankton and phytoplankton production, stable isotope monitoring, sediment trapping, and mass balance calculations were used. Total organic carbon mineralization showed a summer mean of 0.3 g C m(-2) d(-1) and was partitioned about equally between water and sediment. In the water column, organic matter was mineralized by bacteria (60%) and protozoan and metazoan zooplankton (30%), as well as by photooxidation (10%). Most of the mineralized organic carbon was of allochthonous origin. Primary production in the lake contributed at most 5% of the total organic carbon input and about 20% of the total organic carbon mineralization. Total carbon mineralization in. the epilimnion and metalimnion agreed well with an estimate of CO2 evasion from the stratified lake, while CO2 accumulation in the hypolimnion matched the O-2 consumption and resulted in a very negative delta C-13 of DIC before autumn overturn (-23 parts per thousand). Isotopic compositions of DIC and POC confirmed the dominant influence of terrestrial organic input on the cycling of both organic and inorganic carbon in the lake.

Both the spring diatom maximum and the summer bloom of the filamentous blue-green alga, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (L.) Ralfs, coincided with low values of phytoplankton species diversity and equitability. Diatom collapse was mainly due to internal modifications as nutrient depletion (Si, P) caused by rapid growth of phytoplankton, and increased grazing activity from zooplankton. A large population of Daphnia longispina O.F. Muller in June effectively removed smaller algal competitors, thus favouring the development of a huge summer bloom (140 mm3 l-1) of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. Heavy rainfall and storms in late July increased the loss of Apahnizomenon by out-flow and disturbed the stratification of the lake. These events caused a marked decline in phytoplankton biomass but had no effect on species diversity. A second storm period in late August circulated the lake completely and was followed by a rapid increase in phytoplankton diversity, and a change in the phytoplankton community structure from dominance of large, slow-growing K-selected species (Aphanizomenon) to small, fast-growing r-selected species (cryptomonads).																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN 10	1993	249	1-3					9	14		10.1007/BF00008838	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008838													WOS:A1993KN39000003

Sediment samples were collected at two stations in a eutrophic freshwater littoral in different seasons. Bacterial production ranged from 19.7 to 263.0 x 10(9) bacteria dm(-3) h(-1), with the highest values measured in summer. HNAN grazing rates (3.8-64.2 bacteria flagellate(-1) h(-1)) varied significantly with season and station, and rates were correlated with flagellate biovolume. At both stations, there were large discrepancies between bacterial production and HNAN grazing. The estimated bacterivory ranged from 0.4 to 5.2% of bacterial production. The minor impact of HNAN as grazers on bacteria during summer months was caused by high bacterial production and low HNAN abundances. During winter, bacterial production decreased, whereas HNAN abundance increased. However, due to the low grazing rate of these relatively small flagellates, the total HNAN community still consumed only an insignificant amount of the bacterial production. The results of our measurements show that bacterivory by HNAN cannot account for the fate of bacterial production in the littoral studied.																			0024-3590					JAN	1996	41	1					62	69		10.4319/lo.1996.41.1.0062	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1996.41.1.0062													WOS:A1996UC90700006

This drift was greatest from mid-October through March at water temperatures lower than 4degrees C, and was rare during summer. Individuals that were collected from the screens, marked, and released above the hatchery were rarely recovered, hence the location of the source population and drift distances are speculative. The sex ratio overall was close to 1:1, with males dominating numerically in 1994 and 1997, and females in 1993 and 1996. Females averaged 56.5 mm in total length (range 51-63 mm), and males 50.7 mm (range 47-56 mm). There was significant interannual variation in the mean lengths of males, but not of females. No differences in mean lengths or sex ratios between early- and late-winter collections were evident for any year. We suggest that the drift of these insects is best explained as a dispersal mechanism following the final molt and that winter is selected for dispersal to minimize predation risks.																			0090-0222					FAL-WIN	2001	34	2					69	75																WOS:000183110500009
J	GIBERSON, DJ; HALL, RJ				GIBERSON, DJ; HALL, RJ			SEASONAL-VARIATION IN FAUNAL DISTRIBUTION WITHIN THE SEDIMENTS OF A CANADIAN SHIELD STREAM, WITH EMPHASIS ON RESPONSES TO SPRING FLOODS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The vertical distribution of invertebrates within the shallow substrates of a Canadian Shield lake outflow stream was examined to determine the importance of season and spate on distribution pattern. Stream invertebrates were found throughout the year to depths of 25 cm below the sediment surface, only about 5 cm above bedrock. Insect abundance showed a strong seasonal pattern, with highest numbers occurring during early winter (December) in all depth zones. Except for Chironomidae, the majority of the insects found below 5 cm were early instar larvae of those found regularly at the surface. Insect abundance was generally higher at the sediment surface than for all other depth zones combined and consisted mainly of one taxon, Prosimulium (Diptera: Simuliidae). Non-insect invertebrates were always more abundant in the hyporheos than at the surface. Total invertebrate abundance (primarily Prosimulium) at the sediment surface decreased by about 40% during the spring snowmelt flood, but no significant changes in abundance occurred in the hyporheos during this period. Chemical analysis of surface and interstitial water showed that both pH and alkalinity decreased slightly in surface waters during the flood, but increased within the hyporheos, particularly on the rising limb of the flood hydrograph.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	1988	45	11					1994	2002		10.1139/f88-232	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f88-232													WOS:A1988Q956100014

This environmental reconstruction is based on a multi-proxy approach that integrates pollen, micro-charcoals, grain size and geochemical analysis. During the last glacial period we observe a strong presence of aquatic plants species that today flower during late spring and summer. These occurrences are related to an increased amount of snow precipitation on the surrounding mountains which fed the marsh during the summer season. Although the early Holocene reveals a slight and steady expansion of Mediterranean oaks, the semi-arid Artemisia steppe remained dominant in the landscape until 6.8ka cal BP. Thus, the early Holocene seems to have been less humid than elsewhere in North Africa. The Atlas cedars began to establish around 6ka cal BP. This indicates that the amount of annual rainfall increased after the mid-Holocene. The late Holocene is marked by an increase of fire events, which may be related to a strengthening of the dry season and/or a higher seasonality. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Zoological Studies 48(1): 33-48. The distribution of ciliates living among different species of mosses (Sphagnum angustifolium, S. cuspidatum, S. flexuosum, S. magellanicum, Polytrichum strictum, and P. commune) in eastern Poland Sphagnum peatlands is described. The highest species richness (23-35 taxa) occurred in hollows dominated by S. angustifolium, S. flexuosum, and S. palustre. Decidedly lower numbers of taxa (7-10) were observed in hummocks dominated by S. magellanicum and Polytrichum. The greatest abundance of ciliates was found in micro-sites dominated by S. flexuosum (25-30 individuals (ind./g), while the lowest was found in sites dominated by Polytrichum (4-6 ind./g). Likewise, independent of the species of mosses, micro-vertical differentiation of these protozoa was found. The number of species and abundance significantly increased at the deepest sampling depth. The upper sampling of mosses (0-5 cm) was dominated by mixotrophic taxa, whereas the deeper sampling level (5-10 cm) showed increases in the proportions of bacterivore species. In peatlands, the factors limiting the occurrence of ciliates are physical and chemical suitability - mainly the total organic carbon content and depth of water table (DWT), but also somewhat lower levels of pH and the species of moss. In turn, an increase in pH also increased the role of nutrients. Such factors have a significant effect on the occurrence of ciliates, The abundances of ciliates in spring and autumn were positively correlated with the concentration of organic matter independent of the species of moss; however, in summer, the influence of pH and DWT increased. http://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/48.1/33.pdf						Mieczan, Tomasz/0000-0003-2839-1798													1021-5506	1810-522X				JAN	2009	48	1					33	48																WOS:000263548600003

High nitrogen balance surpluses in the summer rice-winter wheat double-cropping systems are leading to large-scale non-point source pollution of aquifers. In an interdisciplinary approach, four-year (1995-1998) field trials were carried out in two representative areas (Jurong County and Wuxi City) of the Tailm Region. Five farmers' field sites were chosen in each of the 2 locations, with each site divided into "standard" (farmers' practice) and "reduced" (by 30%-40%) N fertilization. For both fertilization intensities, N balance surpluses and monetary returns from grain sales minus fertilizer expenditures were calculated in an economic assessment. Based on the field trials, the mineral N fertilizer application rates reduced by about 10% for rice and 20%-30% for wheat were recommended in 1999. Since 1999, the research focused on the trends in N fertilizer application rates and changes in grain and agricultural commodities prices. Summer rice N fertilizer use, in Wuxi City as of 2001, dropped by roughly 25%, while for winter wheat it decreased by 10%-20%, compared to the 1995-1998 period. This has been achieved not only by grain policy and price changes, but also by an increased environmental awareness from government officials. Nitrogen balance surpluses in Anzhen Town (of Wuxi City) have consequently diminished by 50%-75% in rice and by up to 40% in wheat, with reductions being achieved without concomitant decreases in physical grain yields or returns from sales minus fertilizer costs.																			1002-0160					NOV	2004	14	4					449	460																WOS:000224774000005

Hydrochemical monitoring was conducted in years 2005-2007 and comprised determination of temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, phosphates, nitrates(III), nitrates(V), iron(II) and total iron. The study revealed that in both lakes oxygen saturation of subsurface and near-bottom water within the littoral zone reached maximum values in spring and minimum values in autumn. In deeper layers, hypoxia occurred in near-bottom water throughout the whole study period. Average temperature of both subsurface and near-bottom water was significantly higher in lake Marta. Concentrations of nitrates (III and V) were higher in lake Sitno, and the difference was statistically significant for near-bottom layer. Elevated concentrations of nutrients observed in both lakes indicate their eutrophic character. Lower nitrate(III) concentrations in lake Marta may evidence occurrence of denitrification processes.

In particular, studies have revealed that typhoon-induced perturbations can result in several long-term effects on various ecosystems. In this study, we have conducted a 2-year metagenomic survey to investigate the microbial and viral community dynamics associated with environmental changes and seasonal variations in an enclosed freshwater reservoir subject to episodic typhoons. We found that the microbial community structure and the associated metagenomes continuously changed, where microbial richness increased after typhoon events and decreased during winter. Among the environmental factors that influenced changes in the microbial community, precipitation was considered to be the most significant. Similarly, the viral community regularly showed higher relative abundances and diversity during summer in comparison to winter, with major variations happening in several viral families including Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, Podoviridae and Microviridae. Interestingly, we also found that the precipitation level was associated with the terrestrial viral abundance in the reservoir. In contrast to the dynamic microbial community (L-divergence 0.73 +/- 0.25), we found that microbial metabolic profiles were relatively less divergent (L-divergence 0.24 +/- 0.04) at the finest metabolic resolution. This study provides for the first time a glimpse at the microbial and viral community dynamics of a subtropical freshwater ecosystem, adding a comprehensive set of new knowledge to aquatic environments.

For 1992-2018, the largest number of stream samples with P5+ concentrations ([P5+]) above detection limits occurred in 2008, corresponding with the highest frost-cracking intensity (FCI). Therefore, relatively cold winters and warm summers with a comparatively low mean annual temperature partly influence stream [P5+]. Sediment cores were collected from The Loch, an outlet lake of the LVW. Iron-, Al-, and Mn-oxide-bound phosphorus (adsorbed and authigenic phosphates; NP) serves as a proxy measurement for paleolake [P5+]. The highest NP in the core occurred during the cold and dry Allerod interstade. The lowest NP concentrations in the core occurred during climatically very wet periods in the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene. Therefore, [P5+] are highest with relatively cold winters followed by relatively warm summers, relatively low mean annual temperatures, and relatively little rainfall and/or cryospheric melting. Currently the LVW is experiencing warming and melting of the permanent cryosphere with a rapidly declining FCI since 2008. This has the potential to dramatically decrease [P5+] in surface water ecosystems of the LVW, reducing biological productivity, enhancing P-limitation, and increasing ecosystem reliance on aeolian P5+.

Lake superior supports novel clusters of cyanobacterial picoplankton	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Very little is known about the biodiversity of freshwater autotrophic picoplankton (APP) in the Laurentian Great Lakes, a system comprising 20% of the world's lacustrine freshwater. In this study, the genetic diversity of Lake Superior APP was examined by analyzing 16S rRNA gene and cpcRA PCR amplicons from water samples. By neighbor joining, the majority of 16S rRNA gene sequences clustered within the "picocyanobacterial clade" consisting of freshwater and marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus. Two new groups of Synechococcus spp., the pelagic Lake Superior clusters I and 11, do not group with any of the known freshwater picocyanobacterial clusters and were the most abundant species (50 to 90% of the sequences) in samples collected from offshore Lake Superior stations. Conversely, at station Portage Deep (PD), located in a nearshore urbanized area, only 4% of the sequences belonged to these clusters and the remaining clones reflected the freshwater Synechococcus diversity described previously at sites throughout the world. Supporting the 16S rRNA gene data, the cpcBA library from nearshore station PD revealed a cosmopolitan diversity, whereas the majority of the cpcBA sequences (97.6%) from pelagic station CD1 fell within a unique Lake Superior cluster. Thus far, these picocyanobacteria have not been cultured, although their phylogenetic assignment suggests that they are phycoerythrin (PE) rich, consistent with the observation that PE-rich APP dominate Lake Superior picoplankton. Lastly, flow cytometry revealed that the summertime APP can exceed 10(5) cells ml(-1) and suggests that the APP shifts from a community of PE and phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria and picoeukaryotes in winter to a PE-rich community in summer.

J	Mitchell, JS; Bailey, RC; Knapton, RW				Mitchell, JS; Bailey, RC; Knapton, RW			Effects of predation by fish and wintering ducks on dreissenid mussels at Nanticoke, Lake Erie	ECOSCIENCE												Dreissenid mussels in the Laurentian Great Lakes are preyed on by fish and diving ducks. but predators' roles in structuring Great Lakes' mussel populations are unclear. In Europe, predation impacts on zebra mussels are most pronounced on lakes where waterfowl winter. Using cages which excluded either fish and diving ducks or only diving ducks, we examined effects of these predators on both zebra mussels and quagga mussels (Dreissena polymorpha, D. bugensis) at Nanticoke, Lake Erie, where ducks both stage and winter. We arrayed cages at two sites, one within, and one adjacent to, a winter ice-free hole created by a generating station's coolant water discharge. At the ice-free site, predation by diving ducks reduced numbers of both mussel species substantially, and especially numbers of larger mussels. At the ice-covered site, residual effects of predation by ducks the preceding fall depended on rock size: numbers of large mussels declined on large rocks. Predation by fish reduced quagga but not zebra mussel abundance at the ice-covered site. Effects appeared to be: most pronounced on the smallest mussel length class, but characterizing length-class: preferences was difficult because effects on large mussels were sensitive to rock size: large mussels were removed from small rocks. At both sites, prior correlations between the number of quagga mussels on a rock and the size of that rock weakened or broke down completely following predation. Our results extend previous work on zebra mussels to include the quagga mussel, and show experimentally the potential of both predator groups, but especially wintering diving dudes, to affect local density, demography, and substrate-specific occupancy of dreissenid mussels.

Dynamics in space and time of four testate amoebae (Difflugia spp.) co-existing in the zooplankton of a reservoir in southern China	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PROTISTOLOGY												We studied a long time series of the dynamics in space and time of four species of Difflugia (thecamoebae) that co-exist in the pelagic plankton of Liuxihe Reservoir, an oligo-mesotrophic impoundment in southern China, during 8-9 months ("summer" form March to November), and retreat to the benthos during the rest of the year ("winter"). We discuss the reasons for the winter retreat, and suggest that predator evasion may be involved, although temperature-linked physiological effects (like the rate of gas bubble production) appear more probable. Clear diel vertical migration of Difflugia was not observed, but patchiness was common. We found no evident lake edge-effects in the spatial pattern either, but the abundances were strongly influenced by trophic conditions and increased by up to one order of magnitude in the upstream, eutrophic sections of the reservoir.

Hydrodynamics of a large lake with complex geometry and topography: Lake of the Woods	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We developed a high-resolution (250 m) three-dimensional hydrodynamic model of Lake of the Woods (LoW) to study surface seiches, lake circulation, and water temperature. LoW spans over two different geological regions, experiences wind variability, encompasses >14,500 islands and includes twelve hydraulically connected sub-basins. The complex geometry and topography are unique for this large lake that suffers from seasonal algal blooms. The model uses a spatially and temporally variable wind field, heat fluxes, riverine inflows obtained from a watershed model, outflows at Kenora and Norman dams, and was run for the spring-summer of 2017 and 2018. The predominant physical processes in LoW are surface seiches, and wind and rivers drive mean lake-wide circulations and mixing. The observed periods of seiches in the lake are 9.5, 3.4, 2.3, and 1.3 h, attributed to horizontal modes 1, 3, 6, and 12, respectively. Amphidromic structures show that sub-basin seiche's responses to wind may be limited to one sub-basin; however, lake-wide responses were also observed, which suggests the seiche-induced oscillatory velocities can impact transport paths. The mean water temperature is variable spatially, ranging from <15 degrees C in early June to similar to 25 degrees C in July-August. Sabaskong Bay experienced warmer summer water temperatures with unidirectional mean flows to the lake. Main water transport is towards the northeast. Modelled conservative tracers, consistent with observations, show that the Rainy River plume extent covers Big Traverse, Morson, and Little Traverse Bays. The modelled seasonal hydraulic retention times in southern bays are <150 days and are much longer in northern bays.

Hydrodynamics of an aquatic system like Chilika is extremely important. It has significant impact on sediment and pollutant transport, distribution of nutrients in water and sediments, and the productivity of the system. Data on salinity, temperature and wind procured during summer and winter season have been utilized to demonstrate circulation and mixing processes in Chilika lagoon. Density and wind driven circulation of this lagoon have been examined and depicted for the above period. Mixing of water masses in the lagoon are studied using straight line as well as triangle mixing methods.

Wild trout and stocked fish, which had been present in a fishery for 12 mo. or longer, tend to feed on the same dietary items at similar rates. Stocked fish in their immediate post-planting period (1-14 days) ate less than both the wild trout and established planted fish. In some instances recently stocked fish appear to have a preference for surface food items. They also consumed stones and detritic material. Stocked fish adopted a natural diet in less than 5 mo.

J	Spence, C				Spence, Christopher			Hydrological processes and streamflow in a lake dominated watercourse	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES					31st Annual Meeting of the Hydrology Section of the Canadian-Geophysical-Union	MAY 08-10, 2005	Banff, CANADA	Canadian Geophys Union, Hydrol Sect				This paper discusses results of a nested basin study investigating run-off responses along the watercourse in a 137 km(2) subarctic Canadian Shield watershed. Catchment areas contributing surface run-off to the basin outlet shrink after a maximum during spring snowmelt because of storage demands in headwater wetlands and lakes. This decrease is significant as summer contributing areas to the basin outlet are only 4% the size of spring melt contributing areas. This reduction in contributing area and decrease in antecedent lake levels lead to a two order of magnitude decrease in run-off ratios from spring snowmelt to midsummer. Furthermore, the attenuating influence of lakes on the run-off hydrograph increases the opportunity for evaporative losses, which prevents small run-off events from maintaining a measurable flood wave through the basin. The location at which a run-off event is interrupted in the watercourse is a function of lake size relative to upstream run-off inputs. Run-off is more susceptible to evaporative losses in large receiving lakes where inflow per unit area is less. These processes cause intermittent streamflow through the basin. These results have repercussions for coupled atmospheric/hydrological models whose resolution is approaching the basin scale. The incorporation of lateral transfer schemes that encompass these processes and physiographic influences on streamflow response is encouraged. Copyright (c) 2006 Crown in the right of Canada.

Seasonal foraging strategies of Alaskan gray wolves (Canis lupus) in an ecosystem subsidized by Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Despite frequent observations of gray wolves (Canis lupus L., 1758) using nonungulate prey, the seasonal and interannual variation in the use and relative importance of alternative prey sources to gray wolf diets have not been studied at the individual scale. We used stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of guard hair and blood components (clot and serum) collected over 4 years to examine the occurrence, extent, and temporal variation of Pacific salmon (genus Oncorhynchus Suckley, 1861) as a food resource by both individual wolves and social groups in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve in southwestern Alaska, USA. Our results demonstrate substantial variability in the use of salmon over time. During summer, diets of five wolves consisted of at least 50% salmon, while the diets of 17 wolves consisted of primarily terrestrial prey. Over 3 years, one group of wolves consistently consumed salmon in summer and switched to terrestrial prey in winter. Prey choices were generally similar within social groups; however, the degree to which individuals consumed salmon was highly variable. The use of salmon as exhibited by wolves in Lake Clark is likely widespread where salmon are abundant and this finding should be taken into consideration in the conservation and management of wolves and their prey.					; Causey, Douglas/O-8584-2019; Welker, Jeffrey/C-9493-2013	Stanek, Ashley/0000-0001-5184-2126; 													0008-4301	1480-3283				AUG	2017	95	8					555	563		10.1139/cjz-2016-0203	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2016-0203													WOS:000407297600004

Decaying macrophytic material supported rich algal growth and biomass accumulation in spring and early summer. Emergence of the macrophytes severely reduced underwater light availability; the epiphytic algal biomass declined rapidly as a result of both lower photosynthetic activity of the epiphytic algae and more intensive grazing by invertebrate herbivores. Epiphytic N:P ratios were lower than those in the water around, suggesting that either the water was not the only source of P for the epiphytic algae or that the algae took P up selectively from the water. Low epiphytic C:N ratios suggested a high potential nutritional value for herbivores.																			0020-9309						1984	69	4					475	505		10.1002/iroh.19840690403	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19840690403													WOS:A1984TN24500002

Early detection of reproduction deficits and the compensatory potential of enhancement stocking for vendace, Coregonus albula, fisheries in German lakes	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Enhancement stocking is a widespread but rarely evaluated practice in German vendace, Coregonus albula L. fisheries, which is precautionarily carried out to buffer yield fluctuations. However, it is assumed that stocking of larval vendace can elevate year-class strength only in the presence of substantial reproductive deficits, which so far cannot be detected prior to the spring time period when stocking is conducted by fisheries managers. Simple measures for the early quantification of natural reproduction were tested, and the efficiency of larval enhancement stocking in a lake with strong reproduction deficits was analysed. Analysis in four lakes over 3years revealed a significant positive correlation between standardised catches of vendace larvae caught with pump-driven illuminated traps in spring and the abundance of young-of-year (YoY) vendace in the following autumn, whereas standardised catches of spawners were insufficient to forecast YoY recruitment. In a lake with low natural vendace reproduction, stocked vendace contributed 73-100% of year-class strength and fisheries yield. Accordingly, enhancement stocking can efficiently compensate for reproduction deficits, and the simple larvae sampling method may facilitate early detection of these deficits, which would allow fisheries managers to respond accordingly through larvae stocking.

J	deCatanzaro, R; Chow-Fraser, P				deCatanzaro, Rachel; Chow-Fraser, Patricia			Effects of landscape variables and season on reference water chemistry of coastal marshes in eastern Georgian Bay	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We surveyed 34 marshes in relatively pristine Precambrian Shield catchments in Georgian Bay and related water chemistry to a suite of landscape-level variables, including characteristics of the marsh and its drainage basin. The first landscape principal component (explained 48% of variation) ordered marshes along a gradient with high values corresponding to marshes with large watersheds that contain extensive upstream wetland and that receive relatively high precipitation inputs. This axis was negatively related to specific conductivity, pH, nitrate nitrogen, and SO42- concentrations and positively related to total phosphorus, colour, suspended solids, ammonia nitrogen, and summer dissolved organic carbon. Stepwise regression models built using catchment- and marsh-level variables explained up to 64% of the variation in water chemistry variables. Average precipitation and snowmelt inputs to the catchments were first to enter the majority of models, alone explaining up to 43% of the variation (in the case of water colour), while drainage area alone explained 44% of the variation in pH. Concentrations of catchment-derived constituents in marshes were highest in spring, reflecting greater loadings from the watersheds, while ionic strength was highest during summer, reflecting increased contributions form other sources (i.e., lake water).																			0706-652X	1205-7533				JUN	2011	68	6					1009	1023		10.1139/F2011-035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F2011-035													WOS:000294370600005

On 14 October 2010 at Lake Ohnuma, Wakkanai, the northernmost part of Hokkaido, Japan, H5N1 HPAIVs were isolated from faecal samples of ducks flying from their nesting lakes in Siberia. Since then, in Japan, H5N1 HPAIVs have been isolated from 63 wild birds in 17 prefectures and caused HPAI outbreaks in 24 chicken farms in nine prefectures by the end of March in 2011. Each of these isolates was genetically closely related to the HPAIV isolates at Lake Ohnuma, and those in China, Mongolia, Russia and Korea, belonging to genetic clade 2.3.2.1. In addition, these isolates were genetically classified into three groups, suggesting that the viruses were transmitted by migratory water birds through at least three different routes from their northern territory to Japan. These isolates were antigenic variants, which is consistent with selection in poultry under the immunological pressure induced by vaccination. To prevent the perpetuation of viruses in the lakes where water birds nest in summer in Siberia, prompt eradication of HPAIVs in poultry is urgently needed in Asian countries where HPAI has not been controlled.

The role of internal feedbacks in shifting deep lake mixing regimes under a warming climate	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Climate warming is causing changes in the physics of deep lakes, such as longer summer stratification, increased water column stability, reduced ice cover, and a shallower depth of winter overturns. An ultimate consequence of warming would be a transition to a different mixing regime. Here we investigate the role of physical, chemical, and biological feedback mechanisms that unfold during a shift in mixing regime, and whether these feedbacks could prompt and stabilise the new regime. Although climate, interannual temperature variation, and lake morphometry are the main determinants of a mixing regime, when climate change causes shifts in mixing regime, internal feedback mechanisms may gain in importance and modify lake ecosystem functioning. We review the role of these feedbacks in three mixing regime shifts: from polymictic to seasonally stratified, from dimictic to monomictic, and from holomictic to oligomictic or meromictic. Polymictic lakes of intermediate depth (c. 3-10 m mean depth) could experience seasonal stratification if a stratification event triggers phytoplankton blooms or dissolved organic matter release, reducing transparency and therefore further heating the surface layer. However, this feedback is only likely to have influence in small and clear lakes, it would be easily disturbed by weather conditions, and the resulting stratified state does not remain stable in the long term, as stratification is lost in winter. The ice-albedo feedback might cause an accelerated shift from ice-covered (dimictic) to ice-free (monomictic) winters in sufficiently deep (mean depth 50 m or more) lakes, where temperature memory is carried over from one winter to the next. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing debate into whether this process can persist during natural weather variations and overcome self-stabilising mechanisms such as thermal insulation by snow. The majority of studies suggest that a gradual transition from dimictic to monomictic is more likely than an abrupt transition. A shift from a holomictic to a meromictic regime can occur if anoxia is triggered by incomplete mixing and an increase in deep-water density-through the accumulation of solutes-exceeds a density decrease by hypolimnetic warming. A shift to meromixis would strongly alter the biology of a lake and might be difficult to reverse. If solutes accumulate only minimally in the hypolimnion, an oligomictic regime is formed, in which years with complete and incomplete mixing alternate. Understanding the importance of feedback mechanisms and the role of biogeochemistry when lakes shift in mixing regime could lead to a better understanding of how climate change affects lake ecosystems.

Food caching by a Eurasian otter	FOLIA ZOOLOGICA												In early spring of 2007, unusual feeding behaviour was observed for the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) when a cache of toads (n = 18), black bullheads (n = 2) and great diving beetles (min. 58 id.) were found in a hollow tree-trunk on the shores of an oxbow lake near the River Danube. Spraint analysis identified the primary food of otters in the area to be fish, with non-fish (buffer) prey of very low importance. As the otter consumed almost exclusively fish, and appeared to store mainly buffer food items, this may indicate that either preferred fish were less available (limited) or that non-fish items were relatively more abundant for a short period during the mild 'cold' winter and spring period. The otter had abandoned this particular cache. Food caching is an important dietary adaptation for many species, providing readily available food during periods when fresh food may be difficult to find.					; Lanszki, Jozsef/AAN-1013-2020	Lanszki, Jozsef/0000-0002-2067-6601; 													0139-7893					MAR	2011	60	1					43	46																WOS:000289010400007

Winter mortality reduced the population to low levels, and population density increased over summer to high levels. Fecundity, adjusted for total length (TL) of the female, was high early in the breeing season, then declined to low levels as the population increased. The mean TL of gravid females declined during the same period, as a result of two factors: (1) large overwintering females died early in the breeding season: (2) young-of-the-year females began breeding at smaller TL later in the breeding system. The pattern of seasonal change in fecundity fits the predictions of r-K selection theory; the pattern of TL at first reproduction does not.																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1985	114	1					30	36		10.2307/2425237	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2425237													WOS:A1985AQL5800004

Assessing inter-annual and seasonal patterns of DOC and DOM quality across a complex alpine watershed underlain by discontinuous permafrost in Yukon, Canada	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												High-latitude environments store approximately half of the global organic carbon pool in peatlands, organic soils and permafrost, while large Arctic rivers convey an estimated 18-50 Tg Ca-1 to the Arctic Ocean. Warming trends associated with climate change affect dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export from terrestrial to riverine environments. However, there is limited consensus as to whether exports will increase or decrease due to complex interactions between climate, soils, vegetation, and associated production, mobilization and transport processes. A large body of research has focused on large river system DOC and dissolved organic matter (DOM) lability and observed trends conserved across years, whereas investigation at smaller watershed scales show that thermokarst and fire have a transient impact on hydrologically mediated solute transport. This study, located in theWolf Creek Research Basin situated similar to 20 km south of Whitehorse, YT, Canada, utilizes a nested design to assess seasonal and annual patterns of DOC and DOM composition across diverse landscape types (headwater, wetland and lake) and watershed scales. Peak DOC concentration and export occurred during freshet, as is the case in most northern watersheds; however, peaks were lower than a decade ago at the headwater site Granger Creek. DOM composition was most variable during freshet with high A254 and SUVA(254) and low FI and BIX. DOM composition was relatively insensitive to flow variation during summer and fall. The influence of increasing watershed scale and downstream mixing of landscape contributions was an overall dampening of DOC concentrations and optical indices with increasing groundwater contribution. Forecasted vegetation shifts, enhanced permafrost and seasonal thaw, earlier snowmelt, increased rainfall and other projected climate-driven changes will alter DOM sources and transport pathways. The results from this study support a projected shift from predominantly organic soils (high aromaticity and less fresh) to decomposing vegetation (more fresh and lower aromaticity). These changes may also facilitate flow and transport via deeper flow pathways and enhance groundwater contributions to runoff.

H.; Fung, Ngum E.; Kosten, Sarian			Drainage ditches are year-round greenhouse gas hotlines in temperate peat landscapes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from drained peatlands have been studied extensively. Considerably less attention has been paid to the emissions from the ditches used to drain peatlands. High within-ditch GHG production and lateral inflow of GHGs may lead to ditches emitting considerable amounts of GHGs on the landscape scale.2. We quantified annual emissions of ebullitive and diffusive methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) in 10 drainage ditches in intensively used temperate peatlands used for dairy farming, in The Netherlands. Additionally, we assessed water and sediment quality to determine proxies for emissions via the two emission pathways.3. The mean annual emissions from the studied ditches varied between 3.57 and 60.1 g CO2-eq. m(-2) day(-1) (based on a global warming potential over a 100-year timeframe), where CO2 contributed on average 43% (ranging between 1.9 and 22.0 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)) and diffusive CH4 contributed 16% (0.1-16.5 g CO2-eq. m(-2) day(-1)) to the total GHG emission. Ebullition of CH4 made up nearly half of the total GHG emission (40%, 1.3-40.9 g CO2-eq. m(-2) day(-1)). N2O emissions were mostly low. CO2 emissions were higher in winter months, while CH4 ebullition was higher during spring and summer. Diffusive CH4 emissions did not show a seasonal pattern.4. The mean emission factor, the estimate of average emissions per unit area (EF), for CH4 was 2144 kg CH4 ha(-1) year(-1), which is two times higher than the tier 1 EF reported by the IPCC (with underrepresented ebullition data), underlining the high variability of ditch emissions.5. Ditch emissions were also higher than the EF used for the surrounding drained peatlands indicating that ditch emissions can be important on the landscape scale and should be considered to be included in national greenhouse gas reporting.					; Fritz, Christian/C-5501-2011; Kosten, Sarian/D-7550-2011	Hendriks, Lisanne/0000-0002-4380-1620; Aben, Ralf/0000-0002-6182-4789; Fritz, Christian/0000-0003-2687-9749; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2024	69	1					143	156		10.1111/fwb.14200	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14200		NOV 2023											WOS:001105027300001

Here, we aim to decipher the influence of climate-induced changes on temporal patterns in chironomid assemblages. We apply a novel approach combining traditional taxon-based analysis and species-trait framework to subfossil chironomid assemblages in a sediment core covering the Late Glacial-Holocene transition in Northern Europe. We produce pollen-based July and January temperature reconstructions to characterize past climate fluctuations that show a distinct Early Holocene warming for continuous 1700 years with considerably greater warming in winter (ca. 10 degrees C) than summer (ca. 4 degrees C) temperature. Overall, chironomid taxonomic changes were mainly induced by the temperature tolerances and optima of species, as temporal dynamics showed agreement with temperature reconstructions. Our results suggest that vegetation dynamics could also play a role in structuring chironomid assemblages by selecting taxa with the highest ability to exploit available food resources, thus potentially confounding chironomid-based summer climate reconstructions. We demonstrate that the study of the hidden chironomid functional composition could help to identify secondary drivers and thus strengthen the reliability of climate reconstruction based on subfossil chironomids.

J	Rikardsen, AH; Johansen, M				Rikardsen, AH; Johansen, M			A morphometric method for estimation of total lipid level in live Arctic charr: a case study of its application on wild fish	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Linear body measurements were made on wild Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus parr (100-200 mm L-F) from two populations in northern Norway during spring (May), summer (June and July) and autumn (October). To reduce handling stress, a method was developed were dorsal and ventral body measurements could subsequently be taken easily from a single picture of the anaesthetized fish. Multiple regression analyses investigated the possible correlation between the body measurements and both total and percentage lipid content of the fish. For both populations and during all seasons, the regression equations gave better estimates for total lipid than for percentage lipid. The regression equations for total lipid accounted for between 67.7 and 89.5% of the variance in lipid content for the different seasons within the lakes. The pooled data within each lake accounted for 62.9 and 81.0% of the variance in total lipid, while the pooled data for both lakes accounted for 67.7% of the variance. In general, the condition factor alone did not give a satisfactory estimate of lipid content of the Arctic charr (r(2) = 0.003-0.521). Shrinkage on validation values was high (0.20-0.52). Employing a ridge regression method resulted in models with lower r(2) values and lower shrinkage values (indicating more stable models). Published equations used for hatchery-reared Arctic charr could not be used on wild fish from the same population. The close correlations between actual and predicted lipid levels found in this study show that morphometric measurements can predict total lipid levels in wild Arctic charr with reasonable accuracy. The most accurate results were obtained when equations were derived from each data set. Therefore, the method has the potential within a single study to estimate lipid levels in live fish as long as some fish can be sacrificed to develop a unique regression equation for each population or experiment.

I.; Roof, Steve			Fluvial suspended sediment yields over hours to millennia in the High Arctic at proglacial Lake Linnevatnet, Svalbard	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Sediment yield can be a sensitive indicator of catchment dynamics and environmental change. For a glacierized catchment in the High Arctic, we compiled and analyzed diverse sediment transfer data, spanning a wide range of temporal scales, to quantify catchment yields and explore landscape response to past and ongoing hydroclimatic variability. The dataset integrates rates of lake sedimentation from correlated varve records and repeated annual and seasonal sediment traps, augmented by multi-year lake and fluvial monitoring. Consistent spatial patterns of deposition enabled reconstruction of catchment yields from varve- and trap-based fluxes. We used hydroclimatic data and multivariate modeling to examine annual controls of sediment delivery over almost a century, and to examine shorter-term controls of sediment transfer during peak glacier melt. Particle-size analyses, especially for annual sediment traps, were used to further infer sediment transfer mechanisms and timing. Through the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age, there were no apparent multi-century trends in lake sedimentation rates, which were over three times greater than those during the mid-Holocene when glaciers were diminished. Twentieth-century sedimentation rates were greater than those of previous millennia, with a mid-century step increase in mean yield from 240 to 425Mg km(-2)yr(-1). Annual yields through the twentieth century showed significant positive relations with spring/summer temperature, rainfall, and peak discharge conditions. This finding is significant for the future of sediment transfer at Linnevatnet, and perhaps more broadly in the Arctic, where continued increases in temperature and rainfall are projected. For 2004-2010, annual yields ranged from 294 to 1330Mg km(-2)yr(-1). Sediment trap volumes and particle-size variations indicate that recent annual yields were largely dominated by spring to early summer transfer of relatively coarse-grained sediment. Fluvial monitoring showed daily to hourly sediment transfer to be related to current and prior discharge, diurnal hysteresis, air temperature, and precipitation.

However, they have been neglected in previous microbial studies, particularly those involving migratory waterbirds. Here, we investigated the gut archaeal communities of Anser erythropus wintering at Shengjin and Caizi Lakes in China using metagenomic analysis of 20 fecal samples (ten samples per lake). The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the gut archaea of geese wintering in the two lakes represented 16 phyla, 16 classes, 24 orders, 27 families, and 45 genera, with Euryarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, and Bathyarchaeota being the dominant gut archaeal phyla. The results of alpha diversity analysis showed a significant difference in composition between the Shengjin and Caizi Lake samples, and orthogonal partial least squares -discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) analysis indicated that geese were well -matched with their lakes of origin. Stamp analysis revealed a difference of 27 gut archaeal species between A. erythropus wintering at Shengjin Lake and those at Caizi Lake. Archaeal network analysis results fell into four major modules, with Methanolobus psychrotolerans and Thaumarchaeota archaeon as the hub modules. The abundances of several bacterial and fungal genera were significantly correlated with abundances of archaeal genera in pairwise populations, and a positive correlation was observed between archaeal, bacterial, and fungal diversities in the guts of A. erythropus wintering at both Shengjin and Caizi Lakes (R=0.4, p =2.2x10 -16 ; R=0.86, p =2.2x10 -16 , respectively). This suggests that fecal bacteria and fungi may cooperate with archaea to perform crucial roles in the gut. However, because of the small sample size in this study, further studies are needed to fully investigate the altered archaea in the guts of these geese.																			0030-9923					AUG	2024	56	4					1809	1818		10.17582/journal.pjz/20221208061226	http://dx.doi.org/10.17582/journal.pjz/20221208061226													WOS:001244800200004

Given the 'Holocene temperature conundrum', it is becoming increasingly important to reconstruct seasonal temperature variations. As a major component of the global monsoon system, the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) transports moisture and heat from the tropical oceans to higher latitudes and thus it has substantial socioeconomic implications for its regions of influences. We developed a well-dated, pollen-based summer temperature record (mean July; MJT) for the last 14,000 years from Xingyun lake in southwest China, where the climate is dominated by the ISM. MJT decreased during the Younger Dryas, increased slowly to high values during 8000-5500 yr BP, and decreased thereafter. The MJT record differs from that inferred using carbonate oxygen isotopes (delta O-18) from the same sediment core. The latter record reflects variations in monsoon precipitation, with highest precipitation during the early Holocene (11,000-6500 yr BP). We propose that summer temperature and precipitation in southwest China were decoupled during the early Holocene. Both MJT and monsoon precipitation decreased after the middle Holocene, tracking the trend in boreal summer insolation. We suggest that greater cloud cover, associated with high precipitation and generated by a strong summer monsoon, may have depressed early Holocene temperatures that would otherwise be driven by greater summer insolation. Melting ice sheets in high-latitude regions and high concentrations of atmospheric aerosols during the early Holocene may also have contributed, in part, to the relatively cool summer temperatures.

Heterogeneity in winter philopatry in a central-Arctic population of King Eiders	CONDOR												We used banding data from King Eiders (Somateria spectabilis) at Karrak Lake, Nunavut, Canada, during 2001 and 2002 in conjunction with analysis of naturally occurring stable isotopes (C-13, N-15) from feathers to connect winter and breeding areas of individuals. We also investigated the occurrence of winter philopatry among nesting females, and examined cross-seasonal effects of wintering area on subsequent breeding. Isotopic data suggested that 66-73% of this central-arctic breeding population wintered to the west (i.e., Bering Sea and North Pacific) and the remaining 24-37% wintered to the east (i.e., west Greenland, northwest Atlantic). In contrast, limited band recoveries from hunter-killed King Eiders marked at the same breeding location suggested that about 56% of individuals were shot in eastern wintering areas. These differences likely reflect stronger hunting pressures along the coast of Greenland, which result in more band recoveries for this area. Our results suggest that female King Eiders were not strongly philopatric to wintering areas among years. Individuals that wintered in western seas initiated nests 1.9 days earlier and had slightly larger clutches during early initiation relative to females that wintered in the east. Nest parasitism appeared to be biased toward earlier nesters, many of which wintered in the west. Female condition during incubation did not vary by wintering area. Our results have important implications for gene flow and for potentially associating wintering-area conditions with overall demography and individual fitness of King Eiders.					; Hobson, Keith/Q-9306-2019	Alisauskas, Ray/0000-0003-1983-020X; 														1938-5129				MAY	2004	106	2					241	251		10.1650/7356	http://dx.doi.org/10.1650/7356													WOS:000221264000003

Nutrient deficiency was tested in samples from three different layers of the lake: the epilimnion, metalimnion and oxic hypolimnion. Nitrogen additions, either without or combined with P, increased phytoplankton growth in all three strata, compared with controls or P treatments. This showed that N was the nutrient limiting phytoplankton growth in late summer-early fall. Since both hypolimnetic diffusion and groundwater fluxes of N-rich waters into the lake are much reduced during summer, N becomes the limiting nutrient as stratification advances. We suggest that in this Mediterranean area with low atmospheric deposition of anthropogenic N and in lakes relatively free of surface run-off, nutrient supply by atmospheric deposition might be a key factor in controlling nutrient deficiency for phytoplankton growth.

Large-scale fish movement affects metrics of management importance as indicated by quantitative stock assessment	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Since achieving population recovery targets, management of the Saginaw Bay stock of walleye in Lake Huron is informed by a statistical-catch-at-age (SCAA) model providing estimates of abundance, spawning stock biomass, mortality rates, and exploitation rates. Movement was examined by an acoustic telemetry study and indicated that 37% of the adult population spends much of spring, summer, and fall in the main basin of Lake Huron and unavailable to the fishery in the bay. The current SCAA model used by managers accounts for this movement by including harvest estimates from main basin fisheries in addition to those within the bay. To quantify the effect of the inclusion of the migration information into the model, we constructed a reduced model version that was limited only to the bay harvest and data sources, and then compared these estimates to the full model estimates. All estimates from the reduced model deviated significantly from the full Lake Huron model's estimates. Significantly different by year were 61% of population size estimates, 25% of total annual mortality estimates, 18% of recreational exploitation rates, and 52% of spawning stock biomass estimates. Differences between the two models were greatest in years of high walleye abundance (i.e., after recovery) and retrospective analysis indicated that this departure was not an estimation artifact. Generally, the reduced model underestimated predicted abundance. We concluded that incorporation of knowledge of movement of Saginaw Bay walleye from the acoustic telemetry study resulted in better informed stock assessment estimates.

J	Suchan, J; Azam, S				Suchan, Jared; Azam, Shahid			Determination of Evaporative Fluxes Using a Bench-Scale Atmosphere Simulator	WATER												An accurate determination of evaporative fluxes is critical for efficient water management in semi-arid climates such as in the Canadian Prairies. The main achievements of this research are the design and operation of a bench-scale atmosphere simulator, performance evaluation using selected weather scenarios pertaining to regional atmospheric conditions, validation using established empirical correlations, and estimation of evaporation rates and the amount for a typical local water body. Results indicate that the measured data achieved the target values for the various parameters and the data were found to be stable during the 3-h test duration. The vapour flux was found to have large variation during summer (0.120 g.s(-1).m(-2) during the day and 0.047 g.s(-1).m(-2) at night), low variation during spring (0.116 g.s(-1).m(-2) during the day and 0.062 g.s(-1).m(-2) at night), and negligible change during fall (0.100 g.s(-1).m(-2) during the day and 0.076 g.s(-1).m(-2) at night). The measured vapour flux was generally within one standard deviation of the equality line when compared with that predicted by both the mass-transfer equations and the combination equations. The average evaporation ranged from 4 mm.d(-1) to 8 mm.d(-1) during the day and decreased to 1 mm.d(-1) to 3 mm.d(-1) at night. The 24-h evaporation was found to be 8 +/- 1 mm.d(-1) from late April through late October. Likewise, the cumulative annual evaporation was found to be 1781 mm, of which 82% occurs during the day and 18% at night.					; Azam, Shahid/C-6380-2009	Azam, Shahid/0000-0002-8531-2577; Suchan, Jared/0000-0001-6891-7542; 														2073-4441				JAN	2021	13	1							84	10.3390/w13010084	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w13010084													WOS:000606403600001
J	Grossart, HP; Simon, M				Grossart, HP; Simon, M			Significance of limnetic organic aggregates (lake snow) for the sinking flux of particulate organic matter in a large lake	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												The abundance, composition and bacterial colonization of macroscopic organic aggregates (lake snow) were studied from March until November 1993 in Lake Constance, Germany. In addition, the concentration of particulate organic carbon (POC) and the amount, composition, and bacterial colonization of particulate matter (PM) collected in a sediment trap deployed at 50 m were investigated. The seasonal and vertical dynamics of lake snow and of sinking PM were closely Linked to those of phytoplankton blooms in spring. summer, and fall and to sedimentation losses of zooplankton during the clear-water phase. POC in lake snow comprised between 0.15 and 28% of total POC in the surrounding water. On the other hand, sinking losses of POC bound in lake snow as estimated from the abundance, POC content and potential sinking rates of lake snow comprised much higher percentages, indicating the significance of these aggregates for the POC sinking flux. Particulate combined amino acids comprised 8 to 51% of lake snow POC and were turned over in <20 h as determined from high rates of aminopeptidase activity. A rapid release of dissolved amino acids from sediment trap material into the surrounding water was shown experimentally indicating that the rapid POM decomposition in the aphotic zone leads to a supply of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to planktonic bacteria at this depth. However, in the same type of experiments we found that dissolved amino acids were taken up by the bacteria associated with the settled material when it was deprived of labile organic substrates. This finding complicates the 1-way concept of bacterially mediated interactions between POM and DOM in aquatic environments.

However, although the composition, diversity and function of bacterial communities have been well studied, little is known about the interactions and co-occurrence characteristics of these communities, let alone their seasonal patterns. To investigate the seasonal variations of bacterial community interactions, we collected water samples from four seasons in Lake Taihu and applied network analysis to reveal bacterial community interactions. Bacterial community networks were non-random in structure, and interactions among bacterial taxa in the networks varied markedly in different seasons. The autumnal bacterial network was the largest and most complex among obtained networks, whereas the spring correlation network was the simplest, having no module hubs or connectors. The important species of the networks were the dominant bacterial phyla/classes (e.g., Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes), although their relative abundance varied among seasons. The relationships between species and measured environmental variables changed over seasons; fewer environmental factors were correlated with bacterial species in the spring bacterial network, while we observed a greater number of species-environment correlations in the winter network. Our study highlights the seasonal differences in bacterial community interactions and expands our understanding of freshwater microbial ecology in systems affected by aquaculture.					; Zeng, Jin/AAQ-7810-2020; Jiao, Congcong/AAQ-8264-2020	Jiao, Congcong/0000-0002-9096-8431; 														2073-4441				SEP	2019	11	9							1868	10.3390/w11091868	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11091868													WOS:000488834400131

Five forms of P were fractionated, namely exchangeable P (Ex-P), iron-bound P (Fe-P), authigenic apatite (Ca-P), detrital P (De-P) and organic P (OP). Total P (TP) varied from 13.42 to 23.88 mu mol g(-1) with the main form of inorganic P (IP). The benthic phosphate (DIP) fluxes were calculated based on incubation experiments. The results show that the sediment was an important source of P in summer with similar to 39% of the bioavailable P (Bio-P) recycled back into the water column. However, the sediment acted a sink of P in autumn. The benthic DIP fluxes were mainly controlled by the remobilizing of Fe-P, Ex-P and OP under contrasting redox conditions. In August (hypoxia season), similar to 0.92 mu mol g(-1) of Fe-P and similar to 0.52 mu mol g(-1) of OP could be transformed to DIP and released into water, while similar to 0.36 mu mol g(-1) of DIP was adsorbed to clay minerals. In November (non-hypoxia season), however, similar to 0.54 mu mol g(-1) of OP was converted into DIP, while similar to 0.55 mu mol g(-1) and similar to 0.28 mu mol g(-1) of DIP was adsorbed to clay minerals and bind to iron oxides. Furthermore, scallop farming activities also affected the P mobilization through biological deposition and reduced hydrodynamic conditions. The burial fluxes of P varied from 11.67 to 20.78 mu mol cm(-2) yr(-1) and its burial efficiency was 84.7-100%, which was consistent with that in most of the marginal seas worldwide. This study reveals that hypoxia and scallop farming activities can significantly promote sedimentary P mobility, thereby causing high benthic DIP flux in coastal waters. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Both anthropogenic activities and climate change have influenced the availability and distribution of surface water resources in this area. This research endeavors to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on surface water resources across the LUB. Various critical climatic and anthropogenic factors affecting surface water bodies, such as air temperature (AT), cropland (CL), potential evapotranspiration (PET), snow cover, precipitation, built-up areas, and groundwater salinity, were analyzed from 2000 to 2021 using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. The JRC-Global surface water mapping layers V1.4, with a spatial resolution of 30 m, were employed to monitor surface water patterns. Additionally, the Mann-Kendall (MK) non-parametric trend test was utilized to identify statistically significant trends in the time series data. The results reveal negative correlations of -0.56, -0.89, -0.09, -0.99, and -0.79 between AT, CL, snow cover, built-up areas, and groundwater salinity with surface water resources, respectively. Conversely, positive correlations of 0.07 and 0.12 were observed between precipitation and PET and surface water resources, respectively. Notably, the findings indicate that approximately 40% of the surface water bodies in the LUB have remained permanent over the past four decades. However, there has been a loss of around 30% of permanent water resources, transitioning into seasonal water bodies, which now account for nearly 13% of the total. The results of our research also indicate that December and January are the months with the most water presence over the LUB from 1984 to 2021. This is because these months align with winter in the LUB, during which there is no water consumption for the agriculture sector. The driest months in the study area are August, September, and October, with the presence of water almost at zero percent. These months coincide with the summer and autumn seasons in the study area. In summary, the results underscore the significant impact of human activities on surface water resources compared to climatic variables.

J	Nishri, A; Hamilton, DP				Nishri, A.; Hamilton, D. P.			A mass balance evaluation of the ecological significance of historical nitrogen fluxes in Lake Kinneret	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Kinneret (LK) is a monomictic lake that has undergone significant biological and chemical changes over the last three decades of the twentieth century. The transition between the 1970s and the 1980s attracted a lot of scientific attention as it was marked by significant changes in the ecology of the lake. In the early 1980s, phytoplankton biomass increased, apparently in response to an increase in the external soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) load. This period was marked by a rise in hypolimnetic levels of ammonium (NH4) and SRP as well as surface water dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH. Cconcomitantly, in surface waters in winter levels of NH4 increased and NO3 decreased. In this study interrelationships amongst these observations were examined with a mass balance modelling approach, including simulation of individual nutrient sources and sinks, focusing on nitrogen fluxes in winter. The step-like rise in phytoplankton biomass in 1981 may have been triggered by the increase in winter external loads of SRP, as P is likely to be the growth-limiting nutrient during this season. The additional P load led to a sequence of changes including greater summer phytoplankton biomass, followed by enhanced sedimentation of organic matter. Furthermore, higher organic matter mineralization fluxes within the hypolimnion resulted in elevated levels of NH4 and SRP in this layer through the 1980s, with a feedback to productivity in the trophogenic zone following seasonal destratification in early winter. In an apparent transition period (late 1970s to early 1980s), an increase in the modelled rate of nitrate (NO3) production occurred via nitrification together with increased uptake of the additional nitrate by phytoplankton. These results are consistent with increased phytoplankton abundance and elevated levels of surface water NH4 and DO during this period. Through this period the increase in phytoplankton uptake of NO3 predominated over the increase in nitrification, and NO3 concentrations in the 1980s were reduced compared with the previous decade, with increased partitioning of N in biomass and NH4.

We investigated whether annual seawater migration is preceded by changes in hyposmoregulatory capacity, intermediary metabolism, and the plasma levels of hormones known to play a role in salmonid seawater preadaptation (smoltification). Wild, anadromous Arctic char were sampled in their overwintering lake in April and May and during the period of downstream migration in June. Our results demonstrate a fourfold seasonal increase in gill Na+/K+ ATPase activity, with maximum levels in descending migrants that also displayed prime hyposmoregulatory capacity. Hepatosomatic index and activities of key liver enzymes also increased during spring, indicating a general increase in liver metabolic capacity. These changes were accompanied by increased plasma cortisol and thyroxine levels, decreased plasma growth hormone levels, and unchanged plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor-I and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine. Our results indicate that wild, anadromous Arctic char resmoltify every spring, and this involves a shift from an energy-conserving overwintering state to a state where they become osmotically and metabolically prepared for their annual feeding migration to seawater.					; Vijayan, Mathilakath/AAC-2190-2020	Vijayan, Mathilakath/0000-0002-4300-1965; 													0706-652X					JAN	2005	62	1					195	204		10.1139/F04-186	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F04-186													WOS:000227614100019
J	Hessen, DO; Henriksen, A; Smelhus, AM				Hessen, DO; Henriksen, A; Smelhus, AM			Seasonal fluctuations and diurnal oscillations in nitrate of a heathland brook	WATER RESEARCH												A 5-year study on nitrogen dynamics were performed in a pristine heathland catchment (2.55 km(2)) in southern Norway. The catchment received 1.6 g total N m(-2)yr(-1) from wet and dry deposition, which is nearly tenfold more than that of northern Norway. Compared to most Norwegian catchments and forested areas, there is only a modest depression in mid-summer nitrate in runoff from winter maxima of nearly 250 mu g litre(-1) to late summer minima of 50-100 mu g NO3-N litre(-1). N:P-ratios in runoff was strongly skewed towards P-limitation, and concentrations of both phosphate and total-P were normally below detection limits (<1 mu g litre(-1)). The nitrate response of a three days P-enrichment in late May in the main brook draining the area was monitored continuously with a 10-min resolution for two months. The data confirmed a strong P-limitation and revealed a strong nitrate uptake and diurnal oscillations in nitrate concentrations over a period of more than one month following the P-enrichment. Over this period, mid-day concentrations were reduced by a factor of 2-3 relative to night maxima. Such reductions in nitrate during day relative to night-time may have profound effect on transport or budget estimates based on day-time samples only. Nitrate contributed normally 20-30% to anion acidity, and over the summer period there was a significant negative correlation between nitrate concentrations and pH, suggesting that increased N-uptake could also affect pH of such low-alkalinity systems.

Data are considered at both sites during a 10-day winter period with high PM2.5 concentrations due to winter inversions, and at the Hawthorne site only during a fourteen day summer period when the site was impacted by smoke from wildfires in the Wasatch Mountains. The PM2.5 was dominated by organic material and ammonium nitrate in the winter and by organic material in the summer. In both cases, substantial amounts of sem-volatile material, SVM, was present which was not measured by a Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM) monitor but was detected by a Real-Time Ambient Mass Sampler (RAMS). The PM2.5 data have been combined with concentrations of particulate soot and soil corrected potassium, and with gas-phase concentrations of NOx, CO, and SO2 to apportion the PM2.5 to primary emissions emitted by and secondary particulate material formed from emissions from mobile sources, wood smoke combustion (including the forest fire emissions), and oil refineries located near the Bountiful site on an hourly basis. Wood smoke and mobile source emissions dominated the contribution to the non-volatile fraction of the PM2.5, with about equal contributions for each, but very different diurnal patterns for the two contributions. The diurnal patterns for the attribution were consistent with the emission patterns for these two sources. In addition, the oil refineries contributed about 10% of the primary PM2.5 at Bountiful. The SVM could not be directly attributed to any source but appeared to be secondary ammonium nitrate and organic material formed from gaseous emissions from the various sources. The dominant contributors to this SVM were NOx and gas-phase organic compounds in emissions from both mobile sources and wood smoke.

Structural and Functional Characteristics of Zooplankton Communities in Thermokarst Lakes of Samoylov Island (Lena River Delta, Republic of Sakha (Yakutia))	UCHENYE ZAPISKI KAZANSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA ESTESTVENNYE NAUKI												The structural and functional characteristics of zooplankton communities of two thermokarst lakes on Samoylov Island (Lena River delta, Yakutia) have been studied. A total of 76 taxa of hydrobionts have been found in the zooplankton community of the studied lakes. The taxonomic lists of the spring-summer zooplankton compositions have been provided. The complex of species determining the community structure has been defined. Rotifers determined the species diversity and zooplankton abundance in the lakes. The biomass values were defined by large copepods. Cold-water-dwelling northern species made the greatest contribution to the quantitative indicators of zooplankton. The seasonal dynamics of quantitative indicators of zooplankton has been analyzed. The current state of the lakes has been assessed using the saprobity index and species diversity.

C. hirundinella f. gracile was present during the whole investigation period in Lake Njivice. The same species was the dominant form in Ponikve Lake during 1997/98, while in 2000/01 a strong development of C. hirundinella f. austriacum occurred. The species C. hirundinella f. austriacum was restricted to spring-summer time. This population showed larger variations in number of horns. An analysis of morphometric measurements showed significant differences (p < 0.01) in the total length of cells, length of the fourth horn and V3 angle of the two Ceratium forms.					; Udovič, Marija/IZE-0991-2023	Gligora Udovic, Marija/0000-0002-1982-2528; Ternjej, Ivancica/0000-0002-7525-3067													0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV 15	2003	506	1-3					213	220		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008607.07210.24	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008607.07210.24													WOS:000188455600029

Altogether, 41.0% (57 of 139) of the samples were positive for at least one of the pathogens; 17.3% were positive for Campylobacter spp. (45.8% of the positive samples contained Campylobacter jejuni, 25.0% contained Campylobacter lari, 4.2% contained Campylobacter coli, and 25.0% contained Campylobacter isolates that were not identified), 13.7% were positive for Giardia spp., 10.1% were positive for Cryptosporidium spp., and 9.4% were positive for noroviruses (23.0% of the positive samples contained genogroup I and 77.0% contained genogroup II). The samples were positive for enteropathogens significantly (P < 0.05) less frequently during the winter season than during the other sampling seasons. No significant differences in the prevalence of enteropathogens were found when rivers and lakes were compared. The presence of thermotolerant coliforms, E. coli, and C perfringens had significant bivariate nonparametric Spearman's rank order correlation coefficients (P < 0.001) with samples that were positive for one or more of the pathogens analyzed. The absence of these indicators in a logistic regression model was found to have significant predictive value (odds ratios, 1.15 X 10(8), 7.57, and 2.74, respectively; P < 0.05) for a sample that was negative for the pathogens analyzed. There were no significant correlations between counts or count levels for thermotolerant coliforms or E. coli or the presence of F-RNA phages and pathogens in the samples analyzed.					; Heikinheimo, Annamari/LXW-8097-2024	Maunula, Leena/0000-0002-0841-5353; Heikinheimo, Annamari/0000-0002-6559-5442; 													0099-2240	1098-5336				JAN	2004	70	1					87	95		10.1128/AEM.70.1.87-95.2004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.70.1.87-95.2004								14711629					WOS:000188115300011

In this context, has become a description of the extent of the area, geographic position, morphology of the terrain, hydro graphic and climate, geologicaltectonic construction, biodiversity, natural heritage and genetic zone Mountains National Park-Sharr. Sharr Mountains occupy an area of 580 km(2), and have split into three sub-districts: Lumbardhi of Prizren, it Korishe-Mushtisht and Lepenci. The criteria for these sub-districts is taking water-sharing and climate. Also, in this paper we tried to treat natural resources, and opportunities they present for economic and social development of the inhabitants of this territory. Sharr Mountains area has great potential for tourism development, whether it summer or winter, if sufficient capacity rise hotels, sports centers, rehabilitation etc. This, the fact that there are great natural potential for ecological food products (bio-products), medicinal plants etc., Owing to soil, water, clean air, a favorable climate, which makes one of the most special throughout the territory of Kosovo. For the aspect of this mineral rich area is polimetallyc minerals: iron, chromium, copper, zinc, silver etc. The area is rich with springs, such as sweet, as well as mineral water. Sources of mineral waters are known: the Sour Spring Gacke, Hani Elezit, Bajnice, Vraniq, Buzhala etc. A feature of this area are fluvio-glacial lakes that are in altitude over 2000m. For more complete coverage of the area that was taken for treatment, is also working on the graphics: maps of road connections, morphological maps, weather maps, it geological zoning map of genetic maps hypsometric. Also, images are presented with pictures to illustrate better the area that we handle. Sharr Mountains, seen from the aspect of bio-diversity pose the most interesting and comprehensive area throughout the territory of Kosovo. They incorporate in itself a world of vibrant, diverse and complex simultaneously represent a huge potential, and less used for economy.																			1314-2704						2011							367	+																WOS:000307366500051

Evidence of widespread natural reproduction by lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in the Michigan waters of Lake Huron	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Localized natural reproduction of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush in Lake Huron has occurred since the 1980s near Thunder Bay, Michigan. During 2004-2006, USGS spring and fall bottom trawl surveys captured 63 wild juvenile lake trout at depths ranging from 37-73 m at four of five ports in the Michigan waters of the main basin of Lake Huron, more than five times the total number captured in the previous 30-year history of the surveys. Relatively high catches of wild juvenile lake trout in bottom trawls during 2004-2006 suggest that natural reproduction by lake trout has increased and occurred throughout the Michigan waters of the main basin. Increased catches of wild juvenile lake trout in the USGS fall bottom trawl survey were coincident with a drastic decline in alewife abundance, but data were insufficient to determine what mechanism may be responsible for increased natural reproduction by lake trout. We recommend further monitoring of juvenile lake trout abundance and research into early life history of lake trout in Lake Huron.																			0380-1330					DEC	2007	33	4					917	921		10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[917:EOWNRB]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2007)33[917:EOWNRB]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000252473500016

While evidence has been found for the easily discernible faecal pellets of sheep and goats, recognition of cattle dung has proven to be considerably more difficult. In this study, we give an overview of evidence for dung remains in prehistoric wetland settlements in Germany, Switzerland and eastern France. Various methods for the analysis of uncharred dung remains are reviewed - analyses of plant macro-and microremains, micromorphology and palaeoparasitology - and are applied to two late Neolithic sites in Germany, Alleshausen-Taschenwiesen and Alleshausen-Grundwiesen. It will be shown that at Alleshausen-Taschenwiesen small ruminants were penned during the whole winter and fed on leaf hay unlike Alleshausen-Grundwiesen, where cattle browsed/grazed in the open during the day and were herded into the settlement during the night - both in summer and in winter.

J	Poole, KG; Heard, DC; Mowat, G				Poole, KG; Heard, DC; Mowat, G			Habitat use by woodland caribou near Takla Lake in central British Columbia	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) living in the mountainous areas of British Columbia are usually classified as either northern caribou, which spend much of the winter in low-elevation relatively young forests foraging primarily on terrestrial lichens, or mountain caribou, which winter in high-elevation old subalpine forests foraging exclusively on arboreal lichens. The forest-management practices necessary to conserve caribou differ substantially between these two categories of animals with different life-history strategies. Because of this variability in winter-habitat use, information relating specifically to Takla Lake caribou was required for forest management. To provide this information, we radio-collared 15 female caribou in two subherds in the vicinity of Takla Lake and determined their distribution and movements between January 1996 and May 1998 in relation to topography and vegetation cover. Habitat selection was examined using a classified satellite image. At the landscape scale, Takla Lake caribou avoided low-elevation forests (presumably because of the associated high risk of predation from wolves (Canis lupus)), occupying small seasonally overlapping home ranges (mean 151 km(2)) at intermediate and high elevations. Within home ranges in all seasons, caribou were most often found in the forest but, relative to availability, they selected forests only during calving. When in the forest, caribou selected open hybrid white-Engelmann spruce (Picea glauca x Picea engelmannii) - subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) forests over lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and deciduous forests in all seasons except spring. Caribou selected open spruce-fir stands over dry and closed spruce-fir stands in all seasons except calving. We conclude that caribou feed primarily on arboreal lichens in winter, because the open spruce-fir forests that they use have moderate to high arboreal lichen abundance, deep snow, and few terrestrial lichens. Takla Lake caribou were not typical of either mountain or northern caribou, but as is typical of insular populations of any species, have adapted to the food, topography, and cover types available to them on their mountain islands in a sea of moose (Alces alces) and wolves.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				SEP	2000	78	9					1552	1561		10.1139/cjz-78-9-1552	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-78-9-1552													WOS:000089033600005
J	Schleiger, SL				Schleiger, SL			Fish health assessment index study of four reservoirs in west-central Georgia	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												I investigated differences in a modified fish health assessment index (FHAI) among reservoirs, sections of reservoir (lower, middle, and upper), periods (summer 2000, winter 2001, summer 2001, and winter 2002), and species (bluegill Lepomis machrochirus and largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides) in four west-central Georgia Piedmont reservoirs to explore the feasibility of adapting the FHAI in Georgia as an addendum to agency-standardized sampling protocols for identifying problem reservoirs and problem areas in reservoirs. Mean fish health varied significantly over time across reservoirs, sections of reservoirs, and species. Lakewide sampling was necessary to adequately characterize overall reservoir health. Fish health of both species responded similarly to poorer areas; however, fewer bluegills than largemouth bass per sample achieved the same level of precision. The collection of 45 fish lakewide of each species per sampling period yielded a precision level approaching 20-25% of the true fish health mean for largemouth bass and 15-20% for bluegills; these precision levels had a 1 in 20 chance of being incorrect. Largemouth bass fish health in the upper section of West Point Reservoir was significantly poorer than that in all other reservoirs studied. The top six metrics that correlated most to fish health scores were nearly the same for both species (abnormal kidneys, livers, pseudobranchs, gills, thymuses, and spleens for largemouth bass and pseudobranchs, kidneys, spleens, livers, thymuses, and eyes for bluegills). Period-to-period variability precludes same-site comparisons over time; however, the FHAI appears to be useful in identifying consistently poorer areas in need of further study.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				NOV	2004	24	4					1173	1188		10.1577/M03-084.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M03-084.1													WOS:000226080800007

Age-0 Arctic grayling grew faster in the watershed with numerous lakes (eight) than in the watershed with only one lake. The presence of lakes along the stream courses in both watersheds decreased stream temperatures in the spring but increased temperatures in summer. The size of substrates was greater in streams below lakes than in inlet stream reaches. Growth rates of discrete populations of age-0 Arctic grayling were positively related to stream temperature. No relationship between fish growth rate and the biomass of invertebrate drift was apparent. We conclude that the summer increase in stream temperatures attributable to the presence of lakes resulted in increased growth of Arctic grayling in the watershed with numerous lakes. A simulation model of the temperature-dependent growth of age-0 Arctic grayling indicated that the abundance of lakes in one of the watersheds enhanced the potential production of Arctic grayling almost sixfold.

J	VECCHIONE, M				VECCHIONE, M			VARIABILITY IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF LATE-STAGE OYSTER LARVAE IN THE CALCASIEU ESTUARY	CONTRIBUTIONS IN MARINE SCIENCE												The Calcasieu Estuary is the largest body of water in southwest Louisiana and it has been subjected to substantial man-made perturbations. Oyster larvae (Crassostrea virginica) were collected in this estuary by net sampling over a four-year period to examine several scales of spatial and temporal variability. The dominant pattern in these data was high variability in replicate collections, perhaps indicating aggregation on a scale of tens of meters. Some patterns were discernible because a large data set was assembled. The highest concentrations of late-stage larvae tended to be near the mouth of the estuary. The larvae were rare in the West Cove area, which is hydrodynamically distinct from the rest of the estuary. Both the eastern part of Calcasieu Lake and the bayous of the upper Calcasieu Estuary appeared to be provided seasonally with a reasonable supply of larval oysters. The strongly bimodal seasonality (spring and autumn) of late-stage oyster larvae may be subject to interannual variability on a scale which is presently unpredictable.																			0082-3449					DEC	1987	30						77	90																WOS:A1987T249600007

Due to the high cost of NPDES permitting, nonchemical aquatic plant control methods are receiving renewed attention in California. Five case studies were evaluated to determine cost and implementation issues for alternative plant control methods in waters of the San Francisco Bay-Delta region. The primary case study examined control costs, operation, and endangered species permitting for mechanical shredding of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Additional case Studies examined control costs for the use of backhoe excavators, manually operated weed-trimmers, or grazing by goats (Capra hircus) to control submersed, emergent, or riparian vegetation. In the fall of 2003 and the spring of 2004, three types of shredding boats were operated on two representative sites. Two boats were operable in all conditions, provided there was sufficient water depth (> 0.3 to 0.6 m). A third boat was difficult to maneuver, could not chop large plants, and repeatedly got mired in dense vegetation. Treatment costs varied widely as a function of plant size. In the fall, costs in three of the four sites were greater than $4,000/hectare (ha). In the spring, treatment costs ranged from $477 to $2,146/ha, comparable to chemical herbicide application. Control costs also varied widely among the other case studies, ranging from $456/ha for goat grazing on riparian vegetation to $24,200/ha using manually operated weed-trimmers to control cattails (Typha latifola) and bulrush (Schpus acutus).

Adults and larvae were sampled in activity traps every week during March-October and every 2-3 weeks during November-February. The traps were emptied every 2 hrs during a 24-hr period. The diel locomotor activity of I. fenestratus was clearly nocturnal, except in the second half of July, for the males also in the first half of July, when surprisingly the population showed an arrhythmic activity pattern. The arrhythmicity is connected with the mating and egg-laying period of the species. The larvae were also nocturnal in the autumn, but showed arrhythmicity under the ice during the winter.																			0165-0424						2002	24	3					207	211		10.1076/aqin.24.3.207.8120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1076/aqin.24.3.207.8120													WOS:000177410900004

The prevalences of infection in birds were similar during seasons, whereas mean intensity and percentages of adult gravid females were higher in spring and summer, respectively. For fishes no seasonal differences were found in infection. Cormorant diet varied seasonally in relation to fish prey consumed and this can be related to seasonal differences in infection parameters of birds. The high infection in birds should be considered as a potential risk for salmoniculture.

Patterns of movement of adult northern pike (Esox lucius L.) in a regulated river	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH					Conference on Behaviour and Ecology of Freshwater Fish - Linking Ecology and Individual Behaviour	AUG 22-26, 2004	Silkeborg, DENMARK	Danish Inst Fisheries Res, Dept Inland Fisheries & Ecol Freshwater Fish				We performed a tagging study on one of the spawning populations of northern pike (Esox lucius L.) of the River Kajaaninjoki in Finland. Northern pike is the main predator in many lakes and rivers in the northern hemisphere. Previous tagging studies have shown a general tendency to sedentary behaviour by pike. Whether individuals in a fish population adapt a sedentary or moving strategy may affect population persistence. To study if the spawning population consists of sedentary or moving individuals and the pattern of movements, we tagged 40 pike with radio transmitters and followed them from May 2002 to June 2003. Pike were caught and tagged during the spawning season in the mouth of the River Kajaaninjoki which flows into one of the largest lakes in Finland, Lake Oulujarvi. Our results suggest that the pike spawning population consisted of sedentary pike (N = 16) dwelling the whole year in the river, and moving pike (N = 24) which moved to Lake Oulujarvi after the spawning period. Pike exhibited homing behaviour, as most of the migrating pike returned to the same spawning area in the following year. Large pike had a higher movement rate than small pike during the summer and seasonally the movement rate was lowest during the spring and highest during the summer.																			0906-6691	1600-0633				JUN	2006	15	2					154	160		10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00151.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0633.2006.00151.x													WOS:000238542100009

NEW LIGHT-WEIGHT STEREOSOPIC SPECTROMETRIC AIRBORNE IMAGING TECHNOLOGY FOR HIGH-RESOLUTION ENVIRONMENTAL REMOTE SENSING - CASE STUDIES IN WATER QUALITY MAPPING	ISPRS HANNOVER WORKSHOP 2013	International Archives of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences				International-Society-for-Photogrammetry-and-Remote-Sensing Hannover Workshop	MAY 21-24, 2013	Hannover, GERMANY	Int Soc Photogrammetry & Remote Sensing				A new Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) based light-weight spectrometric camera provides new possibilities for environmental remote sensing applications. The sensor collects spectral data cubes with adjustable spectral properties in a rectangular image format, and so stereoscopic data can be obtained by gathering images in block structures with overlapping images. The FPI camera thus enables stereoscopic, spectrometric remote sensing applications with light-weight, low-cost airborne imaging systems. Our objective is to investigate the processing and use of this new imaging technology in a water quality mapping. We carried out imaging campaigns over a small lake in summer and autumn 2012 using a light-weight unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) and a small manned airborne vehicle (MAV). We present the preliminary results of these campaigns.

However, the water exchange with the sea through the porous karst remains poorly understood. From 2020 to 2023, opportunistic temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and sea level measurements were conducted at various sites in and around ZO, including underwater caves, which are believed to facilitate the greatest exchange with the sea. Although tides in ZO are attenuated compared to the sea, tidal exchange influences the upper-layer lateral boundary temperatures. Moreover, the water that enters ZO has different effects in winter and summer and may alter hydrostatic stability depending on its salinity. Spectral analyses of water levels show that the karst between ZO and the sea acts as a natural filter, protecting against high-frequency water level fluctuations in the neighbouring sea. Fluctuations in dissolved oxygen and nutrients were also observed during the tidal cycle at locations with considerable subsurface exchange. However, more precise sampling strategies are needed to quantify the effects of ZO-sea exchange on ZO's biogeochemical properties. As anoxic overturn events become more frequent, further studies are essential to understand ZO's sensitivity to water exchange, particularly in the context of a changing climate that is expected to bring higher air temperatures, increased salinity, and more extreme precipitation in the Adriatic.					; Vilibic, Ivica/AAE-5160-2019; Bakran-Petricioli, Tatjana/AAU-3594-2020; ciglenecki, irena/N-8792-2013	Vilibic, Ivica/0000-0002-0753-5775; Petricioli, Donat/0000-0002-0150-9322; Dominovic, Iva/0000-0002-4931-6378; Bakran-Petricioli, Tatjana/0000-0002-3368-4248; Ciglenecki, Irena/0000-0002-1873-6193; 													0001-5113	1846-0453					2024	65	2					179	192		10.32582/aa.65.2.6	http://dx.doi.org/10.32582/aa.65.2.6													WOS:001379892900001

Desmid assemblies in Ponikve Lake (23 species) and Njivice Lake (12 species) were distinctly different in floristic composition, having only three species in common. Cosmarium moniliforme and Staurastrum tetracerum were dominant desmid taxa in Lake Ponikve, and Cosmarium cf. tenue and Staurastrum tetracerum I. trigona in Njivice Lake, all of which peaking in late summer to early autumn. In Ponikve Lake, desmids contributed up to 20% of total phytoplankton biomass. The lower desmid species diversity and biomass values in Njivice Lake compared to those in Ponikve Lake may be explained by industrial aluminium contamination in Njivice Lake since the 1980's.

This study evaluates agricultural nonpoint source nutrient pollution transport in a wetland-stream-lake complex in a mountain, tussock grassland catchment in the South Island, New Zealand. Flow and water-quality monitoring in the Lake Clearwater catchment during three flow events from May to August 2010 (autumn high flow, winter low flow, and winter high flow) showed high concentrations and exceedances of water quality guidelines for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) in small ephemeral streams draining agricultural land during high flows. Concentrations were attenuated through the wetlands to below guidelines, with the exception of TN which still remained slightly higher. Most TN was in the organic form above and below the wetland, suggesting N sources from animal waste/agricultural land and organic material and vegetation within the wetland. Most TP was particulate associated with suspended solids during high flows. Dissolved forms of N and P generally were below guidelines. Flows and loads (instantaneous and daily) increased at the lake outlet during winter high flow, indicating unaccounted sources to the lake from groundwater, the wetlands, or the lake sediments, and seasonal N saturation. Infiltration losses to shallow groundwater along the main perennial tributary likely re-appear as discharge to the wetlands and lake downstream. Surface-groundwater interactions play a dominant role in N transport to the wetland complex due to highly permeable soils and glacial alluvial deposits. Loads and unit loads of TN and TP were also elevated in the ephemeral streams. Results show that TN and TP concentrations and unit loads during high flows in ephemeral streams in this mountain grassland catchment are similar to, or higher than, values for impacted lowland pasture catchments. Although impacts to the wetland ecosystem have not been observed to date, the lake is shifting toward a mesotrophic state, and further research is needed to elucidate impacts of nutrient loads and help meet conservation and restoration goals.					; Sherratt, Michael/A-1175-2015	O'Sullivan, Aisling Dominique/0000-0002-1967-4166; Caruso, Brian S./0009-0007-8996-7160; 													0049-6979	1573-2932				OCT	2013	224	10							1695	10.1007/s11270-013-1695-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-013-1695-x													WOS:000326051700006

The chronology of the top 21 cm of the record was established using Pb-210 analysis using a constant-rate-of-supply model, and validated with Cs-137 measurements and the content of spheroidal carbonaceous particles. A tentative chronology for the lower part of the core was obtained through extrapolation of the sedimentation rates in the uppermost part of the record. Pollen assemblages in the record reflect regional changes in forestation and land-use patterns in the Upper Engadine valley and show no evidence of significant local human activity in the lake's catchment. Diatom assemblages record a distinct increase in planktonic taxa since the early 19th century, suggesting a decrease in the duration of ice-cover. In contrast, chironomid assemblages remained stable during a large part of the record. We applied an established chironomid-based July air temperature transfer function and a newly developed diatom-based spring air temperature transfer function to reconstruct past seasonal air temperature changes at Lej da la Tscheppa. The reconstructions indicate a diatom-inferred warming trend in spring temperatures during the past ca. 400 years, whereas chironomid-inferred summer temperatures suggest a slight cooling trend. These biota-based reconstructions are in good agreement with the centennial-scale temperature trend in an independent reconstruction of regional temperatures in the Upper Engadine region based on instrumental records and documentary proxy evidence from the Alps. Our results suggest that, in high-altitude lakes, independent chironomid- and diatom-based seasonal temperature reconstruction is possible and can be successfully used to track seasonal temperature trends.					; Bigler, Christian/C-4002-2008; Lotter, Andre/C-3477-2008; Heiri, Oliver/JCE-4598-2023; Lotter, Andre F./C-3477-2008	Heiri, Oliver/0000-0002-3957-5835; Lotter, Andre F./0000-0002-2954-8809; von Gunten, Lucien/0000-0003-0425-2881													0921-2728	1573-0417				APR	2008	39	3					283	299		10.1007/s10933-007-9103-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-007-9103-4													WOS:000254237500001

Diet of Invasive Adult White Perch (Morone americana) and their Effects on the Zooplankton Community in Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												White perch (Morone americana) became established in Missisquoi Bay, Lake Champlain in the mid 1990s. Since that time, cyanobacteria blooms have become common in summer. Although introduced planktivorous fish often impact plankton communities through a reduction in Daphnia density, such effects can be difficult to predict in an opportunistic species such as white perch. In this study, we examined the extent of zooplanktivory exhibited by adult white perch in Missisquoi Bay. Adult white perch were collected from Missisquoi Bay on ten dates in spring and summer of 2005. White perch diet consisted of large numbers of Daphnia on dates when Daphnia densities exceeded 20 individuals/L and when Daphnia comprised more than 50% of the zooplankton assemblage. When Daphnia densities were below these threshold values, adult white perch diet consisted predominantly of benthic prey. Our results show that white perch feed on large numbers of Daphnia in Missisquoi Bay and select Daphnia over other zooplankton taxa when they are abundant. It is likely that adult white perch grazing in Missisquoi Bay has contributed to a reduction in Daphnia density which in turn may be contributing to summertime cyanobacteria dominance in this bay.

However, long-term coverage and untimely recovery lead to a large amount of plastic residues in soils. This decomposes into smaller plastics over time, which can reduce sowing quality, destroy the soil structure, and have adverse effects on soil organisms. In this study, the seasonal variations and correlations of microplastics and cadmium (Cd) in Wuxi farmland soils of Taihu Lake, China, were investigated in the spring and winter. The microplastics were mainly in the form of films, fibers, and debris and were mainly transparent and black in color. Microplastic abundance reached 890 particles/kg soil, with the majority of microplastics (>72.5%) being 0-500 mu m. Polyethylene microplastics were the main polymers, accounting for >54.65%. In addition, the abundance of soil microplastics in the winter was significantly correlated with Cd, indicating that microplastics and heavy metals present a risk of coexposure to soil organisms. Furthermore, the response of in situ earthworms to microplastic-Cd pollution revealed that microplastics can be used as a vector to transfer heavy metals in the soil environment and may accumulate in the bodies of soil organisms. Multiomics techniques demonstrated bacterial community structure dysbiosis and metabolic changes of in situ earthworms under microplastic heavy metal-contaminated soils. The abundance of microplastics in earthworm casts and intestines was higher than that in the soil samples. These results reveal the potential risks from microplastics entering the soil environment and heavy metal pollution in soil ecosystems.

Microbial communities of the Laurentian Great Lakes reflect connectivity and local biogeochemistry	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The Laurentian Great Lakes are a vast, interconnected freshwater system spanning strong physicochemical gradients, thus constituting a powerful natural laboratory for addressing fundamental questions about microbial ecology and evolution. We present a comparative analysis of pelagic microbial communities across all five Laurentian Great Lakes, focusing on Bacterial and Archaeal picoplankton characterized via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We collected samples throughout the water column from the major basins of each lake in spring and summer over 2 years. Two oligotypes, classified as LD12 (Alphaproteobacteria) and acI-B1 (Actinobacteria), were among the most abundant in every sample. At the same time, microbial communities showed distinct patterns with depth during summer stratification. Deep hypolimnion samples were frequently dominated by a Chloroflexi oligotype that reached up to 19% relative abundance. Stratified surface communities differed between the colder, less productive upper lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron) and warmer, more productive lower lakes (Erie, Ontario), in part due to an Actinobacteria oligotype (acI-C2) that averaged 7.7% of sequences in the lower lakes but <0.2% in the upper lakes. Together, our findings suggest that both hydrologic connectivity and local selective pressures shape microbial communities in the Great Lakes and establish a framework for future investigations.

Environmental distribution of two widespread uncultured freshwater Euryarchaeota clades unveiled by specific primers and quantitative PCR	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS												Quantitative environmental distribution of two widely distributed uncultured freshwater Euryarchaeota with unknown functional role was explored by newly designed quantitative PCR primers targeting the 16S rRNA gene of clades Miscellaneous Euryarchaeota Group (MEG, containing the groups pMC2A384 and VALII/Eury4) and Deep-Sea Euryarchaeotal Groups (DSEG, targeting the cluster named VALIII containing the DHVE-3/DSEG, BC07-2A-27/DSEG-3 and DSEG-2 groups), respectively. The summer surface plankton of 28 lakes was analysed, and one additional dimictic deep alpine lake, Lake Redon, was temporally and vertically surveyed covering seasonal limnological variability. A trophic range between 0.2 and 5.2gl(-1) Chl a, and pH span from 3.8 to 9.5 was explored at altitudes between 632 and 2590m above sea level. The primers showed to be highly selective with c. 85% coverage and 100% specificity. Only pH significantly explained the changes observed in gene abundances and environment. In Lake Redon, DSEG bloomed in deep stratified waters both in summer and early spring, and MEG at intermediate depths during the ice-cover period. Overall, MEG and DSEG showed a differential ecological distribution although correlational analyses indicated lack of coupling of both Euryarchaeota with phytoplankton (chlorophyll a). However, an intriguing positive and significant relationship was found between DSEG and putative ammonia oxidizing thaumarchaeota.					; Casamayor, Emilio/A-3676-2010; Casamayor, Emilio O/A-3676-2010	Restrepo-Ortiz, Claudia Ximena/0000-0002-8314-2420; Casamayor, Emilio O/0000-0001-7074-3318													1758-2229					DEC	2013	5	6					861	867		10.1111/1758-2229.12088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.12088								24249295					WOS:000326891500010

We have investigated changes in lake diagenesis of Fe and P (1969-2009), with particular attention focused on vivianite formation with sediment depth (0-20 cm) in an iron-silica-carbon rich lake sediment (Ornso, Denmark). Porewaters were supersaturated for vivianite by two to five orders of magnitude (upper 10 cm) with porewater phosphate concentrations ranging between 0.69 and 10 mu mol l(-1), in winter, and summer concentrations ranging between 9.8 and 40 mu mol l(-1). Significant formation of vivianite was confirmed by X-ray diffraction while scanning electron microscopy and electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicated an increase in vivianite crystal size with depth (similar to 20 to similar to 70 mu m across). Variations in elemental composition of vivianite crystals in relation to at.% P and Fe were especially seen going from 9.5 cm to 24.5 cm. The total sediment Fe pool was very large similar to 3000 mu mol g(-1) and total P increased from 200 mu mol g(-1) to 400 mu mol g(-1) descending down the sediment profile. Differential extraction experiments of P release at pH 3 estimated that vivianite amounts to between 3 and 5% of the total Fe pool. The total P burial fluxes estimate that similar to 38 mu mol cm(-2) yr(-1) or similar to 26% of sedimentary P in the lower sediments is sequestered as vivianite. There are seasonal variations in the porewater composition with lower Fe, orthophosphate and higher sulfate concentrations during winter (5 degrees C), than during summer (15 degrees C). This suggests that temperature modulates the rate of organic matter degradation which in turns affects the rate of Fe(III) phase reduction, release of phosphate, and thereby the porewater Fe2+ and orthophosphate concentrations and hence vivianite formation. This work highlights the role vivianite can play for P retention in a Si-Fe-C rich lake sediment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Supersaturation of calcium carbonate up to a calcite saturation index of about 20 in spring and summer was observed, together with a diminution of the concentration of dissolved organic matter, in particular humic substances (HS). These results suggested an adsorption between organic matter and calcium carbonate which should influence the growth of calcium carbonate crystals. A preferential removal of higher molecular weight HS was observed by gel permeation chromatography experiments.

In this study, we enhance the Snake River Planning Model (SRPM) by modeling the feedback loop between incidental recharge and surface water supply resulting from surface water and groundwater extraction for irrigation and provide a case study involving climate change impacts and management scenarios. The new System Dynamics-Snake River Planning Model (SD-SRPM) is calibrated to flow at Box Canyon Springs located along a major outlet of the East Snake Plain Aquifer. A calibration of the model to flow at Box Canyon Springs, based on historic diversions (1950-1995) resulted in an r(2) value of 0.74 and a validation (1996-2005) r(2) value of 0.60. After adding irrigation entities to the model an r(2) value of 0.91, 0.88, and 0.87 were maintained for modeled vs. observed (1991-2005) end-of-month reservoir content in Jackson Lake, Palisades, and American Falls, the three largest irrigation reservoirs in the system. The scenarios that compared the impacts of climate change were based on ensemble mean precipitation change scenarios and estimated changes to crop evapotranspiration (ET). Increased ET, despite increased precipitation, generally increased surface water shortages and discharge of springs. This study highlights the need to develop and implement models that integrate the human-natural system to understand the impacts of climate change.

Winter recreationists' perspectives on seasonal differences in the outdoor recreation setting	JOURNAL OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AND TOURISM-RESEARCH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												The relationship between the outdoor recreation setting and the recreation experience is of perennial interest to recreation researchers. However, few studies have investigated how seasonal setting attributes impact the outdoor recreation experience. During the winter season, outdoor recreation environments are materially transformed, most notably through cold air temperature and the addition of snow to the landscape. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to explore recreationists' perceptions of residence proximate winter recreation settings in relation to their behaviors and experiences. The study involved coding and thematically analyzing 28 semi-structured interviews from a larger investigation of winter recreationists living and recreating in the Salt Lake City, Utah region. The findings indicate that recreationists perceive many changes to the biophysical and social outdoor recreation settings during winter, and link these seasonal attributes to specific experiential outcomes and associated dimensions. These differences result in a distinct winter persona character whose dimensions are aesthetic, sensory, and material. The findings are displayed using six summary themes for winter settings. The key discovery is that seasonal changes to the recreation environment lead to a qualitatively different outdoor recreation experience. This study contributes to a gap in empirical knowledge about winter recreation that can inform man-agement, and opens the door to future research on the impacts of seasonality on recreation experience. Management implications: The study findings regarding the importance of winter aesthetics, the introduction of novelty, the expansion of terrain, increased solitude, altered wildlife experiences, and seasonal opportunities for adventure and challenge, suggest potential avenues for promoting park visitation. Managers could develop messaging about the novelty of visiting familiar places during winter, emphasize the opportunity to try new recreational activities, and experience the environment in a different way, highlight the special restorative quality of the winter setting, use these benefits in advocating for year-round funding to support these places.

J	Pelechata, A; Pelechaty, M; Pukacz, A				Pelechata, Aleksandra; Pelechaty, Mariusz; Pukacz, Andrzej			Winter temperature and shifts in phytoplankton assemblages in a small Chara-lake	AQUATIC BOTANY												The structure of phytoplankton was analyzed along four successive growing seasons in relation to environmental conditions following contrasting winters in a shallow, mesotrophic Chara-lake (Lake Jasne, western Poland). The 2008 and 2009 growing seasons followed mild winters, whilst these of 2010 and 2011, had severe winters. After mild winters, despite higher availability of nutrients in the lake water, phytoplankton was less numerous than after severe winters, as reflected in the total abundance and the abundance and biomass of Chrysophyceae. Moreover, water clarity was higher after mild than after severe winters (5.2 m versus 3.8 m, mean Secchi depths). Contrary to abundance, total phytoplankton biomass showed no differences between the studied periods. However, a greater biomass of Cyanoprokaryota, particularly Dolichospermum lemmermannii (Richter) Wacklin, Hoffmann et Komarek and Aphanothece clathrata W. et G.S. West., was observed after mild winters, possibly in response to greater nutrient availability. A. clathrata also had higher abundance after mild winters. Nutrient budget and solute content as well as color, clarity, and, to a lesser extent, temperature of water were explanatory variables. We postulate that extensive charophyte meadows may be a crucial factor to control the phytoplankton dynamics in Chara-lakes. Overwintering charophytes may reduce phytoplankton densities by modifying phytoplankton responses to nutrient concentrations, which are higher due to shorter and warmer winters induced by climate change.

J	Lauer, TE; Spacie, A				Lauer, TE; Spacie, A			Space as a limiting resource in freshwater systems:: competition between zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and freshwater sponges (Porifera)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Species interactions between two types of sessile benthic invertebrates, the zebra mussel ( Dreissena polymorpha) and freshwater sponges ( Porifera), were evaluated in Michigan City IN Harbor in southern Lake Michigan during 1996. The study objective was to define whether competition plays a role in structuring benthic communities using experimental techniques commonly employed in marine systems. Sponges were uninhibited by zebra mussel presence and overgrew zebra mussel shells on hard vertical substrata. In contrast, zebra mussels did not overgrow sponge colonies, but did show an ability to re-capture hard substrata if relinquished by the sponge. The negative affect of sponges on zebra mussels through overgrowth and recruitment suggests interactions that could eventually displace zebra mussels from these benthic communities. However, seasonal reduction of sponge biomass from autumn through winter appears to allow the zebra mussel a periodic respite from overgrowth, preventing exclusion of zebra mussels from the community and allowing these two taxa to co-exist.																			0018-8158					APR	2004	517	1-3					137	145		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000027342.31716.9a	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000027342.31716.9a													WOS:000221338200010

Model outputs of T and DO corroborate observations at five monitoring stations within the lake. Simulated results indicated annual cycles of turnovers and stratifications and different behaviors for the deep and shallow basins. For the simulated years, the deep basin was stratified in summer and winter, while the shallow basin was mostly mixed throughout the year. The lake heat budget indicates that during summer with a long retention time, the thermal structure of the lake is principally controlled by net radiation, latent, and sensible heat fluxes. For the rest of the year, the inflow (from the main tributary, the Des Hurons River) and outflow are the main drivers of the lake's thermal structure.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				OCT	2023	195	10							1198	10.1007/s10661-023-11744-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11744-2								37698733					WOS:001068204900002

Macrophyte Species Drive the Variation of Bacterioplankton Community Composition in a Shallow Freshwater Lake	APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Macrophytes play an important role in structuring aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we explored whether macrophyte species are involved in determining the bacterioplankton community composition (BCC) in shallow freshwater lakes. The BCC in field areas dominated by different macrophyte species in Taihu Lake, a large, shallow freshwater lake, was investigated over a 1-year period. Subsequently, microcosm experiments were conducted to determine if single species of different types of macrophytes in an isolated environment would alter the BCC. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), followed by cloning and sequence analysis of selected samples, was employed to analyze the BCC. The DGGE results of the field investigations indicated that the BCC changed significantly from season to season and that the presence of different macrophyte species resulted in lower BCC similarities in the summer and fall. LIBSHUFF analysis of selected clone libraries from the summer demonstrated different BCCs in the water column surrounding different macrophytes. Relative to the field observations, the microcosm studies indicated that the BCC differed more pronouncedly when associated with different species of macrophytes, which was also supported by LIBSHUFF analysis of the selected clone libraries. Overall, this study suggested that macrophyte species might be an important factor in determining the composition of bacterial communities in this shallow freshwater lake and that the species-specific influence of macrophytes on BCC is variable with the season and distance.

Meanwhile, the shallow zone situated in the 0-3 m depth range, could be a sink for phosphorus during spring and a source during other seasons of the year. The total loading of phosphorus from the bottom sediments was over 950 kg year(-1) P, and 83% of this amount originated from the deeper part of the lake.

In fresh waters, they are represented by invasive PontoCaspian dreissenid mussels spreading throughout Europe and North America. They negatively affect globally threatened unionid mussels by fouling, which deteriorates their condition and survival. The appearance of quagga mussels ( D. rostriformis bugensis , QM) in areas occupied by zebra mussels ( Dreissena polymorpha , ZM) usually has led to the replacement of ZM by QM. We combined long-term field survey (Lake Balaton, Hungary) and experimental data to check differences in fouling of unionid mussels ( Unio tumidus and Sinanodonta woodiana ) by the two dreissenids, determine their mechanisms and predict environmental consequences of the species replacement. ZM fouled unionids evenly throughout the year, whereas QM exhibited high fluctuations, being common on unionid shells during their recruitment peak (summer), decreasing towards autumn and almost completely absent in spring. Such fluctuations did not occur on stony substrata. This pattern suggests that interspecific differences in fouling did not result from recruitment preferences, but from greater detachment of QM from unionid substratum, whereas ZM more often remained attached to their initial recruitment sites. This was supported by the results of the laboratory experiments, in which dreissenid mussels did not show any consistent preference or avoidance of unionid mussels. Whereas, QM attached less often than ZM to hard objects and showed a higher detachment rate. Furthermore, dreissenids increased detachment after substratum immersion into soft sediments, indicating their capability of coping with suffocation after the burrowing of the living substratum or its siltation. The observed pattern indicates that the replacement of ZM by QM in the dreissenid assemblage may reduce fouling pressure on unionids. On the other hand, unionids may become a refuge for ZM in habitats invaded by competitively superior QM.

Total pollen concentrations in dark layers show relatively high amounts. Conversely, concentrations in light layers are quite low and likely influenced by changes in transportation and deposition processes associated with atmospheric or oceanic conditions. The fossil pollen assemblages in dark layers of the PC-07 core show similar patterns to those of the terrestrial pollen record from Lake Biwa, whereas pollen depositions from northeastern Asia were likely higher during the glacial periods. Japanese vegetation is likely the primary pollen source at the PC-07 site, especially within dark layers during MIS 5 and 3, because the dominant pollen taxa in the core are Japanese cedar and Japanese beech, which are endemic tree species. We recognize two types of pollen compositions in dark layers of the PC-07 core during MIS 5 and 3: Cryptomeria-dominant dark layers (Cry-DL) and temperate deciduous broadleaf-dominant dark layers (TDB-DL). The pollen record from the PC-07 core suggests that the regional climate conditions in western Japan were wet with a low seasonal contrast within Cry-DL during periods of smaller summer insolation and, in contrast, a relatively dry summer and dry winter within TDB-DL during periods of larger summer insolation.

Feeding intensity varied seasonally, being lowest in winter and highest in summer. Small, medium and large leeches preyed to the same extent on the several mollusc genera; this was true for both leech species. Qualitatively, the diet of both glossiphoniids was similar throughout the year. Snail genera were consumed in proportion to their relative abundance in the field. Quantitatively, Glossiphonia preyed more heavily on snails than did Helobdella. 3.

J	Traunspurger, W				Traunspurger, W			Distribution of benthic nematodes in the littoral of an oligotrophic lake (Konigssee, National Park Berchtesgaden, FRG)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Although nematodes are the most abundant and species richest organ isms in the benthos of aquatic ecosystems, little is known about their seasonal, bathy-metrical and vertical distribution in lakes. In this study, the spatial and temporal distribution of the nematode fauna of an alpine, oligotrophic lake was studied over a one-year period. In the littoral of Konigssee, nematodes comprise 78 % of the meiobenthic organisms, with a mean abundance of 2960 individuals/100 cm(2). Seasonal variation and differences between the depths examined (1 m, 2 m, 5 m and 10 m) however, were considerable. Minimum nematode abundances were recorded in winter and maximum values in the warmer months. The highest abundance with regard to water depth was recorded at 5 m and the lowest at 10 m. The fresh weight biomass ranged from 0.2 to 1.7 mg/100 cm(2) depending on the season and water depth. Rhabdolaimus terrestris was by far the most abundant of the 90 species found in the littoral. It was found predominantly in 2 m and 5 m depth, whereas the next most abundant species. Monhystera paludicola, prevailed at 10 m. About 3/5 of the nematodes were found in the upper 2 cm of the sediment and overall 90 % of all individuals in the first 5 cm. The remainder was found between 5 cm and 20 cm sediment depth. The proportion of nematodes in the top sediment layer was highest in spring and summer. Deposit-feeders were the most common feeding-type, followed by epistrate-feeders. The study shows that the structure of freeliving nematodes of an oligotrophic lake is very dependent on seasonal, bathymetric and vertical distribution. Hence, general conclusions and comparisons with other aquatic ecosystems should be done with caution.

When lake temperature was > 15-degrees-C, nutrients limited realized growth rates to half or less of potential growth. Nutrient limitation was obliterated in the fall by floods. Density stratification was not a prerequisite to nutrient limitation in spring. Both macro- and micronutrients were important in terms of frequency of experiments showing limitation and in terms of quantitative degree of limitation. Horizontal variability in the degree of limitation was absent; however, shallower sites showed more incidence of multiple nutrient limitation compared to a deep, near-dam site.

Water column CH4 concentrations showed spatial and temporal variability (range = 8-100 nM), and were supersaturated with respect to the atmosphere by a factor of 2-37. Rates of net water column CH4 production-oxidation were determined by in situ experiments, and were not found to be significantly different from zero. Fluxes across the sediment-water interface, determined by direct measurement using benthic chambers, varied from -0.1 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) to +16 mu mol m(-2) d(-1) (positive fluxes into water). Methane concentrations in the two perennial creeks feeding the bay varied annually (140-950 nM); these creeks were a significant CH4 source to the bay during winter. in addition, mass-balance calculations indicate a significant additional winter CH4 source, which is hypothesized to result from storm-related runoff from dairy farms adjacent to the bay. Systemwide CH4 budgets of the 16-km(2) inner hay indicate benthic production (110 mol d(-1)) and atmospheric (110 mol d(-1)) dominated during summer, while atmospheric evasion (160 mol d(-1)) and runoff from dairy farms (90 mol d(-1))dominated during winter.

The copepod Diaptomus gracilis and the cladoceran Daphnia hyalina were dominant both in the open lake and in each tube, but D. gracilis was relatively more abundant in the tubes than in the lake; D. hyalina, especially in spring and autumn, was more abundant in the lake than in the tubes. Several scarce species became relatively more abundant in the tubes than in the lake. These changes are more probably associated with reduced predation, especially by larvae of Chaoborus, than with artificially induced changes in the phytoplankton, changes only poorly correlated with changes in the zooplankton.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1976	6	3					241	251		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1976.tb01610.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1976.tb01610.x													WOS:A1976BU94900006

The results showed that CO2 was released to the atmosphere all the time and was less in autumn than in other seasons (P < 0.05). CH4 was also released to the atmosphere throughout the year but more in summer than other three seasons (P < 0.05). N2O flux was higher in autumn than other seasons (P < 0.05), and N2O was absorbed from the atmosphere mainly in summer. Moreover, correlation analysis illustrated that CO2 flux had significantly negative correlation with wind velocity (P < 0.05), whereas positive correlation with pH (P < 0.01) had been found. There was no significant correlation between CH4 (or N2O) flux and the measured environmental variables respectively (P > 0.05).Additionally, the annual fluxes of CO2, CH4 and N2O were 140.45 +/- 12.57 mg CO2<middle dot>m(-2) h(-1), 1.35 +/- 0.14 mg CH4<middle dot>m(-2) h(-1) and 34.34 +/- 11.64 mu g N2O<middle dot>m(-2) h(-1), respectively. When compared to other reservoirs worldwide, the CO2 and N2O fluxes from TGR were higher than those from boreal and temperate reservoirs, but much lower than those from tropical reservoirs. CH4 flux was lower than those from boreal, temperate and most tropical reservoirs. In our study, the surface area of the TGR emitted 1.42 x 10(6) t CO2, 1.19 x 10(4) t CH4 and 589.93 t N2O in a year. The total GWP was 17.68 t CO2-eq ha(-1 )yr(-1), of which CO2 flux was dominant (74.38%). Therefore, CO2 was the main contributor of GHGs fluxes in our study and thus future researches should focus on how to reduce CO2 fluxes from the surface of the TGR. TGR has a considerable contribution to regional GHG emissions.(c) 2020 Ecological Society of China. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Will Mississippi River diversions designed for coastal restoration cause harmful algal blooms?	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Large-scale river diversions have been proposed as a way to transport sediment to the deteriorating Mississippi River deltaic plain. These diversions would also transport immense nutrient loads to shallow receiving estuaries, including open water areas where there may be potential for blooms of toxin producing cyanobacteria. We examined environmental variables and cyanobacteria dynamics in the Lake Pontchartrain Estuary during the spring-summer period of two years: (a) 2011 when the system received a massive inflow of diverted Mississippi River water from the Bonnet Carre-Spillway, and (b) 2012 when no diversion occurred. Cluster analysis of 180 samples collected over the course of both years identified five distinct water types grouped according to salinity, temperature, clarity, bioavailable nutrients, and chlorophyll a. Three of these water types were unique to the 2011 diversion event. We found no evidence of immediate, direct cyanobacteria bloom stimulation by diverted nutrients in the "high phytoplankton biomass" cluster associated with the 2011 diversion. Substantial nitrate assimilation by non-harmful phytoplankton occurred as the plume of diverted freshwater traveled through the system that year. The "summer" cluster characterized by nitrogen-limited conditions and including data from both years was characterized by significantly greater cyanobacteria abundance than all other clusters. There was no difference in cyanobacteria abundance between years within the summer cluster. Microcystin levels detected suggested low probability of acute health risks for recreational waters and were not correlated to cyanobacteria abundance. Site-specific understanding of the following is needed to guide diversion management: (i) interannual phytoplankton community variability in non-diversion years, (ii) cyanobacteria inputs from local tributaries, (iii) interactions between plume physics, chemistry, and phytoplankton dynamics, (iv) internal phosphorus feedbacks that may indirectly link diversions to summer blooms, and (v) controls on cyanotoxin production.

About 75 % of the fish stock was removed (425 000 kg fish). The fish was mainly composed of bream and roach. In May 600000 young pikes (3-4 cm) were introduced. In May 1991 the water became very clear (Secchi depth 1.8 m) during a spring bloom of large Daphnia. Then the grazing by zooplankton was eight times higher than the primary production of algae and the total suspended matter concentration became very low. Compared to the situation before the fish reduction, the grazing had increased only slightly, while the primary production had decreased significantly in early spring. The fish stock reduction might have contributed to the reduction in primary production by a reduced internal nutrient load. The clear water period lasted six weeks. Daphnia disappeared in July due to food limitation, the algal biomass increased and the Secchi depth became 50 cm. Daphnia did not recover during summer, due to predation that was not caused by 0 + fish but by the mysid shrimp Neomysis integer. Neomysis could develop abundantly, because of the reduced biomass of the predator perch. The production of young fish had been low because of the cold spring weather. The cold weather was probably also responsible for the slow increase in density of macrophytes. After 1991, perch probably can control Neomysis. Due to lack of spawning places and shelter for 0 + pike, pike was probably not able to control the production of 0 + fish. In a lake of this scale, it will not be easy to get more than 50% coverage of macrophytes, which seems necessary to keep the algal biomass low by nutrient competition. Therefore, we expect also in the future a decrease in transparency in the summer. Locally, especially near Characeae, the water might stay clear.					van Nes, Egbert/F-2681-2011; Gulati, Ramesh/F-4943-2013	van Nes, Egbert/0000-0002-6345-104X; 													0018-8158					FEB 25	1994	275						31	42		10.1007/BF00026697	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00026697													WOS:A1994NB19800004

Traditionally, this is performed through hydrochemical and sanitary assessments, alongside phytoplankton composition analysis. This study aimed to assess the seasonal dynamics of microbial communities-both bacterioplankton and microeukaryotes including phytoplankton-in the Irkutsk Reservoir (IR), which is fed by the cold oligotrophic waters of Southern Baikal (SB). Using parallel metabarcoding of 16S and 18S rRNA gene fragments, we analyzed community composition during the open-water season and evaluated the ecological connectivity between these two freshwater systems. We demonstrated that seasonal changes in microeukaryotic communities were closely linked between SB and IR, with the greatest divergence observed in early summer and progressive convergence by autumn. Metabarcoding confirmed microscopy-based observations while providing higher taxonomic resolution and detecting otherwise overlooked groups. Bacterioplankton communities also exhibited seasonal variation and were shaped by environmental gradients and reservoir characteristics. Cyanobacteria peaked in SB in late summer but did not dominate communities, unlike in mesotrophic lowland reservoirs. These findings demonstrate the value of metabarcoding for freshwater monitoring and provide new insights into microbial community dynamics in river-reservoir systems influenced by oligotrophic lake inflow.

J	Carmack, E; Vagle, S; Pour, HK				Carmack, Eddy; Vagle, Svein; Pour, Homa Kheyrollah			Seasonal Temperature and Circulation Patterns in a Hybrid Polar Lake, Great Bear Lake, Canada	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE												Great Bear Lake (GBL) is the largest lake entirely within Canada and the largest polar-type lake in the world. It holds cultural and sustenance value to the Deline Got'ine. However, its baseline physical limnology and how this may be altered by climate warming and anthropogenic stressors have received little attention. To explore the roles that surface heat exchange, wind, seasonal ice cover, and thermodynamic constraints play in the seasonal progression of ventilation and stratification of GBL, we report data from two 2008-09 moorings, satellite-derived lake surface temperatures, and observations made in 1964. Three spatially constrained processes regulate seasonal patterns of ventilation and stratification. Mid-lake temperatures remain below the temperature of maximum density (TMDsurf = 3.98 degrees C) throughout the year. In this area, solar radiation drives vertical convection while cooling develops stratification. Waters along the perimeter of the lake and within its five major arms do rise above TMDsurf in summer and stratify. It follows that mixing between the inner and outer domains form water at TMDsurf to create a convergent sinking zone or thermal bar. Because TMD decreases with increasing pressure, ventilation in the deepest region of the lake (McTavish Arm, Z(max) = 446 m) requires wind-aided downwelling to force cold surface water to a depth where it lies closer to the local TMD, triggering thermobaric instability, which then drives full-depth ventilation. These patterns of ventilation and stratification constrain the availability of light and nutrients, therefore setting rates of biogeochemical processes, and regulating the lake's overall response to climate change. Plain Language Summary Great Bear Lake (GBL), crossed by the Arctic Circle, is the world's largest polar-type lake. It has three unique areas: the middle, where temperatures stay below 3.98 degrees C, with dense water sinking in summer and stratification occurring in winter; the five protected arms, where temperatures exceed 3.98 degrees C, creating stratification in both summer and winter, and interactions between the cooler main body and warmer arms form vertical barriers; and McTavish Arm, where depths reach 446 m show extra layering due to water compressibility, requiring wind convection for mixing. Our study examines these processes through comprehensive temperature data from 2008, 2009, and 1964, alongside satellite images, to understand the lake's ecology and response to climate change.																			2169-9003	2169-9011				SEP	2024	129	9							e2024JF007650	10.1029/2024JF007650	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024JF007650													WOS:001300007000001

Short cores were obtained from four lake basins in the southwestern Tengger using a hand-driven piston coring device. Proxies front these cores were supplemented by radiocarbon ages obtained from lake sediment cores, shoreline features and spring mound deposits. Together these records provide evidence of millennial-scale climate change events from the Pleistocene-Holocene transition to the present. Lake/wetland events, representing periods of more intensive summer monsoon, occur in the records at similar to12.7-11.6, similar to10.1, similar to9.3, similar to8.0, similar to5.4. similar to1.5, and similar to0.8 ka BP. They do suggest that century- to millennial-scale climatic cycles are characteristic of the Holocene in the southeastern Tengger Desert although the chronology must be considered extremely tentative.					; Fahu, Chen/B-2788-2011; Elston, Robert/LDF-9630-2024	Chen, Fahu/0000-0002-8874-1035; 													1001-6538	1861-9541				JUL	2003	48	14					1423	1429		10.1360/02wd0257	http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/02wd0257													WOS:000184463300005

Seasonal variability in turbidity currents in Lake Ohau, New Zealand, and their influence on sedimentation	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Layers of sediment that are deposited on the floor of Lake Ohau, New Zealand, offer a means to reconstruct past climate conditions in the Southern Hemisphere at subdecadal and annual resolution. A robust understanding of the modern physical processes that control the influx and dispersal of sediment in the lake is required to reconstruct climate from these sedimentary archives. In this study, water temperature and velocity measurements collected during 2012-13 were analysed to determine the primary physical processes that influence sediment transport in the lake. Sediment input from river inflow occurs throughout the year but exhibits strong seasonal variation. Large inflow events (Q>500m(3)s(-1)) that follow strong summer rainstorms trigger high-concentration turbidity currents, which are the main agents for sediment delivery and deposition. During winter, smaller turbidity currents also occur after rain events and contribute to annual sediment accumulation. In addition, large internal waves were observed during the summer and may influence sedimentation. In conclusion, several processes including river inflow, internal waves and convectively driven flows control sediment deposition and accumulation in the Lake Ohau system. We utilise these observations to establish a conceptual model to explain the observed infill stratigraphy in Lake Ohau and guide interpretation of the longer sedimentary record.

J	Layden, A; Merchant, C; MacCallum, S				Layden, Aisling; Merchant, Christopher; MacCallum, Stuart			Global climatology of surface water temperatures of large lakes by remote sensing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY												Lake surface water temperatures (LSWTs) of 246 globally distributed large lakes were derived from Along-Track Scanning Radiometers (ATSR) for the period 1991-2011. The climatological cycles of mean LSWT derived from these data quantify on a global scale the responses of large lakes' surface temperatures to the annual cycle of forcing by solar radiation and the ambient meteorological conditions. LSWT cycles reflect the twice annual peak in net solar radiation for lakes between 1 degrees S to 12 degrees N. For lakes without a lake-mean seasonal ice cover, LSWT extremes exceed air temperatures by 0.5-1.7 degrees C for maximum and 0.7-1.9 degrees C for minimum temperature. The summer maximum LSWTs of lakes from 25 degrees S to 35 degrees N show a linear decrease with increasing altitude; -3.76+/-0.17 degrees Ckm(-1) (R-adj(2) = 0.95), marginally lower than the corresponding air temperature decrease with altitude -4.15+/-0.24 degrees Ckm(-1) (R-adj(2) = 0.95). Lake altitude of tropical lakes account for 0.78-0.83 (R-adj(2)) of the variation in the March to June LSWT-air temperature differences, with differences decreasing by 1.9 degrees C as the altitude increases from 500 to 1800m above sea level (a.s.l.) We define an 'open water phase' as the length of time the lake-mean LSWT remains above 4 degrees C. There is a strong global correlation between the start and end of the lake-mean open water phase and the spring and fall 0 degrees C air temperature transition days, (R-adj(2) = 0.74 and 0.80, respectively), allowing for a good estimation of timing and length of the open water phase of lakes without LSWT observations. Lake depth, lake altitude and distance from coast further explain some of the inter-lake variation in the start and end of the open water phase.

Autumn destabilization of deep porewater CO2 store in a northern peatland driven by turbulent diffusion	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS												The CO2 stored in deep peat porewater is viewed as a fixed component of peatland C cycling. Here, the authors reveal a hitherto unknown hydro-physical process that results in sudden losses from this CO2 store every autumn. The deep porewater of northern peatlands stores large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2). This store is viewed as a stable feature in the peatland CO2 cycle. Here, we report large and rapid fluctuations in deep porewater CO2 concentration recurring every autumn over four consecutive years in a boreal peatland. Estimates of the vertical diffusion of heat indicate that CO2 diffusion occurs at the turbulent rather than molecular rate. The weakening of porewater thermal stratification in autumn likely increases turbulent diffusion, thus fostering a rapid diffusion of deeper porewater CO2 towards the surface where net losses occur. This phenomenon periodically decreases the peat porewater CO2 store by between 29 and 90 g C m(-2) throughout autumn, which is comparable to the peatland's annual C-sink. Our results establish the need to consider the role of turbulent diffusion in regularly destabilizing the CO2 store in peat porewater.					; Bishop, Kevin/C-7816-2012	Campeau, Audrey/0000-0002-9113-8915; Bishop, Kevin/0000-0002-8057-1051; Vachon, Dominic/0000-0003-1157-5240; Wallin, Marcus/0000-0002-3082-8728; Nilsson, mats/0000-0003-3765-6399														2041-1723				NOV 25	2021	12	1							6857	10.1038/s41467-021-27059-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27059-0								34824219					WOS:000722866700079

The 1st, a relatively dry regime, lasted from the mid-1880''s until the late 1930''s. This was followed by a relatively wet regime, which continues to the present. The analysis also indicates that the annual precipitation regime prior to the mid-1880''s was similar to the present regime. The change in precipitation may be the result of increased precipitation during spring and summer.

The in-lake conditions (high nutrient concentration, high water temperature) during the dry phase in summer stimulated an increase of phytoplankton abundance and supported cyanobacterial bloom development. An extremely high flood pulse altered the physical and chemical environment of the lake. Consequently, phytoplankton abundance was low with dominance of species characteristic for a mixed environment. Contrary to phytoplankton, abundance of periphytic algae reached its peak value under the conditions of flooding, with the predominance of diatoms with low to medium resistance to physical disturbance. Periphytic algal abundance was reduced during the dry phase in the conditions of high grazing pressure. The rapid increase in abundance of prostrate diatoms indicated the periphyton recovery. Altogether, flooding dynamics appeared as the most influential cause of dominance and abundance changes of phytoplankton. In the same time, periphytic algae were found to benefit from the environmental changes caused by flooding. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate a variety of factors important for controlling periphytic algal development in complex and dynamic ecosystems like temperate floodplains.

J	VanDeelen, TR; Pregitzer, KS; Haufler, JB				VanDeelen, TR; Pregitzer, KS; Haufler, JB			A comparison of presettlement and present-day forests in two northern Michigan deer yards	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Deer yards are wintering areas used by white-tailed deer in the northern part of their range. In northern Michigan, deer yards typically consist of extensive stands of cedar-dominated (Thuja occidentalis) or mixed conifer swamps where thick evergreen overstories provide shelter from winter conditions. Forest and wildlife management in and around cedar-dominated swamps of the upper Great Lakes have created a nearly optimal interspersion of early-seral summer range and mature conifer winter range. For a variety of reasons which include favorable habitat changes, deer populations are today larger than those of presettlement conditions. We used General Land Office survey records from the 1840s to compare presettlement forest composition with present-day forest composition in two important deer yarding areas in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Except for tamarack (Larix laricina), woody plant species that are unpalatable to deer or tolerant of browsing have increased. Species that are palatable and intolerant of browsing have decreased. Ages of extant mature cedars indicate establishment during a period of low deer populations in Michigan. Change in forest composition has many causes, but deer populations encouraged by forest and wildlife management may contribute to a changing ecology in northern Michigan's conifer swamp communities, and may change the structure of plant communities in areas where deer use is concentrated.

Deposition of Stephanodiscus taxa and small Cyclotella taxa was much higher after late ice out and a deep, short lake mixing period in spring 2013, compared to that after gradual warming and lengthy lake mixing periods in spring 2012 and 2014, when only brief or marginal ice cover occurred. Availability of dissolved Si and P was 33 and 20 % higher, respectively, in 2013 compared to 2014. The observed relation between high (low) diatom deposition and short (lengthy) mixing duration in spring was applied to varved sediments deposited between AD 1924 and 2008. Low detrital Si content in trapped material and a sediment core enabled use of A mu XRF-counts of Si as a proxy for diatom silica. The spring mixing duration for 1951-2008 was derived from FLake-model calculations. The spring warming duration related to lake mixing was approximated from air temperatures for 1924-2008 using the dates when daily mean air temperature exceeded 5 A degrees C (start) and 10 A degrees C (end). Diatom silica deposition showed a significant (p < 0.0001) inverse linear relationship with the modeled spring mixing duration (R-2 = 0.36) and the spring warming duration (R-2 = 0.28). In both cases, the relationship is strengthened when data from the period of low diatom production (1987-2005) is excluded (R-2 = 0.59 and R-2 = 0.35). Part of this low diatom production is related to external nutrient supply that favored growth of cyanobacteria at the expense of diatoms. This approach shows that diatom Si deposition was strongly influenced by the availability of light and nutrients, related to the duration of lake mixing and warming in spring, during most of the studied period. The remaining unexplained variability, however, indicates that additional factors influence Si deposition. Further tests in other deep, temperate lakes are necessary to verify if this relation is a common feature and consequently, if diatom Si can be used as a proxy for spring mixing duration in such lakes.

E.			Heating up a cold subject: prospects for under-ice plankton research in lakes	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												Long-term patterns and drivers of ecosystem structure may be misunderstood if knowledge of an ecosystem is derived primarily from a single season, a situation common in many temperate lakes where the role of winter has been less studied. In lakes, avoidance of winter research has been especially pronounced for those that experience winter ice, but critical ecological processes can take place under ice. Even when obscured by snow, ice transmitting as little as 2% incident light can allow relatively high rates of photosynthesis, and winter trophic interactions may have year-round repercussions. Here, we offer a suite of research questions that require attention, in order to build a mature understanding of seasonal plankton dynamics in lakes. Specifically, we ask freshwater ecologists to consider the extent to which abundance and nutrition of winter primary productivity supports consumers under the ice, reorganizes food webs, and how long the effects of winter trophic dynamics extend throughout the year. In addition, we recognize some critical gaps in knowledge about physical and biogeochemical conditions at the time of ice-off. Worldwide shortening in ice duration lends imperative to under-ice studies, in order to more fully understand changes in ecosystem structure and function that may already be underway.

Here we show reconstructions of the paleohydrology of the East Gobi Desert since the last interglacial using satellite images and digital elevation models (DEM) combined with detailed section analyses. Paleolakes with a total area of 15,500 km(2) during Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS 5) were identified. This expanded lake system was likely coupled to an 800-1000 km northward expansion of the humid region in East China, associated with much warmer winters. Humid climate across the Gobi Desert during MIS 5 likely resulted in a dustier MIS 4 over East Asia and the North Pacific. A second wet period characterized by an expanded, albeit smaller, lake area is dated to the mid-Holocene. Our results suggest that the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) might have been much weaker during MIS 3.

Citrus genotypes for screening comprised two autotetraploids and nine triploid hybrids of 'Lakeland' limequat (Citrus aurantifolia x Fortunella japonica) and their progenitors ('Lakeland' limequat, the autotetraploids 'Femminello' lemon (Citrus limon) and 'Giant Key' lime (C. aurantifolia), and the somatic hybrids 'Key' [also known as 'Mexican'] lime + 'Valencia' orange and 'Hamlin' orange + 'Femminello' lemon). 'Meiwa' kumquat (Fortunella crass folia) and 'Pineapple' sweet orange (C. sinensis) were used as known resistant and susceptible standards, respectively. Lesion number per inoculation site and bacterial population per lesion were recorded 15 to 19 days after inoculation. The assay was performed four times during a spring-summer-fall period under greenhouse conditions. Canker lesions were consistently produced by stomatal inoculation with 10(4) but not 10(3) CFU/ml. Susceptible and resistant genotypes were separated based on lesion number per inoculation site and bacterial population per lesion. Spearman's rank correlation analysis for lesion numbers on 15 genotypes common to all four assays showed significant correlations among the genotype rankings. Genotype rankings were also significantly correlated between the two bacterial population assays. Lesion number per inoculation site is sufficient for assessment of resistance of citrus genotypes to ACC without the necessity of conducting bacterial population assays. 'Lakeland' limequat is a promising seed parent for breeding acid citrus fruit that is resistant to ACC.

AHS-rich lake water was exposed to three treatments in summer and winter 2014: radiation with the full solar wavelength range, radiation with the > 320-nm solar wavelength range, and no solar radiation. Irradiation caused AHS-like peaks to shift to shorter wavelengths in the EEM contour plots, implying that AHS photodegradation caused the formation of lower-molecular-weight fractions or more simply structured components. Three components were identified from PARAFAC analyses: AHS-1 (excitation/emission wavelengths of maxima: < 252 and 315 nm/426 nm), AHS-2 (360 and 261 nm/489 nm), and AHS-3 (276 nm/403 nm). These components had different photosensitivities. AHS-1 was most sensitive to full solar radiation, while AHS-2 was most sensitive to > 320-nm radiation. More photodegradation of these components occurred in the summer than in the winter, indicating that photodegradation depended on light intensity. AHS-3 was photoresistant. The different characteristics of the components reflected the in situ dynamics of the components. The AHS-3 fluorescence intensity was positively correlated with the dissolved organic carbon concentration but the AHS-1 and AHS-2 fluorescence intensities were not. The EEM-PARAFAC method was found to be a good tool for tracing AHS-like materials in situ and in the laboratory.

Microcystins were recorded in 4 of 54 lakes in 1999 and 14 of 134 lakes in 2000, especially in eutrophic lakes but also in some dystrophic lakes and one oligotrophic. There was a satisfactory agreement between results obtained with different methods. The most likely microcystin- producers involved, as judged by microscopical examination, were Planktothrix agardhii, Microcystis aeruginosa, and Anabaena lemmermannii. One drinking-water reservoir and several lakes used for irrigation were microcystin- positive. Microcystins were also detected in late autumn samples from some eutrophic lakes.

The distribution of the diatom Cyclotella comensis in Ontario (Canada) lakes	NOVA HEDWIGIA												The ecology of the diatom Cyclotella comensis Grunow is poorly understood in Canadian waters, yet this taxon is important in a variety of paleolimnological studies. We investigated the distribution of C. comensis in the surface sediments of 101 oligotrophic to eutrophic (TP = 4-54 mu g/l, TN = 200-927 mu g/l), alkaline (alkalinity = 28-261 mg/1) lakes in Ontario, Canada. Four common morphotypes were present in our study area, but the ecological distributions of the morphs were not very different in our lake set: The, relative abundances of all C. comensis in surface lake sediments were linearly correlated with epilimnetic spring alkalinity (Pearson correlation r = + 0.37, Bonferroni adjusted probability p < 0.05, n = 101) and spring total phosphonis concentrations (r =- 0.36, p < 0.05, n = 101). Cyclotella comensis was more common in oligo-mesotiophic (TP < 20 mu g/1) and relatively alkaline (> 80 mg/1; pH > 8.2) lakes in our study region. Cyclotella comensis was also particularly abundant in polymictic lakes with high summer Si:TP levels (> 150).					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Werner, Petra/0000-0003-1418-4560; 													0029-5035	2363-7188					2006				130			373	391																WOS:000239016300026

Despite that, a number of works report stormwater ponds serving as habitats for a variety of biota. In this study we aimed to examine phytoplankton communities of urban ponds, as the basis of the aquatic food web, and compare them to those of natural shallow lakes. Stormwater ponds were selected from two distant geographic locations: three in Denmark and three in Canada. As a reference to natural systems, three Danish shallow lakes were sampled. The sampling was carried out in the spring, summer and fall of 2014. The phytoplankton communities in ponds were found to be at least as rich in taxa as natural shallow lakes. Their abundance and biovolume varied highly among the types of water bodies as well as in each pond or lake individually, depending on the sampling month. We did not find any significant differences among ponds and natural shallow lakes at the investigated taxonomic level, despite some distinction observed by multivariate DCA and CCA analyses. Little difference was found between Canadian and Danish ponds as well, even though they are separated by a large geographic distance. This study shows that stormwater ponds are habitats for diverse planktonic algae communities which have some similarities to those of natural shallow lakes. Also, the similarities observed between Danish and Canadian ponds indicate some consistence with the urban homogenization hypothesis, although this should be further looked into by future works examining a larger number and distinct types of ponds.

For the purpose of holding interannual and seasonal monitoring of the hypersaline lake Adzhi-Baichi, located on the western coast of the Crimean peninsula in the arid climate zone, we studied the change in air and water temperatures, as well as the hydrochemical parameters of brine and the dynamics of the Artemia population Artemia salina in 2017-2020. The established general trends are expressed in an increase in air and water temperature in the summer period with maximum values in July-September (above +30 degrees C), which was accompanied by an increase in reservoir salinity and a decrease in the oxygen content. Fluctuations in the pH and values of the redox potential Eh were less pronounced. The maximum brine salinity (more than 350 parts per thousand) was noted in 2017, the minimum oxygen content (0.7-1.0 mg/L) occurred in 2020, and the lowest Eh values (-78.5 mV) were found in 2019. Crustacean cysts were found in all of the studied periods during the year. Nauplii appeared in March-April at a water temperature of +3 horizontal ellipsis +7 degrees C; adults were found in the summer months and at the beginning of autumn. In summer, at high water temperature and salinity but a low oxygen content, a crustacean die-off occurred. The results reflect the characteristics of the influence of climatic and anthropogenic factors on the ecosystem of the hypersaline lake and can serve as a model for the prediction of possible scenarios of the impact of climate change on inland waterbodies and can be useful for an understanding of the processes of transformation of aquatic ecosystems in arid zones located in a region of intense anthropogenic influence, as well as the development of measures for their protection and the rational use of resources.

J	Scharbert, A; Borcherding, J				Scharbert, Andreas; Borcherding, Jost			Relationships of hydrology and life-history strategies on the spatio-temporal habitat utilisation of fish in European temperate river floodplains	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Floodplain inundation is considered as crucial for the recruitment of fish in lowland rivers, by either providing suitable spawning areas as well as breeding habitats for young-of-the-year fish (YOY), as well as for supporting species that exhibit different life history-strategies in order to be differently adapted to long term discharge patterns. Fish communities in a set of 38 waterbodies on the Lower Rhine floodplain, representing different long-term frequencies of inundation and differently affected by seasonal inundations, were sampled by means of electro fishing (point abundance sampling, total n = 42,701 points) over a four-year period in order to identify species-specific and life-history strategy related patterns of spatio-temporal floodplain habitat utilisation. For 18 species (total catch: n = 107,150), typically occurring in European lowland rivers and representing different ecological guilds, different responses towards seasonal inundations were found. YOY of most species closely associated to the periodic strategy (e.g., Abramis brama, Aspius aspius, Blicca bjoerkna) were highly abundant in frequently inundated waterbodies, provided these were subject to inundations occurring in spring and early summer and coincided with temperatures required for spawning. However, recruitment in these species was impaired or failed when no inundations in this time frame occurred, although adults were present. In contrast, most species associated to the opportunistic strategy (e.g., Gasterosteus aculeatus, Pseudorasbora parva, Leucaspius delineatus) had highest recruitment in waterbodies unaffected by inundations in this time frame, which had detrimental effects on these predominantly small sized species. Spatio-temporal floodplain habitat utilisation of YOY fish (most rheophilic species as well as eurytopics) is suggested to be size-related, since most fast growing periodic strategists left the floodplain at given connectivity at latest in winter and were then absent in the subsequent year. Smaller YOY fishes and all opportunistic species either remained in more isolated waterbodies, or dispersed from there across the floodplain to some degree during extensive winter floods. These findings suggest adaptations to the long-term hydrograph of large river systems, with flood-related recruitment patterns predominantly occurring in periodic strategists and low-flow recruitment strategies in opportunistic strategists and stagnophilic species. The results of this study point to the significance of hydrological transversal floodplain gradients that provide diverse communities and population maintenance of different life-history strategies, evidencing that fish communities within the floodplain act as indicators for the hydrological conditions.

The isotopic composition of carbon in the methane produced during incubation experiments was also studied. The ratio between methane produced by acetate fermentation and CO2/H-2 reduction was estimated from delta(13)C-DIC vs. DIC concentration profiles in sediment pore water using a mathematical model developed by LaZerte [LaZerte, 1981. The relationship between dissolved carbon dioxide and its stable isotope ratio in aquatic sediments. Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 45, 647-656]. It was found that in the spring acetate fermentation is dominant when about 65% of methane is produced by this reaction pathway, whereas in the autumn, over 90% of the methane results from CO2 reduction. delta(13)C of methane released during a 6-week incubation experiment with sediment taken in the autumn varied between - 70 to - 85% V-PDB, i.e., values typical of methane produced by CO2/H-2 reduction, in spite of methane oxidation evident from the low delta(13)C-CO2 values, thus confirming the results obtained by mathematical modelling.

Salt-Affected Soils of the Barguzin Depression	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												Factual materials on salt-affected soils in the Barguzin Depression (Buryat Republic) are generalized. A geomorphic map of the depression has been developed. The distribution of salt-affected soils and the specificity of salinization in different geomorphic regions are characterized. These soils tend to be developed within the low lacustrine-alluvial plain of the depression, on the floodplain of the Barguzin River and its tributaries. Smaller areas of salt-affected soils are found on the river terraces. They are virtually absent on ancient sandy ridged terraces (kuituns). The genesis and chemistry of soil salinization are mainly related to the discharge of slightly saline deep water along tectonic faults and fissures. An additional source of soil salinity is represented by surface water flows. The presence of permafrost preventing the leaching of salts and the cryoarid climate favoring the migration of salts toward the soil surface during the dry spring and early summer periods and during the soil freezing in the winter contribute to the soil salinization. Slightly saline hydromorphic solonchakous soils predominate among salt-affected soils of the depression; the portion of semihydromorphic saline soils is smaller. Automorphic saline soils rarely occur in the depression. Strongly saline soils solonchaks-are widespread within lacustrine depressions around salt lakes. Soils of the soda and sulfate salinization predominate. The content of chlorides is small; their increased amounts, as well as the presence of sulfates, are indicative of the discharge of dee ground water onto the surface. The soda type of salinization is also related to the discharge of deep stratal water with further transformation of salt solutions during freeze-thaw cycles. Under anaerobic conditions, the formation of soda is favored the processes of sulfate reduction.

However, experimental data to establish clear cause-and-effect relationships in naturally complex field conditions are scarce in aquatic environments. Here, we describe the design and performance of a unique outdoor enclosure facility used to simulate warming, increased nitrogen supply, and both factors combined in a littoral freshwater wetland dominated by common reed, Phragmites australis. The experimental system effectively simulated a 2.8 A degrees C climate warming scenario over an extended period, capturing the natural temperature variations in the wetland at diel and seasonal scales with only small deviations. Excess nitrogen supply enhanced nitrate concentrations especially in winter when it was associated with increased concentration of ammonium and dissolved organic carbon. Nitrogen also reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations, particularly in the summer. Importantly, by stimulating biological activity, warming enhanced the nitrogen uptake capacity of the wetland during the winter, emphasizing the need for multifactorial global change experiments that examine both warming and nitrogen loading in concert. Establishing similar experiments across broad environmental gradients holds great potential to provide robust assessments of the impacts of climate change on shallow aquatic ecosystems.

Macromolecules and bacteria were isolated from the same lake water sample, one taken in summer and one in winter. The decompositional changes of the DOM fraction were compared with respect to substance- and bacterial species-specific differences, and with respect to the action of photolysis and co-substrate supplementation. The metabolite patterns resulting from the simultaneous growth of the bacteria on the persistent DOM fraction and the labile co-substrate, glutamic acid were analyzed. The macromolecules differed in accessible components, and the bacteria degraded most effectively the DOM fraction of the parent lake water sample. Photolysis was the prerequisite for the reduction of the inaccessible bulk of the macromolecules. Glutamic acid enhanced the degradation of the macromolecules. The enhancement effect was impaired by the build up of waste products which balanced the losses of the DOM fraction. Three formation modes of refractory metabolites could be distinguished: formation of intensely UV absorbing small sized products which were poor in DOC during degradation of (1) the macromolecules of winter, and (2) of glutamic acid, and formation of (3) apparent high molecular weight substances from glutamic acid in cultures containing the macromolecules of summer which probably results from a stable linkage between the small sized metabolites of the amino acid and the DOM fraction.																			0036-7842					DEC 30	1985	47	1					27	44		10.1007/BF02538182	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02538182													WOS:A1985AXN8200004

The calculated determination coefficients, especially 0.588 for autumn 2004 and 0.767 for spring 2005, confirmed that the littoral sediment iron was correlated to overlying water phosphorus and iron. The results also confirmed that an adequate amount of variation in sediment characteristics can be explained by the pore water characteristics owing to the fact that they were statistically significant (p<0.01), except for LSTFe in the spring 2005. The results proved that the measured total filterable phosphorus and total iron concentration of the pore water have a more predictive value for phosphorus concentrations in the littoral sediment of Lake Mogan. In this study, it was also demonstrated that multiple regression equations constructed for one year could not be utilized to predict littoral sediment characteristics effectively in another year.					; Pulatsü, Serap/AAF-1648-2020; Arici, Yeliz/U-9757-2017; KOCABAŞ, Zahide/AAF-9795-2020; Topcu, Akasya/AAF-1769-2020	Pulatsu, Serap/0000-0001-5277-417X; KOCABAS, Zahide/0000-0002-0310-4062; 													1680-5593	1993-601X				DEC	2009	8	12					2750	2755																WOS:000271623400060

Evaluation of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) as biomonitors of mercury contamination in aquatic ecosystems	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Zebra mussels have invaded many lakes in the United States and could be a useful tool for monitoring responses of aquatic biota to changes in mercury loading. The goal of the present study was to evaluate zebra mussels for use as a biomonitor of mercury contamination by comparing zebra mussel mercury concentrations between a lake with only indirect atmospheric mercury contamination (Otisco Lake, NY, USA) and a lake that was directly contaminated by mercury discharges (Onondaga Lake, NY, USA). Zebra mussels were sampled in both the spring and fall of 2004 and 2005. Total mercury (THg) concentrations in zebra mussels were approximately seven times greater in Onondaga Lake than in Otisco Lake, and water column mercury concentrations differed by an order of magnitude between the two lakes. Seasonal differences resulted in significantly higher zebra mussel THg concentrations during the fall for both lakes. There was also significant variation among different sampling sites in Onondaga Lake. Mussel methylmercury concentrations averaged 53% of THg concentrations but were highly variable. Strong relationships between water column THg and zebra mussel THg suggest that zebra mussels are a good indicator of aquatic mercury concentrations and could be used as an effective biomonitor of mercury contamination in aquatic ecosystems.

J	WESTELL, CE				WESTELL, CE			AVAILABLE BROWSE FOLLOWING ASPEN LOGGING IN LOWER MICHIGAN	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Aspen has ceased to be a "weed-tree" in the Lake States and has become a valuable forest resource. Cut-over aspen areas are attractive to wildlife, especially deer. In 1952 a sample of over 500 aspen stands in Lower Michigan showed that 21% of the suckers in the w. part of the State and 42% in the e. portion were browsed. Data obtained by weighing aspen suckers from a series of 10 mil-acre plots showed that an area stocked with an average of 10,000 per acre is capable of producing 2400 lbs. of summer browse per acre per year when the average height of the reproduction is 4 ft. This would be equivalent to 343 deer days of browse. Summer and winter values are given for sucker heights ranging from 3.0 to 5.5 ft. The integration of forest and wildlife management plans could provide for a continuous supply of this food in areas where other browse spp. are deficient.

J	Davis, BAS; Brewer, S; Stevenson, AC; Guiot, J				Davis, BAS; Brewer, S; Stevenson, AC; Guiot, J		Data Contributors	The temperature of Europe during the Holocene reconstructed from pollen data	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												We present the first area-average time series reconstructions of warmest month, coldest month and mean annual surface air temperatures across Europe during the last 12,000 years. These series are based on quantitative pollen climate reconstructions from over 500 pollen sites assimilated using an innovative four-dimensional gridding procedure. This approach combines three-dimensional spatial gridding with a fourth dimension represented by time, allowing data from irregular time series to be 'focussed' onto a regular time step. We provide six regional reconstructed temperature time series as well as summary time series for the whole of Europe. The results suggest major spatial and seasonal differences in Holocene temperature trends within a remarkably balanced regional and annual energy budget. The traditional mid-Holocene thermal maximum is observed only over Northern Europe and principally during the summer. This warming was balanced by a mid-Holocene cooling over Southern Europe, whilst Central Europe occupied an intermediary position. Changes in annual mean temperatures for Europe as a whole suggest an almost linear increase in thermal budget up to 7800 BP, followed by stable conditions for the remainder of the Holocene. This early Holocene warming and later equilibrium has been mainly modulated by increasing winter temperatures in the west, which have continued to rise at a progressively decreasing rate up to the present day.

Phytoplankton and Macrophyte Response to Increased Phosphorus Availability Enhanced by Rainfall Quantity	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Rainfall patterns are becoming more extreme in the northeastern US and are expected to intensify with an increase in extreme precipitation events and a greater frequency of short-term drought. In Northwest Bay, an undeveloped, primarily forested sub-watershed of Lake George, NY, stream discharge and phosphorus loading in 2006 exceeded that of 2007 by more than 3-fold due to unusually heavy rainfall in 2006 and below average rainfall in 2007. The additional phosphorus loading to the open water positively influenced chlorophyll concentrations in 2006, while porewater soluble phosphorus significantly correlated to precipitation in both 2006 and 2007. The elevated porewater concentrations in early summer of 2006 provided a nutrient advantage that resulted in tissue phosphorus in 3 macrophyte species to more than double while no change in nitrogen or carbon was detected. It is believed that the heavy late spring/early summer rainfall in 2006 saturated soils creating additional stormwater run-off and increasing groundwater seepage that supplied ample phosphorus resulting in enhanced phytoplankton biomass and macrophyte uptake of phosphorus.																			1092-6194	1938-5307				JUN	2014	21	2					234	246		10.1656/045.021.0204	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/045.021.0204													WOS:000342488100006

Correlations of Northern Saw-whet Owl Aegolius acadicus calling indices from surveys in southern Wisconsin, USA, with owl and small mammal surveys in Manitoba, Canada, 1986-2006	ARDEA					4th World Owl Conference	OCT 31-NOV 04, 2007	Groningen, NETHERLANDS					The Northern Saw-whet Owl Aegolius acadicus (NSWO) can be found year-round on its North American breeding range, but considerable numbers migrate south in autumn, with banding data documenting migration movements over 1000 km. Although the timing and routes of migration are better known in eastern North America, there is some evidence of a general movement from Manitoba, Ontario and Minnesota around Lake Superior to Wisconsin, and then south and/or east. We examined NSWO calling indices from annual auditory surveys in Manitoba, Canada (1991-2006) and from another study site over 770 km southeast in Wisconsin, USA (1986-2007) for covariance as evidence of a spring migration in central North America. In Manitoba and Wisconsin, NSWO calling showed a consistent pattern of regular periodicity, with peak calling every 2-7 years (average 3-5). Likewise, NSWO prey (small mammal) abundance in southeastern Manitoba surveys (1986-2006) showed a periodicity of 2-7 years. NSWO calling, both in Manitoba and Wisconsin, covaried significantly with small mammal abundance in southeastern Manitoba. NSWO indices in Manitoba covaried nearly significantly with the same year in Wisconsin, and significantly with the lag year in Wisconsin suggesting a spring migration takes place in central North America that is influenced by prey availability. This study highlights the need for more extensive analyses of long-term data from owl and prey surveys and for spring owl migration banding to better understand NSWO migration in North America.

Previous researches were mainly focused on reconstructing effective moisture by multiproxy analyses of lake sediments. We carried out a series of experiments, including a transient climate evolution model, a lake energy balance model and a lake water balance model to simulate continuous Holocene effective moisture change represented by variability of virtual lake level in East and Central Asia. The virtual lake level, area, water depth and salinity are not equivalent to actual values, but we estimated relative changes of the regional effective moisture. We also explored the driving mechanisms of effective moisture change in different geographical regions. Our results indicated that gradually falling effective moisture during the Holocene in northern China was due to the combined effects of high lake evaporation caused by longwave and shortwave radiation, and low precipitation caused by reductions of summer solar insolation. A decline in effective moisture through the Holocene in the Tibetan Plateau and southern Central Asia resulted from decreased precipitation because of the weakening of the Asian summer monsoon. Increased precipitation induced by the strengthening of the westerly circulation contributed to the effective moisture rise during the Holocene in northern Central Asia.

It covers over 5000 km . The climate is transitional between the Mediterranean and dry Sahara climates. Rains come in winter and are sparse and highly variable. Summer temperatures are very high, even above 50[degree]C during sandstorms. Maps at a scale of 1/4,000,000 show the yearly isohyets of precipitation and January and July isotherms in Tripolitania. Insolation is intense, producing mirages and abundant violent whirlwinds. Soil profiles show sand horizons over hard gypsum. Water and air capacities indicate that even during the driest part of summer the soil, moisture is greater than field capacity at depths of a few decimeters. Water soluble salt contents of the profiles are tabulated. These are high. Soil water tension is plotted against depth and shows that at the height of summer drought the soil moisture of the entire profiles is at tensions greater than 15 atm. Only when the soils are at water contents greater than field capacity is soil water tension low enough to permit germination of even halophytes. The soil salts are derived not from the sea but from evaporation of water carried into the depression by wadis.

J	Zhang, JZ; Yan, Q				Zhang, Jinzhe; Yan, Qing			Elevated equilibrium line altitude over High Mountain Asia during the Last Interglacial	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												High Mountain Asia (HMA) was experiencing rapid climate change and significant glacier shrinkage in recent three decades, which has profound environmental and socioeconomic impacts on Asia. To better decipher the climate-glacier interaction, we examine climate change and the associated response of the Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) over HMA during the Last Interglacial (LIG), often viewed as a potential analogue for future warming world. Based on the bias-corrected model outputs from the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project Phase 4, we illustrate an overall warmer/wetter state over HMA in summer but colder/drier conditions in winter during the LIG relative to the preindustrial. In response to the modeled climate change, the ELA rises by similar to 466 +/- 124 m on average across HMA during the LIG relative to the preindustrial, with more intense increase in the northern parts. Moreover, our sensitivity analysis shows that air temperature change dominates the variation of ELA during the LIG, and climate change during the summer season plays the most important role compared with the other seasons. Additionally, we demonstrate that the modeled ELA change could be largely biased if the seasonality effect is not considered. Despite the lack of glacier deposits/sediments for the LIG, the elevated ELA is in accordance with the reconstructed summer warming and expanded ancient lakes. Our results may improve the understanding of glacier behavior over HMA during the LIG and shed light on glacier response to future warming.

A Wetter Arctic Coincident With Hemispheric Warming 8,000 Years Ago	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Arctic precipitation is predicted to increase this century, with dramatic consequences for high-latitude systems. Observations remain spatiotemporally limited, hampering determination of the forcings causing wetter Arctic conditions, although two mechanisms have been proposed: enhanced local evaporation and greater poleward atmospheric moisture transport. Here a subcentennial-resolution multiproxy lake sediment record from western Greenland sheds light on these mechanisms. Cool summers throughout the Northern Hemisphere and in western Greenland 9 to 8 ka are associated with aridity in this region, via reductions in local evaporation and in meridional moisture gradients, which suppressed poleward moisture transport. Summers became more humid starting 8.1 ka, mainly due to increased evaporation from warmer Arctic seas but also to increased poleward moisture transport caused by hemispheric warming. This record provides independent support for predictions of both enhanced local evaporation and increased poleward moisture transport causing wetter Arctic summers in step with global ocean and atmosphere warming. Plain Language Summary As the Arctic warms, it is getting wetter. This change can amplify warming worldwide by causing more plants to grow and decompose, releasing heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. Sparse modern weather records in the Arctic make it difficult to pinpoint the forces causing increased rainfall, but scientists are debating two theories: (1) More water evaporates from warm, ice-free Arctic seas, and then falls locally as precipitation, or (2) as Earth warms, humidity rises more at lower latitudes, creating an imbalance that draws moist air up into the drier Arctic. Our research turns to history for insights. We show that in western Greenland, summers became cooler and drier about 9,000 years ago, coinciding with a drop in moisture imported from lower latitudes. Then, around 8,000 years ago, the region warmed rapidly and summers got wetter. A rise in both local evaporation and incoming moisture from lower latitudes may have fueled this change, according to our interpretation of geologic records. Our study suggests that both processes may contribute to a future, wetter Arctic. In addition, we advance scientific inquiry by using a recently developed technique, analysis of the hydrogen isotopes of ancient precipitation, to examine prehistoric humidity and precipitation trends that previously eluded investigation.

The highest sedimentation rates, recorded in spring, decreased during summer by two orders of magnitude. Granulometric segregation of settling seston along the inflow zone was related to differentiation of phoshorus content. Smaller particles were richer in P, producing a gradient of increasing P concentrations in the settling material. A substantial loss of P from polyphosphate and various organic fractions was found after settlement of river suspensoids. Mechanisms of P losses are discussed and possibilities of P retention within the inflow zone are considered.

Radio telemetry was used to document the seasonal movements and identify important habitats of broad whitefish in a lake system in Canada's Northwest Territories. Radio transmitters were surgically implanted into 50 mature broad whitefish which were then relocated over a 16 month period. In the summer, broad whitefish used the shallow areas of the lakes and nearby riverine areas, presumably for feeding. In the autumn, fish migrated from the lakes into rivers where two spawning areas were identified. Following spawning, broad whitefish migrated back to the lakes to overwinter. These data provide the first comprehensive examination of the seasonal movements of the lacustrine form of this species. It is suggested that future management strategies for lower Mackenzie River system broad whitefish consider two units of conservation below that of the species level.																			1612-166X		978-3-510-47066-2				2013	64						91	107		10.1127/1612-166X/2013/0064-0010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/1612-166X/2013/0064-0010													WOS:000328231900008

Seasonal and Sex-specific mRNA Levels of Key Endocrine Genes in Adult Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens) from Lake Erie	MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY												To better understand the endocrine mechanisms that underlie sexually dimorphic growth (females grow faster) in yellow perch (Perca flavescens), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to measure pituitary, liver, and ovary mRNA levels of genes related to growth and reproduction-sex in this species. Adult perch were collected from Lake Erie and body mass, age, gonadosomatic index (I-G), hepatosomatic index (I-H), and gene expression for growth hormone (GH), prolactin, somatolactin, insulin-like growth factor Ib (IGF-Ib), estrogen receptor alpha (esr1), estrogen receptor beta a (esr2a), and aromatase (cyp19a1a) were measured. Females had higher body mass, I-H, and liver esr1 mRNA level than males, while males had higher liver IGF-Ib, liver esr2a, and liver cyp19a1a mRNA levels. In both sexes, season had a significant effect on GH and liver IGF-Ib mRNAs with higher levels occurring in spring, which also corresponded with higher liver cyp19a1a mRNA levels. For females, IG, liver esr1, and ovary cyp19a1a mRNA levels were higher in autumn than the spring, and ovary cyp19a1a mRNA levels showed a significant negative correlation with pituitary GH and liver IGF-Ib mRNA levels. The most significant (p <= 0.001) relationships across the parameters measured were positive correlations between liver IGF-Ib and esr2a mRNA levels and liver IGF-Ib and cyp19a1a mRNA levels. This study shows significant effects of season and sex on adult yellow perch endocrine physiology.

THE FIRST RECORDS OF SENECELLA SIBERICA VYSHKVARTZEVA 1994 (COPEPODA, CALANOIDA) IN LARGE NORILSK LAKES, PYASINA RIVER BASIN, CENTRAL SIBERIA	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The large, deep, freshwater Norilsk lakes (Lake Lama, Lake Sobachye, Lake Glubokoe and Lake Keta) are located beyond the Arctic Circle, at the northwestern edge of the Putorana Plateau. They underwent a Pleistocene boreal marine transgression. A relict of that transgression, Limnocalanus macrurus Sars 1863 (Copepoda, Calanoida), presently dominates the crustacean zooplankton of these lakes. Sympatric with the native relict species L. macrurus, Senecella siberica Vyshkvartzeva 1994, was found in our zooplankton samples taken from the deep parts of lakes Lama and Sobachye in the summer-autumn of 2014-2016. Sampling was performed using a Juday net hauled vertically from a depth of 15, 20(25/30) and/or 50 m to the surface. All Senecella specimens were older copepodites, mainly CIV stage in Lama and Sobachye lakes in August and CV in Sobachye Lake in September; their abundance was low (25-2000 ind. m(-2)). They inhabited the central deeper regions of the lakes, contributing up to 7-14% to the total wet biomass of net zooplankton in 0-20 and 0-50 m strata. Previous sporadic and rather superficial samplings in these lakes missed Senecella due to its deep locations, low abundance levels and the absence of both the oldest copepodites and adults in summer.

With manual interpretation of 150 remote sensing images of aerial surveys, vertical aerial photographs, Landsat MSS, TM, ETM and OLI, ALOS, and ASTER images, 19 GLOFs were captured/ inferred by focusing on icebergs and water levels, except two periods in the 1980 s and the 1990 s for which no image was available. This translates to the occurrence of the GLOF on average once ca. every 14 months. Many GLOFs occurred in late summer to early fall, with a few in late spring: but one GLOF was inferred to have occurred in wintertime. The causes of GLOFs were supposed to be heavy rainfalls, probably accompanied with rapid snow/ice melting by warm air temperatures, judging from the general weather condition over the laguna area. The latest two GLOFs (2016 & 2017) were very large, enough to have completely exposed the lake floor in the middle section. The GLOF of 2017 (Mar. 31) was registered in a hydrograph set up at Lower Rio Huemules. After this GLOF, the water level has become stable with a more or less continuous outlet stream along the glacier sidewall and there has been no GLOF to date. So probably the prospect of another GLOF has considerably diminished by now. As Glaciar Steffen receded about 6 km during this study period, the glacier has thinned accordingly, to which the water level adjusted with three distinctive relatively stable states while fluctuating frequently.					; Barcaza, Gonzalo/NNG-6074-2025	Dussaillant, Alejandro/0000-0002-7830-013X; 													1345-3807	1884-8044					2020	38						13	24		10.5331/bgr.20R01	http://dx.doi.org/10.5331/bgr.20R01													WOS:000616722300002

We investigated the diet of ruffes in the 4,654-ha St. Louis River estuary in May-October 1989-1990 and the feeding periodicity of ruffes in two adjacent habitats during five 24-h periods in summers 1990-1991. Ruffes were primarily benthophagous. Age-0 ruffes fed mostly on cladocerans and copepods in early summer and midge larvae (Chironomidae) in late summer and fall. Adult ruffes less than 12 cm fed mostly on midges and other macrobenthos but also consumed large numbers of microcrustaceans. Adult ruffes 12 cm and larger fed mostly on midges, burrowing mayflies Hexagenia spp., and caddisflies (Trichoptera). Ruffes consumed few fish eggs. Adult ruffes in deeper waters and all age-0 ruffes fed throughout the day as indicated by weight patterns of stomach contents. However, adult ruffes generally moved to shallower waters al night to feed most heavily. Results of this study indicate that ruffes will probably compete with other benthic-feeding fishes such as yellow perch Perca flavescens and trout-perch Percopsis omiscomaycus.					; Newman, Raymond/AAD-8343-2019; Ogle, Derek/AAT-2617-2020	Ogle, Derek/0000-0002-0370-9299; Newman, Raymond/0000-0002-1170-3217; 													0002-8487					MAY	1995	124	3					356	369		10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0356:DAFPOR>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0356:DAFPOR>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1995QW86900007

Starting from the daily periodicity of WBGT, this paper uses the Holt-Winters 24 h, and discusses the feasibility of its auto-correlation prediction. The prediction results were evaluated using the time series cross-validation method and RMSE. Two experiments were conducted with the dataset acquired by NCSCO and the self-collected Dongguan University of Technology dataset(DGUT-D). First, a preliminary experiment was conducted using NCSCO data to explore the feasibility of WBGT autocorrelation pre-diction, and then the DGUT-D was used to predict the 24-h WBGT of the Songshan Lake Campus of the Dongguan University of Technology (DGUT).																			0302-9743	1611-3349	978-981-97-0858-1; 978-981-97-0859-8				2024	14490						347	358		10.1007/978-981-97-0859-8_21	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-97-0859-8_21													WOS:001205993300021
J	Jenkins, A; Boorman, D; Renshaw, M				Jenkins, A; Boorman, D; Renshaw, M			The UK acid waters monitoring network: An assessment of chemistry data, 1988-93	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The current extent and distribution of acidified surface waters in the U.K. is assessed using data collected between 1988 and 1993 as part of the U.K. Acid Waters Monitoring Network (AWMN). The data have been collected against a background of constant S deposition across the U.K. throughout the monitoring period. 2. Surface waters with mean pH < 5.0 occur in south-west Scotland, south-east Northern Ireland, the Lake District and south-east England. In addition, sites with mean pH < 5.5 are found in central and north-east Scotland, the Pennines and north Wales. These areas receive, and have historically received, high levels of S deposition and xSO(4) is identified as the main contribution to non-marine acid anion concentrations. 3. Mean total oxidized nitrogen (TON) concentrations are > 10 mu eq l(-1) at ten of the twenty-two sites which are found in areas broadly corresponding to areas of high N deposition. The mean contribution of TON to total non-marine acid anion concentration is > 10% at sixteen sites and > 20% at six sites. Most sites, except for those with TON < 10 mu eq l(-1) and mainly located in north-west Scotland and Northern Ireland, demonstrate strong seasonality in TON concentrations and during autumn and winter instantaneous contributions of TON to total non-marine acid anions is up to 60%. This confirms the importance of N with respect to surface water acidification and strengthens the case for implementation of controls on future N emissions. 4. The data period is currently too short for rigorous trend analysis given the monthly/quarterly sampling frequency in streams/lakes, respectively. Nevertheless, increased SO4 and xSO(4) can be observed in the time series at sites in south-west Scotland and north Wales despite constant deposition to these areas. Similar trends are evident in longer-term more frequent data at two sites and may reflect hydrometeorological influences, especially the duration and intensity of hot and dry weather in summer which promotes mineralization of organic S.

Overall, ovoid ciliates were the most abundant component of the microzooplankton. Some species of rotifer were present for most of the year, their periods of abundance often shortlived and the species of episodic occurrence usually dominated the fauna briefly. During diel surveys in late summer and late winter the crustacean zooplankton was dominated by Calamoecia lucasi with Bosmina meridionalis and Ceriodaphnia dubia being less abundant. These species generally moved towards the surface at night but some life stages exhibited a modified reversed migration. Ovoid ciliates were mostly below the oxycline during the day, moving towards the surface only at night. In general rotifers exhibited a subdued vertical migration compared with crustaceans.																			0003-9136					JUN	1991	121	4					419	429																WOS:A1991GC47200003
J	Starr, G; Oberbauer, SF; Pop, EW				Starr, G; Oberbauer, SF; Pop, EW			Effects of lengthened growing season and soil warming on the phenology and physiology of Polygonum bistorta	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												The phenological and physiological responses of arctic tundra plant species are key to predicting their survival in a warmer climate. One of the consequences of a warmer climate in the Arctic will be a longer growing season. We examined the effects of lengthened growing season and soil warming on the widely distributed forb, Polygonum bistorta L. Three treatments were established near Toolik Lake, Alaska in 1995 and 1996: extended season, extended season with soil warming, and an unmanipulated control. The season was extended by removing the snow load in the spring and keeping the treatments free of snow in the autumn. The spring snow removal extended the snow-free period over that of controls by 8 d in 1995 and 24 d in 1996. As a result, the number of accumulated soil thaw days and consequently the depth of soil thaw increased on the treatment plots. Polygonum bistorta responded to the treatments by becoming active earlier and senescing earlier, resulting in a growth period of similar duration to that of the controls. Leaf size and leaf number were unaffected by the treatments, as were leaf photosynthetic assimilation rates and nutrient concentrations. The results indicate that internal constraints limit the response of this species to lengthened growing season, suggesting that it is a determinant or periodic species. With climate warming, this periodic growth will put P. bistorta at a competitive disadvantage relative to plants that can respond to lengthened growing season.					; Oberbauer, Steven/JNE-2672-2023	Starr, Gregory/0000-0002-7918-242X; 													1354-1013	1365-2486				MAR	2000	6	3					357	369		10.1046/j.1365-2486.2000.00316.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2486.2000.00316.x													WOS:000086198100010

Diluted bitumen weathered under warm or cold temperatures is equally toxic to freshwater fish	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												Canada is one of the main petroleum producers in the world. Through its oil sands exploitation, a viscous bitumen mixed with sand, water, and clay is being produced. This bitumen is so viscous that approximatively 20%-30% of diluent needs to be added to ease transportation, resulting in a mixture called diluted bitumen (dilbit). The transport of dilbit through North America comes with a potential risk for oil spills in freshwater ecosystems at any time of the year. In this study, a mesoscale spill tank was used to study dilbit spills in freshwater to understand the effect of cold (winter-like) vs. warmer (spring- and fall-like) water temperatures on its natural weathering and their toxicity to fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) embryos. Water samples were collected weekly during two consecutive 35-day experiments ran at either 2 or 15 degrees C. Each week, fish larvae were exposed for 7 days, and water analysis was performed. Chemical analysis showed that the volatile organic compound, total organic carbon, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations decreased in both experiments with time, while fish larvae exposed to both temperature settings yielded increased abnormalities, EROD activity, CYP1A, and glutathione S-transferase mRNA expression levels, and decreased heart rate. Importantly, there were no major differences between the temperature regimes on dilbit weathering, highlighting that if a spill occurs in colder waters, it would be equally toxic to organisms. This work provides new data on the potential risk of oil spill for use during response planning and modelling.

To identify the main forces that drive phytoplankton structure becomes a relevant tool to understand several knowledge gaps in the phytoplankton ecology domain, such as community succession, biological invasions and responses to disturbances. We used the morphological-based functional groups (MBFG) approach to investigate the influence of environmental conditions (physical and chemical factors), nutrient availability and spatial processes (habitat connection and species dispersal) in structuring microphytoplankton community in a subtropical hypereutrophic reservoir located in southern Brazil. Samples were taken quarterly, between February 2017 and December 2018. We used distance-based multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) to evaluate potential spatial and seasonal dissimilarities in the MBFG's biovolume, and variation partitioning approach (pRDA) to evaluate the role of environmental, nutrient availability and spatial components in explain the microphytoplankton community structure. We identified 16 microphytoplankton taxa, which were sorted into five MBFGs. Significant seasonal dissimilarities were observed in the MBFG's biovolume. Higher relative biovolume of potential harmful cyanobacteria (MBFG III) and alien dinoflagellates (MBFG V) was observed in summer and autumn/winter, respectively. Pure environmental component (composed by physical and chemical predictors insolation, precipitation, total dissolved solids, turbidity, water temperature, water transparency and wind intensity) explained 45% of the variance in the MBFG's biovolume, whereas pure nutrient availability component explained 7% and spatial component explained only 3% of the biotic variance. The results showed that the environmental factors - especially the seasonal-influenced ones - are more effective than nutrient availability and spatial processes in explaining the microphytoplankton community structure in this ecosystem. Our findings alert to the need to consider the variability of the environmental conditions (mainly those directly influenced by seasonality) in phytoplankton community structure in disturbed freshwater ecosystems prone to eutrophication events.					; Silva, Lorena/AAU-5405-2021; Petrucio, Mauricio/AAC-6232-2019; Schuster, Karling/JMP-9441-2023	Pinheiro Silva, Lorena/0000-0002-8010-9262; /0000-0003-2123-7560; Matthiensen, Alexandre/0000-0001-9630-2107; Petrucio, Mauricio/0000-0002-7242-9426; 													1442-9985	1442-9993				APR	2022	47	2					291	305		10.1111/aec.13110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aec.13110		SEP 2021											WOS:000695558200001

The phytoplankton community of Lake Ontario in 2008: Structure, biodiversity and long term changes	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The phytoplankton community of Lake Ontario was assessed during April, July and September 2008 as part of the Cooperative Science and Monitoring Initiative (CSMI) framework. Results were also compared with historic surveys that began in 1970. A total of 320 unique species were identified during 2008, the vast majority being considered 'rare' or 'less common'. The biomass was found to be, on average, 1.6 g m(-3) in spring, 3.0 g m(-3) in early summer and 2.4 g m(-3) in late summer with rare and less common species accounting for 60-80% of the total. Analysis of the size structure of the phytoplankton community combined with size fractionated primary productivity experiments revealed that one picoplankton (< 2 mm) species, Chroococcus dispersus var. minor, accounted for up to half of the observed primary productivity, despite contributing 1% or less to total biomass. Our results also showed that the lake was mesotrophic during the summer of 2008 (July and September) and that trophic state has fluctuated between hyper-eutrophic and ultra-oligotrophic since monitoring began in 1970. These findings demonstrate that the Lake Ontario ecosystem is continually changing and more frequent sampling is needed. A high level of taxonomic expertise is required for even the most basic assessments of the phytoplankton community structure and improved taxonomic training and implementation of standardized techniques are necessary.

The day and night acoustic surveys revealed majority of pelagic fish present in the upper 5 m of the water column. The highest gillnet catches of planktivorous fish in epipelagic waters were obtained in May and August. The lowest fish catches were recorded in April and October which resulted in significant positive correlation between the gillnet catch per unit effort and water temperature. The majority of captured fish were adults of three cyprinid species: roach Rutilus rutilus, bleak Alburnus alburnus and bream Abramis brama. In the early spring the food of the three species was diversified: bream consumed primarily cyclopoid copepods, bleak fed on terrestrial insects and gut content of pelagic roach consisted mainly of littoral food components algae and detritus. In the late spring and summer however, the diets of all three cyprinids were predominated by large cladocerans, thus proving the use of open water habitat abundant in this prey.					; Kubecka, Jan/A-8230-2011; Peterka, Jiří/C-7218-2014; Vasek, Mojmir/C-5839-2014; Prchalová, Marie/F-8664-2014; Cech, Martin/C-5797-2014; Prchalova, Marie/F-8664-2014	Peterka, Jiri/0000-0001-5935-4311; Kubecka, Jan/0000-0001-9203-4854; Vasek, Mojmir/0000-0001-6386-4015; Cech, Martin/0000-0003-1350-4286; Prchalova, Marie/0000-0001-5000-2918													0139-7893						2008	57	3					324	336																WOS:000259599200017

To assess the prevalence, incidence, and severity of these diseases in North Dakota, wheat samples were collected from spring wheat fields across the state in 2012, 2013, and 2014. Based on subcrown internode symptoms, a greater incidence and severity of CRR was observed in 2012 (warm and dry year) than in 2013 and 2014. Also, the Northwestern Glaciated Plains and Northwestern Great Plains ecoregions showed greater CRR incidence and severity compared with the Northern Glaciated Plains and Lake Agassiz Plains ecoregions in the state. B. sorokiniana and Fusarium species, including Fusarium acuminatum, Fusarium avenaceum, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium equiseti, Fusarium pseudograminearum, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium redolens, Fusarium sporotrichioides, and Fusarium solani were isolated and identified from the root and crown tissues of the wheat samples. B. sorokiniana was isolated more frequently than other fungal species in all sampled years and ecoregions of North Dakota. F. acuminatum, F. avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. equiseti, F. graminearum, F. pseudograminearum, and F. redolens were pathogenic causing infections on seedlings of the two wheat genotypes (ND652 and Alsen), whereas isolates of F. oxysporum and F. solani were nonpathogenic and considered as secondary invaders associated with the root and CR diseases. Evaluation of some spring wheat genotypes for reactions to one B. sorokiniana isolate at seedling and adult plant stages, and one F. culmorum isolate at the seedling stage, indicated that susceptibility to these pathogens varied among different wheat genotypes tested. This study provides useful information on fungal species associated with CRR and CR of wheat in North Dakota and on resistant/ susceptible reactions of some spring wheat lines to the different fungal isolates evaluated.																			0191-2917	1943-7692				NOV	2021	105	11					3564	3572		10.1094/PDIS-11-20-2412-RE	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-11-20-2412-RE								33646825					WOS:000756448800028

Comparisons of thermal cycles, light penetration, chemical distribution and productivity indicate that the lake had a greater productivity while meromictic, even though the seasonal accumulation of dissolved materials in the deep waters was greater during the holomictic period. Calculations showed that the stability due to chemical stratification was actually greater during the holomictic period, supporting the idea that in biogenic meromictic lakes circulation may be controlled more by thermal phenomena than by chemical stratification. Turbid inflows during winter tended to destory meromixis, but low transparencies due to algal blooms in summer tended to encourage it and may be the primary way by which biogenic meromictic lakes become permanently stratified.																			0024-3590	1939-5590					1977	22	4					667	686		10.4319/lo.1977.22.4.0667	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1977.22.4.0667													WOS:A1977DP82500007

The system recorded ice thickness and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), ultraviolet (UVB) radiation, and temperature at a range of depths in the water column. The data were accessed remotely at Davis Station (15 km distant) by telemetry. The remote sensing platform produced continuous quasi real-time data, enabling the development of accurate detailed models, e. g., ice heat budget models during seasonal melt out. The prototype system has the capacity for the addition of further instrumentation, for example, fluorimeters. Here we present an illustrative preliminary data set derived during the summer immediately prior to ice-cover break up and after winter redeployment of the platform.					; Crout, Neil/A-1369-2011	Crowe, John/0000-0002-5438-2169; Crout, Neil/0000-0001-7394-5070; Benford, Steve/0000-0001-8041-2520; Greenhalgh, Chris/0000-0003-3483-2422; Sumner, Mark/0000-0003-2536-6298; Palethorpe, Ben/0009-0008-6855-2537																		JUN	2004	2						191	201		10.4319/lom.2004.2.191	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lom.2004.2.191													WOS:000227420000005

The reed-belt adjacent to the lake was isolated with a 250 m long reinforced PVC-membrane equipped with a tunnel for transportation of water out of the wetland. Inputs, mainly from agricultural runoff, were measured at seven inlet stations. Calculations of retention show a substantial retention of suspended matter and residue on ignition, respectively 94 and 97% for the whole period 1994-96. Total phosphorus shows a mean value of 65%. The retention of orthophosphate was 85%. Nitrogen shows a lower retention rate, 44% for total nitrogen, somewhat lower for ammonia and somewhat higher for nitrate. For suspended matter/residue on ignition and for the phosphorus fractions, there was a high retention rate also during the winter period. For nitrogen, however, there was a significant reduction in the retention rare in the winter period. While in the summer period, 50-85% of the total nitrogen was held back this was down to 30% in the winter period. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Scott; Markgraf, Vera; Gaglioti, Benjamin V.; Jimenez-Moreno, Gonzalo			Modern pollen and climate calibration along an elevational gradient in northern Arizona, USA	PALYNOLOGY												Comparing the modern pollen - vegetation relationship with fossil pollen is critical to understanding and reconstructing former vegetation from sediment records. However, few studies have utilized this technique to determine former vegetation in the Southwest US, and fewer still have combined modern pollen - vegetation with detailed climate data. We present a series of paired modern pollen samples with climate data collected from a similar to 2300 m elevational transect of vegetation type sites along the Merriam Powell Environmental Gradient (MPEG) in northern Arizona. In general, Individual pollen percentages correspond to local vegetation types at sites below the alpine. The alpine site is the lone exception, where despite the lack of trees, Pinus pollen dominates. Pseudotsuga menziesii and Populus tremuloides pollen are limited primarily to the Mixed Conifer forest, while pollen of both Picea and Abies are found almost exclusively in Spruce-Fir and Subalpine Shrub vegetation types. Non-arboreal pollen types are found predominantly within the unforested areas. The pollen ratio Picea+Abies+Populus/Artemisia ratio is important in determining the upper treeline position, while the ratio Amaranthaceae + Shrubs/Pinus ratio tracks lower treeline. The PCA results show the dominant trend is related to the climatic-environmental-vegetation gradient due to elevation. As anticipated, warmer conditions are registered in lower vegetation types, with moister and cooler conditions in higher vegetation types, the latter strongly tied to higher rates of precipitation in spring and summer. Our data suggest that widespread establishment of Pinus ponderosa locally near the Holocene transition would take similar to 160 mm during spring and summer seasons. These data are used to compare modern pollen and vegetation and can be used to better understand fossil pollen records from the area.

The palsas upshore experienced raised summer soilwater levels and inundation during winter. The effects of these changed hydrological conditions on 5 palsas were monitored over a period of 5 years. All the palsas increased in height, from 14 to 43 cm, with a mean of 27 cm.

The morphological differences between members of spring and fall spawning populations of C. zenithicus in Lake Superior are no greater than those between geographically separate populations.

Taking advantage of three strategic meteorological stations, two installed at the shores and another on a floating platform located near the center of the reservoir, a detailed analysis of lake and land breeze occurrences during two years is presented in this study. The thermal gradient between the reservoir and the surroundings is the main driver for the breeze development and the meteorological stations placed in opposite sides of the reservoir allow to establish the criteria in order to detect lake and land breezes. The results showed more land breeze than lake breeze occurrences, in line with the more negative thermal gradient between shores and reservoir in the annual cycle. Lake breezes are more frequent in summer months during daytime and land breezes in turn are more frequent in winter months during night-time.

From January 2020, a "ten-year fishing ban" has been conducted in the Yangtze River and its affiliated lakes in China, which is an unprecedented and one of the most stringent biodiversity conservation plans in the World. However, there are still uncertainties about its restorative effect, because the river-lake isolation has not been properly addressed. To provide more references for the management of widespread sluice-controlled lakes, we constructed Ecopath models for three oxbow lakes under different management modes, compared the outputs, and manipulated through Ecosim simulations. The model comparison showed that, the lakes with longer protection, which only connected to the river in flood phase, were more developed but not more complex in ecological structure. Whereas year-round connected lake had also been simplified after the fishing ban: a 10 cm mesh net allowed small fish flowing in but restricted large fish wintering out, thus caused its biomass accumulation. According to the trophodynamic simulations, the maturity and complexity could be improved simultaneously when large individuals of river-lake migratory fish were removed from the system. Our results indicated a possible widespread food web simplification in sluice-controlled lakes of the middle and lower Yangtze floodplain during the "ten-year fishing ban", and we suggested that future seasonal connecting scheme should be aiming at driving large river-lake migratory species back to the river, including enlarging net mesh and increasing water discharge in autumn and winter. Our findings make new complements to seasonal connecting methods and may benefit the conservation of floodplain lakes worldwide.

Three samples per site were taken and mixed from the examined area, in spring 2005. The study area occupies 820 ha of the now-drained (1910), partially levelled, and continuously farmed Lake Askuris in Greece. The area, which is close to the village of Kalipefki (Longitude: 22 27' 22'' E; Latitude: 39 57' 39'' N) and to Mount Olympus, is elevated (1000m) with a Mediterranean climate of mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. In addition to clay content, the soils were chemically characterized using 22 soil chemical tests, including pH, total carbon and organic matter, total nitrogen, total sulphur, exchangeable cations, cation exchange capacity, organic and extractable phosphorus (P), and pseudo-total and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) extractable trace elements. All of the soil data were skewed, with population mean values higher than the median for clay percentage, cation exchange capacity, carbon/nitrogen ratio, exchangeable calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), DTPA iron (Fe), and total zinc (Zn). A geographic information system and kriging was used to prepare spatially explicit maps (at least two or three level of fertility) for the exchangeable basic cations, the trace elements, phosphorus, organic matter, total nitrogen (N), and total sulfur (S). It is expected these contemporary baseline data will assist the local community and farmers as they consider future nutrient management plans along with other land use options that could include re-flooding the lake bed.

J	Cottingham, KL; Narayan, L				Cottingham, Kathryn L.; Narayan, Lakshmi			Subsidy quantity and recipient community structure mediate plankton responses to autumn leaf drop	ECOSPHERE												Although ecologists appreciate the important contributions of cross-ecosystem subsidies to a variety of ecological processes, relatively little is known about the ability of detrital subsidies from temperate forests (e.g., leaves and leaf leachates) to stimulate plankton in freshwater lakes and ponds, especially immediately after leaves fall. We hypothesized that subsidy quantity interacts with zooplankton community structure to determine how phytoplankton and zooplankton respond to leaf additions, predicting that phytoplankton would peak at intermediate levels of leaf addition due to a tradeoff between increasing nutrients and decreasing light, while Daphnia would continue to increase due to their ability to exploit increased microbes. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated the amount of freshly-abscised sugar maple leaves added to artificial pond mesocosms with contrasting zooplankton community structures (with vs. without added Daphnia) in a factorial experiment and then monitored the responses of water chemistry, phytoplankton, and zooplankton to treatments over the next four weeks. Leaf additions increased total phosphorus (TP) concentrations but decreased pH, water clarity, and total nitrogen (TN) to TP ratios; the increases in TP and decreases in TN: TP were smaller in ponds with added Daphnia. Consistent with expectations, chlorophyll a increased following modest leaf additions in the ponds without Daphnia and decreased in response to the largest leaf addition in both zooplankton treatments, probably due to a lack of light. Daphnia increased with increasing leaf quantity in the+Daphnia ponds, as predicted. Surprisingly, the dominant copepods (mainly diaptomids) also increased with leaf quantity in the ponds without Daphnia. We conclude that modest leaf additions can stimulate phytoplankton and zooplankton in autumn, especially in small lakes and ponds surrounded by forest, and suggest that this "hot moment'' (sensu McClain et al. 2003) for cross-ecosystem studies be further evaluated in natural systems.

J	De Jager, NR; Houser, JN				De Jager, Nathan R.; Houser, Jeffrey N.			Variation in water-mediated connectivity influences patch distributions of total N, total P, and TN:TP ratios in the Upper Mississippi River, USA	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Floodplain rivers have been conceptualized as patchwork mosaics of hydrogeomorphic zones that differ in hydrological, physiochemical, and ecological conditions. However, few investigators have empirically examined the extent to which basic ecological properties of large rivers, such as nutrient concentrations, are patchily distributed or the relationship between such distributions and water-mediated connectivity. We used global and local measures of spatial autocorrelation in 5 reaches of the Upper Mississippi River from 1994-2008 in spring (higher discharge) and summer (lower discharge) to examine distributions of total N (TN), total P (TP), and TN:TP for evidence of patchiness. TN was distributed as discrete patches regardless of season, but the patches of TP and TN:TP were more distinct during summer low-flow than spring high-flow conditions. The occurrence of patches of low TN, high IT, and low TN:TP was highly predictable, generally occurring in backwater, low-velocity (0.1 m/s) environments. Patches of high TN, low TP, and high TN:TP were less common and less predictable, but were more likely to occur in channels with high current velocities (> 0.1 m/s) or in impounded areas with low current velocity, but adjacent to channel environments. These patch distributions are consistent with our current understanding of dominant mechanisms of riverine nutrient cycling and were generally consistent across 5 river reaches that spanned nearly the entire length of a large floodplain river. Watershed characteristics ultimately determine nutrient inputs to river systems, but our results support the idea that local geomorphic and hydraulic conditions influence spatial patterns of nutrient delivery and biochemical transformation and create a patchwork mosaic of nutrient distributions within large floodplain rivers.

The water level in Lake Urmia has decreased dramatically in recent years, due to drought, climate change, and the overuse of water resources for irrigation. This shrinking of the lake may affect local climate conditions, assuming that the lake itself affects the local climate. In this study, we quantified the lake's impact on the local climate by analyzing hourly time series of data on climate variables (temperature, vapor pressure, relative humidity, evaporation, and dewpoint temperature for all seasons, and local lake/land breezes in summer) for the period 1961-2016. For this, we compared high quality, long-term climate data obtained from Urmia and Saqez meteorological stations, located 30 km and 185 km from the lake center, respectively. We then investigated the effect of lake level decrease on the climate variables by dividing the data into periods 1961-1995 (normal lake level) and 1996-2016 (low lake level). The results showed that at Urmia station (close to the lake), climate parameters displayed fewer fluctuations and were evidently affected by Lake Urmia compared with those at Saqez station. The effects of the lake on the local climate increased with increasing temperature, with the most significant impact in summer and the least in winter. The results also indicated that, despite decreasing lake level, local climate conditions are still influenced by Lake Urmia, but to a lesser extent.					; Moshir Panahi, Davood/ABX-3021-2022; Kalantari, Zahra/ABI-7877-2022; Tajrishy, Massoud/ABE-6204-2020	Tajrishy, Massoud/0000-0001-9252-8213; Moshir Panahi, Davood/0000-0002-9351-9391; Mousavi, Hossein/0000-0002-7286-7282; Dehghanipour, Amirhossein/0000-0001-9646-769X; Kalantari, Zahra/0000-0002-7978-0040														2073-4441				AUG	2020	12	8							2153	10.3390/w12082153	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12082153													WOS:000565658100001

Results showed that there was an obvious increase in the temperature of the basin since 1987. Specifically in the mountainous area, the significantly increasing temperature in the summer and autumn seasons accelerated the melting rate of glaciers and caused glacial-lake burst. Sudden flood release occurred frequently. The frequency of glacial-lake outburst floods was 0.4 times/a during the period 1959-1986 and increased to 0.7 times/a during 1997-2006. Peak discharge also increased. There were seven floods with peak discharge over 4000 m(3)/s from 1959-2006, and three occurred after 1997. The increasing frequency and magnitude of glacial outburst floods mirrored the effect of climate warming on glaciers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Trin. ex Steud.) as the most widely distributed species. In many wetlands, P. australis plays a highly ambivalent role. On the one hand, in many wetlands it purifies wastewater, provides habitat for numerous species, and is a potentially valuable raw material, while on the other hand it is an invasive species which expands aggressively, prevents fishing, blocks ditches and waterways, and builds monospecies stands. This paper uses the eutrophic reed-swamp of Wuliangsuhai Lake in Inner Mongolia, northern China, as a case to present the multiple benefits of regular reed cutting. The reed area and aboveground biomass production are calculated based on field data. Combined with data about water and reed nutrient content, the impact of reed cutting on the lake nutrient budget (N and P) is investigated. Currently, at this lake around 100,000 tons of reed are harvested in winter annually, removing 16% and 8% of the total nitrogen and phosphorus influx, respectively. Harvesting all available winter reed could increase the nutrient removal rates to 48% and 24%, respectively. We also consider the effects of summer harvesting, in which reed biomass removal could overcompensate for the nutrient influx but could potentially reduce reed regrowth.

New paleoecological records (e.g., pollen, macrofossils) from the Italian Peninsula suggest a much wider climatic niche of the important European tree species Abies alba (silver fir) than observed in its present spatial range. To explore this discrepancy between current and past distribution of the species, we analyzed climatic data (temperature, precipitation, frost, humidity, sunshine) and vegetation-independent paleoclimatic reconstructions (e.g., lake levels, chironomids) and use global coupled carbon-cycle climate (NCAR CSM1.4) and dynamic vegetation (LandClim) modeling. The combined evidence suggests that during the mid-Holocene (similar to 6000 years ago), prior to humanization of vegetation, A. alba formed forests under conditions that exceeded the modern (1961-1990) upper temperature limit of the species by; similar to 5-7 degrees C (July means). Annual precipitation during this natural period was comparable to today (>700-800 mm), with drier summers and wetter winters. In the meso-Mediterranean to sub-Mediterranean forests A. alba co-occurred with thermophilous taxa such as Quercus ilex, Q. pubescens, Olea europaea, Phillyrea, Arbutus, Cistus, Tilia, Ulmus, Acer, Hedera helix, Ilex aquifolium, Taxus, and Vitis. Results from the last interglacial (ca. 130 000-115 000 BP), when human impact was negligible, corroborate the Holocene evidence. Thermophilous Mediterranean A. alba stands became extinct during the last 5000 years when land-use pressure and specifically excessive anthropogenic fire and browsing disturbance increased. Our results imply that the ecology of this key European tree species is not yet well understood. On the basis of the reconstructed realized climatic niche of the species, we anticipate that the future geographic range of A. alba may not contract regardless of migration success, even if climate should become significantly warmer than today with summer temperatures increasing by up to 5-7 degrees C, as long as precipitation does not fall below 700-800 mm/yr, and anthropogenic disturbance (e.g., fire, browsing) does not become excessive. Our finding contradicts recent studies that projected range contractions under global-warming scenarios, but did not factor how millennia of human impacts reduced the realized climatic niche of A. alba.

EFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON LOW-FLOW CONDITIONS IN THE RUSCOM RIVER WATERSHED, ONTARIO	TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE												The objective of the present study is to explore and project the effect of climate change on the low flows from the Ruscom River watershed in Ontario, Canada. The watershed is one of the subwatersheds draining into Lake St. Clair on the Canadian side of the Great Lakes system. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was implemented to simulate the hydrologic regime in the watershed. SWAT was calibrated and validated for the streamflow from the Ruscom River watershed using the observed monthly flow data. The LARS-WG weather generator was used for the generation of daily future weather data at local scale using the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) outputs under the SRES A2 scenario for the period 2041-2070. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and coefficient of determination (r(2)) for streamflow predictions using SWAT were found to be greater than 0.74. Under the projected climate scenario, the future mean monthly minimum and maximum temperatures by the year 2070 may be increased by 3.2 degrees C and 3.6 degrees C, respectively, compared to the temperatures in the base period (1961-1990). The average annual precipitation would also increase by 8%. SWAT-simulated flow duration curves indicated that low flows in the Ruscom River would be increased in spring but decreased in summer and fall due to the possible climate change conditions. Based on the frequency analysis, the annual minimum monthly flow of five-year return period could be reduced by as much as 50%.

Microplastics in Flathead Lake, a large oligotrophic mountain lake in the USA*	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Microplastics are contaminants that are closely associated with human activity and are often abundant even in remote areas. As the largest natural freshwater lake in the western USA, Flathead Lake is a suitable site to study microplastics in lakes in less-populated areas of North America. Our assessment of microplastics in lake surface water samples showed that microplastic densities and concentrations in Flathead Lake were similar to those in other lakes located in less-populated areas around the world, with densities ranging from 8.00 x 104 to 4.22 x 105 particles/km2 with a mean concentration of 1.89 x 105 particles/km2. Dry deposition rates for microplastics ranged from 4 to 140 particles/m2/day with an average of 69 particles/m2/day and were significantly higher in the fall. Microplastic concentrations in wet deposition ranged from 0.006 particles/mL to 0.050 particles/mL with highest concentrations in winter and lowest in summer. Fibrous microplastics were predominant in both lake water and atmospheric deposition. The high densities of microplastics in the sample sites located near the Flathead River inlet suggests that the river is an important source of microplastics to Flathead Lake. The high densities of microplastics and high proportions of non-fibrous microplastics near populated areas of the lake imply that local human activities also affect microplastics in Flathead Lake. Although the annual flux of microplastics in dry deposition was higher than that in wet deposition, the relatively modest difference suggests that precipitation might enhance the deposition of microplastics. The results of this study indicate that instituting increased control measures that target both reducing the microfibers generated by laundry and improving the overall level of plastic waste management in the watershed may help in controlling microplastic levels in Flathead Lake.

Impact assessment of some heavy metals on tilapia fish, Oreochromis niloticus, in Burullus Lake, Egypt	JOURNAL OF BASIC AND APPLIED ZOOLOGY												Background: Burullus Lake has received a great attention because of its environmental and economic importance for being a significant source of fish production in Egypt. It is subjected to many of environmental changes due to the huge amount of discharges originated from different sources as well as many human activities. The Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is an abundant sedentary fish present in the most Egyptian lakes, Nile River, and ponds. The study was designed to evaluate some metal pollution in Burullus Lake. Results: The values of heavy metals (Mn, Zn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Pb) were measured in lake water and muscles of O. niloticus fish during winter and summer 2014. Water samples were collected from six sampling sites, while fish samples were collected from the three sectors (eastern, middle, and western) of the lake. The mean values of heavy metals (Mn, Zn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Pb) in surface water of Burullus Lake during winter and summer for the year 2014 were 1.09, 10.50, 29.38, 6.87, 2.05, and 5.98 mu g/L, respectively, whereas the annual means of heavy metals (Mn, Zn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Pb) in the muscles of O. niloticus fish were 0.68, 4.70, 10.62, 0.52, 039, and 0.46 mu g/g wet wt, respectively. Conclusions: In lake water, Mn was the lowest concentration of the six sampling sites, while Fe was the highest concentration, whereas in fish muscles, Cu recorded the lowest concentration of the three sectors, while Fe was the highest concentration. The southern part of Burullus Lake had the highest heavy metal values as it influenced by the discharge of massive amounts of domestic sewage as well as agricultural and industrial effluents. The accumulation of heavy metals in fish muscles of the three sectors showed different patterns. Generally, the values of metals in the fish muscles were accepted by the international legislation limits and are safe for human consumption.

J	Ziernicka-Wojtaszek, A				Ziernicka-Wojtaszek, Agnieszka			Summer Drought in 2019 on Polish Territory-A Case Study	ATMOSPHERE												The summer 2019 drought in Poland, i.e., the warmest year in observation history, was characterized. Meteorological, agricultural, hydrological, and hydrogeological aspects were taken into account. Meteorological drought in the light of regionally differentiated days of low precipitation frequency lasted the longest, i.e., over 3 months in central-western Poland. In the period between June-August 2019, in the belt of South Baltic Lakes and Central Polish Lowlands, the lowest precipitation sums of 30-60% of the norm were recorded. The values of the climatic water balance (CWB) calculated by the Institute of Soil Science and Plant Cultivation (IUNG) method for individual months of June-August for the Polish area were -129, -64, and -53 mm, respectively. The most threatened were fruit bushes, spring cereals, maize for grain and silage, and leguminous plants. In central-western and south-western Poland, the drought accelerated the date of the lowest flows by two months on average from the turn of September and October to the turn of July and August. In the lowland belt, where the drought was the most intensive, the average monthly groundwater level, both of free and tight groundwater table, was lower than the monthly averages for the whole hydrological year.					; Ziernicka-Wojtaszek, Agnieszka/ABD-5532-2020	Ziernicka-Wojtaszek, Agnieszka/0000-0002-9928-1468; 														2073-4433				NOV	2021	12	11							1475	10.3390/atmos12111475	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/atmos12111475													WOS:000727719300001
J	Nolan, M; Brigham-Grette, J				Nolan, Matt; Brigham-Grette, Julie			Basic hydrology, limnology, and meteorology of modern Lake El'gygytgyn, Siberia	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A survey of the modern physical setting of Lake El'gygytgyn, northeastern Siberia, is presented here to facilitate interpretation of a 250,000-year climate record derived from sediment cores from the lake bottom. The lake lies inside a meteorite impact crater that is approximately 18 km in diameter, with a total watershed area of 293 km(2), 110 km(2) of which is lake surface. The only surface water entering the lake comes from the approximately 50 streams draining from within the crater rim; a numbering system for these inlet streams is adopted to facilitate scientific discussion. We created a digital elevation model for the watershed and used it to create hypsometries, channel networks, and drainage area statistics for each of the inlet streams. Many of the streams enter shallow lagoons dammed by gravel berms at the lakeshore; these lagoons may play a significant role in the thermal and biological dynamics of the lake due to their higher water temperatures (> 6 degrees C). The lake itself is approximately 12 km wide and 175 m deep, with a volume of 14.1 km(3). Water temperature within a column of water near the center of this oligotrophic, monomictic lake never exceeded 4 degrees C over a 2.5 year record, though the shallow shelves (< 10 m) surrounding the lake can reach 5 degrees C in summer. Though thermally stratified in winter, the water appears completely mixed shortly after lake ice breakup in July. Mean annual air temperature measured about 200 m from the lake was -10.3 degrees C in 2002, and an unshielded rain gage there recorded 70 mm of rain in summer of 2002. End of winter snow water equivalent on the lake was approximately 110 mm in May 2002. Analysis of NCEP reanalysis air temperatures (1948-2002) reveals that the 8 warmest years and 10 warmest winters have occurred since 1989, with the number of days below -30 degrees C dropping from a pre-1989 mean of 35 to near 0 in recent years. The crater region is windy as well as cold, with hourly wind speeds exceeding 13.4 m s(-1) (30 mph) typically at least once each month and 17.8 m s(-1) (40 mph) in winter months, with only a few calm days per month; wind may also play an important role in controlling the modern shape of the lake. Numerous lines of evidence suggest that the physical hydrology and limnology of the lake has changed substantially over the past 3.6 million years, and some of the implications of these changes on paleoclimate reconstructions are discussed.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JAN	2007	37	1					17	35		10.1007/s10933-006-9020-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-006-9020-y													WOS:000243141600002
J	Atkinson, JF; Edwards, WJ; Feng, YP				Atkinson, Joseph F.; Edwards, William J.; Feng, Yanping			Physical measurements and nearshore nested hydrodynamic modeling for Lake Ontario nearshore nutrient study	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Application of a well-known hydrodynamic code for the Great Lakes was evaluated for its effectiveness, using a nested modeling approach, to examine nearshore physical processes in connection with the 2008 Lake Ontario Nearshore Nutrient Study (LONNS). The purpose of LONNS was to examine possible causes of nearshore eutrophication, and as a subset the goal of this study was to develop a framework for understanding the role of physical processes in nearshore eutrophication problems (e.g., benthic algae blooms). A relatively fine scale (200 m) nested model was interfaced with a coarser scale (2 km) whole-lake model to allow direct incorporation of processes acting on the whole-lake scale, while also providing spatial detail that better matched available data and the desired resolution for the nearshore. Both models were based on the Princeton Ocean Model. Measurements of temperatures and currents were obtained during 2008 in each of the three regions: Oak Orchard Creek, Rochester Embayment, and Sandy Creek (or Mexico Bay), representing three different regimes of human interaction with the nearshore. The model reproduced general temperatures and flow structures relatively well for the Oak Orchard and Rochester sites, but was less effective for Sandy Creek, where simulation results were possibly adversely affected by the relatively shallow conditions of this site. Results were generally better for summer and fall, while early spring comparisons appeared to be influenced by specified initial conditions, which were found to impact model results well past the one to two month period usually assumed for spin-up time.

Although the dramatic loss of Arctic sea ice certainly has contributed to a more extreme climate, the mechanism connecting sea-ice loss to extensive snow cover is still up for debate. In this study, a significant relationship between sea ice concentration (SIC) in the Barents-Kara (B-K) seas in November and snow cover extent over Eurasia in winter (November-January) has been found based in observational datasets and through numerical experiments. The reduction in B-K sea ice gives rise to a negative phase of Arctic Oscillation (AO), a deepened East Asia trough, and a shallow trough over Europe. These circulation anomalies lead to colder-than-normal Eurasian mid-latitude temperatures, providing favorable conditions for snowfall. In addition, two prominent cyclonic anomalies near Europe and Lake Baikal affect moisture transport and its divergence, which results in increased precipitation due to moisture advection and wind convergence. Furthermore, anomalous E-P flux shows that amplified upward propagating waves associated with the low SIC could contribute to the weakening of the polar vortex and southward breakouts of cold air. This work may be helpful for further understanding and predicting the snowfall conditions in the middle latitudes.

This record covers the last 723 years (CE 1219-1942) and is based on high-resolution lacustrine sediment pollen proxy data. The pollen evidence indicates that between 731 and 576 cal yr BP (CE [AD] 1219-1374), the landscape was dominated by mixed moist/semi-evergreen-dry tropical deciduous forests under a warm and moist climate, possibly indicating increased monsoon rainfall. This phase is globally correlated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; CE 750-1200). Between 576 and 279 cal yr BP (CE 1374-1671), dense mixed moist/semi-evergreen-dry tropical deciduous forests came into existence and transformed the existing forests of the previous phase under a warm and more moist climate with further increase in monsoon rainfall. Finally, between 279 and 8 cal yr BP (CE 1671-1942), mixed moist/semi-evergreen-dry tropical deciduous forests again came into being, replacing the existing dense mixed forests of the previous phase under a warm and comparatively less moist climate with increased monsoon (may be NEM) rainfall, corresponds to the global Little Ice Age (LIA; CE 1550-1850). The hydro-climatic variability during CE 1219-1942 offers valuable insights into the impact of monsoonal variability and human activities on ecosystems in the Western Ghats (India), which are subject to dual monsoon systems (SWM and NEM).

J	Field, KM; Prepas, EE				Field, KM; Prepas, EE			Increased abundance and depth distribution of pelagic crustacean zooplankton during hypolimnetic oxygenation in a deep, eutrophic Alberta lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Since June 1988, the north basin of eutrophic Amisk Lake has been treated by hypolimnetic oxygenation, while the south basin has served as a reference. In summer 1989, hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations were greater than or equal to 1 mg.L-1 in the treatment basin, while they fell to <1 mg.L-1 in the reference basin by early July. There were no apparent treatment effects on biomass, abundance, or distribution of zooplankton in surface waters (0-10 m). However, in summer 1989, hypolimnetic abundances of two of four species (Daphnia longiremis and Daphnia pulex) were greater in the treatment than in the reference basin (P < 0.03) and than in the north basin in summer 1984 (4 years pretreatment). In the hypolimnion, D. longiremis, D. pulex, Bosmina longirostris, and Diacyclops bicuspidatus thomasi were found at greater median depths (P < 0.001) in the treatment than in the reference basin. Median depths of these four species in the hypolimnion tracked species-specific DO concentrations of between 1.5 and 2.3 mg.L-1. Coincident with enhanced DO concentrations in the treatment basin in August, D. longiremis migrated vertically in the treatment basin (median depth day versus night, P < 0.001, median migration 4 m), but not in the reference basin (P > 0.9).																			0706-652X					SEP	1997	54	9					2146	2156		10.1139/cjfas-54-9-2146	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-54-9-2146													WOS:A1997YH98200020
J	MCQUEEN, DJ; POST, JR				MCQUEEN, DJ; POST, JR			CASCADING TROPHIC INTERACTIONS - UNCOUPLING AT THE ZOOPLANKTON-PHYTOPLANKTON LINK	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Four limnocorrals (8 m dia. by 15 m deep) located at Lake St. George, Ontario, Canada; were used to examine the interactions between planktivorous fish, crustacean zooplankton (notably Daphnia galeata mendotae), and phytoplankton. During the spring, in all of the limnocorrals, high Daphnia biomasses were correlated with increased water transparency and a spring ''clear-water'' phase. However, as the summer progressed, the relationship between Daphnia biomass and phytoplankton abundance became more complex and less predictable. Investigation of these interactions suggested four conclusions. (1) During late July and throughout August and September, water transparency decreased and algal cell counts increased. In 3 of 4 limnocorrals, deterioration in water quality occurred 3-5 weeks before zooplankton (and Daphnia populations) declined. In all cases decreased transparency was associated with increased concentrations of algal cells (Gloeococcus) that were poor food sources for Daphnia. These results suggested that decreased water transparency was not ''caused by'' decreases in Daphnia biomass. (2) Taken together, data from all of the limnocorrals showed no correlation between the magnitude of July Daphnia biomasses and the percentage of ''poor food source'' algae that were observed in August. This suggested that grazer effects were not necessary for the onset of summer ''poor food source'' algal blooms. (3) In two limnocorrals, there was a positive correlation between increased Daphnia mortality and the onset of ''poor food source'' blooms. In the other two limnocorrals there was no correlation. In all limnocorrals there was no correlation between decreased Daphnia reproductive capacity and ''poor food source'' blooms. These data suggested that blooms of ''poor food source'' algae were not necessary for the collapse of Daphnia populations. (4) In all 4 limnocorrals there was a strong correlation between the time that 0+ yellow perch planktivores reached biomasses of 30-50 kg ha-1 and the collapse of Daphnia populations species and size selection was also observed. These results suggested that for this set of limnocorral experiments, fish biomasses in the 30-50 ha-1 were responsible for the collapse of Daphnia populations in the summer.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR 22	1988	159	3					277	296		10.1007/BF00008241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00008241													WOS:A1988M507100007

The growth and survival of 1 and 2 yr old salmon were investigated and compared with that of other lake-reared populations and also with salmon in the natural stream environment. Lake-reared salmon follow the same patterns of slow and rapid growth as found for river fish, but the growth rate was superior in the former. The variation in length-weight relationship with age and sex was investigated. Survival rates in general compared favorably with the survival in rivers, with high mortality rates of salmon in Llyn Dwythwch resulting from predation at spring stocking by the resident brown trout. This was later avoided by stocking larger fish in the autumn.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1978	8	5					423	431		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01465.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1978.tb01465.x													WOS:A1978FW43500003

Two species of (Cyclotella glomerata Bachmann and Synedra radians Kutz.) became dominant at different depth intervals (0-30 m and 60-90 m, respectively). Experimental transplants of assemblages between depths demonstrated asymmetrical competition. In the phosphate-limited region near the surface, growth of S. radians declined in the presence of C. glomerata. However, growth of C. glomerata was not affected by the presence of S. radians in the light-limited region at depth.

J	Baskin, CC; Baskin, JM; Chester, EW				Baskin, Carol C.; Baskin, Jerry M.; Chester, Edward W.			Long-term persistence of summer annuals in soil seed banks of seasonally dewatered mudflats	PLANT ECOLOGY												In annually flooded and dewatered mudflats, does the big flush of germination following dewatering exhaust the seed bank, and if not, how long can seeds remain viable and nongerminated under annual flooding cycles? Soil samples from mudflats in Land Between the Lakes in western Kentucky and northwestern central Tennessee (USA) were collected in 1990, 1991, and 1992 and annually flooded in winter and kept moist during summer for 15, 14, and 13years, respectively. Beginning in 1996, all samples were stirred when dewatered in June. Seedlings were counted and removed, thus preventing any input of new seeds. During the study, seeds of 37 species germinated, and there were 2 to 8588 seedlings m(-2), depending on the species. Ten of the species germinated in only one set of samples (2-4 seedlings m(-2)) in 1 year, but the number of years before germination ranged from 1 to 9; one species germinated in two sets of samples (2-4 seedlings m(-2)) after 6 and 9 years. Eighteen species germinated in 2-12 of the years but not necessarily in consecutive years. Eight species germinated in 14 and/or 15 years. Regardless of seed bank size, seeds of many species lived in the samples for extended periods of time with 31 (83.8%) germinating after >= 5 years and 19 (48.6%) after >= 10 years. New species appeared in the 1990, 1991, and 1992 samples after 8, 9, and 11 years, respectively. Thus, if the seedling emergence method is used to study mudflat soil seed banks and monitoring is terminated after only a relative short period of time, the size and species richness of the seed bank may be greatly underestimated.																			1385-0237	1573-5052				AUG	2019	220	7-8					731	740		10.1007/s11258-019-00948-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-019-00948-7													WOS:000476517600006

The entire water column was oxic throughout the year. Measurements were taken monthly from July 1991 to March 1996. The oxidation rates were derived from time-course dissolved methane concentration measurements during the bottle incubation at in situ temperature. The existence of methane oxidation activity in the oxic lake water was confirmed. Methane oxidation was distinctly seasonal, with low activity from January to April and high activity from August to November. Maximum methane oxidation was observed in late summer or early autumn, when the turnover time of dissolved methane was usually shorter than half a day. Methane oxidation activity does not depend on water temperature, dissolved methane concentration, dissolved oxygen, or dissolved inorganic nitrogen. The annual average methane consumption rate was 12.3 +/- 15.5 mg CH(4) m(-2) d(-1). Methane oxidation was the dominant methane sink, consuming an annual average of 74% of dissolved methane in the water column of Lake Kasumigaura.

Experiments at 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0.degree. C, 4 light climates [continuous light (24/0); long day (16/8); short day (8/16) and continous dark (0/24)] and constant food were performed to determine if larval development followed a constant pattern and the mechanism used for programming development. The sigmoid growth curve was divided into a 1st, level phase .alpha. and 2nd steep phase .beta.. Only phase .alpha. was programmed: fixation of the duration of phase .alpha. was permanent, the programmed upper limit of growth rates in phase .alpha. was changing under natural conditions. The latter spares the necessity of a termination of the fixation. Constant light climates exert only a weak effect on larval development.																			0003-9136						1985	104	1					111	128																WOS:A1985ANJ9600007
J	McKerchar, AI; Pearson, CP; Fitzharris, BB				McKerchar, AI; Pearson, CP; Fitzharris, BB			Dependency of summer lake inflows and precipitation on spring SOI	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Inflows to South Island, New Zealand lakes deriving from snowmelt are quantified using a water balance approach and are shown to be between 8% and 24% of annual inflow. A snow accumulation index calculated from climatological data using a snowpack simulation model confirms the general pattern of the year-to-year variability of these estimates. Previous work has shown that summer inflows tend to be relatively low in years when the EI Nino Southern Oscillation phenomenon is in a positive phase (i.e. La Nina). We show that this pattern is also evident in records of precipitation around the catchments, particularly where precipitation exceeds 1000 mm/yr. Variance of inflows and precipitation appears to be dependent on the magnitude of the SOI. Snowmelt increases somewhat in La Nina years, and this may relate to a general trend for wanner temperatures in these years. A relative absence of La Nina conditions for 1976-1994 may be partially responsible for a significant increase in mean lake inflows over the period 1978-1994.

During subsequent years (1995-1999), Aphanizomenon also appeared in late summer and fall, but did not bloom. In outdoor microcosm experiments, we examined zooplankton grazing on Lake Kinneret phytoplankton, with and without Aphanizomenon present, and the effects of N, P and N:P ratios on phytoplankton growth. In one-day feeding experiments, clearance and grazing rates of the ambient Lake Kinneret zooplankton assemblage feeding in lake water dominated by Aphanizomenon were 10-fold lower than in water without Aphanizomenon. We suspect that the low grazing rates were due to interference caused by the presence of Aphanizomenon. In 9-day nutrient addition experiments, significant enhancement effects on phytoplankton were detected with additions of either P or N; a high N:P was better for phytoplankton growth than a low N:P. After 7 days, bottles receiving low P and no N additions were dominated by Oscillatoria sp. and Closterium acutum; few Aphanizomenon were present. In contrast, bottles receiving high P and N additions had large increases of Aphanizomenon, as well as Oscillatoria and Closterium. There was a tendency for more green algae and diatoms with increasing N additions. These results provide evidence that (i) non-grazeability of Aphanizomenon enabled it to gain a competitive advantage over grazeable phytoplankton, and (ii) that nutrient limitation, but not grating, was probably important in the eventual decline of the Aphanizomenon bloom.

Ice-out dates from 29 lakes in New England (USA) with 64 to 163 ears of record were assembled and analysed for this study. Ice-out dates have become significantly earlier in New England since the 1800s. Changes in ice-out dates between 1850 and 2000 were 9 days and 16 days in the northern/mountainous. and southern regions of New England respectively. The changes in the ice-out data over time were very consistent within each of the two regions of New England, and more consistent than four air-temperature records in each region. The ice-out dates of the two regions had a different response to changes in air temperature. The inferred late winter-early spring air-temperature warming in both regions of New, England since 1850. based on linear regression analysis. was about 1.5 C.

Analyses of lithologies, grain size distributions and elemental compositions revealed that the early Holocene climate in the eastern Mu Us desert experienced at least seven multi-centennial oscillations between humid and arid episodes. Four humid episodes occurred at 10,800 to 10,200 cal. (calendar) yr BP, 9800 to 9400 cal. yr BP, 8900 to 8300 cal. yr BP and 8000 to 7700 cal. yr BP. Three arid episodes occurred at 10,200 to 9800 cal. yr BP, 9400 to 8900 cal. yr BP, and 8300 to 8000 cal. yr BP. These humid-arid oscillations were representative of multi-centennial fluctuations in the history of waxing and waning of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) in the eastern margin of the Mu Us desert. Comparisons with other climate records based on pollen-based annual precipitation (PANN) reconstructed from Gonghai Lake and the stalagmite 6180 records from Dongge cave, southern China, supported certain influences of the Indian summer monsoon on moisture variations in the eastern margin of the Mu Us desert. Our results also revealed a possible climatic connection between the variability of the East Asian winter monsoons and air temperature changes at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere and North Atlantic thermohaline circulation during the early Holocene. The similarity between early Holocene climate evolution in the eastern Mu Us desert and several proxies (Delta C-14 residuals, sunspot numbers, spectral analysis of grain-size and elemental compositions) supports the hypothesis that variations in solar insolation are a major external force responsible for East Asian Monsoon variations at the multi-centennial scale during the early Holocene.

The stomach contents of 110 (40 males, 62 females, eight juveniles) E. orbicularis individuals were analyzed, and 461 prey items were found. Gastropods (2.2%), earthworms (0.4%), insects (67.2%), fishes (6.9%), amphibians (15.0%), and plant material (8.2%) constituted the food of the species. Food consisted primarily of insects and other invertebrates during the breeding season and of vertebrate and plant material (especially seeds and roots) during the post-breeding season. Based on these results, the European pond turtle is a generalist opportunistic omnivore whose diet is most strongly influenced by prey availability.

Cyclotella ocellata was the most important centric diatom in the lake with a maximum cell density of 6 x 10(6) cells l(-1). The seasonal development, characterized by a spring and a summer maximum, is considered in relation to environmental factors and the succession of the phytoplankton community. The amount of Cyclotella ocellata biomass as a proportion of the total phytoplankton biomass varied from 0.5 to 35%. in addition, seasonal changes in cell size and feature associated with sexual reproduction of Cyclotella ocellata were documented. Light and electron microscopic investigations demonstrate an extremely wide range of morphological variability of this natural population.																			1434-2944						1999	84	5					469	478																WOS:000083107700006
J	Schmidt, EG				Schmidt, EG			The ecological niche of Sympetrum flaveolum (L, 1758) and the problem of species conservation and Red Data Books in Odonata, breeding in temporary water bodies (Odonata: Libellulidae).	ENTOMOLOGIA GENERALIS												The niche concept of ecosystem theory is explained. Inventarization of dragonflies by sight in correlation with the choice of reproduction microhabitat proved to be the best base for niche analysis; photo documentation secures verification. For oviposition Sympetrum flaveolum prefers open wetlands with vey low or lacking vegetation +/- off from the water in summer. If being floated with shallow water in spring, drying up in early summer; here best conditions for a quick developement are given. The oviposition behaviour is described. The species at the microhabitat often is associated with Lestes dryas (but preferring vertical reeds for oviposition) or with Lestes barbarus at the open places too. The ecological niche of Sympetrum flaveolum has the following key stone factors: Water regime, which fits only in certain years, thus breeding only temporarily can be successful and dispersal is necessary for a new colonisation. Good weather conditions during spring for the larval developement and during the flying season as well for reproductive behaviour as for dispersal. Microclimate: The microhabitats have a more continental microclimate compared with the surroundings. This fits to the rather northern distribution across the Euro-Sibirian continent and preference of mountain regions in the southern parts of the distribution area. In NW-Germany temporarily floated areas at running waters, lakes and swamps decreased strongly. So the species lost most breeding habitats except some few places (mainly under nature conservancy or in sand dune valleys on the wadden sea islands). The vegetation structure wanted under natural conditions is favoured by poor soil, and so it suffered very much from fertilization everywhere. Special water and vegetation management in swamps may help for saving breeding habitats. The usual Red Data Books do not have an adequate category for species like Sympetrum flaveolum confined to only temporariliy fitting breeding microhabitats.																			0171-8177						1998	23	1-2					129	138																WOS:000077271100009

Mysterious microsporidians: springtime outbreaks of disease in Daphnia communities in shallow pond ecosystems	OECOLOGIA												Parasites can play key roles in ecosystems, especially when they infect common hosts that play important ecological roles. Daphnia are critical grazers in many lentic freshwater ecosystems and typically reach peak densities in early spring. Daphnia have also become prominent model host organisms for the field of disease ecology, although most well-studied parasites infect them in summer or fall. Here, we report field patterns of virulent microsporidian parasites that consistently infect Daphnia in springtime, in a set of seven shallow ponds in Georgia, USA, sampled every 3-4 weeks for 18 months. We detected two distinct parasite taxa, closely matching sequences of Pseudoberwaldia daphniae and Conglomerata obtusa, both infecting all three resident species of Daphnia: D. ambigua, D. laevis, and D. parvula. To our knowledge, neither parasite has been previously reported in any of these host species or anywhere in North America. Infection prevalence peaked consistently in February-May, but the severity of these outbreaks differed substantially among ponds. Moreover, host species differed markedly in terms of their maximum infection prevalence (5% [D. parvula] to 72% [D. laevis]), mean reduction of fecundity when infected (70.6% [D. ambigua] to 99.8% [D. laevis]), mean spore yield (62,000 [D. parvula] to 377,000 [D. laevis] per host), and likelihood of being infected by each parasite. The timing and severity of the outbreaks suggests that these parasites could be impactful members of these shallow freshwater ecosystems, and that the strength of their effects is likely to hinge on the composition of ponds' zooplankton communities.					; Suh, Daniel/JMQ-7021-2023; Cleveland, Chris/HOH-0036-2023; Warburton, Elizabeth/NNG-9854-2025	Yabsley, Michael/0000-0003-2452-5015; Strauss, Alexander/0000-0003-0633-8443; Schroeder, Katie/0000-0002-4541-0332; Warburton, Elizabeth/0000-0001-8125-2741; Suh, Daniel/0000-0002-8087-0713; Cleveland, Christopher/0000-0002-5437-4011													0029-8549	1432-1939				FEB	2024	204	2			SI		303	314		10.1007/s00442-023-05421-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-023-05421-x		JUL 2023						37470872					WOS:001029824200001

Parasitofauna of pike Esox lucius of the Lower Tobol (Russia)	BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY												One of the predators of the ichthyofauna of the Lower Tobol is Esox lucius (Linnaeus, 1758) (Esociformes, Esocidae). The purpose of this work is to study the current state of the E. lucius parasite fauna in the lower reaches of the Tobol River. hi the present study 47 individuals of the northern pike of different sex aged from 2+ to 8+ years were examined by the method of complete parasitological dissection. As a result of the research, 23 types of parasites were found in the pike. The largest number of species of parasitic organisms - 20 - were found in May, 12 were found in December and 11 in September. Of these, 10 species are specific to northern pike: Haemogregarina esoci (Nawrotzky, 1914), Chloromyxum esocinum (Dogiel, 1934), Myxidium lieberkuhni (Biitschli, 1882), Myxosoma anurum (Cohn, 1895), Henneguya psorospennica (Thelohan, 1995), Tetraonchus monenteron (Wagener, 1857), Gyrodactylus lucii (Kulakowskaja, 1951), Triaenophorus nodulosus (Pallas, 1781), Azygia lucii (Miller, 1776), Raphidascaris acus (Bloch, 1779). For the first time an intraerythrocyte parasite -H. esoci - was found in pike in the Lower Tobol, the extensiveness of invasion was 18.7% in December, and 6.2% in May. Epistylis sp. and Trichodinella epizzotica parasitized on the surface of the body of fish only in May, whereas members of the genus Trichodina were found in winter and spring. hi all seasons, parasitization by M. anunim and H. psorospennica was established on the gills. The greatest occurrence of spores of M. lieberkuhni and C. esocinum was observed in the spring. Myxosporidia parasitized in the kidneys and T. monenteron parasitized on the gills during all periods of the study (the latter with an extensivity of invasion of 100.0%). All examined fish are infected with T. nodulosus 100.0% of cases. hi May, other types of cestodes were found: P. esocis and Dibothriocephalus latus. Three pike were infected with proteocephalis. The larval stage of diphyllobothriid was found in one fish in the liver and gonads in an amount of 139 individuals. hi the pikes' stomach, during all periods of the study, A. lucii was found in all the fish examined. hi the autumn period of the study immature R. campanula were found in in the intestine of 4 fish specimens. The nematode R. acus was found in pike only in spring. This nematode was found in fish aged 4+-8+. In May, glochidia with a high intensity of invasion were found on fins, gill covers and gills of fish. E. sieboldi copepods were found on the gills; in May, one specimen was found in one pike and in September in 6 with AI of 0.7. Tetraonchus monenteron was a dominant species, in May its degree of dominance decreased with the greatest uniformity of species in this study period. Having considered the age dynamics of pike infection by various types of parasites, it was found that in the age group 4+-5+ the number of species of parasites was greatest (20), while in groups 2+-3+ and 6+-8+ it was 14. hi the pike, the core parasitic fauna were M. anurum, H. psorospennica, T. monenteron, T. nodulosus, A. lucii. Seasonality has virtually no effect on the degree of infection with specific parasites. The age of fish largely determines the qualitative and quantitative composition of the parasite fauna.

In 90-s main attention was paid to translational landslides (active layer detachments). Due to climate trends summer temperature became warmer, active layer depth increased. As a result, active-layer base ice thawed and stopped development of translational landslides. At the same time, tabular ground ice table got involved into seasonal thaw and triggered earth flows at the lake shores, the second known type of cryogenic landslides found previously mainly at the sea coasts. Earth flows are the main process in thermal denudation: a complex of processes responsible for formation of thermocirques. Thermocirques are semi-circle shaped depressions resulting from massive ground ice thaw and removal of detached material downslope. Monitoring of thermocirque activation and development allows analyzing climatic controls of thermal denudation, and rates of thermocirque enlargement. At present in the Yamal Peninsula tundra predominance of processes associated with tabular ground ice thaw (cryogenic earth flows) over the processes associated with the ice formation at the bottom of the active layer (cryogenic translational landslides) is observed. This is caused by deepening of the active layer and exposure of the massive ground ice (tabular ground ice or ice-wedges) within permafrost to first seasonal and then perennial thaw. Activation of thermal denudation which started on Yamal Peninsula in summer 2012, is associated with extremely warm spring and summer of this year, and the warmest July of 2013. By the end of the warm season thawing of the top of icy permafrost and tabular ground ice on some slopes resulted in cryogenic landsliding in the form of earth flows and further thermocirque development. Thermocirques may form on slopes of various aspects but develop faster on south-facing slopes.

In contrast to sizable former research devoted to hydrochemical and hydrobiological (phytoplankton) composition, zooplankton communities of these thermokarst lakes and thaw ponds remain poorly understood, especially along the latitudinal gradient, which is a perfect predictor of permafrost zones. To fill this gap, 69 thermokarst lakes of the WSL were sampled using unprecedented spatial coverage, from continuous to sporadic permafrost zone, in order to assess zooplankton (Cladocera, Copepoda, Rotifera) diversity and abundance across three main open water physiological seasons (spring, summer and autumn). We aimed at assessing the relationship of environmental factors (water column hydrochemistry, nutrients, and phytoplankton parameters) with the abundance and diversity of zooplankton. A total of 74 zooplankton species and taxa were detected, with an average eight taxa per lake/pond. Species richness increased towards the north and reached the maximum in the continuous permafrost zone with 13 species found in this zone only. In contrast, the number of species per waterbody decreased towards the north, which was mainly associated with a decrease in the number of cladocerans. Abundance and diversity of specific zooplankton groups strongly varied across the seasons and permafrost zones. Among the main environmental controllers, Redundancy Analysis revealed that water temperature, lake area, depth, pH, Dissolved Inorganic and Organic Carbon and CO2 concentrations were closely related to zooplankton abundance. Cladocerans were positively related to water temperature during all seasons. Copepods were positively related to depth and lake water pH in all seasons. Rotifers were related to different factors in each season, but were most strongly associated with DOC, depth, CH4, phytoplankton and cladoceran abundance. Under climate warming scenario, considering water temperature increase and permafrost boundary shift northward, one can expect an increase in the diversity and abundance of cladocerans towards the north which can lead to partial disappearance of copepods, especially rare calanoid species.

Studies on the growth of scales and opercula indicate that roach in all year classes formed a distinct annulus on both structures during May/June each year and fish in their 2nd yr of life also formed an additional check in the late summer/autumn of both 1969 and 1970. Reference is made to previously published descriptions of the particular difficulties and their solutions, involved in aging stunted roach are discussed. Data on age distribution in the samples suggests that the 1966 yr class was absent from the lake by late 1969 and that the 1965 and 1967 yr classes were also very weak. Comparisons with other authors are mentioned.																			0022-1112	1095-8649					1979	14	1					73	87																WOS:A1979GJ17300007
J	CAPEL, PD; EISENREICH, SJ				CAPEL, PD; EISENREICH, SJ			PCBS IN LAKE-SUPERIOR, 1978-1980	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured in the water column of Lake Superior during the summers of 1978 to 1980. The total PCB water concentrations were relatively uniform areally and vertically within any one year: 1978, 1.3 .+-. 1.3 ng/L; 1979, 3.8 .+-. 1.9 ng/L; 1980, 0.9 .+-. 0.4 ng/L. The volume-weighted abiotic PCB burden in the water column fluctuated with climatic conditions between .apprx. 10,000 and 40,000 kg, but would be in the range of 10,000 to 20,000 kg most of the time. Analysis of 24 large volume, filtered samples from 1980 showed that 27 .+-. 12% of the PCBs were in the particulate phase. The distribution coefficient for PCBs, defined by use of a glass-fiber filter, ranged from 104 to 107 L/kg, exhibiting a strong, inverse log relationship to the suspended solids concentration. This behavior is partially attributed to the differences in the organic carbon content of the sampled particles in different regions of the lake and to artifacts of the filtration process. The elevated total PCB cocentrations in the summer of 1979 in conjunction with the previous winter''s severe weather conditions are evidence of seasonal fluctuations of PCBs in the water column resulting mostly from sediment resuspension.																			0380-1330						1985	11	4					447	461		10.1016/S0380-1330(85)71789-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(85)71789-3													WOS:A1985AXC3300004

A Migratory Ungulate Facilitates Cross-Boundary Nitrogen Transport in Forested Landscapes	ECOSYSTEMS												Forest ungulates impact ecosystems in a number of ways. Most studies have focused on consumptive effects that may cascade to other components of the ecosystem, and tend to be motivated by harvest management or the mitigation of undesired effects on vegetation. In this study, we demonstrate that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), a common forest ungulate in eastern North America, may directly increase availability and heterogeneity of nitrogen due to excretion of nitrogenous wastes. We conducted fecal pellet counts in 39 winter cover habitat patches, ranging in area from 0.04 to 59.6 ha, each spring for eight consecutive years. Pellet counts were used to develop allometric models of annual deer-associated nitrogen inputs at both whole-stand and fine (< 10 m(2)) spatial scales. Deer-associated nitrogen estimates were in the range of 1-4 kg[N] ha(-1) in persistently used patches when estimated at the stand scale. Fine-scale estimates in areas of consistent aggregation were equivalent to up to 20 kg[N] ha(-1). These areas, such as bedding sites and trails, experienced greater N inputs compared to the surrounding forest matrix. Annual deer use and associated nitrogen inputs were highly variable over space, and spatial patterns in use were consistent over time at both stand and fine spatial scales. Deer-associated nitrogen likely represents a cross-boundary nitrogen flux into patches of conifer cover because deer accumulate nutrients in other habitat types during the warm season, and lose body mass during winter. Nitrogen hotspots and heterogeneity derived from the nitrogenous wastes of forest ungulates may be a generally overlooked phenomenon in forest ecology, with impacts varying according to ecological context.

The average abundances of Synechococcus, picoeukaryotes and heterotrophic bacteria was 10(4), 10(2) and 10(6) cells ml(-1), respectively. In autumn meso-eutrophic reservoirs, thermal stratification was clear and abundances of different picoplankton groups in release water was low; whereas these phenomena were not obvious in autumn hypereutrophic reservoir. Picoplankton numbers decreased with increasing water depth and showed a positive correlation with water temperature, which reflected the importance of light and temperature on the picoplankton growth. Contribution of Synechococcus to total phytoplankton production and contribution of picoeukaryotes to total phytoplankton production asynchronous changed with varying trophic states. Synechococcus preferred meso-eutrophic reservoirs over hypereutrophic reservoir and picoeukaryotes showed no preference for the investigated reservoirs in autumn.

J	Köhler, J; Hachol, J; Hilt, S				Koehler, Jan; Hachol, Justyna; Hilt, Sabine			Regulation of submersed macrophyte biomass in a temperate lowland river: Interactions between shading by bank vegetation, epiphyton and water turbidity	AQUATIC BOTANY												Growth of aquatic vegetation is often controlled by light supply, which is potentially decreased by bank vegetation, water turbidity and epiphytic biofilm. To understand the relative importance of these shading factors and the interactions between them we analysed the seasonal course of macrophyte biomass, shading by bank vegetation, turbidity of the water column and epiphytic light absorption in shaded and sunny sections of a temperate eutrophic lowland river. At a shaded site, bank vegetation decreased the light supply by 79%, 0.5 m water column by 45% and 2-week-old epiphyton by 28% during the vegetation period. Growth of submersed macrophytes, but not of epiphyton, was light-limited in the shaded sections. We found a saturation-type correlation between light supply and macrophyte biomass. Therefore, the additional light absorption of the water column or epiphyton only shortened the period of optimum light supply at the sunny site, but was crucial for macrophyte development at the shaded site. Light absorption of phytoplankton was most important in spring and that of epiphyton in late summer. Submersed macrophytes effectively retained particles and thus improved light supply of downstream stands, but this positive feedback effect was only relevant for shaded sections in summer.

The negative effects of eutrophication of the reservoir reach far outside its boundaries. One of the symptoms of eutrophication was a mass development of cyanobacteria, including the toxin-producing Plank tothrix agardhii. In the reservoir, the biomass of the species strongly correlated with the concentration of microcystins. Redundancy analysis (RDA) identified seven environmental variables as significantly influencing phytoplankton composition in the Narew river: discharge, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, orthophosphates, silicate ions, and total phosphorous. Higher discharge in the river and higher rates of flushing induced faster dilution of limnoplankton in downstream river and had positive effects on the decrease of cyano bacterial biomass and microcystin concentration.					; Grabowska, Magdalena/E-2079-2018; Mazur-Marzec, Hanna/J-8511-2017	Mazur-Marzec, Hanna/0000-0002-6526-4045; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG	2016	188	8							488	10.1007/s10661-016-5506-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-016-5506-x								27468846					WOS:000381144300045

All biological features varied both at different levels of seagrass coverage and between seasons. A low algal diversity (46 taxa, 14.75 +/- 1.41 on average) was highlighted; algal coverage and species richness showed to be negatively correlated. Ruppia cirrhosa coverage was negatively correlated with algal coverage, but positively correlated with species richness. Moreover, a significant correlation among R. cirrhosa coverage, the availability of suspended matter in the water column and the chlorophyll a concentration was detected.

J	Van, TK; Wheeler, GS; Center, TD				Van, TK; Wheeler, GS; Center, TD			Competitive interactions between hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata) and vallisneria (Vallisneria americana) as influenced by insect herbivory	BIOLOGICAL CONTROL												Two experiments (winter and summer) were conducted in outdoor tanks using addition-series methods to evaluate the impact of specialized feeding by two biological control agents, Hydrellia pakistanae Deonier and Bagous hydrillae O'Brien, on competitive interactions between hydrilla [Hydrilla verticillata (L.f.) Royle] and vallisneria (Vallisneria americana Michx). Competitive abilities of each plant species were determined using the reciprocal-yield model of mean plant weight. In the absence of the biocontrol agents, intraspecific competition from hydrilla on itself was 8.3 times stronger than interspecific competition from vallisneria. Hydrellia pakistanae interfered with hydrilla canopy formation by removing as much as 80% of the plant biomass in the top 30 cm of the water column. Damage by H. pakistanae also caused a 43% reduction in hydrilla tuber production during the winter experiment. Similarly, B. hydrillae caused up to a 48% reduction in hydrilla plant weight in the summer experiment. Neither insect species damaged vallisneria. As a result, there were significant shifts in the competitive balance between hydrilla and vallisneria due to selective insect feedings. In the presence of H. pakistanae, hydrilla intraspecific competition was nearly equal to interspecific competition from vallisneria, indicating that hydrilla had lost its competitive edge over vallisneria. Bagous hydrillae also produced similar, but smaller, shifts in the relative competitive abilities of hydrilla and vallisneria. These results indicate that biological control agents can disrupt the competitive balance between plant species in favor of native species, thus adding another element to the weed biological control strategies.

Prediction of summer rainfall would be valuable for managing the region's water resources and agricultural operations. This study investigated the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) as a predictor of summer rainfall in the basin by applying cross-correlation analysis between summer rainfall and climatic indices and SST in various oceanic regions from 1985 to 2015. Summer rainfall showed a strong negative correlation (-0.619) with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index at short time lags. Further analysis identified strong teleconnections (|r|>= 0.5) between SSTs in specific parts of the Pacific Ocean and summer rainfall in the Lake Tana basin, raising the possibility of predicting summer rainfall from Pacific SSTs with a lead time of 4 to 5months. Average SSTs of an area near the Philippines and an area west of North America were positively correlated (0.629) and negatively correlated (-0.538), respectively, with summer rainfall in the Lake Tana basin. Predictions of summer rainfall from these teleconnected SSTs by an Elman recurrent neural network model were encouraging, indicating a strong correlation (r>0.77) between the observed and predicted summer rainfall. Our results suggest that neural network techniques may have sufficient skill to support seasonal rainfall predictions over the Lake Tana basin.					; YASUDA, Hiroshi/D-5835-2019; Fenta, Ayele A./P-1639-2016; Kawai, Takayuki/C-1811-2019; Fenta, Ayele/P-1639-2016	Alhamshry, Asmaa/0000-0003-0824-7609; Fenta, Ayele A./0000-0002-8228-4048; 													0177-798X	1434-4483				AUG	2019	137	3-4					3077	3087		10.1007/s00704-019-02796-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-019-02796-x													WOS:000477054700101

This continental record's broad correspondence to the marine isotope record demonstrates that this very large catchment, with its hydrology dependent on a planetary-scale climate element, responds to Milankovitch-scale climate forcing. Abrupt transitions from dry phases to wet phases (ca. 125 and 12 ka) coincide with Northern Hemisphere winter insolation minima rather than Southern Hemisphere summer insolation maxima, indicating that Northern Hemisphere insolation exerts a dominant control over the intensity of the Australian monsoon. Stratigraphic and dating uncertainties of other wet phases preclude conclusive correlation to specific insolation signals but, within the uncertainties, are consistent with Northern Hemisphere forcing. Regardless of the hemispheric forcing, the low intensity of the early Holocene Australian monsoon-by comparison with the last interglacial and particularly the last high-level lacustrine event at 65-60 ka when all forcing elements were modest-is an enigma that can be explained by a change in boundary conditions within Australia.

However, few monarchs are found along the east coast of the USA until mid-summer. Brower (Brower, L. P. 1996 J. Exp. Biol. 199, 93-103.) proposed that east coast recolonization is accomplished by individuals migrating from the west over the Appalachians, but to date no evidence exists to support this hypothesis. We used hydrogen (delta D) and carbon (delta C-13) stable isotope measurements to estimate natal origins of 90 monarchs sampled from 17 sites along the eastern United States coast. We found the majority of monarchs (88%) originated in the mid-west and Great Lakes regions, providing, to our knowledge, the first direct evidence that second generation monarchs born in June complete a (trans-) longitudinal migration across the Appalachian mountains. The remaining individuals (12%) originated from parents that migrated directly from the Gulf coast during early spring. Our results provide evidence of a west to east longitudinal migration and provide additional rationale for conserving east coast populations by identifying breeding sources.					; Norris, Ryan/F-4720-2011; Wassenaar, Leonard/B-5996-2013; Hobson, Keith/Q-9306-2019	Wassenaar, Leonard/0000-0001-5532-0771; 													1744-9561	1744-957X				FEB 23	2011	7	1					43	46		10.1098/rsbl.2010.0525	http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2010.0525								20630891					WOS:000286135000014

Age and growth calculations indicated that females grew faster than males. The length-weight [L,W] relation did not differ between sexes and was described by the equation: log W = -5.4383 + 3.1987 log L. Some males became sexually mature at age 2 and all were mature by age 6. Females matured 1 yr later than males. Three sizes of eggs were present in ovaries; the average total number was 127,000 per female for 20 females over a length range of 270-478 mm. Seasonal analysis of the ovary-body weight ratio indicated that spawning extended from June-Aug. A total annual mortality rate of 49% for drum aged 4 through 11 was derived from catch-curve analysis. Freshwater drum were widely distributed throughout Lake Erie in 1977-1979, the greatest concentration being in the western basin. They moved into warm, shallow water (less than 10 m deep) during summer, and returned to deeper water in late fall. Summer biomass estimates for the western basin, based on systematic surveys with bottom trawls, were 9545 tons in 1977 and 2333 tons in 1978.																			0380-1330						1984	10	1					48	58		10.1016/S0380-1330(84)71806-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(84)71806-5													WOS:A1984SF29700006

J	Zeng, QH; Qin, LH; Li, XY				Zeng, Qinghui; Qin, Lihuan; Li, Xuyong			The potential impact of an inter-basin water transfer project on nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorous) and chlorophyll a of the receiving water system	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Any inter-basin water transfer project would cause complex physical, chemical, hydrological and biological changes to the receiving system. The primary channel of the middle route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project has a total length of 1267 km. There is a significant difference between the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of the originating and receiving drinking water conservation districts. To predict the impacts of this long-distance inter-basin water transfer project on the N&P (nitrogen and phosphorus) concentrations and eutrophication risk of the receiving system, an environmental fluid dynamics code (EFDC) model was applied. The calibrated model accurately reproduced the hydrodynamic, water quality and the entire algal bloom process. Thirteen scenarios were defined to fully understand the N&P and chlorophyll a (Chl a) variation among different hydrological years, different quantity and timing of water transfer, and different inflows of N&P concentrations. The results showed the following: (a) The water transfer project would not result in a substantial difference to the trophic state of the Miyun reservoir in any of the hydrological years. (b) The area affected by the water transfer did not involve the entire reservoir. To minimize the impact of water transfer on N&P nutrients and Chl a, water should be transferred as uniform as possible with small discharge. (c) The variation in Chl a was more sensitive to an increase in P than an increase in N for the transferred water. The increased percentages of the average Chl a concentration when water was transferred in the spring, summer and autumn were 7.76%, 16.67% and 16.45%. Our findings imply that special attention should be given to prevent P increment of the transferred water from May to October to prevent algal blooms. The results provide useful information for decision makers about the quantity and timing of water transfers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Seasonal interactions between Quagga Mussel grazing and phytoplankton in western Lake Erie: The view from different measuring technologies	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												We measured Quagga Mussel grazing-induced changes in seston concentration in 20-L laboratory mesocosms containing lake water, during May-October, as part of a study to investigate the present role of mussel feeding and nutrient excretion in affecting phytoplankton composition. A variety of measuring methodologies including size-fractionated chlorophyll (< 2, 2-20, and >20 mu m), phytoplankton groups by FluoroProbe, cyanobacterial genera by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and particulate C, N, and P gave us different insights into seasonal phytoplankton dynamics and mussel selective feeding and assimilation. High clearance rates and/or high assimilation rates were seen during late May-early July across all size categories, with high rates seen particularly in cryptophytes and diatoms as revealed by FluoroProbe. Starting in late July cyanophytes dominated the phytoplankton and feeding rate on them was generally zero or low. Sequencing analyses suggested that there was a diverse cyanobacterial community present, with Microcystis, contrary to expectation, dominating only in late June. Cyanobium was the dominant genera at most times during summer-fall, and as expected, Microcystis was rejected by mussels relative to other cyanobacteria. Planktothrix, dominant in spring, was readily ingested as well as Anabaena in late June. We show that a combination of methods is helpful to make progress in understanding plankton succession and grazing. These methods were important adjuncts to microscopic analysis (Carrick et al, this issue). Our results support the hypothesis that dreissenid mussels, when abundant, can affect seasonal succession of phytoplankton shifting composition to cyanobacteria and even changes within the cyanobacterial community; however, impacts are likely modest now due low mussel biomass (Carter et al., this issue). Assimilation of C, N, and P was generally high, which is important for mussel population maintenance.

However, water surface evaporation models rarely take into account the effect of water depth directly. Four evaporation ponds with water depths of 30 cm, 60 cm, 150 cm and 200 cm were set up. And the driving factors of energy and vapor pressure deficit were analyzed by using the measured data of daily meteorology, water temperature and evaporation for seven consecutive months. And an evaporation model including water depth was built based on Dalton model. The results showed that water surface evaporation decreased with the increase of water depth from April to August, the evaporation of 30 cm evaporation pond was 2.4 %, 4.9 % and 8.9 % higher than that of 60 cm, 150 cm and 200 cm evaporation ponds from April to May, respectively, and was 5.0 %, 9.7 % and 11.4 % from June to August; and water surface evaporation increased with the increase of water depth from September to October, the evaporation of 30 cm evaporation pond was 5.0 %, 9.5 % and 13.6 % lower than that of 60 cm, 150 cm and 200 cm evaporation ponds, respectively. In summer and autumn, the influence of water depth on evaporation was greater than that in spring because of the energy difference caused by water depth was larger. Water surface evaporation divided by vapor pressure deficit and water depth showed a logarithmic relationship, the aerodynamic evaporation model including water depth based on this can be used well on daily scale and can reflect the effect of water depth on water surface evaporation better. This study provides a basis for calculating evaporation from water surface by considering the influence of water depth.

By spring 1980, dissolved N loads to Mohun Lake increased by a minimum of 55% in the largest basin and 1924% in the smallest basin. This corresponded to fertilizer losses of 2.1% of the total applied from drainages that had leave strips and up to 5.2% from those where the treatment included direct application to stream channels. N transport was dominated by reduced N species and lasted up to 144 d [days]. Relatively small changes in NO3- transport were attributed to low temperatures, which reduced rates of nitrification. During the 3-yr prior to forest fertilization, N and P were added to the lake at an N:P ratio of 4.5 (wt/wt) and a load of 1.4-2.2 mg P .cntdot. m-1. Spring overturn P concentrations were 4-5 .mu.g .cntdot. l-1 throughout the study and, except during the spring following forest fertilization, N:P ratios (NO3-N:TP [total P]) at spring overturn were 3-6 (wt/wt). Despite the low ratios, N-fixing phytoplankton were not dominant in Mohun Lake. After forest fertilization, average epilimnetic chlorophyll concentrations were 1.8 times higher than in 1979, the last year of lake fertilization. The increase is attributed to the much higher spring overturn N:P ratio that occurred after forest fertilization and to P recycling processes within the extensive littoral zone of the lake.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1984	41	2					253	262		10.1139/f84-029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f84-029													WOS:A1984SP98000003
J	Burn, CR				Burn, CR			Cryostratigraphy, paleogeography, and climate change during the early Holocene warm interval, western Arctic coast, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Botanical and cryostratigraphic records from northwest Canada indicate that the climate of the early Holocene was considerably warmer than today: tree line was over 100 km farther north; and a thaw unconformity, dating from 8000 C-14 years BP, formed at the base of an active layer 2.5 rimes thicker than at present. Numerous thermokarst-lake basins formed in the preceding millennia. Both the botanical and cryostratigraphic indices described are products of summer conditions. Previous reconstructions of early Holocene climate have not assessed the significance of paleocoastal location on the seasonality and extent of apparent climate warming. At present, there is a steep gradient in growing-season conditions between cooler sites on the Beaufort Sea coast and warmer, inland locations, Winter conditions are more uniform because both sea and land are snow-covered. Coastal retreat in the region has been rapid, due to sea level rising over a gently sloping shelf containing readily erodible sediments. The coastline has moved about 100 km southward during the Holocene. The increasing proximity to the coast, through time, of points currently within 100 km of the sea may account for between one and two thirds of the cooling in summer climate experienced there since the mid-Holocene.																			0008-4077	1480-3313				JUL	1997	34	7					912	925		10.1139/e17-076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/e17-076													WOS:A1997XP89800003
J	Makarewicz, JC; Bertram, P; Lewis, TW				Makarewicz, JC; Bertram, P; Lewis, TW			Chemistry of the offshore surface waters of Lake Erie:: Pre- and post-Dreissena introduction (1983-1993)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Major changes in ambient surface nutrient chemistry, were observed after the introduction of Dreissena to Lake Erie. For example, statistically significant increases in spring soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) (180%, 1.0 to 2.8 mu g P/L), nitrate+nitrite (40%, 0.57 to 0.80 mg N/L), ammonia (131%, 15.1 to 34.9 mu g N/L), silica (75%, 0.8 to 1.4 mg/L), N:P ratio and turbidity and a significant decrease in total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) (25%, 0.24 to 0.18 mu g N/L) were observed in the western basin from the 1983 to 1987 pre-Dreissena baseline period to the 1989 to 1993 post-Dreissena period In the summer, total phosphorus (TP) (13%, 20.1 to 17.5 mu g P/L) and TKN (27%, 0.30 to 0.22 mu g N/L) decreased, while nitrate+nitrite (122%, 0.18 to 0.40 mg N/L) and the N:P ratio increased significantly. Fewer chemical parameters changed significantly in the central and eastern basins, but major changes were observed For example, spring SRP concentrations in the central and eastern basins increased 250% (0.8 to 2.8 mu g P/L) and 92% (2.4 to 4.6 mu g P/L), respectively. Silica in these basins increased 300% (0.1 to 0.4 mg/L) and 250% (0.2 to 0.7 mg/L), respectively. TKN decreased in all basins in both the spring and summer (range = 22 to 27%), while TP decreased in all basins in the summer (range = 13 to 24%) but not in the spring. Spatially, spring post-Dreissena (1989 to 1993) ammonia, TP, and nitrate+nitrite concentrations were high in the western basin and decreased easterly, while chloride concentrations were variable with no downward or upward trend In the central basin and eastward through the eastern basin, concentrations of ammonia, chloride, nitrate+nitrite, and total phosphorus were remarkably consistent during and between the pre- and post-Dreissena periods. After the Dreissena invasion, a different spatial pattern of SRP, silica and phytoplankton biomass was observed SRP and silica concentrations were high in the western basin and decreased into the central basin as in the pre-Dreissena period. Similarly, post-Dreissena SRP and silica concentrations were low in the western portion of the central basin but then unexpectedly increased easterly by > 250% and > 1,000%, respectively, over the pre-Dreissena period. Phytoplankton biomass increased from within the west end of the western basin to a peak about halfway into the central basin, after which biomass decreased into the eastern basin. The increase in the dissolved fraction of nutrients in the western basin can be attributed to the excretion of dissolved fractions by Dreissena spp. after digestion of particulate matter, the remineralization of surficial organic sediments containing nitrogen and phosphorus-rich feces and pseudofeces and to a decrease in uptake of SRP by less abundant populations of phytoplankton in the western basin. In the western portion of the central basin, it is possible that SRP is being carried by the prevailing westerly current into the central basin stimulating phytoplankton population growth combined with minimal Dreissena grazing causing a peak in phytoplankton abundance. There does not appear to be a satisfactory explanation for the simultaneous increase in SRP and the lack of any change in phytoplankton pre- and post-Dreissena in the eastern portion of Lake Erie.																			0380-1330						2000	26	1					82	93		10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70675-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(00)70675-7													WOS:000086696200008

Fish catchability at various temperatures was estimated (regression analysis) during the fall pound net set survey (1977-88) using number of fish caught per 24-h net set as the dependent variable. Swimming activity was expected to be higher at temperatures closest to the species' preferred temperature, thereby increasing catchability. Maximum final temperature preferendum was the best predictor of observed fish temperature preferences. Geographic distributions and median final temperature preferenda were better predictors than summer or fall seasonal thermal distributions. Acute temperature preferenda were also good predictors of fish catchability at different temperatures. Of the 22 species examined, the catchability of Centrarchidae (five of six species), Catostomidae (two of five species), Clupeidae (one species), Ictaluridae (two species), and Percichthyidae (two species) was greater in warmer water, while the catchability of Amiidae (one species), Cyprinidae (one species), Catostomidae (three of five species), Esocidae (one species), Percidae (two species), and Sciaenidae (one species) increased in colder water. Temperature significantly accounted for differences in catchability among most species (14 of 22).

However, there are very few comprehensive studies reporting all seasonal occurrences, spatiotemporal dynamics, and risk assessments of antibiotics in agricultural lake catch-ments, especially in cold regions during the winter season. This study measured seasonality in the concentrations of 12 antibiotics belonging to seven different classes in the surface waters (tributary rivers and lakes) of the Chagan lake catchment in northeast China. All antibiotics were detected in most of the water samples across most seasons, with concentrations varying for different compounds, locations, and seasons. These levels were dis-cussed in terms of the main sources at different sampling sites, including agriculture, fish farming, municipal wastewater, and others. In general, the highest concentrations of most compounds were observed during the freeze-thaw periods. The number of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) correlated with compound lipophilicity and half-life. Based on the ecological risks of antibiotics and the relative abundance of ARGs, a hierarchical control priority list (HCPL) of antibiotics was determined, considering four levels (critical, high, medium, and low). To further strengthen the control and effectively manage antibiotics, we highly recommend the reduction and selective use of veterinary antibiotics in winter and spring during the freeze-thaw periods in the Chagan lake catchment.					; li, linfeng/GYJ-4381-2022; li, jinling/HRD-0858-2023; Gin, Karina/AIB-8230-2022; Ju, Hanyu/HSG-7441-2023; Liu, Ling/LIF-9897-2024; Liu, Xuemei/HSG-6255-2023; Wu, Yao/HSG-5577-2023; Zhang, Jingjie/AAD-6672-2020	Wu, Yao/0000-0002-2544-6901; Liu, Ling/0000-0001-7912-568X; Zhang, Jingjie/0000-0001-8040-3608; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				FEB 1	2023	229								119433	10.1016/j.watres.2022.119433	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.119433		DEC 2022						36493699					WOS:000904532400002

Here, one 200-cm sediment core was collected from Dali-Nor Lake on the northern margin of the EASM in China and high-resolution multi-proxies were analyzed. The constant rate of supply (CRS) model based on Cs-137 and Pb-210 contents, which combined calibrated ages (AMS(14)C) with the 2 sigma error, provided a detailed history of the primary productivity and EASM changes over the past 2100 cal a BP. The primary productivity (P2) was calculated based on the proportion of delta C-13(org) in authigenic and terrigenous organic carbon. Total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and delta C-13(org) in the sediment core suggested a decreasing EASM since 2100 cal a BP. Further, P2 showed a drastic fluctuation due to the temperature and nutrient variations caused by the EASM and we could also observe a decreasing trend based on P2. Compared to the EASM, precipitation from the winter monsoon (WM) had no significant impact on primary productivity variations. The higher values of P2 during the periods of 1700-1550 cal a BP, 1400-1250 cal a BP, 1100-850 cal a BP and 500-350 cal a BP indicated that the Dali-Nor Lake basin may have been greatly affected by ENSO events during these periods.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2018	27	7					5096	5106																WOS:000439087100064
J	Quinn, TP; Peterson, NP				Quinn, TP; Peterson, NP			The influence of habitat complexity and fish sire on over-winter survival and growth of individually marked juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in Big Beef creek, Washington	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Wild juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were individually marked in October 1990 and 1991 to evaluate the effects of habitat complexity and fish size on over-winter survival in Big Beef Creek, Washington. Habitat complexity was quantified for the habitat unit where the fish were collected and, in 1991, also for the 500-m reach downstream from the collection site. Survival, estimated from recovery of marked smelts at the stream's mouth, differed between years (25.4 and 46.2%) and also varied among habitat units and reaches within years. Survival was at most weakly correlated with complexity of the habitat units but was strongly correlated with the quantity of woody debris and density of habitat units in the 500-m reach, and distance from the estuary. Because distance covaried with habitat complexity, we could not ascertain which factor had the primary influence on survival. In addition, larger fish generally survived at a higher rate than smaller individuals. However, fish tagged above William Symington Lake were smaller in the fall but larger as smelts and had higher survival rates than those tagged below the lake. Taken together, these results reveal complex relationships between size, habitat, and growth that may affect over-winter survival and subsequent life-history events.																			0706-652X					JUL	1996	53	7					1555	1564		10.1139/f96-092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f96-092													WOS:A1996VU53500009

Samples from 1993 indicate that seasonal variability exists in abundance, horizontal distribution, and morphology. The highest and lowest abundances occurred in the warmest and coldest months, with a corresponding change in distribution. In February 1993, D. lumholtzi was found only in the highly saline Red River inflow waters, whereas in the summer months the species was collected throughout the reservoir. A change in morphology also corresponds with the change in temperature; during cold months the helmet and tail spines were significantly shorter than in warm months. The warmest temperatures resulted in a zooplankton community crash, during which we noticed individuals with deformed helmets and tail spines. Successive experiments indicate that high temperatures can induce deformation of D. lumholtzi spines.

Seasonal and diurnal evaporation from a deep hypersaline lake: The Dead Sea as a case study	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Evaporation plays a major role in lake systems, as it affects the water, energy and solutes budgets. Water salinity reduces evaporation, and as a result affects the energy budget of the lake, including stored heat. In this study, we explore the seasonal and diurnal variations of evaporation and other energy fluxes over the Dead Sea, the deepest and saltiest hypersaline lake on Earth. We present two consecutive years observations using Eddy Covariance system, meteorological stations and a buoy station measuring the water column properties. These observations reveal the effects of synoptic and mesoscale atmospheric circulation on lake evaporation. The seasonal cycle of evaporation is characterized by two peaks. The summer evaporation peak is related to high radiation inputs. The winter peak stem from the high heat storage of the deep lake, with evaporation driven by high vapor pressure demand, combined with synoptic scale wind systems and thermal instability. In summer, the synoptic circulation is stable, providing a weak background wind velocity (Persian trough), hence, the dominant diurnal wind pattern is induced by the Mediterranean Sea Breeze (mesoscale circulation). The two years of eddy covariance measurements in the hypersaline Dead Sea, located in a hyperarid region, revealed annual evaporation rate of 1.13 +/- 0.13 m yr(-1). We explored several evaporation models versus the directly measured evaporation, and found that the most reliable is a mass transfer model, that was calibrated here for the Dead Sea.					; Lensky‬‏, Nadav/AAL-7950-2021; Lensky, Itamar/B-5285-2014	, Nadav/0000-0002-4726-1668; Lensky, Itamar/0000-0001-7594-5277													0022-1694	1879-2707				JUL	2018	562						155	167		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.04.057	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.04.057													WOS:000438003000012

Eutrophication and climate change are two main widespread, often co-occurring stressors, yet evidence concerning their interactive effects on aquatic plants remains partial and fragmented. Predicting the response of submerged aquatic vegetation to the combined effects of nutrient pollution and compound climate warming (mean + variability) is therefore crucial for the conservation and management of these valuable and vulnerable ecosystems. Here, we present the results of an outdoor mesocosm experiment examining the combined effects of nutrient enrichment (phosphorus addition) and warming (a 4 degrees C increase in mean temperature above present ambient conditions applied as either a constant increase or a variable increase ranging between 0 and 8 degrees C to mimic the effect of extreme events but keeping an equivalent total amount of warming) on Potamogeton crispus L. Warming accelerated the growth and senescence of P. crispus suggesting a more important role in maintaining the clear water state in winter-early spring but concomitant to possible earlier turbid states in summer. Warming also consistently advanced the flowering phenology but had no significant effect on flowering duration. There were no significant differences in the life cycle between the two warming treatments, while phosphorus addition also had little effect. However, under phosphorus enrichment, P. crispus increased sexual reproduction investment producing higher seed setting rate per infructescence. In contrast, warming, especially variable warming, may decrease sexual reproduction investment by reducing the number of infructescences. Seed and turion stoichiometry were altered by the combination of warming and phosphorus addition, but the changes were complex and difficult to interpret.					bowen, hu/HNO-8799-2023; Garcia Molinos, Jorge/C-9252-2015; Molinos, Jorge/C-9252-2015	Garcia Molinos, Jorge/0000-0001-7516-1835; 													0160-4120	1873-6750				APR	2020	137								105502	10.1016/j.envint.2020.105502	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105502								32044441					WOS:000517970800027

J	Elliott, JM				Elliott, J. M.			Validation and implications of a growth model for brown trout, Salmo trutta, using long-term data from a small stream in north-west England	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. The objectives were: (i) to check the validity of a new growth model; (ii) to examine the relationship between population density and both mean mass and mean growth rate and (iii) to discover if compensatory growth occurred. First (0+) and second (1+) year-old juvenile sea-trout were sampled by electrofishing at the beginning and end of the summer from 1967 to 2000. Additional samples were taken in some years in winter and in the critical period for survival when the fry first emerge from the gravel. The trout left the stream as pre-smolts in May, soon after their second birthday. 2. A growth model (Elliott, Hurley & Fryer, 1995) estimated the mean mass of the trout over the 2 years spent in fresh water. The date and mean mass at the start of the growth period were defined as the median date for fry emerging from the gravel and their mean mass at emergence, both being estimated from individual-based models (Elliott & Hurley, 1998a, b). 3. The variation in mean mass among year-classes was small for newly-emerged fry (CV = 6.2%), maximum at the start of the first summer of the life cycle (CV = 38.1%), and then decreased gradually for successive life-stages to a low value for pre-smolts (CV = 10.8%). Mean mass was not related to population density and, therefore, mean growth rate was density-independent. Growth in the first, but not the second, winter of the life cycle was lower than model prediction, but when it was assumed in the model that there was no first-winter growth, there was good agreement in most year-classes between model estimated values and observed mean mass. Exceptions were that mean masses and growth rates for 0+ trout after four summer droughts were lower than expected, but compensatory growth followed, so that observed and expected masses were similar for 1+ trout. 4. Pre-smolt mean mass on 30 April measured total growth achieved in the freshwater phase of the life cycle. This was significantly related to mean mass at the end of the first and second summers of the life cycle, but not to the emergence date and mean mass of emerging fry. 5. These juvenile sea-trout were growing at their maximum potential in most year-classes but when this was not achieved, compensatory growth soon restored their mass to values expected from the model. This ensured a low variation in the mean mass of pre-smolts just before they migrated to the sea. However, the latter mass was higher in more recent year-classes (1987-98) than in previous ones (1967-86), demonstrating the effect of slightly higher stream temperature. This study has shown the importance of developing realistic growth models in order to detect departure from maximum potential growth, and the more subtle effects of temperature change, possibly due to the effects of climate change.																			0046-5070					NOV	2009	54	11					2263	2275		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02258.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02258.x													WOS:000270613600007
J	Parker, SM; Utz, RM				Parker, Stephanie M.; Utz, Ryan M.			Temporal design for aquatic organismal sampling across the National Ecological Observatory Network	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is a continental-scale research platform designed to assess the impacts of climate change, land-use change and invasive species on ecosystem structure and function at field sites distributed across 20 ecoclimatic domains (or regions) from Alaska to Puerto Rico. Aquatic sites within the NEON network include 24 streams, 7 lakes and 3 rivers among 19 domains. A significant challenge to this effort is defining standardized methodology for sampling at sites with substantially variable geomorphology and hydrology. The aquatic temporal sampling design provides timing windows for seasonal sampling to best assess organismal diversity and abundance. The need to establish a rule set for temporal sampling was addressed via site-specific seasonal sampling windows, defined using a suite of environmental variables collected from publicly available meteorological data. Variables integrated into the design include stream flow, growing degree days and riparian phenology. Thresholds for these variables were determined using published literature and used to create three sampling windows for each sample site. Sampling windows target biological community diversity and seasonal changes in abundance, and roughly align with spring, mid-summer and autumn. NEON-generated organismal data from 2014 to 2021 were analysed for inter- and intra-annual variability to quantify community-scale variability among seasonal sampling windows and years at each site. Algae, macroinvertebrate and zooplankton community structure was significantly different within sites across sampling windows, supporting the sampling design of three separate windows per year. Moreover, 93% of sampling windows were completed from 2014 to 2021. An analysis of macroinvertebrate data at 14 sites shows that seasonal beta-diversity represents an important attribute of the stream community, even if interannual trends among sites may differ. We conclude that the temporal sampling design for NEON aquatic biological sampling is justified in having three sampling windows per site and is achievable at most NEON aquatic sites. Although sampling windows have been adjusted at a select number of sites, the original sampling windows are used successfully at the majority of NEON aquatic sites. Sampling windows will be updated with NEON continuous sensor data from each site once sufficient (>3 years) data are available.

J	Zhang, J; Wei, YC; Wang, GX; Cheng, CM; Xia, XR				Zhang Jing; Wei Yu-chun; Wang Guo-xiang; Cheng Chun-mei; Xia Xiao-rui			UV-Vis Spectrum Characteristics of Phycocyanin in Water from Taihu Lake	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS												The present paper analyzed the UV-Vis spectrum characteristics of ph.ycocyanin extracted from 75 water samples around Meiliang Bay of Taihu Lake, China in spring, summer and autumn, 2011, taking standard sample of phycocyanin, Microcystic aeruginosa and Anabaena cultured indoor as the reference, and discussed the difference and relation of spectrum among water samples, standard sample and single algae samples. According to the number of absorption peak in the wavelength range from 500 to 700 mn, phycocyanin spectrum of water sampling in Taihu Lake can be divided into three patterns: no peak, single peak and two peaks. In the first pattern, the absorbance changed smoothly and no absorption peak was observed around 620 nm. Depending on the absorption difference in the wavelength range from 300 to 450 nm, this pattern can be divided into type I and type II. Type I only had a absorption peak near 260 nm, with the similar spectrum of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in the wavelength range from 250 to 800 nm. Type][[ had absorption peak respectively near 260 and 330 nm. In single peak pattern and two peaks pattern, significant absorption peak of phycocyanin appeared around 620 mm Compared to the other patterns, single peak pattern was more similar to that of standard sample and single algae samples, but different in their maximum absorption peaks position and relative absorption intensity in the wavelength range of 250 similar to 300, 300 similar to 450 and 500 similar to 700 nrn, because of different algae species and purity after extraction. In the two peaks pattern, another absorption peak appeared at 670nm, with the absorption shoulder from 350 to 450 nm, and shared the absorption characteristics of phycocyanin and chlorophyll complex protein. The research can provide a basic support for the phycocyanin quantitation and blooms monitoring in Taihu Lake.

Over the past decades, rapid warming has augmented atmospheric moisture fluxes. The resulting intensification of the hydrological cycle, as evident from instrumental records, is linked to more frequent and severe flooding. However, this observational baseline is too short to adequately assess long-term flood variability under different climate conditions. Geological archives can fill this critical knowledge gap by providing long-term (millennia) empirical constraints on the magnitude and frequency of floods. To reconstruct the frequency of flood events over the last >8000 years, this study investigated the Holocene lacustrine sediments from Lake Lygne in southwestern Norway. The precipitation in this area is sourced from the North Atlantic Ocean and transported by the prevalent westerly winds. As such, reconstructions of flood frequency variability may shed light on past moisture flux and flood generating weather systems in this part of northwestern Europe. We applied a multiproxy approach to robustly fingerprint the flood sediment signatures using multiple independent lines of evidence. This approach included analysing the sediments using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), computed tomography (CT scanning), and magnetic susceptibility (MS). We identified two types of event beds that differed significantly from background sedimentation throughout the sedimentary archive, which we interpreted as river flood deposits: one type is minerogenic and coarse silt-dominated; the other is a composite of minerogenic sediments and macrofossils. By comparing the sediment record with instrumental water discharge data from the last 100 years, we argue that these differing flood signals represent two flood regimes: rainfall-triggered floods during autumn and snowmelt-triggered floods during spring. Conducting a rate of change (RoC) analysis, we found significant millennial-and centennial-scale variability in the frequency of flood events. Moreover, comparing our findings with palaeoclimate reconstructions in the North Atlantic region, we found that the warmer than present early -mid-Holocene was dominated by extreme precipitation-triggered floods, shifting towards more snowmelt-triggered floods in the late Holocene.

J	Pollet, I; Bendell-Young, LI				Pollet, I; Bendell-Young, LI			Uptake of 109Cd from natural sediments by the blue mussel Mytilus trossulus in relation to sediment nutritional and geochemical composition	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												The objective of this study was to determine if trace metal bioavailability from suspended particulate matter (SPM) and recently deposited lake sediment (LS) to the filter-feeding bivalve Mytilus trossulus was dependent on the nutritional content and/or the geochemistry of the sediment. For SPM these characteristics are seasonally dependent; for LS they are dependent on lake chemistry and trophic status. To meet this objective, SPM was sampled from the Fraser River estuary, British Columbia, Canada, during Winter (March), spring (April, May), and summer (June, July) months. Deposited LS was sampled from an acidic dystrophic and a circumneutral, oligotrophic lake. Sediments were labeled with Cd-109, fed to M. trossulus and the amount of Cd-109 accumulated over a 4-h feeding period assessed. Simultaneous extraction (separation of the sediment into easily reducible, reducible, and organic sediment components) of the radiolabeled sediments indicated that Cd-109 associated with the inorganic, not the organic portion of sediment. The amount of Cd-109 accumulated by the mussel over the 4-h feeding period was dependent on sediment %carbon (%C) and %nitrogen (%N) content (R-2 = 0.75 and 0.52, respectively for SPM and R-2 = 0.76 and 0.64 for LS, respectively), and not on sediment concentrations of easily reducible manganese or reducible iron. These findings suggest that mussels obtain Cd-109 from the inorganic portion of sediment as a consequence of,digestive processes that are selecting for the carbon and nitrogen component of sediment. Hence, accumulation of cadmium from sediment will be dependent on sediment %C, and to a lesser extent %N content; however, amounts that the organism will be exposed to will depend on concentrations present on the inorganic component. Predictive models of metal accumulation by filter-feeding organisms need to consider the role of both sediment components for predicting amounts of metal that the organisms will bioaccumulate.

Concentrations of insecticides in water were combined with pumping data to calculate amounts (g/wk) transferred from the marsh drainage system into the Schomberg River and Lake Simcoe. Residues of organochlorine (OC) and organophosphorus (OP) insecticides were present in the drainage system during the 4 yr period. The rate of insecticide transfer was highest in spring during maximum runoff. OC insecticides, chiefly DDT and its metabolites, predominated during this time. Dieldrin and endrin also were detected. OP insecticides, including diazinon and parathion, predominated in the water during summer and fall. Concentrations of OC and OP insecticides in the Schomberg River downstream were 3.5 .times. higher than those found upstream of the marsh. Total amounts of OP insecticides transferred from the marsh to the river system over the 4 yr period were .apprx. 7/10 those of the OC insecticides. Insecticide residues were present in bed material of the drainage system at ppb (pp109) levels and comprised mainly DDT and its metabolites (especially TDE). Other insecticide residues present in sediments were ethion > dieldrin > diazinon. DDT residues in some species of fish from the drainage canal exceeded 5 ppm, while diazinon and ethion were present at < 0.1 ppm. DDT residues in fish from Lake Simcoe were < 0.25 ppm and no OP insecticides were present, indicating that insecticides transferred from the Holland Marsh to the Schomberg River are not currently causing significant contamination of the lake.																			0022-0493	1938-291X					1978	71	1					125	131		10.1093/jee/71.1.125	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/71.1.125								627669					WOS:A1978EL88100035

Using a well-dated biomarker sequence from the southern Tibetan Plateau and a comprehensive analysis of Holocene total organic carbon variations in lakes across the region, here we demonstrate that lake OCB significantly declined throughout the Holocene, closely linked to changes in temperature seasonality. Process-based land surface model simulations clarified the key impact of temperature seasonality on OCB in lakes: increased seasonality in the early Holocene saw warmer summers enhancing ecosystem productivity and organic matter deposition, while cooler winters improved organic matter preservation. The Tibetan Plateau's heightened sensitivity to climate and ecosystem dynamics amplifies these effects. With declining temperature seasonality, we predict a significant slowdown or reduction in OCB across these lake sediments, leading to carbon emissions and amplified global warming.					; Long, Hao/AFT-1009-2022; Cheng, Jun/G-4625-2013; Cheng, Liangqing/KOD-4726-2024; ZHANG, JINGRAN/LZI-1054-2025; Ciais, Philippe/A-6840-2011; Zhou, Shengfang/HDO-7856-2022	Long, Hao/0000-0002-2767-5521; Cheng, Jun/0000-0003-0168-1410; Qiu, Chunjing/0000-0002-9951-3951; Chen, Weizhe/0000-0001-5126-3810; Zhang, Jingran/0000-0002-4743-9673														2041-1723				JAN 26	2025	16	1							1049	10.1038/s41467-025-56399-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56399-4								39865073					WOS:001409498100007
J	Armstrong, JD				Armstrong, JD			Self-thinning in juvenile sea trout and other salmonid fishes revisited	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												1. Self-thinning, the reduction in density (N) as a consequence of the increase in the mean weight (W) of individuals, occurs widely in populations of plants when their growth is constrained at high densities, but has only recently been reported to occur within populations of wild mobile animals. It has been suggested that a self-thinning relationship in which the gradient (Delta log(W)/Delta log(N)) approximates to -1.33 describes concomitant changes in W and N within cohorts of a population of anadromous brown trout (sea trout) Salmo trutta throughout their lives as juveniles in fresh water. This apparent self-thinning occurs with no evidence of density-dependent growth or mortality (as measured by key-factor analysis) after the critical period. 2. Here, the relationship between weights and densities of trout has been examined further. A linear model incorporating log(N), year class and time of year explained 99.5% of the variation in log(W), giving a significantly better fit than incorporating only log(N) and year class. Variation in log(N) explained 85% of the variation in log(W); the addition of year class increased this value by 6% and the addition of monitoring period increased it by a further 8.5%. 3. The gradients for the relationships between log(W) and log(N) within years varied significantly with time of the year. pooled thinning trajectories for the first winter of the life of trout differed significantly from a gradient of -1.33, while those for the second summer were highly variable and sometimes positive (suggesting that immigration could exceed mortality). Thinning trajectories over the first summer of life were related inversely to the densities of trout at the start of the monitoring period in that summer (N-s), but this relation appeared to approach an asymptote at high values of N-s. The mean of the thinning trajectories for cohorts with high N-s (exceeding 300 fish 60 m(-2)) was not significantly different from -1.33. However, these slopes were shown to result primarily from the presence of high numbers of failed nonterritorial fish early in the summer rather than true thinning throughout the summer. 4. The apparent absence of a simple consistent thinning relationship after a critical period in the first couple of months of the lives of cohorts can be explained by three factors. First, the total availability of limiting resources, such as space and food, is not constant but changes with the mean size of the trout. Secondly, there is a winter cessation of growth. Thirdly, trout switch to use different habitats during their development. The implications for interpreting thinning relationships for salmonid fishes in general are discussed.

J	Arpe, K; Leroy, SAG; Mikolajewicz, U				Arpe, K.; Leroy, S. A. G.; Mikolajewicz, U.			A comparison of climate simulations for the last glacial maximum with three different versions of the ECHAM model and implications for summer-green tree refugia	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Model simulations of the last glacial maximum (21 +/- 2 ka) with the ECHAM3 T42 atmosphere-only, ECHAM5-MPIOM T31 atmosphere-ocean coupled and ECHAM5 T106 atmosphere-only models are compared. The topography, land-sea mask and glacier distribution for the ECHAM5 simulations were taken from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase II (PMIP2) data set while for ECHAM3 they were taken from PMIP1. The ECHAM5-MPIOM T31 model produced its own sea surface temperatures (SST) while the ECHAM5 T106 simulations were forced at the boundaries by this coupled model SSTs corrected from their present-day biases and the ECHAM3 T42 model was forced with prescribed SSTs provided by Climate/Long-Range Investigation, Mapping, and Prediction project (CLIMAP). The SSTs in the ECHAM5-MPIOM simulation for the last glacial maximum (LGM) were much warmer in the northern Atlantic than those suggested by CLIMAP or Overview of Glacial Atlantic Ocean Mapping (GLAMAP) while the SSTs were cooler everywhere else. This had a clear effect on the temperatures over Europe, warmer for winters in western Europe and cooler for eastern Europe than the simulation with CLIMAP SSTs. Considerable differences in the general circulation patterns were found in the different simulations. A ridge over western Europe for the present climate during winter in the 500 hPa height field remains in both ECHAM5 simulations for the LGM, more so in the T106 version, while the ECHAM3 CLIMAP-SST simulation provided a trough which is consistent with cooler temperatures over western Europe. The zonal wind between 30 degrees W and 10 degrees E shows a southward shift of the polar and subtropical jets in the simulations for the LGM, least obvious in the ECHAM5 T31 one, and an extremely strong polar jet for the ECHAM3 CLIMAP-SST run. The latter can probably be assigned to the much stronger north-south gradient in the CLIMAP SSTs. The southward shift of the polar jet during the LGM is supported by palaeo-data. Cyclone tracks in winter represented by high precipitation are characterised over Europe for the present by a main branch from the British Isles to Norway and a secondary branch towards the Mediterranean Sea, observed and simulated. For the LGM the different models show very different solutions: the ECHAM3 CLIMAP-SST simulation shows just one track going eastward from the British Isles into central Europe, while the ECHAM5 T106 simulation still has two branches but during the LGM the main one goes to the Mediterranean Sea, with enhanced precipitation in the Levant. This agrees with an observed high stand of the Dead Sea during the LGM. For summer the ECHAM5 T106 simulation provides much more precipitation for the present over Europe than the other simulations, thus agreeing with estimates by the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP). Also during the LGM this model makes Europe less arid than the other simulations. In many respects the ECHAM5 T106 simulation for the present is more realistic than the ECHAM5 T31 coupled simulation and the older ECHAM3 T42 simulation, when comparing them with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis or the GPCP precipitation data. For validating the model data for the LGM, pollen, wood and charcoal analyses were compared with possible summer-green tree growth from model estimates using summer precipitation, minimum winter temperatures and growing degree days (above 5 degrees C). The ECHAM5 T106 simulation suggests for more sites with findings of palaeo-data, likely tree growth during the LGM than the other simulations, especially over western Europe. The clear message especially from the ECHAM5 T106 simulation is that warm-loving summer-green trees could have survived mainly in Spain but also in Greece in agreement with findings of pollen or charcoal. Southern Italy is also suggested but this could not be validated because of absence of palaeo-data. Previous climate simulations of the LGM have suggested less cold and more humid climate than that reconstructed from pollen findings. Our model results do agree more or less with those of other models but we do not find a contradiction with palaeo-data because we use the pollen data directly without an intermediate reconstruction of temperatures and precipitation from the pollen spectra.

Additional samples were taken near the outlet of the sewage treatment plant. Bacterial abundance as determined by epifluorescence microscopy was compared with plate counts of total heterotrophic bacteria. Significantly higher values were obtained at the stations downstream from the sewage influx only for faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci, for glucuronidase activity and bacterial biovolume. All the other parameters were not significantly different from values obtained at the upstream sampling site. Strong seasonal dependence was detectable for nitrate with high concentrations during the winter (approximate to 250 mu M) and low concentrations during summer (approximate to 100 mu M). A distinct spring phytoplankton bloom was noticeable in the river reaching chi a concentrations of approximate to 70 mu g l(-1); during the remaining seasons chi a concentrations were <20 mu g l(-1). Highly significant correlations were found between faecal coliform counts and glucuronidase activity. C:N:P ratios of 13.9:10.7:1 (for the upstream station) and 11.7:9.2:1 (for the downstream stations) of dissolved nutrients are rather low indicating severe carbon limitation of bacterioplankton. Based on our results we conclude that the heterotrophic bacterial community is not significantly effected by the input of treated sewage but faecal contamination is readily detectable over a comparatively long reach of 30 km.					; Herndl, Gerhard/B-1513-2013	Herndl, Gerhard J./0000-0002-2223-2852; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAR 22	1996	321	3					205	218		10.1007/BF00143751	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00143751													WOS:A1996UG45600003
J	JOHANSSON, ME; NILSSON, C				JOHANSSON, ME; NILSSON, C			HYDROCHORY, POPULATION-DYNAMICS AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE CLONAL AQUATIC PLANT RANUNCULUS-LINGUA	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. The dispersal and dynamics of the clonal aquatic plant Ranunculus lingua were studied in a marginal river population in northern Sweden, where this species is dispersed exclusively by vegetative diaspores (i.e. floating rhizome fragments). The study focused on (a) the extent and range of dispersal, (b) relationships between dispersal and distribution of established stands of R. lingua, and between dispersal and environmental characteristics of the river (i.e. 'river status'), (c) the establishment success of vegetative diaspores, and (d) the relative changes in ramet numbers between years. 2. Between 0-8 and 2.9% of the total population of ramets was estimated to disperse each year. Most rhizomes were dispersed within 1.5 km in a leptokurtic pattern. A river lake functioned as a dispersal barrier, preventing dispersal distances greater than 3 km., 3. Vegetative diaspores were mainly dispersed to river curves and obstacles, and the distribution of established stands was highly correlated with these features. 4. Establishment was low and probably strongly influenced by water-level fluctuation and winter conditions. 5. Relative changes in ramet numbers varied between years and were correlated with water-level fluctuations during the present and previous growing seasons, with winter low-water, and with duration of spring-flood. The predictability of change was high within but low between stands.

Here we investigated the warming rates of three large shallow lakes in southern Brazil using a comprehensive 60 year meteorological data set and a 20 year LSWT time series derived from MODIS. Our findings reveal substantial and consistent regional lake water warming concentrated in spring (0.5 degrees C dec(-1)) and, to a lesser extent, summer (mean trend of 0.3 degrees C dec(-1)) and annual trends (0.3 degrees C dec(-1)), in fair agreement with air temperature trends. The data showed an increase in mean, maximum, and minimum air temperatures in these periods, along with a shortening of the cold season for air (-6.3 days dec(-1)) and water (-11.6 days dec(-1)), with all these changes exhibiting heightened intensity in the last 20 years. The remote sensing data showed a fair homogeneity in the warming rates within the lakes but marked spatial differences, possibly owing to the effects of climate change on the tributaries. The warming rates found here can result, for example, in anticipation of phytoplankton phenology and alteration in the functional groups, while the spatial differences in the warming may have additional ecological impacts.

Both have significant storage reservoirs upstream that are capable of subsurface withdrawal, but both show elevated outflow temperatures. For these reservoirs the presence of upstream dams capable of subsurface release of colder hypolimnetic water makes an observed 2-3 degreesC increase in spring/summer outflow temperatures unexpected. Mathematical models were applied to both reservoirs to examine hypotheses for changes in their outflow thermographs, namely, the effect of regulated changes to the natural volume and temperature of the inflows, water level rises and the influence of an oligotrophication-induced increase in water clarity on heat absorption. For the Arrow Lakes Reservoir, the increased transit time of near surface water during the heating season causes a demonstrable elevation of outflow temperatures. This effect was absent for Kootenay Lake since the transit time was greater than the heating period. The predominant cause of the limited outflow warming for Kootenay Lake is, therefore, more likely due to the decreased amount of cold water drawn into the outflow during the reduced spring freshet. Examination of the internal hydraulic controls within the Arrow Lakes Reservoir showed that some temperature mitigation might be possible by selective withdrawal of hypolinmetic water.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 1	2003	504	1-3					3	19		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008503.75784.ee	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000008503.75784.ee													WOS:000188316100003

An Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) and an Aethalometer were deployed to analyze the seasonal and diurnal variations of aerosol properties at 1-h time resolution. The ACSM and Aethalometer measurements of submicron particulate matter (PM1) concentration and composition agreed well with collocated measurements of PM2.5 using a Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance, a Monitoring Instrument for Aerosols and Gases (MARGA) and a Sunset organic carbon and elemental carbon (OC/EC) analyzer. A rolling-window positive matrix factorization (RW-PMF) algorithm was applied to the ACSM mass spectra to examine organic aerosol (OA) sources and identified three factors representing hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol (HOA), more-oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA) and less-oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (LO-OOA), respectively. The annual average mass concentration of PM1 was 43.6 +/- 29.9 mu g m(-3), with the seasonal average ranging from 32.3 +/- 21.0 mu g m(-3) in summer to 60.3 +/- 38.3 mu g m(-3) in winter. OA contributed the most to PM1 with a small seasonal difference (29-32%). More seasonal variations were observed in the mass fractions of nitrate (20-26%) and sulfate (18-26%) in PM1. Nitrate played an important role in PM pollution episodes since its fractional contribution to PM1 mass increased by approximately a factor of 3 (from similar to 10% to similar to 30%) from the lowest to the highest aerosol conditions. Photochemical production and gas-particle partitioning were the main drivers for secondary inorganic aerosol formation, leading to significant diurnal and seasonal cycles. The highest mass fractions of sulfate and nitrate occurred in summer and winter, respectively. Diurnal variation profiles of OA changed significantly between seasons, due to seasonal variations in dominant source contributions and meteorological conditions. HOA showed a predominant morning peak corresponding mainly to traffic emissions. Photochemical production of LO-OOA was observed in the afternoons of summer whereas a relatively flat diurnal cycle of MO-OOA suggested that it was mainly formed on a regional scale. Backtrajectory and potential source contribution function (PSCF) analyses indicated that the most important source region of LO-OOA was located in the coastal areas to the south of Shanghai while MO-OOA had a dominant transport pathway in the northwest direction.					; Yang, Ye/GZM-4812-2022; Zhang, Qi/F-9653-2010	Yang, Xin/0000-0002-9173-1188; Yang, Xin/0000-0003-3428-3806; Huo, Juntao/0000-0002-6067-0749													0169-8095	1873-2895				DEC 1	2020	246								105154	10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.105154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2020.105154													WOS:000581845700031

Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods that reliably detect and quantify nanomaterials in real-world systems at expectedly low concentrations. In this work we tested several methodological approaches to detect titanium dioxide nanomaterials released from sunscreen products into the Old Danube Lake (Vienna, Austria), which is heavily used for recreational activities like bathing and water sports during the summer season. During a 12-month period suspended particulate matter (SPM) was collected from the lake and analyzed using a combination of complementary techniques. By sampling at a location approximately 50 m from the nearest bathing area and at one meter depth from the water surface, we focused on the potentially mobile fraction of the released nanoparticles. We were able to identify titanium dioxide nanoparticles stemming from sunscreens in the suspended matter of the lake using electron microscopy. Bulk analysis of SPM clearly shows an increase of Ti-containing particles during the summer season. These analyses, however, are not able to distinguish sunscreen nanoparticles from natural Ti-bearing nanoparticles. Therefore, Elemental ratios of Ti with Al, V, Ga, Y, Nb, Eu, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Ta as determined by ICPMS and ICPOES, in combination with single particle ICPMS analysis were applied to establish local background values. The observed mild increase of Ti elemental ratios, compared to spring background values indicates that the residence time of released nanomaterials in the water column is rather short. Overall, the advantages and disadvantages of the methods used to detect and characterize the nanomaterials are discussed.

In this study, the alpine grassland ecosystem in the Qinghai Lake watershed of the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was selected as the research subject, and MODIS time series data and field sampling data were used to analyze the characteristics of the beginning of the growing season (BGS) pattern and the spatio-temporal variation and responded to environmental factors. The results show that under the combined influence of elevation, land surface temperature (LST), and soil moisture, the multi-year alpine grassland BGS pattern presents zonal horizontal characteristics with increasing delays from the southeast to the northwest and also exhibits non-zonal vertical characteristics in the western mountainous area. Alpine grassland BGS shows significant negative correlations with elevation and the 0-10 cm soil moisture content but a significant positive correlation with the mean spring LST. The relationships among BGS, elevation, and LST change when the elevation is over 4200 m, but the relationship between BGS and soil moisture continues to be a significant negative correlation. In the period 2000-2016, the BGS of the alpine grassland in the watershed generally advanced at the rate of 1.4 days/10 years and in local areas showed spatially heterogeneous trends. Spring soil moisture plays a key role in controlling spatio-temporal variations of BGS in the arid and semi-arid areas of the alpine zone relative to LST. Grassland degradation also affects the BGS spatio-temporal pattern and shows grassland degradation result of BGS in advance. The findings would provide a scientific reference for further understanding the mechanism of alpine vegetation phenology.

Recreational catch card data from the National Marine Linefish System for the years 1986 to 1999 were analysed to determine total catch, catch composition, catch per unit effort (CPUE), seasonality of catches and annual trends in catch composition. A total of 17 families, comprising 34 species, was reported in catches of recreational anglers. Pomadasys spp., predominantly Pomadasys commersonni was the most prominent taxon caught in terms of both numbers and mass. Seasonal trends in catch rates were observed, with more fish caught in the summer and autumn months. The catch rate fluctuated annually. Fluctuations in CPUE were closely correlated to the number of cards collected, which reflects bias in the data. Despite annual fluctuations in CPUE, regression analysis revealed a slight increase in overall CPUE with time. However, CPUE for Acanthopagrus berda and Lutjanus argentimaculatus decreased steadily since 1986. The decline of these two estuarine-dependent species may indicate that the total fishing levels are not sustainable.

We addressed this gap by temporally (15 months) and spatially (6 sampling locations) characterizing BCC variation in lakes Erie and St. Clair; two connected ecosystems in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Results We found a spatial variation of the BCC between the two lakes and among the sampling locations (significant changes in the relative abundance of 16% of the identified OTUs at the sampling location level). We observed five distinct temporal clusters (UPGMA broad-scale temporal variation) corresponding to seasonal variation over the 15 months of sampling. Temporal variation among months was high, with significant variation in the relative abundance of 69% of the OTUs. We identified significant differences in taxonomic composition between summer months of 2016 and 2017, with a corresponding significant reduction in the diversity of BCC in summer 2017. Conclusions As bacteria play a key role in biogeochemical cycling, and hence in healthy ecosystem function our study defines the scope for temporal and spatial variation in large lake ecosystems. Our data also show that freshwater BCC could serve as an effective proxy and monitoring tool to access large lake health.

J	LEFOHN, AS; KLOCK, GO				LEFOHN, AS; KLOCK, GO			THE POSSIBLE IMPORTANCE OF FOREST SOIL PROCESSES IN DEFINING SURFACE-WATER PH DEPRESSIONS	JOURNAL OF THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL ASSOCIATION												During the winter, acidic deposition from the atmosphere is collected by the snowpack and released during spring runoff periods. During the fall, heavy storms cause flushing events that result in acidic materials on the soil surface (derived from dry atmospheric deposition) being carried to surface waters. Some researchers have ascribed episodic increases in surface water ion concentrations to atmospheric deposition. Other researchers have noted that precipitation chemistry is significantly altered by contact with vegetation and soil and have concluded that acidity of surface waters may be largely independent of atmospheric deposition. An assessment of natural biogeochemical processes clearly reveals that H+ can be produced in temperate forest ecosystems. The potential also exists for these H+ to be transported by soil water flow to surface waters where their input may significantly influence the H+ concentration, particularly during storm or snowmelt events. The observed increase in H+ concentration in some forest watershed surface waters during storm events and snowmelt runoff may be more a function of key climatic and biogeochemical processes rather than precipitation chemistry. Since natural processes do acidify soils and these processes appear to contribute to the acidity and Al concentrations observed in many surface waters, it is important to determine the relative contribution of the anthropogenic sources of acidity compared to the acidity generated through natural processes. Until further data are provided that separate anthropogenically-caused surface water pH depressions from those resulting from natural soil processes, caution is suggested in linking acidic deposition with pH declines in streams, rivers and lakes.

Lesions were assessed in relation to fish species, lake type and location, season and collection year, and lake water chemistry parameters. Fish included bullheads (n = 98), common carp (n = 99), bluegill (n = 114), and largemouth bass (n = 118). Annually, fish collection and point-source water sampling were conducted in spring, summer, and fall from both seepage and impoundment lakes. Examinations included autopsy, wet-mount cytologic assessment for ectoparasites, and histopathology. No lesions of public health concern were detected. The most common abnormalities were branchitis (261 of 429; 60.8%) and endoparasitism (312 of 429; 72.7%). Branchitis was mild in most cases (189 of 261; 72.4%) and concurrent with branchial parasitism in 175 of 261 (67%) cases. Monogeneans were the most common gill parasites but did not influence branchitis severity (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.484). Using generalized ordered logistic regression, predictors of branchitis severity included fish species (p < 0.001), the interaction of lake or location and alkalinity (p < 0.001), and water temperature or season (p < 0.001). Endoparasites included tissue larval trematodes (metacercaria), nematodes, and cestodes (plerocercoids), enteric acanthocephalans, gastric trematodes, renal myxosporidia, biliary and gall bladder myxosporidia, enteric cestodes, and tissue microsporidia. Using generalized ordered logistic regression, variables influencing endoparasitism severity included species (p < 0.001), year (p < 0.001), chloride level (p = 0.009), and the interaction of year and chloride level (p < 0.001). Our results suggested overall good health of fish in sampled Cook County inland lakes and provide a foundation for continued monitoring of ecosystem and public health in the urban environment.

Recent research has identified a dipole pattern in Holocene hydroclimate changes between the ACA and WA, challenging previous assumptions of uniform hydroclimate shifts across the westerlies-dominated mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. However, the mechanisms behind the dipole pattern remain largely unknown. Our findings demonstrate that PMIP4 models accurately reproduced the dipole pattern, attributing it mainly to contrasting spring precipitation changes. From the middle to late Holocene, strengthened westerlies led to increased precipitation in the ACA. In contrast, rising spring solar insolation intensified the subtropical high, leading to reduced water vapor and increased descending air movement in WA, which decreased precipitation in the region. Our study suggests that WA is a distinctive region within the westerlies-dominated mid-latitudes, where low-latitude processes led to inconsistent precipitation variations from the middle to late Holocene.

J	Shao, MQ; Chen, B				Shao, Mingqin; Chen, Bin			Effect of sex, temperature, time and flock size on the diving behavior of the wintering Scaly-sided Merganser (Mergus squamatus)	AVIAN RESEARCH												Background: The foraging and diving behavior of waterfowl are affected by a number of important factors. Hence, learning more about these major factors is of great concern in order to protect endangered species. In this study, we verified the effect of sex, temperature, time and flock size on the diving behavior of the Scaly-sided Merganser (Mergus squamatus). Methods: The study was conducted by means of focal animal sampling in the Wuyuan section of the Poyang Lake watershed in Jiangxi Province, China from December 2015 to March 2016. We used one-way ANOVA and LSD tests to investigate the differences among these factors. Pearson correlations were used to test the relation between pause duration and the previous or subsequent dive duration. The relations between these factors and dive/pause duration are illustrated using Spearman correlations. Results: Mean dive duration and mean time on the pause of males were significantly higher than those of females. With an increase in temperature, dive duration significantly increased. Along with the passage of time of year and daytime, dive duration significantly increased, while dive duration decreased significantly with the increase in flock size. Conclusions: Sex, temperature, time and flock size have an effect on the diving behavior of the wintering Scaly-sided Merganser. The difference of diving behavior between males and females is related to differences in body mass. The difference of diving behavior among various temperatures and time periods may be related to a low minimum rate of oxygen consumption, while the difference among various flock sizes may be caused by rising intraspecific competition.																			2053-7166					MAR 29	2017	8								9	10.1186/s40657-017-0067-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40657-017-0067-4													WOS:000397930200001
J	BERRUTI, A				BERRUTI, A			THE BIOMASS, ENERGY-CONSUMPTION AND BREEDING OF WATERBIRDS RELATIVE TO HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AT LAKE ST-LUCIA	OSTRICH												Responses of the water bird populations to highly variable hydrological conditions at Lake St Lucia are investigated. During high rainfall years, summer floods are followed by a winter drop in water levels (drydown). During low rainfall years water level changes are less predictable. Numbers were low after the summer flood but increased as water levels dropped and then declined as water levels stabilized. High densities of water birds exploit seasonally drying, highly productive marginal areas where food is concentrated in isolated receding pools. Prolonged drydown results in drying of most marginal areas, with a resultant decrease in total water bird numbers. Fishes appear to be a more stable food resource to water birds than invertebrates or plants. The breeding of piscivores is more evenly spread throughout the year compared to other bird species. Most herbivores and invertebrate feeders are largely ground nesters, breed during the drydown and feed by wading, or at the surface by other methods. The occurrence and breeding of white pelicans and greater flamingoes is examined in greater detail because of their abundance. The estimated crude and ecological energy consumptions during the study period were 340 and 1937 kJ/m2 per yr, respectively. Management recommendations for maximum species richness and breeding success are given.

J	Hülsmann, S; Voigt, H				Hülsmann, S; Voigt, H			Life history of Daphnia galeata in a hypertrophic reservoir and consequences of non-consumptive mortality for the initiation of a midsummer decline	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY					International Symposium on Food Web Effects of Fish in Lake Ecosystems	MAY 31-JUN 03, 2000	RHEINSBERG, GERMANY					1. Field and laboratory investigations were combined in a 2-year study on the initiation of a midsummer decline of Daphnia galeata Sars in a hypertrophic reservoir. Quantitative field samples were taken twice a week, and, adult and juvenile mortality rates were calculated. Patterns of reproduction and survival of daphnids born during spring and early summer under fluctuating food conditions were determined in life-table experiments. 2. The abundance of Daphnia increased strongly in early May and declined in June 1998 (midsummer decline). In 1999, Daphnia density increased only slowly in spring and remained constantly high throughout the summer. 3. Food conditions (concentrations of POC<30 mu m) for daphnids deteriorated in both years in response to increasing Daphnia densities, resulting in a clear-water phase of about 4 weeks. When Daphnia abundance declined in 1998, POC<30 mu m concentrations increased greatly, whereas in 1999 food conditions improved only slightly and Secchi depth remained high. 4. Survival of daphnids in life-table experiments decreased greatly after food became rare and was strongly reduced in those animals born during the clear-water phase compared with those born later. In addition, age at first reproduction was retarded during the clear-water phase, resulting in very low population growth rates. Survivorship patterns in life-table experiments suggest a strong impact of non-consumptive mortality on Daphnia population dynamics. 5. Field data of mortality point to differences in mortality patterns between years, probably resulting from different predation impacts of juvenile fish. In both years, however, adult mortality contributed substantially to overall mortality at the end of the clear-water phase. As bottom-up effects on D. galeata were very similar in both years, the significance of non-consumptive mortality on the initiation of midsummer declines appears to depend largely on recruitment patterns before the clear-water phase. A high impact can be expected when Daphnia populations are dominated by a peak cohort of nearly identical age during the clear-water phase.

This tract, located southeast of Woodhenge and west of the Grand Plaza, is situated north of two known borrow pits and includes an additional, previously unidentified borrow pit. Through comparing our gradiometer results with our subsequent test excavations, we argue that this area of Cahokia potentially demonstrates an increase in building density at the Spring Lake Tract during the transition between the Terminal Late Woodland and Lohmann phases. In addition, our survey and exaction results demonstrate that this area was densely occupied between the Lohmann and Stirling phases. During the Moorehead phase, we identify a possible increase in habitation based on hypothesized structure density using statistical analyses of length and width ratios (m) and structure area (m(2)). Our preliminary results suggest that the Spring Lake Tract saw an increase in habitation during the Moorehead phase, a new perspective on the density and use of domestic space during Cahokia's late occupational history. Presentamos los resultados de una reciente prospeccion magnetometrica del sector Spring Lake, realizada durante el verano de 2015 en el sitio de Cahokia, localizado en la llanura aluvial del rio Mississippi en el sur de Illinois. Ubicado al sureste de Woodhenge y al oeste de la Gran Plaza, este sector se encuentra al norte de dos conocidas canteras para extraccion de tierra e incluye otra cantera no identificada previamente. Con base en la comparacion de los resultados del gradiometro con las posteriores excavaciones de prueba, argumentamos que esta zona de Cahokia potencialmente muestra un aumento en la densidad de construccion durante la transicion entre la fase Silvicola tardia terminal y la fase Lohmann. Ademas, los resultados de la prospeccion y de las excavaciones demuestran que esta zona fue densamente ocupada entre las fases Lohmann y Stirling. Durante la fase Moorehead identificamos un posible incremento habitacional basado en la densidad estructural especulada con base en analisis estadisticos de las proporciones entre longitud y anchura y del area de las estructuras. Nuestros resultados preliminares sugieren que el sector Spring Lake vio un aumento residencial durante la fase Moorehead, lo cual es una nueva perspectiva sobre la densidad y el uso del espacio domestico durante las fases finales de la ocupacion de Cahokia.

A prominent lake level rise in 1597/1598 that increased maximum water depth from similar to 20 to 39 m caused slope instabilities, leading to the deposition of mass-flow sediments with a maximum thickness of 2.5 m in the northern part of the lake and less than 50 cm in the southern part, resulting in a total volume of more than 113,000 m(3). Consequently, a rough lake bottom morphology was produced, which led to distinct differences in sedimentation rates of 0.07 cm yr(-1) on sills and 0.18 cm yr(-1) within depressions. The age of the top of the mass-flow deposits was used to validate the ages of the younger, laminated sediments, which were dated by Pb-210 and Cs-137. Lithological investigations showed that the sediments below the mass-flow deposits are also laminated and that they were not bioturbated. The long-term meromixis of Lago di Tovel is therefore mainly due to a combination of its topographic setting and the 5-month period of ice cover. Both prevent effective mixing of the lake by strong winds during spring and autumn. Distinct spatial differences in sediment distribution within the lake show that it is risky to interpret proxy data from only one coring site, even if the lake is very small. This is especially true in mountainous areas, where rock falls, mass movements, and slope instabilities of a significant size may have considerable effects on lakes.					; Cantonati, Marco/G-4278-2018	Anselmetti, Flavio/0000-0002-8785-3641; Cantonati, Marco/0000-0003-0179-3842													0921-2728	1573-0417				OCT	2005	34	3					325	337		10.1007/s10933-005-5022-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-005-5022-4													WOS:000231064100003

Arshad; Hendricks Franssen, Harrie-Jan			Forecasting the Permanent Loss of Lake Ice in the Northern Hemisphere Within the 21st Century	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Lake ice cover is essential to conserving the global freshwater supply for the 50 million lakes that freeze each winter. Here, we ask when lakes across the Northern Hemisphere may permanently lose ice cover. A K-means cluster analysis from 31 lakes identified four clusters of lakes vulnerable to losing ice cover, including shallow and deep lakes in regions where winter air temperatures hover similar to 0 degrees C and larger and deeper lakes in colder regions. By the end of this century, we estimate that up to 5,679 lakes of 1.35 million HydroLAKES may permanently lose ice cover if greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) continue to be emitted at current levels. In the Northern Hemisphere, lakes in southern and coastal regions, some of which are among the largest lakes in the world and in close proximity to large human populations, are the most vulnerable to permanently losing ice. Plain Language Summary Lake ice cover is ecologically important for half of the world's lakes to minimize winter evaporation rates, moderate summer water temperatures, and curtail toxic algal blooms, while also providing recreation, transportation, and food resources to millions of people. In this study, we aimed to identify which lakes around the Northern Hemisphere are most sensitive to permanently losing ice cover and by which decade. Generally, we found that lakes located in southern and coastal regions, some of which are the largest and deepest in the world and close to urban centers, were the most vulnerable to losing ice cover. One hundred and seventy-nine lakes are expected to permanently lose ice cover within this decade, but up to 5,700 lakes by the end of this century if greenhouse gas emissions are not mitigated. We highlight the importance of mitigating GHG emissions to preserve lake ice cover for the conservation of our freshwater ecosystems, in addition to its associated winter cultural heritage for the millions of people who depend on ice ecologically, socioeconomically, and culturally.

J	Marsden, JE; Tobi, H				Marsden, J. Ellen; Tobi, Harrison			Sculpin Predation on Lake Trout Eggs in Interstices: Skull Compression as a Novel Foraging Mechanism	COPEIA												Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) spawn in fall and hatch in spring; to protect their eggs over the winter they spawn on rocky reefs, where the eggs settle deeply into interstices. Uptake of water swells the eggs, further protecting them by lodging in crevices. Freshwater sculpin (Cottidae), the primary predator of salmonid eggs, are small, benthic fishes with malleable bodies and large heads. To acquire the lipid-rich resource contained in eggs, sculpin must penetrate deeply into interstices, and have a method to extract lodged eggs. We placed Slimy Sculpin (Cottus cognatus) into a tunnel containing a sequence of funnels with progressively smaller openings to determine the smallest hole they could enter. Forty-three of 138 Slimy Sculpin (31%) moved through openings up to 19.7% smaller than the maximum width of their head, indicating that they compressed their skull to move through the opening. We examined egg acquisition behavior by placing Lake Trout eggs into holes drilled in a Plexiglass plate. Holes varied in diameter from 5.6 to 8.7 mm, and were either shallow (5 mm) or deep (9 mm); after water hardening, eggs were lodged in the smallest holes and loose in the larger holes. Sculpin consumed eggs in the large, shallow holes first, then used suction to extract eggs from small, shallow holes. To extract eggs from small, deep holes, they used a sequence of suction attempts to draw the eggs upward. Sculpin are highly adapted to forage on Lake Trout eggs, including the novel capacity to compress their skulls to access eggs.

J	AMIN, OM				AMIN, OM			CAMALLANID AND OTHER NEMATODE PARASITES OF LAKE FISHES IN SOUTHEASTERN WISCONSIN	PROCEEDINGS OF THE HELMINTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON												Nine species in 8 familes of nematodes are reported from 18 species of fish collected from 2 inland lakes in southeastern Wisconsin between 1976-1982. New host records include Camallanus oxycephalus Ward and Magath, 1916 from Esox americanus, Capillaria catenata VanCleave and Mueller, 1932 from Umbra limi, Dorylaimus sp. Dujardin, 1845 from Culaea inconstans, and Spiroxys contorta (Rud., 1819) from Lepomis gibbosus, Micropterus salmoides and Fundulus notti. All records except that of Dorylaimus sp. are new to southeast Wisconsin. The taxonomic problem posed by the discovery of female C. oxycephalus exceeding the maximum length of 25.0 mm (redescription by Stromberg et al., 1973) and reaching 51.0 mm was resolved by using the tail length and distance between vulva and posterior end as percentages of body length. In that species, seasonal reproduction and recruitment occur in the summer with minimal growth and maturation until spring. Females live longer than 1 yr. Maturation occurs in only a few among the larger number of reservoir hosts. Infections are initially established in anterior intestinal locations during the summer but are later confined to the rectum. Males are fewer than females but the ratio undergoes seasonal changes, and the prevalence of infection shows a definite relationship to host size but not sex.

J	Shubert, E; Wilk-Wozniak, E; Ligeza, S				Shubert, Elliot; Wilk-Wozniak, Elzbieta; Ligeza, Slawomir			An autecological investigation of Desmodesmus: implications for ecology and taxonomy	PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Background and aims - Phenotypic plasticity is the morphological response of a single genotype to produce several different physiological and/or morphological types under changing environmental conditions. Desmodesmus, a green alga, has been well documented for its phenotypic responses (e.g. colony transformation to unicells, and spiny transformation to spineless). Two oxbow lakes (R1 and R2) and one artificial dam reservoir (R3) were used to evaluate the quantity and diversity range of Desmodesmus species occurring during four seasons of one-year. Methods - Water samples were quantified for Desmodesmus species and identified using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). To better understand the morphological responses of Desmodesmus, an axenic culture of Desmodesmus abundans, CCAP 258/299, was cultured in sterile-filtered water from each water body collected from each season. Key results - Not surprisingly, different Desmodesmus species inhabited each Water body and exhibited different densities of growth, contributing 77% of the total density in R1, 22% in R2 and only 1% in R3. Summer and autumn were the seasons when Desmodesmus showed the highest density in the shallow and polymictic oxbow lakes (R1 and R2). In the deep and dimictic reservoir (R3), the highest density of Desmodesmus was during autumn. Phenotypic plasticity was observed in the experiments, with unicells being formed from colonies, some with shorter spines. Desmodesmus grown in a high concentration of nitrogen (SE, Medium 7 +3N and BBM) had a higher percentage of unicells compared to the other culture conditions. Conclusions - Our studies are important from both taxonomical and ecological points of view, since our results showed that there may be new possibilities for using the phenotypic plasticity of Desmodesmus to assess water quality and as a potential bioindicator of nutrient availability in natural ecosystems.

J	Tan, HB; Chen, J; Rao, WB; Zhang, WJ; Zhou, HF				Tan, Hongbing; Chen, Jun; Rao, Wenbo; Zhang, Wenjie; Zhou, Huifang			Geothermal constraints on enrichment of boron and lithium in salt lakes: An example from a river-salt lake system on the northern slope of the eastern Kunlun Mountains, China	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												Some rivers on the northern slope of the eastern Kunlun Mountains in the Qaidam Basin, China, show very high concentrations of boron and lithium. Correspondingly, the salt lakes fed by these rivers show an unusual enrichment of boron and lithium, and become an important economic resource. The origin of boron and lithium has long been debated. The aim of this study is to analyze the water chemistry and hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of river water to understand the unusual enrichment of boron and lithium in the salt lakes of the Qaidam Basin. Oxygen and hydrogen isotope data show that the source of river water in the winter and summer originates from the Kunlun Mountain ice and snow melt water, respectively. The water chemistry shows that boron and lithium contents are high but little variable with seasons in the Nalenggele River and Wutumeiren River waters. By contrast, other rivers have much lower lithium and boron contents. Moreover, the contents of B3+ and Li+ in the river loads or bed sands show little difference amongst the rivers. This indicates that removal by adsorption or input by surface rock weathering is not the main controlling factor of the B3+ and Li+ variation in the rivers. Rivers with high B3+ and Li+ content are chemically similar to geothermal waters in the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, the source area of the Nalenggele River is located in a collision zone of the Kunlun Mountains and Altun Mountains. Large and deep faults can serve as conduits for geothermal fluids. Thus, deep geothermal waters in the source area can easily migrate to the surface and discharge as springs feeding the rivers. They are an important source of B3+ and Li+ to the rivers. The abnormally high contents of B3+ and Li+ in the Nalenggele and Wutumeiren Rivers also suggest that the geothermal source area may be a future target for boron and lithium resources.

We used the annually resolved biogenic silica (diatoms) flux derived from the accurately dated and annually sampled sediments of Lake Silvaplana (46 degrees 27'N, 9 degrees 48'E, 1800 m a.s.l.). The biogenic silica flux smoothed by means of a 9-yr running mean was calibrated (r=0.70, p < 0.01) against local instrumental temperature data (AD 1864-1949). The resulting reconstruction (+/- 2 standard errors= 0.7 degrees C) indicates that autumns during the late Little Ice Age were generally cooler than they were during the 20th century. During the cold anomaly around AD 1600 and during the Maunder Minimum, however, the reconstructed autumn temperatures did not experience strong negative departures from the 20th-century mean. The warmest autumns prior to 1900 occurred around AD 1770 and 1820 (0.75 degrees C above the 20th-century mean). Our data agree closely with two other autumn temperature reconstructions for the Alps and for Europe that are based on documentary evidence and are completely unrelated to our data, revealing a very consistent picture over the centuries.

These structural and dimensional variations may play an important role in continual, frequentMicrocystisblooms during summer and autumn, the cause of which still remains unclear. Here, laboratory cultures and field investigations were applied to assess mechanisms that drive variation in structure and size, as well as factors that influence diversity. The results demonstrated that colonies grew to large sizes at the expense of their structure being loose and inhomogeneous. Furthermore, colonies may spontaneously change structure to relieve the constraints of size in return. Influencing factors (nutrient limits and turbulent shear) tended to promote these variations. Our work highlights that the diversity ofMicrocystiscolonies may be a result of structural variations as survival strategies for gaining a higher upper size limit. Therefore, during seasonal successions, large colonies commonly have porous or loosely arranged structures, such as inM. aeruginosa. Additionally, this study hypothesized three possible transition routes for better understanding structural diversity and variations inMicrocystis.					; Zhu, Wei/P-3555-2015; Feng, Ganyu/HCI-6688-2022; Xue, Zongpu/JXX-1602-2024	Xue, Zongpu/0009-0002-3373-0432; Feng, Ganyu/0000-0002-7497-7469														1529-8817				DEC	2020	56	6					1676	1686		10.1111/jpy.13054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.13054		SEP 2020						33448389					WOS:000566167600001
J	Steenburgh, WJ; Nakai, S				Steenburgh, W. James; Nakai, Sento			Perspectives on Sea- and Lake-Effect Precipitation from Japan's "Gosetsu Chitai"	BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY												A remarkable snow climate exists on the Japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido near the Sea of Japan. Mean annual snowfall in this "gosetsu chitai" (heavy snow area) exceeds 600 cm (235 in.) in some near-sea-level cities and 1,300 cm (512 in.) in some mountain areas. Much of this snow falls from December to February during the East Asian winter monsoon when frequent cold-air outbreaks occur over the Sea of Japan. The resulting sea-effect precipitation systems share similarities with lake-effect precipitation systems of the Laurentian Great Lakes of North America, but are deeper, are modulated by the regional coastal geometry and topography, and can sometimes feature transversal mode snowbands. Snowfall can maximize in the lowlands or the adjoining mountains depending on the direction and strength of the boundary layer flow. Remarkable infrastructure exists in Japan for public safety, road and sidewalk maintenance, and avalanche mitigation, yet snow-related hazards claim more than 100 lives annually. For winter recreationists, there is no surer bet for deep powder than the mountains of Honshu and Hokkaido near the Sea of Japan in January, but the regional snow climate is vulnerable to global warming, especially in coastal areas. Historically, collaborative studies of sea- and lake-effect precipitation systems involving North American and Japanese scientists have been limited. Significant potential exists to advance our understanding and prediction of sea- and lake-effect precipitation based on studies from the Sea of Japan region and efforts involving meteorologists in North America, Japan, and other sea- and lake-effect regions.

Deeper snow increases the net soil organic carbon accrual rate in moist acidic tussock tundra:210Pb evidence from Arctic Alaska	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												The net change in the carbon inventory of arctic tundra remains uncertain as global warming leads to shifts in arctic water and carbon cycles. To better understand the response of arctic tundra carbon to changes in winter precipitation amount, we investigated soil depth profiles of carbon concentration and radionuclide activities (Be-7,Cs-137,Pb-210, and(241)Am) in the active layer of a twenty-two-year winter snow depth manipulation experiment in moist acidic tussock tundra at Toolik Lake, Alaska. Depth correlations of cumulative carbon dry mass (g cm(-2)) vs. unsupported(210)Pb activity (mBq g(-1)) were examined using a modified constant rate of supply (CRS) model. Results were best fit by two-slope CRS models indicating an apparent step temporal increase in the accumulation rate of soil organic carbon. Most of the best-fit model chronologies indicated that the increase in carbon accumulation rate apparently began and persisted after snow fence construction in 1994. The inhomogeneous nature of permafrost soils and their relatively low net carbon accumulation rates make it challenging to establish robust chronologic records. Nonetheless, the data obtained in this study support a decadal-scale increase in net soil organic carbon accumulation rate in the active layer of arctic moist acidic tussock tundra under conditions of increased winter precipitation.					; Ricketts, Michael/Y-9680-2019; Welker, Jeffrey/C-9493-2013	Gonzalez-Meler, Miquel/0000-0001-5388-7969; Sturchio, Neil/0000-0002-7581-9585; Blanc-Betes, Elena/0000-0002-2049-4613; Ricketts, Michael/0000-0002-5588-9340													1523-0430	1938-4246				JAN 1	2020	52	1					461	475		10.1080/15230430.2020.1802864	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2020.1802864													WOS:000574433300001

The sources of the density gradients between the two basins are (1) salinity differences between the major inlets due to the different geology of their drainage areas, and (2) temperature differences due to spatial variation of wind forcing. Wind speeds are generally larger in Urnersee, especially in spring during the so-called Fohn events, when winds blow from the south. In contrast, Gersauersee is protected form these winds. In spring 1989, a total of 630 g of SF6 was released at 80 to 120 m depth in the small Treib Basin located between Urnersee and Gersauersee. During about 100 days the distribution of SF6 in the lake was determined by gaschromatography. Two models are used to quantify the exchange flow (1) a one-box mass balance model for SF6 in the deep part of Treib Basin, and (2) a one-dimensional diffusion/advection model describing the temporal and vertical temperature variation in Urnersee. According to the first model, the flow into the deep hypolimnion of Urnersee, decreases from 21.10(6) m(3).d(-1) at the end of March to about 8.10(6) m(3) d(-1) in late April. The second model yields similar flow rates. The decrease of the flow rate during spring, confirmed by both approaches, is consistent (1) with the decreasing strength of the density gradient above the sill during spring and early summer, and (2) with hydrographic information collected in Lake Lucerne during other years.

J	Rychert, K				Rychert, Krzysztof			PLANKTONIC CILIATES IN THE COASTAL MEDIUM-SIZE RIVER: DIVERSITY AND PRODUCTIVITY	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Annual changes in abundance, biomass, and taxonomic composition of potamoplanktonic ciliates were assessed in the 139 km long, coastal (Baltic coast) river (the Slupia River, Northern Poland) having mean annual flow - 18 m(3) s(-1) and flowing through several natural lakes and reservoirs. The samples were taken from one site, once a week from December 2005 to December 2006, then concentrated by sedimentation and counted and measured under an inverted microscope. Ciliate production was assessed with relevant published formulas. Mean annual abundance and biomass amounted to 6448 cells l(-1) and 6.60 mu g C l(-1), respectively. During the year two distinct peaks of biomass were observed: a spring peak in April and May, and a winter one in December. Spring peak was formed by prostomatids and oligotrichs, whereas winter one by peritrichs. Three aforementioned orders contributed altogether to 64% of abundance and 82% of ciliate biomass. Prevalence of prostomatids seemed to be characteristic for the studied river. Most of ciliates were surprisingly small, fraction below 20 mu m contributed 77% of the mean annual abundance. Domination of small ciliates indicated high mean annual potential growth rates ranging from 0.6 d(-1) to 0.7d(-1). The river is characterised by a narrow variability of the water level and numerous through-flow lakes. As a result ciliate community in the river resembled communities encountered in lakes free-swimming organisms dominated and sessile forms and those detached from sediments contributed not more than one fifth of ciliate biomass.

In the northern part of the reservoir, Microcystis wesenbergii dominated throughout the summer but no steady-state phases were found, as periods of equilibrium lasted for only two weeks each. In the southern part, the first steady-state phase occurred in spring, lasted for four weeks, and was dominated by Cryptomonas erosa. The second phase was dominated by M. wesenbergii in late summer and persisted for four weeks. The results suggest that steady-state phases establish more readily in deep areas with longer residence times and more dominant species compared to shallow areas. Thermal stratification in the deep area and fluctuation of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the shallow area were considered to be responsible for such differences. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that M. wesenbergii was more strongly related to NOx-N than to temperature in both areas of the reservoir. We conclude that in eutrophic lakes, a high concentration of nutrients such as NOx-N is more important than temperature in the establishment of a steady state.

J	Bazova, MM				Bazova, M. M.			Phosphorus Flux in Small Lakes from Different Natural-Climatic Zones	GEOCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL												Factors of formation of phosphorus load on lakes of various landscapes (from tundra to steppe zone) are considered. The calculations of the balance model showed that the phosphorus load is predominantly determined by the conditional water exchange, specific catchment area, and runoff module. Statistical analysis demonstrated that phosphorus fluxes in lakes are determined by the cumulative impact of landscape (swamp and forest areas), climatic (annual precipitation, sum of active temperatures, duration of the vegetation period). Lakes from the tundra to forest-steppe zones are characterized by the low (mesotrophic) trophicity, while lake from the steppe zone reveals the high (eutrophic) trophicity. The factual phosphorus loads in lakes during the autumn homothermy were calculated and analyzed compared to the critical loads during the period of spring mixing.

Wetland food resources for spring-migrating ducks in the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Region	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Wetlands in the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Region (UMRGLR) must annually sustain populations of migrating waterfowl from the mid-continent of North America. We used multi-stage sampling to estimate plant and invertebrate food biomasses (kg/ha) for ducks in 3 wetland habitat types at 6 stop-over locations in the UMRGLR during 2006 and 2007. Total biomass was greatest in palustrine emergent (PEM; ${\bar {x}}$?=?208?kg/ha, SE?=?23, median?=?120), followed by palustrine forested (PF; ${\bar {x}}$?=?87?kg/ha, SE?=?7; median?=?43), and lacustrineriverine (LR; ${\bar {x}}$?=?52?kg/ha, SE?=?7; median?=?27) wetlands. Ducks that foraged in forested and LR wetlands encountered the least food abundance during spring in the UMRGLR. Our estimates of food abundance were the lowest reported among other landscape scale surveys from mid-continent North America. About 1 in every 5 PEM wetlands and over half of our PF and LR wetlands that we sampled contained <50?kg/ha of food, suggesting many had little or no forage value to ducks during spring. Biomass of plant foods generally exceeded invertebrate biomass in all habitat types, although invertebrate biomass estimates exceeded plant biomass in 8 of 29 sites when considered by wetland type and year. Total food biomass estimates varied widely (${\bar {x}}$?=?6425?kg/ha) between years and among habitats; thus, using global arithmetic means to estimate food abundance for conservation planning obscures fine scale temporal and spatial variation that may be necessary for management on local and sub-regional levels. Distributions of food biomass estimates were right-skewed, causing us to question whether arithmetic means realistically represent levels of food abundance that all ducks encounter during spring migration. Alternative measures of central tendency (e.g., median) may be more biologically realistic, particularly if spring-migrating ducks are not distributed in an ideal-free manner with respect to food abundance. Future research should determine how ducks distribute themselves in relation to variation in food abundance in space and time during spring migration to strengthen the biological approach to conservation planning in non-breeding Joint Venture areas of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan.

J	McCarthy, F; McAndrews, J				McCarthy, Francine; McAndrews, John			Early Holocene drought in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin caused hydrologic closure of Georgian Bay	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Multiple proxies record aridity in the northern Great Lakes basin similar to 8,800-8,000 cal (8,000-7,200) BP when water levels fell below outlets in the Michigan, Huron and Georgian Bay basins. Pollen-climate transfer function calculations on radiocarbon-dated pollen profiles from small lakes from Minnesota to eastern Ontario show that a drier climate was sufficient to lower the Great Lakes, in particular Georgian Bay, to closed basins. The best modern climate analog for the early Holocene late Lake Hough stage in the Georgian Bay basin is Black Bass Lake near Brainerd MN. Modern annual precipitation at Brainerd is similar to 35% lower than at Huntsville ON, in the Georgian Bay catchment; warmer summers and colder, less snowy winters make Brainerd drier than the Georgian Bay snow belt. These values parallel transfer function reconstructions for the early Holocene from pollen records at five small lakes in the Georgian Bay drainage basin. Higher evaporation and evapotranspiration due to greater seasonality during the early Holocene produced a deficit in effective moisture in Georgian Bay that is recorded by the jack/red pine pollen zone that spanned similar to 8,800-8,200 cal (8,000-7,500) BP. This deficit drove late Lake Hough similar to 5 m below Lake Stanley in the Huron basin, following diversion of Laurentide Ice sheet meltwater from the Great Lakes basin. The level of Georgian Bay largely depends not on fluvial input from its own drainage basin, but rather from Lake Superior, where the early Holocene moisture deficit was greater. Reconstruction of paleoclimates in Minnesota, northwestern Ontario and Wisconsin produced a closed lake in the Superior basin, which removed the main water input to Georgian Bay. Once the inflow through the St. Marys River was reduced and inflow from other tributary streams was adjusted for isostatic and climatic differences, input was < 5% of modern values. Consequent high evaporation rates produced a significant fall in lake level in the Georgian Bay basin and a negative water budget. This reduction in basin supply, together with the high conductivity of stagnant water in late Lake Hough inferred from microfossils in lowstand sediments, peaked at the end of the jack/red pine zone, similar to 8,300-8,200 (7,450 +/- A 90) BP. These major hydrologic changes resulting from climate change in the recent geologic past draw attention to possible declines of the Great Lakes under future climates.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				MAR	2012	47	3			SI		411	428		10.1007/s10933-010-9410-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-010-9410-z													WOS:000302381900009

The landscape was characterized by a cool grassland with three conifer genera: Araucaria, Podocarpus and Ephedra. Total arboreal pollen frequency did not change during the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions. Changes in Podocarpus frequency and concentration showed out-of-phase responses with austral summer insolation at an orbital scale while, at a millennial scale, both northern and southern hemisphere ice volume controlled the interplay between positions of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone and South Tropical Front (STF), which in turn defined the latitudinal distribution of rainfall. The disappearance of Podocarpus and the decrease of Araucaria observed between similar to 167 and 160 ka were related to a dry interval which was not observed elsewhere. During Termination II a progressive decrease in conifer pollen taxa was in phase with a southward shift in the STF and increase in Atlantic sea surface temperatures. Our results show that southern hemisphere conifer distribution is strongly linked to austral summer insolation and winter precipitation and will be threatened by the southward expansion of the summer rainfall boundary.

Hypoxic conditions in stormwater retention ponds: potential for hydrogen sulfide emission	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY												Improper design and maintenance of stormwater ponds (SWPs) may lead to hypoxic conditions, poor water quality and the production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The objective of this study is to develop a comprehensive understanding of hypoxic conditions of SWPs, with a focus on the potential for H2S production and emission. This study was conducted at two retention SWPs in Ottawa, Canada; a problematic pond with the propensity for H2S emission and a reference pond that did not demonstrate H2S emission. The investigation illustrated a significant impact of low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, hypoxic conditions, on the concentration of total sulfides in the water column. Both ponds were shown to periodically experience hypoxic conditions at depth, especially during summer periods with less precipitation and across longer periods of winter, ice-covered conditions. The problem pond, however, was shown to experience lower DO and longer hypoxic conditions than the reference pond in both non-ice-covered and ice-covered conditions due to greater depth and a longer hydraulic retention time. Hypoxic conditions were initiated at the deepest locations in the problem pond and subsequently were spread across the entirety of the pond under winter, ice-covered conditions. Algal biomass (Chlorophyll-a) and soluble biochemical oxygen demand concentrations were shown to not likely be significant factors in the development of hypoxia in the H2S-generating pond. Algal blooms of colonial Chrysophyceae, Synura, a known mixotroph, were observed during ice-covered conditions in the problem pond possibly due to stress-coping mechanisms of algae.					; Pick, Frances/P-2473-2017; D'Aoust, Patrick M./JPL-1435-2023; Poulain, Alexandre/C-1246-2009; Pick, Frances/AAD-6379-2021	D'Aoust, Patrick M./0000-0002-7301-7378; Pick, Frances/0000-0002-5486-4061; Poulain, Alexandre/0000-0002-0488-3993; 													0959-3330	1479-487X				FEB 23	2019	40	5					642	653		10.1080/09593330.2017.1400112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2017.1400112								29090613					WOS:000455025400011

Growing-Season Temperature Change across Four Decades in an Arctic Tundra Pond	ARCTIC												We examined temperature dynamics across a 42-year period in a low-centered tundra polygon pond on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska to assess potential changes in thermal dynamics for ponds of this type. Using water temperature data from a pond near Barrow (now Utqiagvik), Alaska, studied intensively during 1971-73 and again in 2007-12, we built an empirical model coupling historical air temperatures to measured pond temperatures for four summers. We then used the model to predict summer pond temperatures over a 42-year span, including 1974-2008, for which direct aquatic temperature records do not exist. Average pond temperatures during the growing season (1 May through 31 October) increased by 0.5 degrees C decade (-1)( )or 2.2 degrees C over the 42-year period. Our simulations predicted the average date of spring thaw for the pond as 2 June (+/- 3 d), which did not change over the 42-year time period. However, average pond temperature during the first 30 days of the growing season increased from 1971 to 2012, suggesting that recently, ponds are warmer in early spring. The average date of pond sediment freeze over the 42 years shifted later by 15 days, from 28 September in 1971 to 13 October in 2012. These changes correspond to a growing season that has increased in length by 14 days, from 118 days in 1971 to 132 days in 2012. Contemporary temperature measurements in other shallow tundra ponds in northern Alaska show a high degree of temporal coherence (r = 0.93-0.99), which warrants the general conclusion that tundra ponds on Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain have undergone a significant change in thermal dynamics over the past four decades. Our results provide a means to incorporate these pond types into larger-scale simulations of Arctic climate change.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				SEP	2018	71	3					281	291		10.14430/arctic4730	http://dx.doi.org/10.14430/arctic4730													WOS:000462922300005

Surface Microplankton Composition at a Hyper Saline Oligotrophic Environment of Bitter Lake on the Suez Canal, Egypt	TURKISH JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The Bitter Lake is the central and most important water body of the Suez Canal as it contains 85% of the water of the canal system. This study reports the microplankton found occurring in the surface water of the Bitter Lake at monthly intervals from November 2008 until November 2009. A total of 130 taxa were identified, among which 67 taxa were of Bacillariophyceae, 15 Dinophyceae, 11 Chlorophyceae, 11 Cyanophyceae, 1 Euglenophyceae, 18 Tintinnidae, 4 Foraminiferidae, as well as 3 of Rotifera. Species diversity, numerical abundances and dynamics were analyzed for each taxon at three sites inside the Bitter Lake. At each of these sites Bacillariophyceae were predominant in the standing crop forming 67.2% of the total microplankton community with an average of 11,594 ind. L-1. The Dinophyceae occupied the second rank constituting about 16.5% of the total microplankton. Increase of microplankton abundance started in spring with maximum values being attained in late summer and early autumn (August), with an average of 37,498 ind. L-1, while January was characterized by the lowest density (9,251 ind. L-1). Relatively higher diversity values were recorded at the northern part of the lake and a progressive decline in diversity was observed southward. Nutrient concentrations in the lake waters were very low, with silicate varying between 0.52-1.34 mu M, phosphate between 0.14 and 0.55 mu M and nitrate between 0.82-3.16 mu mol L-1. Moreover, chlorophyll a fluctuated between 0.4 and 0.89 mu g L-1. Data from microplankton analyses, nutrient (P) and chlorophyll a concentrations and transparency measurements were used to assess the ecosystem health of the Bitter Lake according to OECD, Canadian, and Quebec classification criteria, and it is concluded that the Bitter Lake be classified as an ultraoligotrophic lake.

The effect of past changes in inter-annual temperature variability on tree distribution limits	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim The northern limits of temperate broadleaved species in Fennoscanndia are controlled by their requirements for summer warmth for successful regeneration and growth as well as by the detrimental effects of winter cold on plant tissue. However, occurrences of meteorological conditions with detrimental effects on individual species are rare events rather than a reflection of average conditions. We explore the effect of changes in inter-annual temperature variability on the abundances of the tree species Tilia cordata, Quercus robur and Ulmus glabra near their distribution limits using a process-based model of ecosystem dynamics. Location A site in central Sweden and a site in southern Finland were used as examples for the ecotone between boreal and temperate forests in Fennoscandia. The Finnish site was selected because of the availability of varve-thickness data. Methods The dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS was run with four scenarios of inter-annual temperature forcing for the last 10,000 years. In one scenario the variability in the thickness of summer and winter varves from the annually laminated lake in Finland was used as a proxy for past inter-annual temperature variability. Two scenarios were devised to explore systematically the effect of stepwise changes in the variance and shape parameter of a probability distribution. All variability scenarios were run both with and without the long-term trend in Holocene temperature change predicted by an atmospheric general circulation model. Results Directional changes in inter-annual temperature variability have significant effects on simulated tree distribution limits through time. Variations in inter-annual temperature variability alone are shown to alter vegetation composition by magnitudes similar to the magnitude of changes driven by variation in mean temperatures. Main conclusions The varve data indicate that inter-annual climate variability has changed in the past. The model results show that past changes in species abundance can be explained by changes in the inter-annual variability of climate parameters as well as by mean climate. Because inter-annual climatic variability is predicted to change in the future, this component of climate change should be taken into account both when making projections of future plant distributions and when interpreting vegetation history.					; Giesecke, Thomas/A-2450-2013; Bradshaw, Richard/H-8663-2013; Miller, Paul/B-4675-2013	Miller, Paul/0000-0003-1105-2132; Giesecke, Thomas/0000-0002-5132-1061; Seppa, Heikki/0000-0003-2494-7955; Bradshaw, Richard/0000-0002-7331-2246; 													0305-0270	1365-2699				JUL	2010	37	7					1394	1405		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2010.02296.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2010.02296.x													WOS:000278923500019

Trin ex Steud., germinated in May, June and July, were allowed to grow in shallow water (depth 5 cm or less) in southern Sweden. In the autumn, size parameters were measured on the plants. In the second year, the water level was raised to 0.8 m and emergence of shoots, plant survival and size parameters were recorded. The mean plant weight by the end of the first year differed markedly between cohorts. Rhizome biomass showed a relationship of 700:70:1 between the May, June and July cohorts. In the second year, rate of emergence above the water surface, and maximum height of plants that did not reach the water surface, was positively related to the size (mass) the plants had achieved after the first year. Only plants that emerged above the water surface survived the second summer, resulting in survival rates for the May, June and July cohorts of 90%, 68% and 0%, respectively. The rhizome weight of the smallest survivors had decreased after the second summer compared with values after the first summer. Hence, they were not capable of 'reloading' their rhizomes during the second year. In a temperate climate, the size of juvenile plants after the first year, which is strongly dependent on early germination on exposed bottoms (i.e. bottoms without standing water), determines their water depth tolerance during the second year. The timing and duration of exposure, as well as the subsequent depth of re-flooding, are all of fundamental importance for successful 'lakeward' seedling expansion of P. australis.

Food resource partitioning was studied in sympatry during the summer and autumn seasons and compared with allopatric situations. We found a consistent segregation in food niche between the two species. Both salmon parr and bullhead predominantly utilised the benthic feeding habitat, but the bullhead mostly ate interstitial prey whereas salmon parr mainly consumed prey associated with the substrate surface. Furthermore, the salmon parr fed more on drift than the obligate benthivore bullhead. This study documents a selective segregation in food niche between a benthic and a drift-feeding fish in running water. At present there is little evidence of competition between the species, but potential competition for food is discussed.

The use of P-loading models for outlining permissible and critical loadings may not apply to dystrophic systems and alternate methods should be investigated.																			0003-9136						1983	97	1					109	121																WOS:A1983QS97600008

Climate-induced hydrological variation controls the transformation of dissolved organic matter in a subalpine lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lakes are an inherent component of the global carbon cycle. They receive dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the catchment, which is stored, transformed and respired, or delivered downstream. In this study, we show that a subalpine lake shifts its role from DOM transporter to transformer depending on season and climate. We monitored dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and DOM optical properties at the inlet and outlet of subalpine Lake Lunz (Austria) at high frequency during two contrasting years: an extreme drought in 2015, and regular precipitation regime in 2016. During both years, the DOC mass balance revealed that inflowing and outflowing DOC loads were nearly balanced (+6.57% and +1.70% DOC production in 2015 and 2016, respectively). However, DOM optical properties revealed an in-lake turnover of DOM compounds, so that the terrestrial and aromatic signature of inflowing DOM was modified into autochthonous, protein-like DOM. The magnitude of this transformation varied seasonally, being maximal in summer and minimal in winter, presumably following periods of high and low primary production and photo-degradation. Inter-annually, we found that drought further increased DOM transformation during summer by extending the lake water residence time. Finally, our results demonstrate a rapid response of DOM dynamics to hydrological and meteorological changes at both seasonal and inter-annual scales, suggesting that carbon cycling in clear-water mountain lakes may be highly sensitive to hydrological variation.					; Ejarque, Elisabet/Q-9444-2016; Kainz, Martin/AAG-6268-2021; Schelker, Jakob/H-3734-2018	Ejarque Gonzalez, Elisabet/0000-0002-9399-968X; Kainz, Martin/0000-0002-2388-1504; Schelker, Jakob/0000-0002-0274-7605													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAY	2018	63	3					1355	1371		10.1002/lno.10777	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10777													WOS:000432019600022

It is affected by important active tectonic structures, with high seismic activity and practically continuous micro-seismicity. A recurrent feature from the seismicity observed in volcanic regions is the occurrence of clusters of similar earthquakes, whose origin can be attributed to the repeated action of a similar source mechanism at the same focal area. Doublets/multiplets were identified in this study within a catalogue of small magnitude (usually <3) volcano tectonic events recorded in 2003-2004 by a selection of stations around Fogo volcano. All events have been cross-correlated and pairs whose waveforms exhibited a cross-correlation coefficient equal to or higher than 0.9 were analysed using the coda-wave interferometry technique. Subtle velocity variations found between events highlight a seasonal cycle of the velocity patterns, with lower velocity in winter time and higher velocity during summer months. Those results, together with quantitative differences between the same doublets at different stations, exhibit an excellent correlation with rainfall. A seasonal effect can also be broadly seen in the seismicity occurrence, and some of the swarms recorded over the two year period occur during the wettest season or close to episodes of abundant (above average) rainfall. Moreover, temporal and spatial analysis of several swarms highlighted the lack of any mainshock-aftershock sequence and organized migration of the hypocenters. This is suggestive of a very heterogeneous stress field. Vp/Vs is found to be lower than usually observed in volcanic areas, an occurrence likely related to the presence of steamy fluid associated with the geothermal system. Taken together, these observations suggest that pore pressurisation plays a major role in controlling a considerable part of the recorded seismicity. The geothermal fluids around Fogo massif have been identified as derived from meteoric water, which infiltrates through Fogo Lake and the volcano flanks and flows from south to north on the northern flank. All those elements seem to point to a role played by rainfall in triggering seismicity at Sao Miguel, possibly through pressure changes at depth in response to surface rain and/or an interaction with the geothermal system.

J	Burn, CR				Burn, CR			Tundra lakes and permafrost, Richards Island, western Arctic coast, Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												Lakes, of average size 33 ha, occupy a quarter of the surface area of Richards Island, Northwest Territories. Most of the lakes have a central pool deeper than the thickness of winter ice, and many have prominent, shallow, littoral terraces. The relatively warm lake bottoms cause considerable disturbance to the surrounding continuous permafrost. Water and lake-bottom temperatures, the configuration of permafrost, and active-layer thickness were measured at a tundra lake between 1992 and 1997. The lake is oval, 1.6 km long, 800 m wide, and as deep as 13 m. Sandy terraces, covered by less than 1 m of water, extend over 100 m from the shore. The terraces are underlain by permafrost, which terminates almost vertically at their edge. The annual mean temperature measured at lake bottom in the central pool ranged between 1.5degreesC and 4.8degreesC, depending on depth, and between -0.2degreesC and -5degreesC on the terraces, due to differences in snow cover and proximity to the central pool. In consequence, the temperature of permafrost at 7 m depth in the terraces also varied, from -2degreesC near shore to -5degreesC in mid-terrace. The active layer in the terraces was uniformly 1.4 m deep. Geothermal modelling of talik configuration indicates that there is no permafrost beneath the central pool of the lake. The modelling indicates that, under equilibrium conditions, about one quarter of the lakes on Richards Island have taliks that penetrate permafrost, and at least 10-15% of the island is underlain by talik. Short-term climatic changes predicted for the region imply a small increase in summer lake-water temperature and an extension of the open-water season, accompanied by thicker snow cover in winter. Following such changes, with longer freeze-up and warmer terrace temperatures in winter, permafrost may not be sustainable in the lake terraces.																			0008-4077					AUG	2002	39	8					1281	1298		10.1139/E02-035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E02-035													WOS:000177789000007

In contrast, cities located south of the Great Lakes tended to experience a greater number of excesses during summer. In order to ascertain the key components of PM contributing to these winter exceedances, we examined a regional elevated PM concentration episode which occurred between January 31, 2005 and February 6, 2005. The episode was caused by meteorological stagnation which affected 9 states in the Midwestern US (MN, WI, MI, IA, IL, IN, OH, MO, and KY). The temporal and spatial characteristics of PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 mass and bulk chemistry (nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, organic matter) were measured during this and other wintertime elevated PM episodes at Milwaukee, WI, and compared to Chemical Speciation Network (CSN) data. The observed elevated PM episodes demonstrated that nitrate was the driving anthropogenic component of the wintertime exceedances. This led to the conclusion that winter NOx controls on mobile and stationary sources, in combination with sufficient SO2, VOC and NH3 controls, should be further examined for the mitigation of wintertime PM2.5 episodes in the Midwest. The north-south gradient in exceedances of the PM2.5 NAAQS indicated that strategies for avoidance of violations of the 24-hour standard, and to a lesser degree the annual standard, would benefit from an emphasis on different seasons, and therefore different PM components, depending how far north or south the city is located in the Midwest.

During eight winter periods of above-base level snowpack outflow, and one spring melt period, on the average 25% of the ions were discharged at the following percentages of outflow volumes: Cl- at 11%, NO3- at 13%, SO42- at 18%, and H+ at 20%. Seven of eight winter outflows were associated with low ionic strength rainfall onto the snowpack. Mean solute concentrations during the first 25% and first 50% of the total outflow were significantly greater than during the last 75% and last 50% of the total outflow for Cl-, NO3-, and SO42-, but not for H+. Maximum solute concentrations were up to 2.9 times the overall event volume-weighted mean concentrations for Cl-, 3.7 times for NO3-, 3.0 times for SO42-, and 2.9 times for H+.																			0049-6979					JAN	1992	61	1-2					139	168		10.1007/BF00478371	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00478371													WOS:A1992HB33200010

In the Bothnian Bay, 243 perch (Perca fluviatilis) and 406 ruff (Gymnocephalus cernuus) were studied, of which 60% and 40%, respectively, were infected, while in Lake Yli-Kitaka the prevalences were 10% in 213 perch and 24% in 307 ruff. Higher mean intensities of infection were found in the Bothnian Bay fish than in those from the lake, but no infected fish had as many as 10 worms. Proteocephalus infection in the perch and ruff did not vary significantly according to the length of the fish in earlier area, except that no P. percae were found in perch smaller than 70 mm in the lake. There was a prominent seasonal variation in the occurrence of P. cernuae in the ruff in both areas, but especially in the lake, where no proteocephalids were found in the ruff in July-October. Overlapping of generations was evident in P. percae in the sea perch, although only by vitrue of the lack of mature worms at the end of the summer. Some mature proteocephalids were also found in winter in both fish species in the sea and in the ruff of the lake. The higher mean intensity values in winter, especially in P. cernuae infection in the sea ruff, may be explained partly by the active feeding of the ruff at this time in spite of very low water temperatures. Feeding activity in the perch is lower in the winter, and hence a lower mean intensity of P. percae infection was seen especially in the lake material at that time.																			0015-5683	1803-6465					1989	36	1					33	42											2767548					WOS:A1989T701600006

The high variability of P from 2005 to 2007 during summer and fall (July to October) allowed us to produce water budgets over a large spectrum of wetness conditions at seasonal and event timescales. Bogs and fens (not lakes) have the intrinsic ability to keep the water table near the surface most of the time, which affects Q. Fens and lakes showed a similar hydrological behavior when compared to bogs, in spite of differences in Q and Delta S variability due to the typical vegetation structure of fens. This structure also tends to produce sharper rises of Q when compared to lakes that have overall smoother hydrograms. The dominant water budget term for bogs, fens and lakes was Delta S, Q and Er, respectively. Finally, an adaptation of the Penman-Monteith equation was successfully used to estimate potential ET. This revised method is based on peatland vegetation identification that provides a simple weighing factor for stomatal resistance.					; St-Hilaire, André/W-7120-2019	St-Hilaire, Andre/0000-0001-9161-4742; St-Hilaire, Andre/0000-0001-8443-5885; 													1998-9563	2224-7955					2015	46	1					106	120		10.2166/nh.2014.219	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/nh.2014.219													WOS:000349514300008

In this study, we applied lithostratigraphy, loss on ignition, grain size and pollen analyses to sedimentary sequences from Thale Noi, which is located in the west coast of the Gulf of Thailand, in order to reconstruct the regional environmental history during the 8.2 ka event. Our results, based on sediment. This characteristics and pollen records, indicated that the study area was likely to have flooded prior to c. 8300 cal. a BP. The fall in sea-level coincided with a high precipitation, inferred from grain size, between c. 8250 and 8100 cal a BP. The increased precipitation can be attributed to the strengthening of the northeast (winter) monsoonal rains in the western Gulf of Thailand. The timing of the sea-level fall and strengthen stronger winter monsoon is consistent with the abrupt decrease in the temperature records emanating from the northern hemisphere. Subsequently, we observed a sea-level rise from c. 8100 to 7950 cal a BP, which potentially continued fill c. 7650 cal. a BP. The possibility of coastal erosion was detected by a hiatus in the sedimentary sequences dated between c. 7950 and 7650 cal a BP. Then, a standstill of the sea-level occurred from c. 7650 to 7100 cal a BP. This transgression is suggested to have caused coastal erosion that resulted in a hiatus in the sedimentation process between c. 7950 and 7650 cal a BP. Correspondingly, fluctuations in the monsoon strength resulted in an overall decreased precipitation from c. 8100 to 7450 cal a BP, although punctuated wet intervals were observed at c. 7950 and 7575 cal a BP.

This varve counted interval represents the uppermost 5900 yr of a ca 400 kyr old interglacial lacustrine deposit with a minimum length of 16,000 varve years. Intercalated in the varve succession are: (i) detrital layers, (ii) debris flows (slump deposits), and (iii) micritic calcite layers. The annual couplets are composed of a dominant light summer layer of biochemically precipitated calcite and a thin dark winter layer consisting of organic and minerogenic detritus. Microscopic correlation of individual couplets in two outcrops 130 m apart demonstrated basin-wide continuity of varve deposition. Summer layers have been found to be composed of up to four sub-layers differing in grain size, most likely reflecting discrete pulses of calcite precipitation. Two long periods of pronounced decreases in varve thickness occur within the interglacial (1100 varve years) and during the decline of full interglacial conditions (480 varve years) suggesting colder climatic conditions. The decreases in varve thickness are further accompanied by changes in the pattern of summer sub-layering. The first cold interval reflects an exceptionally long intra-interglacial climatic fluctuation indicating a mode of climatic variability different from the present interglacial. Wavelet analyses of seasonal layer thickness data revealed that periodic variations of solar activity (88-yr and 208-yr cycles) and probably of thermohaline circulation (512-yr cycle) impact on varve formation at certain intervals of the studied time window.

Eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) is a marine foundation species essential for coastal ecosystem services in the temperate northern hemisphere. The elemental (C, N, and P) and isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) contents of eelgrass tissues were measured at nine sampling sites across northern China. Trends at temporal and spatial scales were analyzed to examine temporal-spatial variations in seagrass characteristics, and relationships between different tissues were also analyzed to identify a valuable ecological indicator. Elemental contents (N and P) of eelgrass were variable and demonstrated marked seasonal variations, while the isotope content (delta C-13 and delta N-15) demonstrated marked spatial variations. Elemental contents (N and P) in eelgrass tissues showed a clear annual trend with minima in summer and maxima in spring-winter in Swan Lake. Mean N contents (%) of leaf blades and leaf sheaths in Swan Lake were 2.56 +/- 0.89 and 2.53 +/- 0.96, respectively, and mean P contents of blades and sheaths were 0.31 +/- 0.13 and 0.41 +/- 0.17, respectively. N and P contents were higher in aboveground than in belowground tissues; due to C stability, C/N and C/P were lower in aboveground than in belowgmund tissues. Among different eelgrass populations, the ranges of delta N-15 isotope ratios in leaf blades and leaf sheaths were 5.57-9.64 and 5.89-9.79, respectively. Elemental (N and P) and isotope (delta C-13 and delta N-15) contents of leaf sheaths were positively correlated with those of blades; this was evident regardless of the season and site, suggesting that the sheath elemental and stable isotope content could be a valuable indicator of that in leaf blades for seagrass ecosystem geochemical research.

In the hypolimnion, RSST is dominated by unusually high (up to 5 mM) dissolved divalent. sulfur (S-II), present as H2S + HS- and as inorganic polysulfides (HxSnx-2). Less abundant RSSNV is attributed to dissolved zero-valent sulfur (S-0) in inorganic polysulfides. Assuming negligible contribution of organic S-0 species in the hypolimnion, the equilibrium distribution of polysulfide ions is calculated; S-5(2-) is found to predominate. In the epilimnion, all RSST consists of RSSNV within analytical uncertainty. Through spring and summer, RSST and RSSNV display little vertical or seasonal variation, but they increase dramatically when stratification breaks down in autumn. Based on decay rate, RSS during mixing events is attributed to dissolved S-8 from oxidation of sulfide and decomposition of inorganic polysulfides. This hypothesis quantitatively predicts precipitation of elemental sulfur in a year when colloidal sulfur was observed and predicts no precipitation in a year when it was not observed. Except during mixing events, the entire water column is undersaturated with respect to both rhombic sulfur and biologic sulfur, and the limited variations of RSS exclude hydrophobic and volatile aqueous S-8 as a major species. During such periods, RSS (typically 8 nM) may be associated with organic carbon, perhaps as adsorbed S-8 or as covalently bound polysulfanes or polysulfides. The hypolimnion is viewed as a zero-valent sulfur reactor that creates S-0-containing, dissolved organic macromolecules during stable stratification periods. Some are sufficiently degradation-resistant and hydrophilic to be dispersed throughout the lake during mixing events, subsequently giving rise to similar to 10(-8) M RSS in the oxic water column. Voltammetrically determined RSS in oxic natural waters has often been described as "sulfide" or "metal complexed sulfide", implying an oxidation state of S-II; we argue that RSS in oxic Rogoznica Lake waters is mainly S-0.

Plant foods comprised > 97 aggregate percent dry mass of the canvasback diet. The proportion of plant material eaten did not vary with sex, age, or month, or differ between study sites or nocturnal and diurnal collections. Tubers of chufa flatsedge (Cyperus esculentus) and common arrowhead (Sagittaria latifolia) made up 94% of the canvasback diet at Catahoula Lake. Common and grassy arrowhead (Sagittaria graminea) tubers and American bulrush (Scirpus americanus) rhizomes and seeds formed 94% of the canvasback diet at the Mississippi River Delta. Consumption of specific food taxa did not vary with sex, age, or month at either study site. Canvasbacks at the Mississippi River Delta preferred seeds of American bulrush over all other foods, but American bulrush rhizomes were underrepresented in the diet. Densities of subterranean plant foods at Catahoula Lake and the Mississippi River Delta are apparently higher than at other major canvasback concentration areas and enable canvasbacks wintering in Louisiana to improve their physical condition before spring migration.																			0008-4301					DEC	1990	68	12					2605	2609		10.1139/z90-362	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/z90-362													WOS:A1990EU11200020

Spatial Prediction of Soil Salinity Using Kriging with Measurement Errors and Probabilistic Soft Data	ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT												In this study it is shown how kriging with measurement errors (KME) is useful as opposed to more conventional kriging methods. The goal of the study was to properly account for field measured soil electrical conductivity (EC) as soft data for the spatial prediction of soil salinity. Samplings were done in autumn 2009 (first dataset), spring and autumn 2010 (second and third datasets) around Uromieh Lake, northwest of Iran. The salinity was measured both in the field and laboratory for the first and second datasets. The first dataset was used for error measurements from which an error variance can be estimated. The measured errors were then used for characterizing probabilistic type soft data using the second dataset. The KME with only soft data (SKME), KME with both soft and hard data (HSKME) and ordinary kriging methods were compared. Validation criteria, mean error (ME) and mean squared error (MSE) were used for comparing the methods. Finally, the SKME method was applied as a way of improving the salinity prediction for the third dataset where only field measured soil salinity data were available. Comparing different kriging methods, Ordinary Kriging (OK) showed the best results among the comparing methods with ME and MSE equal to -0.12 and 0.55 respectively. SKME with ME equal to -0.13 was slightly different from OK and SKME with ME equal to -0.24 resulted in more bias predictions among others. KME method has shown to be useful for soil salinity monitoring and can effectively reduce sampling time.

Chronicles of hypoxia: Time-series buoy observations reveal annually recurring seasonal basin-wide hypoxia in Muskegon Lake - A Great Lakes estuary	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												We chronicled the seasonally recurring hypolimnetic hypoxia in Muskegon Lake - a Great Lakes estuary over 3 years, and examined its causes and consequences. Muskegon Lake is a mesotrophic drowned river mouth that drains Michigan's 2nd largest watershed into Lake Michigan. A buoy observatory tracked ecosystem changes in the Muskegon Lake Area of Concern (AOC), gathering vital time-series data on the lake's water quality from early summer through late fall from 2011 to 2013 (www.gvsu.edu/buoy). Observatory-based measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) tracked the gradual development, intensification and breakdown of hypoxia (mild hypoxia <4 mg DO/L, and severe hypoxia <2 mg DO/L) below the similar to 6 m thermocline in the lake, occurring in synchrony with changes in temperature and phytoplankton biomass in the water column during July-October. Time-series data suggest that proximal causes of the observed seasonal hypolimnetic DO dynamics are stratified summer water-column, reduced wind-driven mixing, longer summer residence time, episodic intrusions of cold DO-rich nearshore lake Michigan water, nutrient run off from watershed, and phytoplankton blooms. Additional basin-wide water-column profiling (2011-2012) and ship-based seasonal surveys (2003-2013) confirmed that bottom water hypoxia is an annually recurring lake-wide condition. Volumetric hypolimnetic oxygen demand was high (0.07-0.15 m, DO/Liter/day) and comparable to other temperate eutrophic lakes. Over 3 years of intense monitoring, similar to 9-24% of Muskegon Lake's volume experienced hypoxia for similar to 29-85 days/year - with the potential for hypolimnetic habitat degradation and sediment phosphorus release leading to further eutrophication. Thus, time-series observatories can provide penetrating insights into the inner workings of ecosystems and their external drivers. (C) 2018 The Authors.

The remaining light carbon losses and net sedimentation were calculated from the phytoplankton balance of the lake. On average the physiological losses of algae ranged between 80.5 of primary production in 1986 and 72 % in 1987. Dark carbon losses by respiration ranged between 15 and 20 %, and grazing losses between 24.5 and 21.9 % of gross primary production in 1986 and 1987, respectively. The remaining 16.6 and 23.6 % of primary production which were lost in 1986 and 1987, respectively, are mainly attributed to sedimentation.																			0020-9309						1993	78	3					439	458		10.1002/iroh.19930780314	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.19930780314													WOS:A1993MB33000009
J	Jeffries, MO; Zhang, TJ; Frey, K; Kozlenko, N				Jeffries, MO; Zhang, TJ; Frey, K; Kozlenko, N			Estimating late-winter heat flow to the atmosphere from the lake-dominated Alaskan North Slope	JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY												The conductive heat flux through the snow cover (F-a) is used as a proxy to examine the hypothesis that there is a significant heat flow from the Alaskan North Slope to the atmosphere because of the the large number of lakes in the region. F-a is estimated from measurements of snow depth, temperature and density on tundra, grounded ice and floating ice in mid-April 1997 at six lakes near Barrow, northwestern Alaska. The mean F-a values from tundra, grounded ice and floating ice are 1.5, 5.4 and 18.6 W m(-2), respectively. A numerical model of the coupled snow/ice/water/soil system is used to simulate F-a and there is good agreement between the simulated and measured fluxes. The flux from the tundra is low because the soils have a relatively low thermal conductivity and the active layer cools significantly after freezing completely the previous autumn. The flux from the floating ice is high because the ice has a relatively high thermal conductivity, and a body of relatively warm water remains below the growing ice at the end of winter. The flux from the grounded ice is intermediate between that from the tundra and that from the floating ice, and depends on the timing of the contact between the growing ice and the lake sediments, and whether or not those sediments freeze completely. Using the estimated F-a values combined with the areal fractions of tundra, grounded ice and floating ice derived from synthetic aperture radar images, area-weighted F-a values are calculated for six areas. F-a values for the ice vary between 9.8 and 13.8 W m(-2), and those from the ice plus tundra vary between 3.9 and 5.3 W m(-2). The F-a values are similar to those observed in the sea-ice-covered regions of the south and north polar oceans in winter. The North Slope of Alaska may thus make a significant contribution to the regional energy budget in winter.

In 2010, four standardized field experiments were conducted in Lake Constance, one in each season, to investigate seasonal changes in somatic growth and survival of C. fluminea at different water depths. Somatic growth and survival of the clams were related to seasonal variations in water temperature and seston characteristics, that is, phytoplankton species composition and essential nutrient concentrations, and to the elemental and biochemical composition of clam tissues using principal component analyses and regression models. The field experiments revealed that somatic growth and survival of C. fluminea in LakeConstance were primarily determined by water temperature. In winter, low temperatures (< 5 degrees C) and low food supply resulted in high mortality and zero growth. Positive somatic growthrates were recorded inthe lake throughout the growing oseason, when the water temperatures exceeded 10 degrees C. Other seston variables, that is, particulate organic carbon content, phytoplankton species composition, and the elemental (nitrogen, phosphorus) and biochemical (fatty acids, sterols) nutrient compositionwere of minor importance for growth and survival of C. fluminea in oligotrophic Lake Constance. In parallel to the field experiments, standardized laboratory growth experiments were conducted to assess the effects of temperature on clamgrowth andsurvival at high food quantity and quality. The results from the laboratory experiments confirmed the conclusion that somatic growth and survival of C. fluminea in Lake Constance were primarily determined by water temperature. Our data suggest that further spread of C. fluminea may be supported by climate change, because milder winter temperatures and an earlier onset of thermal stratification in spring may reduce winter mortality and thereby extend the growing season for C. fluminea.

This region owes its origin to effusive and explosive volcanic events that have been going on since the Late Miocene. It consists of lava, ignimbrites, pyroclastic density currents, pyroclastic falls, lahars, and debris avalanche deposits which have been subsequently remolded by glacial and fluvial erosive processes, resulting in the majestic landscape in constant construction. The main landform is the Paletara Caldera within which the Coconucos Volcanic Chain (CVC) occurs, with Purace and Pan de Azucar volcanoes. Volcanism and glacial activity join in the Purace region to form a relief of great scenic value. El Buey and San Rafael Lakes situated amidst a vast plain covered with grassland's domain of frailejones (Espeletia hartwegiana) and Calamagrostis sp. are the source of Bedon River which rushes through a narrow-deep canyon, build on the lava deposits forming the Bedon fall. Also remarkable are the colorful diversity of San Juan, Pozo Azul, and Coconuco hot springs.

However, water level requirements (WLRs) of these plants are not well studied. In the present study, we conducted a systematic assessment of WLRs of Carex cinerascens regarding to each life history stage, based on field investigations and a series of simulation experiments in the Yangtze River floodplain. Results showed that C. cinerascens was well developed in lakes with intermittent water level fluctuations. Its rhizomes could not emerge underwater or in water-saturated conditions, and the optimum soil moisture for emergence was 15-30% with air temperature above 6 degrees C. Its growth was prohibited when the whole plant was inundated (i.e. inundation depth > plant height), and when rate of water level change exceeded 1.2 cm/d. Although summer inundation was not essential for C. cinerascens development, it was beneficial to the plant for excluding competitive species. The timing of habitat inundation was suggested to be after May when the plant matured. The timing of rhizome emergence in the second growing season was determined by when the habitat was exposed. With inclusion of temperature limits, the optimum timing of habitat exposure in autumn was October, and the duration of summer inundation was therefore 0-150 days. We finally combined WLRs of each life history stage and established an integrated WLRs model of C. cinerascens in Yangtze floodplain lakes. It is the first time that such a WLRs model was proposed for hygrophytes in lakes. Moreover, we presented a methodology for assessment of WLRs of hygrophytes which can be widely used in riverine lakes as well as other wetlands. Our results provide important implications for water level management regarding the conservation and rehabilitation of wetland plants.

J	HASLER, AD				HASLER, AD			OBSERVATIONS ON THE WINTER PERCH POPULATION OF LAKE MENDOTA	ECOLOGY												The perch in L. Mendota in winter are caught by gill net most abundantly in the deep water. Nets set at 14 m. in 1943 caught an average of 3 adult perch/25 ft. of net/24 hrs.; those set at 18 m. captured 15.1. In 1944 those set at 18 m. caught an av. of 8.7 and those at 24 m., 21.8 fish/25 ft. net/24 hrs. Of the environmental conditions which might influence this behavior, such as O2 content of the bottom water, temp. abundance of plankton Crustacea and bottom fauna, correlation with the- latter was most striking. Not only were Chaoborus 10 times more abundant at 24 m. than at 18 m., but the perch at 24 m. consumed more of these midges than those at 18 m. Even though O2 was zero on the bottom in late winter it did not retard the perch from plying the bottom for bottom fauna. Evidence is presented that perch swin in schools in the winter much the same as they do in summer. These schools are represented by fish of similar size. The perch attain legal size in the 2d year of life, sexual maturity in the 2d ([male][male]) and 3d ([female][female]) yr. of life. They are in excellent condition (K = 2.1). Pearse recorded the average length of 499 perch captured in 1915 at 116 mm. (6.5 inches); whereas 188 adult perch in 1943 averaged 202 mm. (7.9 inches). The population is evidently growing faster in recent yrs.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1945	26	1					90	94		10.2307/1931918	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1931918													WOS:A1945XX03400009

The average dry and wet deposition fluxes of 15 PAHs were estimated as 879 +/- 1393 ng m(-2) d(-1) and 755 +/- 545 ng m(-2) d(-1), respectively. Gaseous PAH release from seawater to the atmosphere averaged 3114 +/- 1999 ng m(-2) d(-1) in a year round. The air-sea gas exchange of PAHs was the dominant process at the air-sea interface in the YRE as the magnitude of volatilization flux of PAHs exceeded that of total dry and wet deposition. The gas PAH exchange flux was dominated by three-ring PAHs, with the highest value in summer and lowest in winter, indicating a marked seasonal variation owing to differences in Henry's law constants associated with temperature, as well as wind speed and gaseous-dissolved gradient among seasons. Based on the simplified mass balance estimation, a net 11 tons y(-1) of PAHs (mainly three-ring PAHs) were volatilized from seawater to the atmosphere in a similar to 20,000 km(2) area in the YRE. Other than the year-round Yangtze River input and ocean ship emissions, the selective release of low-molecular-weight PAHs from bottom sediments in winter due to resuspension triggered by the East Asian winter monsoon is another potential source of PAHs. This work suggests that the source-sink processes of PAHs at the air-sea interface in the YRE play a crucial role in regional cycling of PAHs.					; Li, Yuanyuan/A-6604-2015; Lin, Tianquan/I-3030-2012	Lin, Tian/0000-0001-9813-7782; Wu, Zilan/0009-0007-8899-3359; 													1352-2310	1873-2844				APR	2018	178						31	40		10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.01.031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.01.031													WOS:000428104200004
J	Roy, R; Wang, Y; Jiang, SJ				Roy, Rupsa; Wang, Yang; Jiang, Shijun			Growth pattern and oxygen isotopic systematics of modern freshwater mollusks along an elevation transect: Implications for paleoclimate reconstruction	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Fossil mollusk shells are widely distributed in the geologic records and their oxygen isotopic compositions have been used to reconstruct seasonality, local climatic and elevation conditions. However, interpretation of isotope data from fossil shells to estimate paleoclimate and elevation is often ambiguous. This study examines the oxygen isotopic systematics of modern freshwater gastropods (Bellamya and Radix) shells along an elevation/ climate transect in the Asian monsoon region of China to improve the accuracy of paleoclimate and paleoelevation reconstruction using stable isotopes in fossil shells. The results from sclerochronological analyses of the shells show that the intra-shell oxygen isotopic pattern is determined by seasonal variations in lake water temperature and water isotopic composition as well as the life cycle of the organism. Both Bellamya and Radix appear to grow throughout the year in lakes where water temperature does not fall below 13 degrees C. Radix in the high elevation cold habitat, although prefers to grow in the warmer months, can survive through the freezing temperature. The delta O-18 patterns in the shells are similar across the elevation/climate transect, showing high delta O-18 values in the winter months and low delta O-18 values in the summer months, consistent with the expected pattern in Asian monsoon region. The average growth rates of the shells were highest at the lowest elevation site (warm and humid climate) but were similar at the mid to high elevation sites. For large shells (> 2.2 cm for Bellamya and > 1.4 cm for Radix), average growth temperatures, calculated using the aragonite oxygen isotope thermometer, closely approximate the annual mean water temperature while their infra-shell variability is a good proxy for the amplitude of seasonal variations in monthly air temperature. This suggests that large shells of both Bellamya and Radix are excellent archives of lake environmental conditions and most suitable for paleoenvironmental studies.					; Roy, Rupsa/AAY-8921-2020; jiang, shijun/J-2443-2014	Jiang, Shijun/0000-0001-6259-7912; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				OCT 15	2019	532								109243	10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.109243	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2019.109243													WOS:000484871600005

Analysing changes in short-duration extreme rainfall events	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-WATER MANAGEMENT												Two approaches are presented for using the UKCP09 weather generator (WG) to assess changes in extreme short-duration rainfall. The first provides change factors for design storms of varying duration and frequency, building on established hydrological techniques and with uncertainty estimation. The second approach characterises and facilitates the selection of WG timeseries for use in impact models. The methods have been tested at ten case study sites around the UK. The results show an increase in the intensity of short-duration (1 h and 12 h) events in winter but a reduction in summer, although the latter is subject to high levels of uncertainty. The number of intense events increases slightly and more significantly for some locations, especially in winter. Generally, it is hard to establish any conclusions geographically, although increases in rainfall intensity and events in the Lake District site stand out. The methods provide practical techniques for utilising the UKCP09 WG to assess the impacts of climate change, in particular for urban drainage and sewer modelling.

Both populations were dominated by the 1979 yr class that presumably entered the lake as larvae in the year that the Brouwerssluice, which opens to the North Sea, was operative all year. Due to high summer temperatures in the lake, juvenile plaice (yr class 1981) attained a mean length of 13.0 cm and a fresh weight of 27.4 g at the end of their 1st growing season. At the end of thee 3rd yr, yr class 1979 males measured on average 27.7 cm and females 29.7 cm, .apprx. 3.5 cm more than plaice of the same age in the North Sea. Flounder reached a mean length of 26.3 cm in 3 yr. Total stock of plaice, excluding yr class 1981, was estimated at an average of 1.3 million over 1980 and at 0.6 million fish over 1981. For flounder these figures were 0.7 million and 0.2 million fish, respectively. In Sept. 1981, the number of O-group plaice was assessed at .apprx. 0.2 million individuals. About 56% of the plaice food consisted of polychaetes, mainly consisting of, in 1980, Arenicola marina (41%) and, in 1981, A. marina (15%), Nereidae (15%) and Nephthys hombergii (11%). Larger plaice consumed significantly more Arenicola and less Tharyx marioni than smaller ones. Polychaetes and crustaceans were eaten all year while consumption of mollusks was restricted to sumemr and that of fish to autumn and winter. In 1980, flounder preyed upon crustaceans (41%) and polychaetes (37%), with A. marina (36%) and Crangon crangon (25%) as the most important species. In 1981, relatively more polychaetes (53%) and less crustaceans (14%) were eaten.

Ecology of Thamnophis sauritus (Eastern Ribbon Snake) at the northern limit of its range	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												In Canada, Thamnophis sauritus (Eastern Ribbon Snake) is found only in Southern Ontario and a small area Of Southwestern Nova Scotia. Although the Nova Scotia Population is nationally designated as threatened, its distribution, seasonal activity. movement patterns, and over-wintering sites remain undescribed. We used radio-telemetry, capture-mark recapture, and direct observation to: 1) assess abundance, summer activity, and movement: and 2) to locate and characterize a hibernaculum for Eastern Ribbon Snakes in Kejimkujik National Park, NS. A total of 105 individuals were marked: among these. 13 free-ranging adults were surgically implanted with radio-transmitters and tracked from June until mid-November 2001. From late May to September, snakes were always found within 5 m of water, with summer ranges on land that rarely exceeded 5 x 10 m. From September to mid-October, snakes moved LIP to 173 in away from the shoreline. Eleven observations of snakes feeding on anurans (Ranidae) and fish (Cyprinidae) were made at temporary pools, marginal to the lake. Despite the use of radio-telemetry, only one hibernaculum was found. Our observations indicate that the Eastern Ribbon Snake is relatively sedentary; its low activity rate and small activity range may make it vulnerable to local extinction.																			1092-6194	1938-5307					2007	14	2					279	292		10.1656/1092-6194(2007)14[279:EOTSER]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/1092-6194(2007)14[279:EOTSER]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000247628300009

J	Swanson, SK; Bahr, JM				Swanson, SK; Bahr, JM			Analytical and numerical models to explain steady rates of spring flow	GROUND WATER												Flow from some springs in former glacial lakebeds of the Upper Midwest is extremely steady throughout the year and does not increase significantly after precipitation events or seasonal recharge. Analytical and simplified numerical models of spring systems were used to determine whether preferential ground water flow through high-permeability features in shallow sandstone aquifers could produce typical values of spring discharge and the unusually steady rates of spring flow. The analytical model is based on a one-dimensional solution for periodic ground water flow. Solutions to this model suggest that it is unlikely that a periodic forcing due to seasonal variations in areal recharge would propagate to springs in a setting where high-permeability features exist. The analytical model shows that the effective length of the aquifer, or the length of flowpaths to a spring, and the total transmissivity of the aquifer have the greatest potential to impact the nature of spring flow in this setting. The numerical models show that high-permeability features can influence the magnitude of spring flow and the results demonstrate that the lengths of ground water flowpaths increase when high-permeability features are explicitly modeled, thus decreasing the likelihood for temporal variations in spring flow.

However, the understanding about the dominant pathways of N cycling keep limited due to the high complexity of N cycle processes in lacustrine environment. The N fractions in sediments collected from Shijiuhu Lake were measured using high-resolution (HR)-Peeper technique and chemical extraction method in varied seasons. The abundance and microbial community compositions of functional genes involved in various N-cycling processes were also obtained using high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that NH4+ concentrations in the pore water remarkably increased from the upper layer toward the deeper layer and from winter to spring. This trend suggested that higher temperature facilitated the accumulation of NH4+ in the water. Decreased NO3- concentrations were also detected at deeper sediment layers and higher temperature, indicating the intensification of N reduction on anaerobic conditions. The NH4+-N concentrations reduced in spring along with the slight change of NO3--N in solid sediment, indicating the desorption and release of mobile NH4+ from solid phase to the solution. Remarkably decreased absolute abundances of functional genes were found in spring with DNRA bacteria nrfA gene as dominant genus and Anaeromyxobacter as the most dominant bacterium (21.67 +/- 1.03%). Higher absolute abundance (146.2-788.1 x 10(5) Copies/g) of nrfA gene relative to other genes was mainly responsible for the increase of bio-available NH4+ in the sediments. Generally, microbial DNRA pathway predominated the N reduction and retention processes in the lake sediment at higher temperature and water depth even experiencing the suppression of DNRA bacteria abundance. These results suggested the existence of ecological risk via N retention by the action of the DNRA bacteria in the sediment on the condition of higher temperature, further provided valuable information for N management of eutrophic lakes.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				SEP 1	2023	341								118050	10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118050	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118050		MAY 2023						37141713					WOS:000998628400001

These deposition systems include both peat and limnic deposits, providing valuable sites to study their evolutionary history shaped by their sensitivity to climate-forced state shifts. To investigate the maar lake-mire shift in response to hydroclimatic variability, we examined developmental history of the Jinchuan peatland based on sedimentary facies, grain-size, physical and chemical properites, plant macrofossils and peat basal age. The results indicate that the Jinchuan peatland mainly originated from paludification in a maar lake from approximately 7000 cal. BP. Its water level continuously increased since the Middle Holocene, reaching the peak during the period of 5000-4000 cal. yr BP. The outward expansions of Jinchuan peatland suggest a climate driven model based on which water level variability superimposes the underlying basin morphology. The hydroclimatic variability and peatland development history can be divided into three periods. From 12 to 7 ka cal. BP, the increasing East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) was the major water vapor source of Jinchuan peatland. The strong evaporation effects induced by the strong Winter Asian winter monsoon (WAWM) and the maximum sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of Japan Sea might have changed the Jinchuan maar lake into dry upland. From 7 to 4 ka cal. BP, the maximum EASM and increasing Westerly jet (WJ) provided water vapor for the peatland. The decreasing EAWM and SSTs of Japan Sea resulted in decreased evaporation effects. The moisture and water level in Jinchuan peatland gradually increased. The peat covered 68.97% of the area during this period. Since 4 ka cal. BP, the decreased EASM and the maximum WJ provided water vapor for the Jinchuan peatland. The weak EAWM and the lower SSTs of Japan Sea induced lower evaporation effects. The moisture and water level in the peatland reached the maximum. Subsequently, peat area further expanded and covered the remaining 31.03% area. This study reveals a remarkable link between the maar lake-mire shift and hydroclimatic variability, which is significant for future prediction of maar lake-mire ecosystem shifts under global climate change.

Laboratory experiments demonstrated that part of the Cs-137 inventory of the sediment is readily exchangeable and that ion exchange with biologically produced ammonium ions is the dominating process for the release into the lake water. It is proposed that the seasonal cycling is the result of two contrary processes, on one hand the flux from the sediment into the water throughout the year due to microbial decomposition of organic matter and on the other hand the incorporation of dissolved cesium into organic matter in the water due to biological production in summer combined with the consumption of ammonium by plants.																			0166-1116		0-444-82533-9				1997	68						141	150																WOS:000074021900010
J	HOLMES, JA; LIN, P				HOLMES, JA; LIN, P			THERMAL NICHE OF LARVAL SEA LAMPREY, PETROMYZON-MARINUS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We used behavioral and physiological responses of larval sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, to temperature to describe the thermal niche and define optimal thermal habitat. Acclimation temperature had a weak direct positive effect on acute preferred temperatures in summer but no effect on acute preferred temperatures in winter tests. Swimming speed, mass, and acclimation temperature accounted for 66% of the variation in the active metabolic rate of larval sea lamprey. When larvae are swimming at their maximum prolonged rate, the relationship between temperature and metabolic rate is a unimodal curve, as has been found for more active fish species. The final preferred temperature in summer, 20.8-degrees-C, is similar to the temperature at which maximum scope for activity occurs, approximately 19-degrees-C. We propose the ''fundamental thermal niche' of larval sea lamprey to be the range of temperatures between 17.8 and 21.8-degrees-C. Some practical applications for the thermal niche are sketched with respect to the integrated management of sea lamprey in the Great Lakes.																			0706-652X					FEB	1994	51	2					253	262		10.1139/f94-026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-026													WOS:A1994NH23300002

The experimental treatments were three concentrations of CO2, 270, 380 and 750 ppm, which represented preindustrial and present levels and the level predicted for the end of this century, respectively. The elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration increased the sestonic C:P ratio, particularly in the spring when the C:P ratio was two-fold greater at the high level of CO2 than at the low level of CO2. As a result, the contribution of Bosmina to total crustacean zooplankton abundance increased, most likely because of the low phosphorus content and high adaptability to foods with large elemental ratio variation. The other dominant crustacean zooplankton genera, including Daphnia, Ceriodaphnia, Diaphanosoma and Sinocalanus, had no response to the change in pCO(2) during the microcosm experiments. The shift in crustacean zooplankton community structure between two seasons was primarily due to the transition of the phytoplankton community. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thermokarst lakes (bodies of freshwater that collect in depressions formed by thawing permafrost) cover 20% of Arctic lowlands and are naturally prone to causing catastrophic flooding. Cumulative lake drainage over time has resulted in up to 60% landscape coverage by drained thermokarst lake basins (DTLBs). Although the impacts of lake drainage on ecosystems and infrastructure have long been considered a potential hazard, these occurrences are usually viewed as one-time events. However, recent observations in northern Alaska highlight a previously unrecognized threat: annually recurring snow-dam outburst floods from DTLBs. Each winter, blowing snow fills DTLB drainage gullies, impounding meltwater in the spring and - upon snow-dam failure - releasing downstream floods. Data collected from 14 DTLBs in Alaska reveal a wide range in flood peaks, many of which exceed river flood events, providing a missing link in Arctic ecosystem hydrology. Projected snowier winters may result in even larger snow-dam outbursts from DTLBs, adding uncertainty to future risk assessments. If climate change also drives enhanced lake drainage, we predict even more sporadic and higher magnitude floods, with implications for downstream ecosystems and human infrastructure as development pushes into the Arctic lowlands.

However, there are limited data to describe the type and number of illness or injury that may occur during mass gatherings in an alpine winter environment. To describe the epidemiology of illness and injury seen among spectators at the alpine and snowboarding venues during the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympic Games, we conducted a retrospective review of the Salt Lake City 2002 Olympic Medical Care database for all patient encounters during the operational period of the Games at the alpine and snowboarding venues. The three venues included were: Deer Valley Resort (DVR), Park City Mountain Resort (PCM), and Snowbasin Resort (SBA). Each venue had a medical clinic located on site for spectators and another for athletes. Physicians, nurses, emergency medical technicians, and therapists staffed the clinics. The database was created by Intermountain Health Care (IHC) in conjunction with Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympic staff and consisted of descriptive reports of all patient encounters from all venues including demographic, epidemiology, and outcome information. IHC maintains the database, and was the sole medical provider for the Games. Each venue had at least 6 days of competition events. Over the 19 days of the Olympiad, a total of 410,160 spectators and 3,961 competitive athletes attended the three venues. There were 841 spectators evaluated and treated at the venue clinics, and mobile medical staff treated 262 spectators. The top five spectator clinic diagnostic categories were: sprain/strain (n = 108), miscellaneous trauma (n = 103), respiratory (n = 88), miscellaneous medical (n = 69), and digestive (n = 52). Fifty spectators required transport to a hospital for additional care: 27 required transfer by ground ambulance and the remainder were transported by private vehicle. The overall spectator medical utilization rate was 26.9. In conclusion, the rate and acuity of patients seen at the alpine venues during the 2002 Winter Olympic Games was low. Nevertheless, we recommend full on-site physician and nurse staffing with advanced trauma and cardiac life support available during similar events.

J	Badger, TC; Watters, RJ				Badger, TC; Watters, RJ			Gigantic seismogenic landslides of Summer Lake Basin, south-central Oregon	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Subsidence of Summer Lake basin, situated in the northwestern Basin and Range province in south-central Oregon, has exposed a kilometer-thick Neogene sequence of dense volcanic flow rocks overlying very weak tuffaceous sedimentary rocks in the bounding Winter Ridge-Slide Mountain escarpment. Subsidence occurs along the active, 40-km-long, Winter Ridge-Slide Mountain fault, which is capable of producing M-w approximate to 7 earthquakes with near-field, maximum horizontal acceleration approaching 1g. Gigantic landslides cubic kilometers in volume scallop the southwestern part of the escarpment, and the deposits run out several kilometers, characteristic of rock avalanches. Geotechnical rock-mass characterization and slope-stability analyses confirm observations that these landslides were initiated within the weak tuffaceous sedimentary rocks along shallow, east-dipping, planar failure surfaces, are insensitive to groundwater fluctuations, and are stable under static conditions. Pseudostatic analyses reveal that strong shaking is required to trigger land-sliding. The Bennett Flat landslide failed as a single event between 900-270 ka and 16.8 ka; the landslide has a depletion-zone volume of 1.1 km(3), but only 0.3 km(3) of debris is discernible in the accumulation zone. The Foster Creek landslide also appears to have failed as a single event between 180 and 16.8 ka; the landslide has a depletion-zone volume of 2.9 km(3), but only 0.3 km(3) of debris is discernible in the accumulation zone. The Punchbowl landslide evidences multiple events, the most recent of which failed in the Holocene and had a volume of 0.4 km(3); 0.5 km(3) of debris is found in the accumulation zone.																			0016-7606	1943-2674				MAY-JUN	2004	116	5-6					687	697		10.1130/B25333.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/B25333.1													WOS:000221045900012

Previous studies have shown that these low-molecular-weight (LMW) substrates are released by phytoplankton but also that unidentified LMW compounds of terrestrial origin is a subsidy for bacterial metabolism in unproductive freshwater systems. We tested the hypothesis that different terrestrially derived CA, AA and CH compounds can offer substantial support for aquatic bacterial metabolism in fresh waters that are dominated by allochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM). Drainage water from three catchments of different characters in the Krycklan experimental area in Northern Sweden were studied at the rising and falling limb of the spring flood, using a 2-week bioassay approach. A variety of CA, AA and CH compounds were significantly assimilated by bacteria, meeting 15-100% of the bacterial carbon demand and explaining most of the observed variation in bacterial growth efficiency (BGE; R-2 = 0.66). Of the 29 chemical species that was detected, acetate was the most important, representing 45% of the total bacterial consumption of all LMW compounds. We suggest that LMW organic compounds in boreal spring flood drainage could potentially support all in situ bacterial production in receiving lake waters during periods of weeks to months after the spring flood.

To examine spatial and temporal patterns of fish abundance in macrophyte stands we sampled fish bimonthly with fine-meshed fish traps by day and night in giant rush habitats of a River Murray billabong between October 1995 and September 1996. Three native and three exotic species were found within these habitats during the study, however, catches were dominated by two species of native carp gudgeons (Hypseleotris spp.). Consistently higher numbers of gudgeons were trapped during the day than at night throughout the study period and there was a sustained decline in catch from spring in the first year to the following spring. The results suggest recruitment of juvenile fish spawned during the summer was insufficient for relative abundance to return to the high numbers found at the start of the study. Fine-scale distribution of carp gudgeons within emergent macrophytes was not generally explained by variability in either physical structure or physicochemical variability. This contrasts with many studies of small fish assemblages in macrophytes where piscivorous predators are present.

The new context of opening of the electricity market reinforces this aspect surely. It is from the knowledge of the high and middle altitude snow cover and thanks to the measure of the precipitations of winer and spring, that EDF can calculate, since the beginning of the winter and until the end of the spring of the forecastings actualized of replenishment contributions in the lakes of altitude. A modern network of devices of automatic measure of teh equivalent in water of the layer of snow associated to complementary manual measures permits to follow non-stop the evolution of the resource and to actualize the forecasting of it to every variation important of the snow stock. The recourse to the satellite imagery can bring an interesting complement to the isolated observations of the snow coat, notably in period of fusion, when the spatial heterogeneity of the coat is stronger and when the isolated measures cannot be considered as representation. But the state of the art on the subject and the related to economic costs slow down the potential operational use of these techniques.																			0018-6368						2002		1					76	78		10.1051/lhb/2002011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/lhb/2002011													WOS:000176281600012

Resting stages and ecology of the planktonic diatom Aulacoseira skvortzowii in Lake Baikal	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Populations of the planktonic diatom Aulacoseira skvortzowii in Lake Baikal developed below 4 degrees C, with mortality increasing rapidly at temperatures above 6.5 degrees C. Resting spores were produced before the temperature rise associated with summer stratification. The main cue for sporulation was a decline in phosphate concentration below 15-20 mu g L-1 P-PO4. If phosphate declined after the onset of stratification, sporulation was poor. In culture, all cells sporulated when phosphate limited but only 15% did so when nitrate limited. Also, spore formation was diameter dependent, with most narrow cells switching to size regeneration. This affected population dynamics, with high biomasses developing in the south and middle basins but only rarely in the north basin, because phosphate did not always fall below the induction threshold necessary for sporulation and size regeneration, leading to poor recruitment. In culture, germination occurred when spores were placed in new media, with stored reserves sufficient to complete two to three divisions, even in the dark. This helped populations re-establish when resuspended by wave action from coastal sediments where they lay dormant during summer.

J	Ahsan, AKMQ; Blumberg, AF				Ahsan, AKMQ; Blumberg, AF			Three-dimensional hydrothermal model of Onondaga Lake, New York	JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING-ASCE												A three-dimensional time-dependent hydrodynamic model of Onondaga Lake, an inland lake in central New York, emphasizing the simulation of dynamics and thermal structure has been developed. The model is based on the ECOM family of models; this version, called ECOMsiz, employs a semi-implicit time splitting algorithm and a z-level vertical coordinate system. Proper assignment of boundary conditions, especially surface heat fluxes, has been found crucial in simulating the lake's hydrothermal dynamics. Formulas for atmospheric radiation and sensible and latent heat fluxes are introduced, which have been found most appropriate for evaluating the heat budget for this midlatitudinal urban lake. The ECOMsiz model has been calibrated and validated against data for two years, 1985 and 1989, representing a wide spectrum of atmospheric and hydrographic conditions in the lake. These two years, marked by significantly different freshwater inputs from tributary inflows, ionic waste loadings, wind forcing, and atmospheric heating and cooling, form a firm basis for evaluating the robustness of the hydrodynamic model. The simulation period chosen for both years, April through October, spans the entire range of lake physical processes as it covers the well-mixed spring condition, the summer period marked by strong vertical stratification, and the well-mixed fall period. Significant differences in thermal structure have been observed in 1985 and 1989 as a result of different meteorological conditions. The mixed layer depth in 1985 is about 3 m deeper (about 9 m) than that in 1989 (about 6 m), consistent with a stronger prevailing wind in 1985. The model has successfully predicted the mixed layer depth for both the years. The model computed total heat storage for both years is in good agreement with the observed conditions.

J	Anneville, O; Pelletier, JP				Anneville, O; Pelletier, JP			Recovery of Lake Geneva from eutrophication: quantitative response of phytoplankton	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												During the seventies Lake Geneva (Switzerland-France) became eutrophic. Measures to reduce phosphorus inputs into the lake have been successful as the concentration of phosphorus has progressively decreased since 1981. This paper describes the long-term quantitative response of phytoplankton (primary production, total phytoplankton biomass, and chlorophyll-a) with regard to the decline in soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration. The annual means of phytoplankton parameters do not show the expected decrease. The long-term trends of annual means appeared to be the resultant of compensating trends which occurred in each season. SRP concentrations indicate that phytoplankton may be phosphorus limited only during summer which appears to be the most appropriate season to study the quantitative response of phytoplankton. From 1981 to 1992, the summer algal biomass and chlorophyll-a have been correlated to the late winter concentration of SRP. However, in the recent years, algal biomass and chlorophyll-a increased while phosphorus remained at low concentrations. This paradoxal increase in total biomass was due to the accumulation of inedible filamentous algae. The observed resilience of phytoplankton is a problem in terms of lake management. These results stress the importance of an appropriate time scale study and bring back into question the use of parameters such as primary production, total phytoplankton biomass, and chlorophyll-a for lake management.																			0003-9136					JUL	2000	148	4					607	624																WOS:000088375000008

In the context of on-going regional to global change, we here aim at identifying and understanding mechanisms behind spatial and temporal variability and trends in the flow of the Selenga River and its tributaries, based on hydrological and meteorological station data (since the 1930s), remote sensing, and statistical analyses. Results show that the flow of the Selenga River exhibits cycles with phases of high flows lasting 12 to 17 years and phases of low flows that historically lasted for about 7 years. However, despite an asynchronous behavior between right-bank tributaries and left-bank tributaries, the flow of the Selenga River near its delta at Lake Baikal has now been low (30% below the 1934-1975 average) for as long as 20 years, due to reduced input from precipitation, particularly during the summer season. Observed decreases in annual maximum hourly flows and decreases in annual minimum 30-day flows are consistent with increasing activation of the groundwater system due to thawing permafrost, and higher winter temperatures that support increased winter flows by preventing rivers to freeze from top to bottom. These recent and relatively large changes have implications for regional water planning and management, including the planned large-scale hydropower expansion in the upper part of the Selenga River Basin.					; Grigorev, Vadim/AAN-9928-2020; Zotov, Leonid/C-3426-2014; Frolova, Natalia/AAT-2671-2020; Belyakova, Pelagiya/X-8153-2018; Sazonov, Alexey/P-3702-2014	Jarsjo, Jerker/0000-0003-3407-8618; Zotov, Leonid/0000-0003-4110-0967; Belyakova, Pelagiya/0000-0003-3752-5460; Grigoriev, Vadim/0000-0001-8757-7344													1436-3798	1436-378X				OCT	2017	17	7					1965	1976		10.1007/s10113-017-1199-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-017-1199-0													WOS:000418588400010

Field beetles had a greater efficiency on oats than wheat. Previous laboratory studies on ''Lakeland'' barley seedlings found that beetles were most efficient shortly after the initiation of oviposition; but beetle feeding on oats began almost 1 mo. later than on wheat. When beetles were transferred from wheat to oats and back to wheat, a substantial increase in efficiency occurred while the beetles were on oats.																			0046-225X	1938-2936					1976	5	3					487	491		10.1093/ee/5.3.487	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/5.3.487													WOS:A1976BV63300019

We then related plant responses in alpine and arctic tundra to soil and air temperature.. parallel experiments were conducted in an alpine moist meadow at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, and in arctic dry heath and moist tussock tundra near Toolik Lake Alaska. We added 99%-enriched (NH4NO3)-N-15-N-15 (0.5 g N m(-2)) to the snowpack, and traced the fate of the N-15 into plants and soil by harvesting samples before snowmelt ended. All alpine and arctic plants acquired N during snowmelt. However, alpine plants acquired 100 times more N than arctic plants. Using data from published studies, we estimated season-long N demand for the vascular plant species. In the: alpine tundra, N uptake during snowmelt constituted over 12% of season-long uptake for a graminoid species, and averaged 7.4% for perennial forbs. In contrast, N uptake during snowmelt by arctic plants averaged less than 0.1% of season-long N uptake. Soil temperatures were similar in these systems during snowmelt, averaging -0.4 degreesC in the arctic and -0.5 degreesC in the alpine tundra. However, arctic plants experienced lower winter soil temperatures, than alpine plants. Winter soil surface temperatures averaged -7.75 degreesC in arctic and -2.43 degreesC in alpine tundra systems, and the lowest weekly mean temperature was -14.5 degreesC in the arctic and -6.14 degreesC in the alpine systems. Thus, differences in plant N uptake are likely due to winter conditions, rather than conditions that occurred during uptake. In conclusion, plant acquisition of N resources during snow-melt is important in alpine systems.

J	Steckenreuter, A; Harcourt, R; Möller, L				Steckenreuter, Andre; Harcourt, Robert; Moeller, Luciana			Are Speed Restriction Zones an effective management tool for minimising impacts of boats on dolphins in an Australian marine park?	MARINE POLICY												The small, genetically distinct population of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in Port Stephens, New South Wales (NSW), is the target of the largest dolphin-watching industry in Australia and falls within the recently created Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park The effectiveness of Speed Restriction Zones (SRZs) as a management tool in this area was investigated during their second year of implementation by comparing dolphin usage and behaviour to adjacent Control Zones (CZs) of similar habitat. For this purpose, boat-based surveys and focal follows of dolphin groups were carried out in the zones between August 2008 and August 2009. Results showed that SRZs were more intensely used by dolphin-watching boats in summer. There was no change in dolphins' behaviour and group structure in the presence of dolphin-watching boats in SRZs when compared to dolphin groups within as in any season. Dolphin groups including calves used SRZs less during summer. The latter may indicate a shift in area utilisation for those groups during intense boat traffic by dolphin-watching operators. CZs were more important than SRZs as foraging grounds for dolphins in summer. This indicates that SRZs as specified are not effective at minimising boating impacts and that the location of these zones should in time be revised. This is important information for management of dolphin-watching within this marine park and an example of adaptive management in progress. Moreover these results are relevant for conservation of dolphins and the management of dolphin-watching industries elsewhere, particularly new industries, where management strategies may incorporate marine protected areas including zoning plans.

Physical controls and processes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The surface energy balance of Lake Superior was measured using the eddy covariance method at a remote, offshore site at 0.5-h intervals from June 2008 through November 2010. Pronounced seasonal patterns in the surface energy balance were observed, with a five-month delay between maximum summer net radiation and maximum winter latent and sensible heat fluxes. Late season (winter) evaporation and sensible heat losses from the lake typically occurred in two- to three-day-long events, and were associated with significant release of stored heat from the lake. The majority of the evaporative heat loss (70-88%) and sensible heat loss (97-99%) occurred between October and March, with 464 mm (2008-2009) and 645 mm (2009-2010) of evaporative water loss occurring over the water year starting October 1. Evaporation was proportional to the horizontal wind speed, inversely proportional to the ambient vapor pressure, and was well described by the ratio of wind speed to vapor pressure. This ratio remained relatively constant between the two water years, so the differences in evaporative water loss between years were largely associated with differences in lake surface conditions (e.g. water temperature, ice cover, and ice duration). Since late-season water temperature decline is driven by evaporative and sensible heat loss, the potential for a negative feedback mechanism between evaporation and ice cover is discussed.

Prominent climate anomalies between 6 and 5 ka have received considerable attention recently due to their cultural significance. Here, we compiled climate and pollen records from 31 sites in eastern China documenting an environmental crisis around 6000 years ago, named as "the 6.0 ka event". These records were previously retrieved from lacustrine, loess, peat and marine sediments and speleo-them. Our synthesis indicates that the East Asian summer monsoon significantly weakened during this event, while the East Asian winter monsoon markedly strengthened, forced by an intensification of the Siberian high. Consequently, changes in East Asian monsoons led to a cooling and drying climatic condition during the 6.0 ka event in eastern China. This centennial-scale climate deterioration inevitably resulted in the response of vege-tation, i.e., remarkable declines of tree cover at mid-latitudes and contraction of evergreen broadleaved forest in subtropical regions, giving way to cool-/drought-tolerant taxa (e.g., steppe grass or conifers). The amplitudes of monsoon and vegetation changes were comparable with those during the 8.2 ka and 4.2 ka events. Furthermore, absolutely dated speleothem isotope records help constrain the period of this environmental crisis between about 6.3 and 5.7 ka, characterized by a double-plunging structure. This environmental crisis was, most importantly, coeval with a decline in the prehistorical human population and agricultural activity, which was, however, followed by an exponential growth soon after. We propose an environmental crisis and its cultural impact in eastern China around 6000 years ago, highlighting the fact that abrupt climate change played an important role in prehistorical culture.					汤, 永杰/JJD-9646-2023; Wan, Qiuchi/KUF-3050-2024; Chen, Cong/IQU-9080-2023; huang, kangyou/JPL-4936-2023														0031-0182	1872-616X				AUG 15	2023	624								111652	10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111652	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111652		MAY 2023											WOS:001060916400001

Based on a comparison with snowpack and cumulative snowmelt, the bulk sampler overcollected major ions by factors ranging from 6 to 22%. Nitrate appeared to be prferentially collected by the bulk sampler relative to SO42- during snow events. Dry deposition was estimated to be 12 and 5% of total deposition for SO42- and NO3-, respectively. Ion budgets for cumulative bulk deposition and snowmelt supported the hypotheses that ion losses from the snowpack are insignificant during a winter having no melt episodes. Snowmelt was characterized by chemical fractionation of major ions; SO42- and H+ in initial meltwaters were 10 times more concentrated than the premelt snowpack. Preferential elutions of ions in the snowmelt followed the sequence: SO42- > NO3- > H+ > Cl-. Snowmelt chemistry was used to predict changes in lake chemistry: H+, NO3-, and NH4+ levels should increase in lake waters; Ca2+ decreases through dilution by snowmelt; SO42- concentrations remain fairly constant.																			0706-652X	1205-7533					1988	45			1			38	46																WOS:A1988Q784000004

This dominance of large phytoplankton and its exudation as well as the low biomass of small phytoplankton lead to a high ratio of exudation to edible primary production, As bacteria can effectively use exudates, they could be an important alternative food source for zooplankton. We investigated primary production (PP) in various size fractions and bacterial production (BP) in the hypertrophic Bautzen reservoir (Germany) in order to test whether (1) high PP can promote high BP and (2) BP can amount to similar values as particulate PP of the edible fraction. The main part of PP was produced by non-edible colonies of Microcystis spp. in summer and fall. The dynamics of BP and PP showing maximum activities in July and October were closely coupled. The strong relationship between BP and PP (r(2) = 0.98) indicates that allochthonous DOC (dissolved organic carbon) should be of Little importance for bacteria. Consequently, PP was their main DOC source, but exudation could not cover bacterial organic carbon demand at the maxima of BP. The mean ratio of BP to PP was 3.5%, a low value typical for hypertrophic waters. However, BP amounted to similar or higher values than particulate PP of the edible fraction with respect to carbon production in summer and fall. Since the dominating daphnids are considered to be able to graze effectively on bacteria, it must be assumed that bacteria should be an equally important food source for Daphnia as edible phytoplankton.

J	Weber, SJ; Mishra, DR; Wilde, SB; Kramer, E				Weber, Samuel J.; Mishra, Deepak R.; Wilde, Susan B.; Kramer, Elizabeth			Risks for cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms due to land management and climate interactions	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The frequency and severity of cyanobacteria harmful blooms (CyanoHABs) have been increasing with frequent eutrophication and shifting climate paradigms. CyanoHABs produce a spectrum of toxins and can trigger neurological disorder, organ failure, and even death. To promote proactive CyanoHAB management, geospatial risk modeling can act as a predictive mechanism to supplement current mitigation efforts. In this study, iterative AIC analysis was performed on 17 watershed-level biophysical parameters to identify the strongest predictors based on Sentinel-2-derived cyanobacteria cell densities (CCD) for 771 waterbodies in Georgia Piedmont. This study used a streamlined watershed delineation technique, a 1-meter LULC classification with similar to 88% accuracy, and a technique to predict CyanoHAB risk in small-to-medium sized waterbodies. Landscape characteristics were computed utilizing the Google Earth Engine platform that enabled large spatio-temporal scope and variable inclusion. Watershed maximum winter temperature, percent agriculture, percent forest, percent impervious, and waterbody area were the strongest predictors of CCD with a 0.33 R-squared. Warmer winter temperatures allow cyanobacteria to be photosynthetically active year-round, and trigger CyanoHABs when warmer temperatures and nutrients are introduced in early spring, typically referred to as Spring Bloom in southeast U.S. The risk models revealed an unexpected significant linear relationship between percent forest and CCD. It is due to the fact that land reclamation via reforestation in the piedmont have left legacy sediment and nutrients which are mobilized as surface runoff to the watershed after rain events. A Jenks Natural Break scheme assigned waterbodies to CyanoHAB risk groups, and of the 771 waterbodies, 24.38% were low, 37.35% and 38.26% were medium and high risk respectively. This research supplements existing cyanobacteria risk modeling methods by introducing a novel, scalable, and reproducible method to determine yearly regional risk. Future studies should include factors such as demographic, socioeconomic, labor, and site-specific environmental conditions to create more holistic CyanoHAB risk outputs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Comparative assessment of dominant macrophytes and limnological parameters of Dal lake and Chatlam wetlands in the Union territory of Jammu & Kashmir, India	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION												The aim of the study was to analyze and compare the physico-chemical properties of water, with respect to the anthropogenic stresses on the growth and dominance of aquatic macrophytes at the four selected sites in Dal lake and Chatlam wetlands, during the year 2020. We have identified 12 species of macrophytes from the Dal lake and 20 species from the Chatlam wetlands. Highest importance value index (IVI) was observed in Nymphoides peltata (48.98) during summer and the lowest IVI was in Mentha sp. (1.93) during winter in the Chatlam wetlands. On the contrary, in Dal lake the highest IVI values were reported for Azolla sp. (175.34) during summer and lowest for Hydrocharis dubia (10.60) during winters. The average values of Biological oxygen demand (BOD), Chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrate nitrogen, ammoniacal nitrogen and orthophosphate content in Chatlam were 19.85 +/- 0.91(mg/l), 62.5 +/- 1.29 (mg/l), 516.25 +/- 1.10 (mu g/l), 291.75 +/- 1.55 (mu g/l) and 136.75 +/- 0.47 (mu g/l) respectively. While in Dal lake, the observed values of these parameters were 27.5 +/- 1.49 (mg/l), 61.75 +/- 0.85 (mg/l), 636.5 +/- 1.04 (mu g/l), 137 +/- 1.31(mu g/l), and 44.6 +/- 0.18 (mu g/l), respectively. We found that the Chatlam wetland (sub-urban area) harbored more macrophytic diversity than the Dal lake (urban). Unplanned development and agricultural activities in the catchment area have significantly contributed to the cultural eutrophication. In lieu of these findings we propose that joint efforts of the researchers, government and the non-governmental organizations be put in for the sustainable conservation of these two wetlands.

Sediment phosphorus cycling in a large shallow lake: spatio-temporal variation in phosphorus pools and release	HYDROBIOLOGIA					5th International Symposium on Shallow Lakes	JUN 05-09, 2005	Dalfsen, NETHERLANDS					Sediment and water column phosphorus fractions were recorded monthly for one year (April 2004-April 2005) in a shallow lake recovering from nutrient pollution (Loch Leven, Scotland). Equilibrium phosphate concentration (EPC0) and gross sediment phosphorus (P) release rates were estimated from laboratory experiments. Pore water and organic P pools were lowest during warm water periods whereas bottom water P was lowest during cold water periods. Reductant-soluble, organic, metal oxide-adsorbed, residual and sediment total phosphorus pools all varied significantly with overlying water depth. Short-term, high magnitude, redox initiated P release events occurred in late summer and winter as a result of anoxic sediment conditions. Lower magnitude long-term release conditions were maintained for most of the year, most likely as a result of organic P cycling and maintenance of high concentration gradients between the pore and bottom water P pools. Estimates of summer P uptake/release rates, across an intact sediment-water interface, suggested that maximum gross internal release was similar to 12 mg SRP m(-2) lake surface area d(-1) with EPC0 values ranging between 180 and 270 mu g P L-1. This study highlights the biological mediation of internal loading in shallow eutrophic lakes, and in particular, the role of sediment algae in decreasing, and sediment bacteria in enhancing, sediment P release.

J	Offer, ZY; Goossens, D				Offer, ZY; Goossens, D			Ten years of aeolian dust dynamics in a desert region (Negev desert, Israel): analysis of airborne dust concentration, dust accumulation and the high-magnitude dust events	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												At Sede Boqer (northern Negev desert, Israel), aeolian dust dynamics have been measured since 1986. The data are somewhat preliminary for the first 2 years, bur from 1988 onward, the data set is nearly complete and contains ample information with respect to northern Negev dust. In this paper, several dynamic aspects of the Negev dust are investigated for the decade 1988-1997. Airborne dust concentration, which was measured by total particulate ultrahigh-volume sampling at 1-m height, was of the order of 120 mug m (-3) (based on 24-h measuring intervals) as an average, with higher values during the day than at night. Concentration was also higher during spring and autumn compared to summer and winter. In the decade 1988-1997, dust concentration decreased from 1988 to 1992 and increased from 1992 to 1997. Systematic oscillations with a periodicity of 30 months occur in the concentration curves. Dust accumulation, which was measured in marble collectors installed at ground level, was of the order of 10-25 gm (-2) month (-1), with an average value of 17.1 gm (-2) month (1). The accumulation rate was higher during the day hours than during the night. There was a tendency for the accumulation to be highest in February and then gradually decrease until the following January, but considerable scatter occurs in this trend. During 1988-1997, dust accumulation at Sede Boqer sharply decreased in the first 2 years, increased during the next 4 years, and more or less stabilized from 1995 onward. There was no agreement between the temporal evolution of the velocity of accumulation v(a) and the temporal evolutions of dust concentration, dust accumulation or wind speed. Most high-magnitude dust events (defined in this study as events with an average airborne dust concentration greater than or equal to 400 mug m (-3)) occurring at Sede Boqer are true dust storms, which occur predominantly during the day hours. During the period 1988-1991, dust storms and dust hazes were equally abundant, but from 1992 onward the high-magnitude dust events were nearly exclusively dust storms. The distribution of dust storms and dust hazes over the year is different: the former are mainly concentrated in the period November-May, whereas the latter occur anywhere in the year. True dust storms are usually associated with local cyclonic activity, but may also be connected to local thunderstorm cells (haboob-type dust storms). At Sede Boqer, there is no correlation in the wet season between rainfall and dust activity. A significant correlation exists between rainfall (in the wet season) and dust activity in the next dry season: wet seasons with low rainfall are followed by dry seasons with high dust activity, and wet seasons with high rainfall are followed by dry seasons with low dust activity. The time lag between rainfall intensity and dust activity is most probably caused by the dust crust on the desert floor, which is much stronger after rain seasons with high precipitation than after rain seasons with low precipitation.

We used high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to profile archaeal and bacterial community compositions in the surface water of Lake Taihu. It is one of the largest lakes in China and has suffered from recurring cyanobacterial bloom. A total of 81 water samples were collected from 9 different sites in 9 different months of 2012. We found that temporal variation of the microbial community was significantly greater than spatial variation (adonis, n = 9999, P < 1e-4). The composition of bacterial community in December was similar to that in January, and so was the archaeal community, suggesting potential annual periodicity. Unsupervised K-means clustering was used to identify the synchrony of abundance variations between different taxa. We found that the cluster consisting mostly of ACK-M1, C111 (members of acIV), Pelagibacteraceae (alfV-A) and Synechococcaceae showed relatively higher abundance in autumn. On the contrary, the cluster of Comamonadaceae and Methylophilaceae (members of lineage betI and betIV) had higher abundance in spring. The co-occurrence relationships between taxa were greatly altered during the cyanobacterial bloom according to our further network module analysis.

Ostracods as indicators of pollution in the lakes of Mysore	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Ostracods are small crustaceans found in aquatic habitats and the present paper deals with the role of water quality index on their population diversity and seasonal fluctuations in the four lakes of Mysore city. The present investigation was carried out from July 2004 to June 2005. The study revealed highest water quality index and population density of ostracods during summer and least during winter. Dalvoi lake recorded higher water quality index (125 04), population density (60 l(-1)) but lower species diversity (2 species) of ostracods, whereas Kamana lake recorded lowest water quality index (63.49), population density (40 l(-1)) and highest species diversity (6 species) of ostracods. Increase in the water quality index indicates increase in the pollution load. As water quality index (WQI) increases, population density of ostracods increases but species diversity decreases.																			0254-8704					MAY	2008	29	3					415	418											18972702					WOS:000256207900026

The animal subsistence economy relied heavily on cattle husbandry, complemented by other species including sheep. Cattle and sheep isotopic history (delta C-13, delta O-18) was investigated at the seasonal scale, through sequential sampling in tooth enamel, providing new insights into seasonality of birth and diet. Sheep were lambing in mid-spring, only slightly later than expected from what is observed nowadays in temperate Europe at similar latitude. Cattle were born over a period spanning approximately six months, which was an unexpected result compared with a two to three months calving period in free-ranging cattle populations. The extension of the calving period might have been related to seasonal food supplementation. Some cattle and some sheep fed on a C-13-depleted resource in winter, potentially leafy fodder. A direct consequence of an extended calving period would be the availability of cow milk, which would have covered the whole year at Bercy. This is important information in a context where the exploitation of cattle milk by the human community was highly suspected from the demographic management of the herd.																			1461-4103	1749-6314				APR	2012	17	1					29	44		10.1179/1461410312Z.0000000003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/1461410312Z.0000000003													WOS:000305477300003

History of the solar ponds: A review study	RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS												Solar pond was discovered as a natural phenomena around the turn of the last century in the Medve Lake in Transylvania in Hungary. In this lake, temperatures up to 70 degrees C were recorded at a depth of 1.32 m at the end of the summer season. The minimal temperature was 26 degrees C during early spring. The bottom of this lake had a salt NaCl with concentration of 26 percent. Solar pond is artificially constructed. To prevent convection, salt water is used in the pond. Those ponds are called "salt gradient solar pond". Nowadays, mini solar ponds are also being constructed for various thermal applications. It was concluded that the optimum value of salinity in the mini solar pond is 80 g/kg of water. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Jewell, ME				Jewell, ME			Aquatic biology of the prairie	ECOLOGY												Prairie streams differ from those of savannah and woodland in their swifter currents, greater fluctuation in water level, greater turbidity, and absence of humus or organic detritus from the bottom. These factors result in a sparse fauna. Since prairie "lakes" are subject to greater wind action, they are more turbid than those of wooded areas. Prairie ponds and "buffalo wallows" are usually temporary, but teem with ento-mostraca and amphibious insects during spring and fall. Highly mineralized alkali lakes and pools are characteristic of prairie regions. The salts present vary qualitatively in different regions, and the faunas are characterized chiefly by the absence of forms common in adjacent non-mineralized waters.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1927	8						289	298		10.2307/1929331	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929331													WOS:000200148100041
J	ARGYLE, RL				ARGYLE, RL			ACOUSTICS AS A TOOL FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF GREAT-LAKES FORAGE FISHES	FISHERIES RESEARCH												Sharp reductions in forage fish populations in Lake Michigan have raised concerns about the continued ability of the forage stocks to support large populations Of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush and other salmonid predators. There was a need for a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of forage fish abundance and distribution to evaluate these concerns. In response. cooperative diel surveys of the Lake Michigan forage species were conducted in late summer 1987 and spring 1989 with acoustics, midwater and bottom trawls. In late summer 1987, the acoustic estimate (night) of the midwater standing stock of alewives Alosa pseudoharangus, rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax, and bloaters Coregonus hoyi was 366 900 +/- 73 600 (95% CI) t. In comparison, bottom-trawl catches estimated the stocks at 235 500 t (day) and only 23 500 t (night). In spring 1989, the acoustic estimate was 435 000 +/- 110 000 t and the bottom-trawl estimates were 269 300 t (day) and 25 400 t (night). The composition of the stock (by weight) was similar both years; bloaters dominated the catches with alewives and smelt represented in roughly equal proportions. The target strength-length (cm) relationship, TS = 18.2 log10(L)-67.5, was determined for rainbow smelt, based on midwater trawling data. As most of the fish caught in midwater were rainbow smelt, the equation was nol representative of the mixed-species population so the average backscattering cross-section per unit weight was used to scale the echo-integrator for biomass computations. Data from the acoustic surveys appeared to provide a more accurate estimate of the size of the mixed-species populations in Lake Michigan than did the trawl catches.																			0165-7836					AUG	1992	14	2-3					179	196		10.1016/0165-7836(92)90052-U	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0165-7836(92)90052-U													WOS:A1992JL07600008

For algal species associated with harmful algal blooms (HAB) in eutrophied freshwater lakes usually light and nutrient availability, especially phosphate, seem to drive patterns of the vertical migration within the water column. The vertical migration patterns of species associated with HAB in freshwater lakes (Cyanobacteria) should be taken as input parameters for modelling algae. As HAB present a health risk to the public they should be monitored and predicted via simulation models, and the results of the predictions should be shared with the public using familiar tools such as smartphone apps or websites. To gather the data on which the model will be formulated, two shallow freshwater lakes (eutrophic condition: Lake Stadtgraben, Northern Germany, oligotrophic condition: Lake Russo, Wisconsin, USA in temperate climates were selected to serve as models for investigating the vertical migration in different seasonal times under natural conditions. Phosphate concentrations, as well as light and temperature over time in hourly increments at the lake surface and bottom were monitored. In addition the vertical migration pattern of Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta populations was followed over 24 hrs in spring (May) and fall (August) in order to derive a behavior assumption as input for a model predicting HAB. In Lake Stadtgraben the vertical migration pattern was strongly influenced by light rather than by phosphate availability in spring, as phosphate was readily available at that time in all depths, while temperature was significantly different between the top and -bottom. The vertical migration pattern was dampened in fall season in both, the oligotrophic and the eutrophic lake, while temperature was not significantly different from the top to the bottom. Thus, vertical migration patterns observed may change slightly with season, which will impact on the outcome of simulation models dependent on the time of day and lake depth, at which input parameters such as Chlorophyll-a are measured.																			1863-9135					DEC	2017	191	1					1	11		10.1127/fal/2017/1021	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/fal/2017/1021													WOS:000419313600001

Reconstruction of Holocene hydroclimatic variability in subarctic treeline lakes using lake sediment grain-size end-members	HOLOCENE												Current climate trends are expected to result in the northward expansion of the subarctic treeline leading to changes in vegetation cover and permafrost distribution, as they did during the Holocene Climate Optimum when the treeline was 150 km north of its current position. The impacts of these changes on the region's hydrology are still poorly understood. The grain-size distributions of treeline lake sediments provide an important proxy related to spring melt conditions that can be used to reconstruct hydroclimatic variability. End-member mixing analysis was used to model depositional end-members in 55 modern lake sediment samples and two sediment cores spanning the mid- to late Holocene collected from above and below the treeline in the central Northwest Territories, Canada. Cold climatic intervals (e.g. 'Dark Ages Cold Period', 'Little Ice Age') were characterised by an increase in the very coarse silt and the fine sand end-members. This was interpreted to be a response to degradation of vegetation cover and/or permafrost development. We observed increases in fine and coarse silt end-members during warmer climatic intervals (e.g. Medieval Climate Anomaly) and over the past c. 300 yr BP. This pattern is probably the result of extended melt seasons, with greater losses to evaporation and increased infiltration. The most pronounced palaeo-hydroclimatological change over the past c. 8000 yr BP was the abrupt increase in a very coarse silt end-member (mode = 50-200 mu m) at c. 6300 yr BP. We interpreted the sedimentological change as an increase in winter precipitation and more energetic spring melt conditions, leading to the spring melt becoming the dominant lacustrine sediment delivery mechanism. These results place modern hydrological changes in a millennial context and show that analysis of temporal changes in the hydroclimatological system can provide insight into the future states of these sensitive subarctic ecosystems.					; Swindles, Graeme/AAU-4321-2020	Macumber, Andrew L/0000-0001-6212-0655; Swindles, Graeme/0000-0001-8039-1790; 													0959-6836	1477-0911				JUN	2018	28	6					845	857		10.1177/0959683617752836	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959683617752836													WOS:000436072100001

Several important chemical transformations take place in wetland media, including the conversion of inorganic mercury (Hg) to monomethylmercury (MeHg), a toxic compound with a strong tendency for bioconcentration. Considering the fact that wetlands are hotspots for Hg methylation, we investigated, for the first time, Hg methylation and demethylation rates in an old growth cypress wetland at Sky Lake in the Mississippi Delta. The Sky Lake ecosystem undergoes large-scale water level fluctuations causing alternating periods of oxic and anoxic conditions in the sediment. These oscillating redox conditions, in turn, can influence the transformation, speciation, and bioavailability of Hg. In the present study, sediment cores from the wetland and Sky Lake itself were spiked with enriched stable isotope tracers of inorganic Hg and MeHg and allowed to incubate (in-situ) before freezing, sectioning, and analysis. Methylation rates (day(-1)) ranged from 0.012 +/- 0.003 to 0.054 +/- 0.019, with the lowest rate in the winter and the highest in the summer. Demethylation rates were about two orders of magnitude higher, and also greater in the warmer seasons (e.g., 1.84 +/- 0.78 and 4.63 +/- 0.51 for wetland sediment in the winter and summer, respectively). Methylation rates were generally higher in the open water sediment compared to wetland sediment, with the latter shaded and cooler. Both methylation (r = 0.76, p = 0.034) and demethylation (0.97, p = 0.016) rates (day(-1)) were positively correlated with temperature, but not with most other water quality parameters. MeHg concentration in the water was correlated with pH (r = 0.80, p < 0.05), but methylation rates were only marginally correlated (r = 0.71). Environmental factors driving microbial production of MeHg in the system include warm temperatures, high levels of labile natural organic matter, and to a lesser extent the relatively low pH and the residence time of the water. This study also provides baseline data that can be used to quantify the impacts of modifying the natural flow of water to the system on Hg methylation and demethylation rates.

Modeling summer circulation and thermal structure of Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												A three-dimensional primitive equation numerical model was applied to Lake Erie on a 2 km grid to study its summer circulation and thermal structure. Model results were compared to long-term observations of currents and temperature made in 2005 at several locations, mostly in its central basin. In the shallow and mostly unstratified western basin circulation is driven by Detroit River inflow (modified to some extent by wind) and is from west to east. In the central basin (which is of intermediate depth and has a relatively flat bottom), the modeled circulation is anticyclonic (clockwise), driven by anticyclonic vorticity in the surface wind, and the thermocline is bowl-shaped, in line with observations. In the deep part of the eastern basin, the thermocline is dome-shaped and circulation is cyclonic (counter-clockwise), due to density gradients (a configuration typical for other large deep lakes), while shallower areas are occupied by anticyclonic circulation driven by anticyclonic wind vorticity. In the central basin, modeled temperature and circulation patterns are quite sensitive to the specification of the wind field. Anticyclonic wind vorticity leads to thinning of the hypolimnion in the central basin and earlier destratification in the fall.

YOUNG, OLD, AND WEATHERED CARBON-PART 2: USING RADIOCARBON AND STABLE ISOTOPES TO IDENTIFY TERRESTRIAL CARBON SUPPORT OF THE FOOD WEB IN AN ALKALINE, HUMIC LAKE	RADIOCARBON					1st International Radiocarbon in the Environment Conference	AUG 18-22, 2014	Queens Univ Belfast, Belfast, NORTH IRELAND		Queens Univ Belfast			Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotope analysis (SIA) has been used to identify the terrestrial subsidy of freshwater food webs. However, SIA fails to differentiate between the contributions of old and recently fixed terrestrial C and consequently cannot fully determine the source, age, and biochemical quality of terrestrial carbon. Natural abundance radiocarbon (Delta C-14) was used to examine the age and origin of carbon in Lower Lough Erne, Northern Ireland. C-14 and stable isotope values were obtained from invertebrate, algae, and fish samples, and the results indicate that terrestrial organic C is evident at all trophic levels. High winter delta N-15 values in calanoid zooplankton (delta N-15 = 24 parts per thousand) relative to phytoplankton and particulate organic matter (delta N-15 = 6 parts per thousand and 12 parts per thousand, respectively) may reflect several microbial trophic levels between terrestrial C and calanoid invertebrates. Winter and summer calanoid Delta C-14 values show a seasonal switch between autochthonous and terrestrial carbon sources. Fish Delta C-14 values indicate terrestrial support at the highest trophic levels in littoral and pelagic food webs. C-14 therefore is useful in attributing the source of carbon in freshwater in addition to tracing the pathway of terrestrial carbon through the food web.

A year of internal Poincare waves in southern Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												A unique set of full year, deep water observations from the middle of Lake Michigan's southern basin are analyzed to quantify the seasonal variability of the dominant near-inertial internal Poincare wave. At this mid-lake location, the Poincare wave is seen to describe more than 80% of the observed surface current variability for much of the year, with characteristic near-inertial frequency and clockwise-rotating velocities. The dominance of the near-inertial seiche on the flow decreases with depth. The wave persists during the "stratified period," roughly May through late December, and is supported by as few as 1-2 degrees of thermal stratification over 150 m; only after complete water column mixing does the wave go dormant for January through April. The strongest Poincare wave activity is seen to correspond to the period of strongest summer thermal stratification (August), in spite of the relatively weak winds at this time. A simple inertial slab model optimized with linear friction is shown to capture the seasonal variability of the near-inertial energy at this location reasonably well. The vertical structure of the wave shows good agreement with that calculated with a standard normal modes formulation, which is in turn used to characterize the potential shear and mixing caused by the wave. Late-spring and summer events of elevated Poincare wave activity are shown to generate sufficiently strong shear with persistent periods of sub-1 Richardson numbers within the thermocline, suggesting that the near-inertial seiche is likely generating thermocline instabilities in the lake's interior.

J	Chabangborn, A; Brandefelt, J; Wohlfarth, B				Chabangborn, Akkaneewut; Brandefelt, Jenny; Wohlfarth, Barbara			Asian monsoon climate during the Last Glacial Maximum: palaeo-data-model comparisons	BOREAS												The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (23-19ka BP) in the Asian monsoon region is generally described as cool and dry, due to a strong winter monsoon. More recently, however, palaeo-data and climate model simulations have argued for a more variable LGM Asian monsoon climate with distinct regional differences. We compiled, evaluated, and partly re-assessed proxy records for the Asian monsoon region in terms of wet/dry climatic conditions based on precipitation and effective moisture, and of sea surface temperatures. The comparison of the palaeo-data set to LGM simulations by the Climate Community System Model version 3 (CCSM3) shows fairly good agreement: a dry LGM climate in the western and northern part due to a strengthened winter monsoon and/or strengthened westerly winds and wetter conditions in equatorial areas, due to a stronger summer monsoon. Data-model discrepancies are seen in some areas and are ascribed to the fairly coarse resolution of CCSM3 and/or to uncertainties in the reconstructions. Differences are also observed between the reconstructed and simulated northern boundaries of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The reconstructions estimate a more southern position over southern India and the Bay of Bengal, whereas CCSM3 simulates a more northern position. In Indochina, the opposite is the case. The palaeo-data indicate that climatic conditions changed around 20-19ka BP, with some regions receiving higher precipitation and some experiencing drier conditions, which would imply a distinct shift in summer monsoon intensity. This shift was probably triggered by the late LGM sea-level rise, which led to changes in atmosphere-ocean interactions in the Indian Ocean. The overall good correspondence between reconstructions and CCSM3 suggests that CCSM3 simulates LGM climate conditions over subtropical and tropical areas fairly well. The few high-resolution qualitative and quantitative palaeo-records available for the large Asian monsoon region make reconstructions however still uncertain.																			0300-9483	1502-3885				JAN	2014	43	1					220	242		10.1111/bor.12032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bor.12032													WOS:000328619600013

This study modified a multilevel upper ocean model (UOM) for lake applications and evaluated its performance in Lake Taihu (China) with comprehensive measurements against three popular one-dimensional (1-D) lake models. These models were based on different concepts, including the self-similarity (FLake), the wind-driven eddy diffusion (LISSS), thek-epsilon turbulence closure (SIMSTRAT), and a simplified turbulence closure (UOM). The surface flux scheme in these models was unified to exclude the discrepancies in representing air-lake exchanges. All models in their default formulations presented obvious cold water temperature biases and largely underestimated the lake surface temperature (LST) diurnal range. For each model, these deficiencies were significantly reduced by incorporating new physics schemes or calibrated tunable parameters based on systematic sensitivity tests. The primary modifications for UOM included (1) a new scheme of decreased surface roughness lengths to better characterize the shallow lake, (2) a solar radiation penetration scheme with increased light extinction coefficient and surface absorption fraction to account for the high water turbidity, and (3) turbulent Prandtl number increased by a factor of 20 to reduce the turbulent vertical mixing. All other models were improved in these three aspects (roughness, extinction, and mixing) within their original formulations. Given these improvements, UOM showed superior performance to other models in capturing LST diurnal cycle and daily to seasonal variations, as well as summer-autumn vertical stratification changes. The new UOM is well suited for application in shallow lakes. Plain Language Summary Lakes, with unique characteristic differences from lands, play an important role on local-regional weather and climate. This study improved a multilevel upper ocean model (UOM) for a shallow lake application with primary modifications on surface roughness, radiation extinction, and vertical mixing. The model was intercompared against comprehensive measurements with three other improved one-dimensional models based on different concepts in the context of using a unified surface flux scheme to exclude the discrepancies in representing lake-air exchanges. All models in their default formulations presented obvious cold water temperature biases and largely underestimated the lake surface temperature diurnal range. Their performances were significantly improved with the proposed modifications. In particular, the improved UOM showed superior performance to other models in capturing lake surface temperature diurnal cycle and daily to seasonal variations, as well as summer-autumn vertical stratification changes. The new UOM is useful for inclusion in weather and climate models to represent shallow lake processes.

J	Saltveit, SJ; Brabrand, Å				Saltveit, Svein Jakob; Brabrand, Age			Incubation, hatching and survival of eggs of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in spawning redds influenced by groundwater	LIMNOLOGICA												Many west coastal and northern Norwegian rivers run through deep, confined valleys with permeable layers of glacial and alluvial deposits. Groundwater flows through these permeable layers and enter lakes and rivers as underwater seepage and springs. Groundwater inflow to inland Norwegian rivers may constitute 40-100% of total water discharge during low flow periods in late summer and winter. Juvenile salmonids may take advantage of groundwater upwellings and actively seek out such patches. In regulated rivers groundwater influx may create refuges during low flow or hydropeaking episodes. The importance of groundwater for salmon redd site selection and egg survival is also clear, although less known and documented in regulated rivers. Eggs of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are deposited in redds in river bed gravels lacking fine sediments and with high oxygen levels. Egg development is therefore dependent on the interaction of a number of environmental factors such as groundwater influx, oxygen and temperature. Atlantic salmon in the regulated River Suldalslagen, Western Norway, spawn relatively late compared to other Norwegian rivers, with a peak in early January. Newly emerged fry are found from the end of May to the beginning of June, i.e. "swim up" one month earlier than expected using models for egg and alevin development and river water temperatures. The most plausible explanation is that groundwater has a higher and more stable temperature than surface river water. In field experiments, fertilized salmon eggs were placed in boxes close to natural spawning redds in the river bed at sites influenced and those not influenced by groundwater. A difference of up to 40 days in 50% hatching was found, and "swim up" occurred at the end of May in boxes influenced by groundwater. Preliminary studies have revealed that groundwater also plays an important role in survival of salmon eggs in the River Suldalslagen when dewatered in winter. Eggs placed in boxes in groundwater seepage areas during winter in the dewatered river bed survived even when covered by ice and snow. The survival from fertilization until 30 April, one month before hatching, was 91%, the same survival as found for eggs placed in boxes in the wetted river bed. However, mortality from fertilization to hatching was higher compared to the eggs placed in wetted river bed, 57 and 91% respectively. Groundwater creates a horizontal and vertical mosaic of temperatures in spawning redd areas leading to potentially greater variation in spawning sites, time of hatching and "swim up". This is likely to increase egg survival during low flow periods in regulated rivers. In conclusion, the interaction between groundwater and surface river water should therefore be considered when managing fish populations in regulated rivers. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

However, with the exception of the speleothems, records from this area with independent age control are few. We investigated aeolian sand deposition on a sand hill on the shore of Poyang Lake in South China and reconstructed the chronological sequence of aeolian deposition using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. Without exception, all aeolian sediments were deposited within seven periods that generally match the timing of Heinrich events and other cold periods in Greenland. We argue that aeolian sand accumulation in this region is most likely forced by extreme aridity driven by weakening of the summer monsoon, while the characteristics of this deposition are influenced by winter monsoon intensity. The monsoon shifts revealed here suggest a possible link between North Atlantic cooling and summer monsoon strength in South China, and support the intensities of cooling phases recorded in Greenland ice cores.

Amplified surface temperature response of cold, deep lakes to inter-annual air temperature variability	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Summer lake surface water temperatures (LSWTs) have previously been shown to respond more rapidly to climatic warming compared to local summer surface air temperatures (SATs). In a globalscale analysis, we explore the factors underpinning the observation of an amplified response of summer LSWT to SAT variability using 20 years of satellite-derived temperatures from 144 lakes. We demonstrate that the degree of amplification in inter-annual summer LSWT is variable, and is greater for cold lakes (e.g. high latitude and high altitude), which are characterised by a short warming season, and deep lakes, that exhibit long correlation timescales of temperature anomalies due to increased thermal inertia. Such lakes are more likely to display responses in excess of local inter-annual summer SAT variability. Climatic modification of LSWT has numerous consequences for water quality and lake ecosystems, so quantifying this amplified response at a global scale is important.					; Merchant, Christopher/KHY-0611-2024	Woolway, Richard Iestyn/0000-0003-0498-7968; 													2045-2322					JUN 23	2017	7								4130	10.1038/s41598-017-04058-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-04058-0								28646229					WOS:000404118700021

The model reproduced minima of ice extent in the winters of 2006 and 2012 (mild winters), as well as maxima in 2009 and 2011 (severe winters) in agreement with the observational analysis. The model reasonably captured ice thicknesses, seasonal variation of the mean surface temperature, and lake circulation. The model results showed early onset of stratification in March after the almost ice-free winter of 2012. In the mild winters, the coastal current speed was significantly higher than the 9 year mean, since the larger open water region due to less ice cover allowed the more effective wind driven circulation. In the severe winters, the lake circulation was slowed because the packed ice reduced wind stress on the water surface. Seasonal means of coastal current speed ranged from 3.9 cm/s in the severe winter (January to March mean) of 2009 to 7.2 cm/s in the mild winter of 2012. The variation was much larger than in the other seasons (0.6 cm/s). The results imply that decreasing ice cover could lead to a more energetic coastal circulation in winter, which could influence lake turbidity, material transport, and nearshore waves. Finally, the interannual variation of ice cover is discussed in relation to teleconnection patterns. The ice minimum (maximum) in the winter of 2006 (2009) can be explained by the intermittent positive (negative) North Atlantic Oscillation that occurred in January (December to January).					; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/AAA-5852-2021	Wang, Jia/0000-0003-4154-9721; Fujisaki-Manome, Ayumi/0000-0001-5466-6332; Lofgren, Brent/0000-0003-2189-0914													2169-9275	2169-9291				SEP	2013	118	9					4286	4304		10.1002/jgrc.20312	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jgrc.20312													WOS:000326230200020

In 2007, a small watershed at Cape Bounty, Melville Island, Nunavut, was studied in detail during the melt season. Two rainfall events on June 30 and July 22, totalling 9.2 and 10.8 mm, respectively, represented significant contributions to seasonal discharge and sediment transport in a year with a low winter snowpack. The precipitation events elevated discharge and suspended sediment concentrations to twice the magnitude of the nival melt, and generated the only measurable downstream lacustrine turbidity current of the season. In two days, rainfall runoff transported 35% of the seasonal suspended sediment load, in contrast to 29% transported over the nival freshet. The magnitude and intensity of the rain events were not unusual in this setting, but the rainfall response was substantial in comparison with equivalent past events. Exceptional temperatures of July 2007 generated early, deep permafrost thaw, and ground ice melt. The resultant increase in soil moisture amplified the subsequent rainfall runoff and sediment transport response. These results demonstrate the importance of antecedent moisture conditions and the role of permafrost active layer development as an important factor in the rainfall runoff and sediment transport response to precipitation events.

Mortality of daphnids was computed using a model that allowed us to differentiate between different size-classes, while total fish consumption was estimated from the temperature-dependent daily weight increase and the population development of the 0+ fish. The predation pressure on the different size-classes of Daphnia species was estimated by combining the total fish consumption with estimates of the selective feeding behaviour of the fish. To make the estimates of fish consumption independent of our current (1989-1991) zooplankton data set, we estimated fish species-specific and fish length-dependent selectivity indices on zooplankton using a different data set (1976-1977). Daphnia population densities usually increased in spring and decreased rapidly in early summer. Predation by 0+ fish was not severe enough to explain the large mortality that caused the summer decline; later in the year most of the mortality in the larger size-classes of the daphnids (>1.0 mm) could be explained by fish predation.

In the midwestern region of the United States, (Detroit, Michigan), highest titers for the A and O antibodies occur in the summer months and the lowest titers in the winter months. The anti-B antibody titers showed greater variability than anti-A and anti-0 antibodies. Inasmuch as the length of light and temperature were relatively controlled in these experiments, these factors are not the cause of the seasonal variation. The observed seasonal variation follows the pattern predicted by the investigations carried out in Wisconsin. However, this seasonal variation is different from that observed in Salt Lake City, Utah.																			0002-9335						1968	34	7					398	+											5672104					WOS:A1968B495200004

Ice-core samples taken at 5350 m a.s.l. in 1994 contained more than seven species of snow algae. In a vertical profile of the algal biomass, 11 distinct algal layers were observed. Seasonal observation in 1996 at the coring site indicated most algal growth occurred from late spring to late summer. Pit observation in 1991, 1992 and 1994 indicated that algal layer formation takes place annually. delta O-18, chemical ions (Na+, Cl-, SO42- and NO3-) and microparticles failed to show any clear seasonal variation, particularly at depths exceeding 2 m, possibly due to heavy meltwater percolation. Snow algae in ice cores would thus appear to be accurate boundary markers of annual layers and should prove useful for ice-core dating in Himalayan-type glaciers.

A steelhead angler intercept survey was conducted in fall, winter, and spring of 2002-2003. Almost 77% of the anglers surveyed (375) responded to a mail survey with useful information. Typical steelhead anglers were 46 years old, middle class, male, and had 9 years steelhead angling experience. Less than two-thirds of respondents fished with spinning tackle and one-third used fly tackle. On average, individuals traveled with 1.7 people in their group. They mostly took single day trips (94% of respondents), traveling approximately 84 kilometers round trip. Steelhead catch rates are positively related to number of trips taken, angler experience, number of streams visited per trip, number of hours fished per trip, and type of tackle used. The value of the steelhead angling experience to participating anglers is estimated at $36 to $46 per trip while the money spent to participate in steelhead fishing is estimated at $26 per trip. Annual value of the Lake Erie tributary steelhead fishery in Ohio could be as high as $12 to $14 million compared to the $600,000 cost for the stocking program. The fishery provides economic benefits to the coastal areas where adequate access for stream steelhead anglers exists during parts of the year when recreational demand is lowest. This information can be used by policy makers to justify expenditures on stocking, public access, and water quality improvements that enhance angling.					; Daigneault, Adam/GYU-9342-2022	Daigneault, Adam/0000-0002-8287-8727; 													0380-1330						2006	32	3					424	433		10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[424:TVOSOM]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[424:TVOSOM]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000241299100003

Data of in total 231 lakes were available. Data on chlorophyll-a, total phosphorus (total-P) acid total nitrogen (total-N) were analysed over the period 1980-1996. Summer-averaged concentrations for chlorophyll-a, total-P and total-N decreased in respectively 65%, 73% and 75% of the lakes with at least eight years data between 1980 and 1996. Results for winter means were comparable (a negative trend in 548, 77% and 69% for concentrations of chlorophyll-a, total-P and total-N respectively). Since 1980 the median decrease in the summer averaged concentrations of chlorophyll-a, tolal-P and total-N is 2.61 mu g l(-1) y(-1), 0.008 mg l(-1) y(-1) and 0.046 mg l(-1) y(-1), respectively, illustrating the effects of (inter)national and regional measures to combat eutrophication.

Based on grain size and trace element analysis of Core S01-10 from the western continental slope area of central Okinawa Trough, high-resolution paleoenvironment records since 14 ka had been obtained. There is a significant positive correlation between the ratio data of Nb, Th, Sc and REE elements of Core S01-10, which reflects the composition characteristics of terrigenous materials. We use REEs and their discrimination plot of Gd/Yb-Yb and La/Yb-Gd/Yb to conclude that the terrigenous materials mainly came from the Yellow River during 14,000-11,500 a. Moreover, grain size parameters and the provenance discriminant function (DF) show that the transportation of terrigenous materials substance from the main rivers in Chinese Mainland (the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers) to the western slope of central Okinawa Trough is affected by the East Asian winter monsoon. This is mainly manifested in two major stages. During 14,000-11,500 a, these indicators fluctuate on the whole, but in the mass, they indicate a strong East Asian winter monsoon stage, which also leads to the formation and enhancement of the low-temperature underflow, leading to the Yellow River as the dominant source. During 11,500-1920 a, these indicators fluctuated more frequently, reflecting the strengthening/weak-ening of the East Asian winter monsoon in a shorter period. The tendency of East Asian winter monsoon analyzed by using grain size parameters and DF is consistent with the Ti content of Lake Huguang Maar on the whole, which also verifies the feasibility of the results from the side. Overall, the contribution of substance from the relevant source areas is different in different periods, but Paleo-Huanghe remains the main source. According to the study, the analysis of grain size parameters and trace element in the western slope of central Okinawa Trough can indicate changes of provenance, sea level rising and falling and winter monsoon in this area since 14 ka, which is helpful to explore and reconstruct the sediment provenance and Paleoenvironment evolution in this area since the late Pleistocene.

J	Wang, MH; Shi, W; Tang, JW				Wang, Menghua; Shi, Wei; Tang, Junwu			Water property monitoring and assessment for China's inland Lake Taihu from MODIS-Aqua measurements	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												We provide results of quantitative measurements and characterization for inland freshwater Lake Taihu from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the satellite Aqua. China's Lake Taihu, which is located in the Yangtze River delta in one of the world's most urbanized and heavily populated areas, contains consistently highly turbid waters in addition to frequent large seasonal algae blooms in various lake regions. Thus, satellite data processing requires use of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) atmospheric correction algorithm. Specifically for Lake Taihu, an iterative SWIR-based atmospheric correction algorithm has been developed and proven to provide reasonably accurate water-leaving radiance spectra data. Using MODIS-Aqua measurements, the blue-green algae bloom in Lake Taihu in 2007 has been studied in detail, demonstrating the importance and usefulness of satellite water color remote sensing for effectively monitoring and managing a bloom event. Seasonal and interannual variability, as well as spatial distributions, of lake water properties were studied and assessed using the MODIS-Aqua measurements from 2002 to 2008. Results show that overall waters in Lake Taihu are consistently highly turbid all year round, with the winter and summer as the most and least turbid seasons in the lake, respectively. Extremely turbid waters in the winter are primarily attributed to strong winter winds that lead to significant amounts of total suspended sediment (TSS) in the water column. In addition, MODIS-Aqua-measured water-leaving radiance at the blue band is consistently low in various bay regions in Lake Taihu, indicating high algae concentration in these regions. Climatological water property maps, including normalized water-leaving radiance spectra nL(w)(lambda), chlorophyll-a concentration, and water diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490 nm (K-d(490)), are derived from all MODIS-Aqua data from 2002 to 2008 for Lake Taihu, showing overall spatial distribution features for the lake water property.

It has been widely reported that ACA experienced multi-centennial alternations between warm/dry and cold/wet climates over the past two millennia. However, less attention has focused on orbital-scale moisture-temperature relationship at a regional scale across ACA. Here, we contribute a framework including a set of quantitative algorithms to acquire reliable pollen-based climatic reconstructions. We apply this methodology to a new pollen record from a wetland in northern Xinjiang (southeastern ACA) for quantitative reconstructions of moisture availability (actual/potential evapotranspiration ratio, AET/PET) and summer temperature (mean temperature of the warmest month, MTWA) over circa the last 10,300 years. We select AET/PET and MTWA because they are evaluated to be most statistically independent and ecologically significant. The effect of differing spatial extents of calibration-sets on model performance is tested to determine the optimal extent. We critically assess the reliability of all reconstructions through calculations of statistical significance, analogue quality and goodness-of-fit statistics. Our final reconstructions are statistically significant with independent features of AET/PET and MTWA, showing an increasing (declining) trend of Holocene moisture (temperature). This anti-phase pattern is consistent with other records and model simulations across southeastern ACA. The data-model consistency postulates that (i) the glacier meltwater from Tien Shan ('Water Tower of Central Asia') is crucial to support major streamflow and watersheds over ACA, and (ii) the Holocene wetting trend may be determined by the interacting effects between decreased summer temperature and increased winter precipitation.					; Zhang, Xiaojian/M-7184-2015	Seppa, Heikki/0000-0003-2494-7955; Zhang, Xiaojian/0000-0001-9757-3101; Li, Jianyong/0000-0003-1921-5880													0930-7575	1432-0894				SEP	2020	55	5-6					1187	1208		10.1007/s00382-020-05319-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-020-05319-x		JUN 2020											WOS:000539985000001

Its annual rates of carbon assimilation, production and respiration, are 166, 110, and 56 mgC m-3 y-1 respectively. Annual biomass turnover (annual production/average daily biomass) is 33 and production efficiency is 50-66% . The population may consume 1.65-2.20 mgC m-3 daily, equivalent to about 1% of the average daily standing crop of phytoplankton. Clutch size is small, 2 eggs, hut represents 30-80% of a female's weight. A female may only produce 8-10 offspring in a full lifespan, nevertheless egg production may account for 56% of total production.

J	Yang, Z; Zhang, M; Yu, Y; Shi, XL				Yang, Zhen; Zhang, Min; Yu, Yang; Shi, Xiaoli			Temperature triggers the annual cycle of Microcystis, comparable results from the laboratory and a large shallow lake	CHEMOSPHERE												Microcystis development in most temperate lakes shows an annual cycle that is mainly triggered by water temperature and includes four stages. This study aims to identify the optimum growth temperature and the temperature thresholds for recruitment and overwintering in Microcystis in Lake Taihu, based on field data and experiments at the cellular and genetic level on Microcystis under a simulated temperature condition. The field investigation showed that the cyanobacterial biomass began to increase at 11-15 degrees C in spring, reached a peak at 20-30 degrees C and remained at a low level after the water temperature declined below 6 degrees C. The simulation experiment found that the recovery of gene expression, photosynthesis and growth in Microcystis cells occurred at 11-14 degrees C and increased to an appreciable level after the temperature exceeded 20 degrees C. Microcystis cells stopped growing and maintained low photosynthetic activity and gene expression when the temperature declined to 10 degrees C or lower. These results suggest that Microcystis in Lake Taihu begin recruitment at 11-14 degrees C in spring and grow vigorously at 20-30 degrees C, then overwinter at 10 degrees C or lower in winter.

J	Tapper, MA; Hicks, RE				Tapper, MA; Hicks, RE			Temperate viruses and lysogeny in Lake Superior bacterioplankton	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The morphology and abundance of free viruses were measured in spring, summer, and fall at one site in Lake Superior. Free viral head sizes ranged from 10 to 70 nn and tail length ranged from 10 to 110 nm. The vast majority (98%) of free viral head sizes were less than or equal to 60 nm, smaller than reported in most freshwater habitats. Most of these free viruses (70%) had polyhedral heads and tails, indicative of bacteriophage. Free viral abundance only ranged from 0.1 to 9 x 10(6) viruses ml(-1) in the surface microlayer (top 20 mu m) and subsurface water (20 m) in Lake Superior, but viruses were 2-15 times more abundant in the surface microlayer. This difference may be due to the enrichment of bacterial hosts, higher levels of UV light that induce temperate phage, or differences in viral burst sizes in the surface microlayer relative to subsurface water. Bacterioplankton were always more abundant than free viruses in both the surface microlayer and subsurface water, which resulted in some of the lowest virus-to-bacterium ratios reported for marine or freshwater environments. Temperate viruses from both habitats responded equally to mitomycin-C and UV light treatments used to induce prophage into lytic cycles. An estimated 0.1-7.4% of the bacterioplankton from this site in Lake Superior contained temperate prophage depending on viral burst sizes that were assumed. Three times more bacteria in the surface microlayer may contain temperate viruses compared to bacterioplankton in subsurface waters. In the western arm of Lake Superior, bacterioplankton infected by temperate phage may be more important for the survival of bacteriophage populations than as future carbon sources for new microbial production.																			0024-3590					JAN	1998	43	1					95	103		10.4319/lo.1998.43.1.0095	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1998.43.1.0095													WOS:000073694200012

Polymorphisms were found at 11 loci, and the percentage of polymorphic loci was 29.63% in Lake Baunt and 37.04% in the Lena River. Mean heterozygosity was 7.62 and 8.83%, respectively, and corresponded to the level of variation in ciscoes as a whole. A heterogeneity test demonstrated significant differences between the two populations at four loci, and the genetic distance between the forms (D = 0.063) corresponded to differences between subspecies in other coregonids. Such a high level of genetic differentiation in the Baunt cisco could have been caused by its long isolation and the specific hydroclimatic conditions in Lake Baunt.																			0071-1128		3-510-47059-1				2002	57						57	64																WOS:000180355400005
J	Sager, L				Sager, Lionel			Measuring the trophic status of ponds: Relationships between summer rate of periphytic net primary productivity and water physico-chemistry	WATER RESEARCH												The monitoring of the water quality is a major environmental concern and specific method of assessment needs to be addressed for ponds. Among threats on freshwater, eutrophication remains an important and widespread problem. To assess if the trophic state of ponds can be significantly predicted by physico-chemical surrogates, parallel measurements of water physico-chemistry and of summer rates of periphytic net primary productivity (NPP) were performed on a set of nine lowland Swiss ponds representing the whole spectrum of trophic states. The developed methods to measure periphytic NPP on artificial substrates give similar values between the pseudo-replicates and are functional for ponds. The winter concentration of total nitrogen (TN) in the water is a significant predictor of the average summer rates of NPP while in submerged macrophyte beds total phosphorus(TP) is a better predictor. Rates of NPP measured in open water were most often higher and water transparency lower than in macrophyte beds, highlighting the positive influence of macrophytes on water quality and a possible co-occurrence in a pond of contrasting conditions when submerged species are present. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining or restoring submerged macrophyte stands in ponds to improve the water quality. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

This research was performed on seawater, sediments, and organisms in Jieshi Bay, China. The level of Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Hg, and As, respectively, was measured in each environment to acquire a comprehensive understanding of their sources and distribution and to accomplish a risk assessment. The results showed that the concentration of heavy metals in autumn was higher than those in spring, and surface water has a higher heavy metal content than bottom water. The main sources of these heavy metals could be surface runoff and industrial wastewater discharge in the said bay. Hg was the main pollutant in the seawater. Hg, Cu, Zn, and Cd could easily accumulate in organisms than other heavy metal contents. In addition, even though the concentration of Pb did not exceed the Seawater Quality Standard, decision-makers should still be attentive to the Pb content in fish because of bioaccumulation from seafood product consumption.

J	Larocca, LJ; Axford, Y				Larocca, Laura J.; Axford, Yarrow			Arctic glaciers and ice caps through the Holocene: a circumpolar synthesis of lake-based reconstructions	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												The recent retreat of nearly all glaciers and ice caps (GICs) located in Arctic regions is one of the most clear and visible signs of ongoing climate change. This paper synthesizes published records of Holocene GIC fluctuations from lake archives, placing their recent retreat into a longer-term context. Our compilation includes 66 lake-based GIC records (plus one non-lake-based record from the Russian Arctic) from seven Arctic regions: Alaska, Baffin Island in northeastern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, the Scandinavian peninsula, Svalbard, and the Russian high Arctic. For each region and for the full Arctic, we summarize evidence for when GICs were smaller than today or absent altogether, indicating warmer-than-present summers, and evidence for when GICs regrew in lake catchments, indicating summer cooling. Consistent with orbitally driven high boreal summer insolation in the early Holocene, the full Arctic compilation suggests that the majority (50 % or more) of studied GICs were smaller than present or absent by similar to 10 ka. We find the highest percentage (> 90 %) of Arctic GICs smaller than present or absent in the middle Holocene at similar to 7-6 ka, probably reflecting more spatially ubiquitous and consistent summer warmth during this period than in the early Holocene. Following this interval of widespread warmth, our compilation shows that GICs across the Arctic began to regrow and summers began to cool by similar to 6 ka. Together, the Arctic records also suggest two periods of enhanced GIC growth in the middle to late Holocene from similar to 4.5-3 and after similar to 2 ka. The regional records show variability in the timing of GIC regrowth within and between regions, suggesting that the Arctic did not cool synchronously despite the smooth and hemispherically symmetric decline in Northern Hemisphere summer insolation. In agreement with other studies, this implies a combined response to glacier-specific characteristics such as topography and to other climatic forcings and feedback mechanisms, perhaps driving periods of increased regional cooling. Today, the direction of orbital forcing continues to favor GIC expansion; however, the rapid retreat of nearly all Arctic GICs underscores the current dominance of anthropogenic forcing on GIC mass balance. Our review finds that in the first half of the Holocene, most of the Arctic's small GICs became significantly reduced or melted away completely in response to summer temperatures that, on average, were only moderately warmer than today. In comparison, future projections of temperature change in the Arctic far exceed estimated early Holocene values in most locations, portending the eventual loss of most of the Arctic's small GICs.

Reproductive Success and Brood Movements of Giant Canada Geese in Eastern South Dakota	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												The population of resident giant Canada geese (Branta canadensis maxima) has increased dramatically in eastern South Dakota since reintroduction efforts were initiated in the 1960s. In order to effectively manage this population of Canada geese, it is important to determine their reproductive success. We collected information on goose nesting success and related brood movements using Very High Frequency (VHF) telemetry. We captured Canada geese in seven counties in eastern South Dakota during summers, 2000-2003. The reproductive success of 88 females was monitored during spring 2001-2004. Half of the geese had successful nests, 20.5% were unsuccessful, and 29.5% did not attempt to nest. Apparent and Mayfield nesting success estimates averaged 71% and 63%, respectively. Overall egg success was 62.6% and overall hatching success was 88.8%. Mean total clutch size averaged 5.73 +/- 0.17 while the number of goslings leaving the nest averaged 5.02 +/- 0.25. Forty-nine percent of marked females nested on or around the shoreline of their previous summers capture wetland. The remaining 51% nested on peripheral wetlands ranging from seasonal wetlands to permanent lakes. Mean distance from the capture wetlands to nest sites across years was 1.5 km +/- 0.18. Biologists need to consider long distance movement of giant Canada goose broods when making management decisions.																			0003-0031					OCT	2009	162	2					373	381		10.1674/0003-0031-162.2.373	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031-162.2.373													WOS:000271138500014

North-south palaeohydrological contrasts in the central Mediterranean during the Holocene: tentative synthesis and working hypotheses	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												On the basis of a multi-proxy approach and a strategy combining lacustrine and marine records along a north-south transect, data collected in the central Mediterranean within the framework of a collaborative project have led to reconstruction of high-resolution and well-dated palaeohydrological records and to assessment of their spatial and temporal coherency. Contrasting patterns of palaeohydrological changes have been evidenced in the central Mediterranean: south (north) of around 40 degrees N of latitude, the middle part of the Holocene was characterised by lake-level maxima (minima), during an interval dated to ca. 10 300-4500 cal BP to the south and 9000-4500 cal BP to the north. Available data suggest that these contrasting palaeohydrological patterns operated throughout the Holocene, both on millennial and centennial scales. Regarding precipitation seasonality, maximum humidity in the central Mediterranean during the middle part of the Holocene was characterised by humid winters and dry summers north of ca. 40 degrees N, and humid winters and summers south of ca. 40 degrees N. This may explain an apparent conflict between palaeoclimatic records depending on the proxies used for reconstruction as well as the synchronous expansion of tree species taxa with contrasting climatic requirements. In addition, south of ca. 40 degrees N, the first millennium of the Holocene was characterised by very dry climatic conditions not only in the eastern, but also in the central-and the western Mediterranean zones as reflected by low lake levels and delayed reforestation. These results suggest that, in addition to the influence of the Nile discharge reinforced by the African monsoon, the deposition of Sapropel 1 has been favoured (1) by an increase in winter precipitation in the northern Mediterranean borderlands, and (2) by an increase in winter and summer precipitation in the southern Mediterranean area. The climate reversal following the Holocene climate optimum appears to have been punctuated by two major climate changes around 7500 and 4500 cal BP. In the central Mediterranean, the Holocene palaeohydrological changes developed in response to a combination of orbital, ice-sheet and solar forcing factors. The maximum humidity interval in the south-central Mediterranean started ca. 10 300 cal BP, in correlation with the decline (1) of the possible blocking effects of the North Atlantic anticyclone linked to maximum insolation, and/or (2) of the influence of the remnant ice sheets and fresh water forcing in the North Atlantic Ocean. In the north-central Mediterranean, the lake-level minimum interval began only around 9000 cal BP when the Fennoscandian ice sheet disappeared and a prevailing positive NAO-(North Atlantic Oscillation) type circulation developed in the North Atlantic area. The major palaeohydrological oscillation around 4500-4000 cal BP may be a non-linear response to the gradual decrease in insolation, with additional key seasonal and interhemispheric changes. On a centennial scale, the successive climatic events which punctuated the entire Holocene in the central Mediterranean coincided with cooling events associated with deglacial outbursts in the North Atlantic area and decreases in solar activity during the interval 11 700-7000 cal BP, and to a possible combination of NAO-type circulation and solar forcing since ca. 7000 cal BP onwards. Thus, regarding the centennial-scale climatic oscillations, the Mediterranean Basin appears to have been strongly linked to the North Atlantic area and affected by solar activity over the entire Holocene. In addition to model experiments, a better understanding of forcing factors and past atmospheric circulation patterns behind the Holocene palaeohydrological changes in the Mediterranean area will require further investigation to establish additional high-resolution and well-dated records in selected locations around the Mediterranean Basin and in adjacent regions. Special attention should be paid to greater precision in the reconstruction, on millennial and centennial timescales, of changes in the latitudinal location of the limit between the northern and southern palaeohydrological Mediterranean sectors, depending on (1) the intensity and/or characteristics of climatic periods/oscillations (e. g. Holocene thermal maximum versus Neoglacial, as well as, for instance, the 8.2 ka event versus the 4 ka event or the Little Ice Age); and (2) on varying geographical conditions from the western to the eastern Mediterranean areas (longitudinal gradients). Finally, on the basis of projects using strategically located study sites, there is a need to explore possible influences of other general atmospheric circulation patterns than NAO, such as the East Atlantic-West Russian or North Sea-Caspian patterns, in explaining the apparent complexity of palaeoclimatic (palaeohydrological) Holocene records from the Mediterranean area.					; Debret, Maxime/L-4236-2017; Simonneau, Anaëlle/A-6186-2012; Joannin, Sebastien/C-8324-2012; Revel, Marie/C-2229-2015; Sadori, Laura/E-4774-2015; Vanniere, Boris/E-4002-2010; Gilli, Adrian/B-5238-2014; Desprat, Stephanie/N-7637-2013; BOUT-ROUMAZEILLES, Viviane/AAD-5259-2019; Tinner, Willy/F-6727-2013; Marie-Alexandrine, Sicre/AAR-1516-2020; Haas, Jean/I-8835-2018; Wagner, Bernd/J-4682-2012; Millet, Laurent/F-8730-2014; Col, Dan/A-2851-2009; Vannière, Boris/E-4002-2010; Di Vito, Mauro/MEQ-2109-2025; Francke, Alexander/N-9761-2013; De Smet, Marc/E-2451-2013; simonneau, anaelle/A-6186-2012	Wagner, Bernd/0000-0002-1369-7893; Debret, Maxime/0000-0002-8852-0152; Joannin, Sebastien/0000-0001-8345-9252; Bout-Roumazeilles, Viviane/0000-0001-6917-818X; Sadori, Laura/0000-0002-2774-6705; Vanniere, Boris/0000-0002-6779-6053; Wirth, Stefanie B./0000-0002-1276-8506; Gilli, Adrian/0000-0003-4193-2157; Zanchetta, Giovanni/0000-0002-7080-9599; Desprat, Stephanie/0000-0003-4400-679X; Anselmetti, Flavio/0000-0002-8785-3641; Millet, Laurent/0000-0003-2050-206X; Tinner, Willy/0000-0001-7352-0144; Desmet, Marc/0009-0002-8970-4313; Sicre, Marie-Alexandrine/0000-0002-5015-1400; Francke, Alexander/0000-0002-0370-5802; Colombaroli, Daniele/0000-0002-9632-2009; simonneau, anaelle/0000-0001-6194-4812; Siani, Giuseppe/0000-0002-2090-5320; Combourieu-Nebout, Nathalie/0000-0002-3604-5986													1814-9324	1814-9332					2013	9	5					2043	2071		10.5194/cp-9-2043-2013	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-9-2043-2013													WOS:000326597800002

The catch of age-1 white bass in fall gill-net samples from 1980 to 1998 was used as an index for year-class strength in Claytor Lake and Kerr Reservoir. Claytor Lake was sampled by electrofishing during the spring spawning run in 1996, and the residuals associated with catch-curve regressions were computed to estimate year-class strength. In Leesville Reservoir. white bass recruit to gill nets at age-0; therefore, the catch per effort oh age-0 white bass was used as an indicator of year-class strength. Strong year-classes (greater than or equal to0.03 fish/9.29 m(2) of gill net) were rare in each reservoir. In Claytor Lake, strong year-classes were produced in 1987 and 1993. both years of high spring inflows. Lake inflows during April were also positively related to the year-class strength of white bass in Kerr and Leesville reservoirs and explained about 90% of the variation in age-1 catch per effort. In all reservoirs, poor or missing year-classes were most common during years with low flow. If sporadic white bass year-class strength is partly due to climatic conditions, then equations derived to forecast year-class strength should facilitate decisions about stocking during low-flow years or adjusting regulations to optimize the use of available resources.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				MAY	2002	22	2					620	626		10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<0620:IORIID>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2002)022<0620:IORIID>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000175869600027

LIFE HISTORIES AND DISTRIBUTION OF OSTRACODS WITH DEPTH IN WESTERN LAKE GENEVA (PETIT-LAC), SWITZERLAND: A RECONNAISSANCE STUDY	CRUSTACEANA					14th International German Ostracodologists Meeting (IGOM 2012)	OCT 11-14, 2012	Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, Cologne, GERMANY	Univ of Cologne, Inst Geolog & Mineralog	Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft			Because environmental conditions within a given basin are different for each season and at different water depth, knowledge of the life history and depth distribution of target species is important for environmental and palaeoenvironmental interpretations based on ostracod species assemblages and/or the geochemical compositions of their valves. In order to determine the distribution of species with depth as well as the life history of species from Lake Geneva, a one-year sampling campaign of living ostracods was conducted at five sites (2, 5, 13, 33 and 70 m water depth) on a monthly basis in the Petit-Lac (western basin of Lake Geneva, Switzerland). Based on the results, the different species can be classified into three groups. Littoral taxa are found at 2 and 5 m water depth and include, in decreasing numbers of individuals, Cypridopsis vidua (O. F. Muller, 1776), Pseudocandona compressa (Koch, 1838), Limnocythere inopinata (Baird, 1843), Herpetocypris reptans (Baird, 1835), Potamocypris smaragdina (Vavra, 1891), Potamocypris similis (G. W. Muller, 1912), Plesiocypridopsis newtoni (Brady & Robertson, 1870), Prionocypris zenkeri (Chyzer & Toth, 1858) and Ilyocypris sp. Brady & Norman, 1889. Sublittoral species are found in a majority at 13 m water depth and to a lesser extend at 33 m water depth and include, in decreasing numbers of individuals, Fabaeformiscandona caudata (Kaufmann, 1900), Limnocytherina sanctipatricii, Candona candida (O. F. Miller, 1776) and Isocypris beauchampi (Paris, 1920). Profundal species are found equally at 13, 33 and 70 m water depth and includes, in decreasing numbers of individuals, Cytherissa lacustris (Sars, 1863), Candona neglecta Sars, 1887 and Cypria lacustris Lilljeborg, 1890. The occurrence of Limnocytherina sanctipatricii (Brady & Robertson, 1869) is restricted from late winter to late spring when temperatures are low, while C. vidua, L. inopinata, P. smaragdina, P. similis, P. newtoni and Ilyocypris sp. occur predominantly from spring to early autumn when temperatures are high. Individuals of C. neglecta, C. candida, E caudata, P. compressa, C. lacustris, H. reptans and Cp. lacustris occur throughout the year with juveniles and adults occurring during the same period (C. neglecta at 70 m, C. lacustris at 13, 33 and 70 m, and H. reptans at 2, 5 and 13 m water depth) or with juveniles occurring during a different period of the year than adults (C. neglecta at 13 and 33 m and C. candida, E caudata and P. compressa at their respective depth of occurrence). Among the environmental parameters investigated, an estimate of the relationship between ostracod autoecology and environmental parameters suggests that in the Petit-Lac: (i) water temperature and substrate characteristics are important factors controlling the distribution of species with depth, (ii) water temperature is also important for determining the timing of species development and, hence, its specific life history, and (iii) water oxygen and sedimentary organic matter content is less important compared to the other environmental parameter monitored.																			0011-216X	1568-5403				AUG	2014	87	8-9			SI		1095	1123		10.1163/15685403-00003344	http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15685403-00003344													WOS:000342332400010
J	Irfanullah, HM; Moss, B				Irfanullah, HM; Moss, B			A filamentous green algae-dominated temperate shallow lake: Variations on the theme of clearwater stable states?	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Shallow lakes can have two alternative stable states over wide range of nutrient concentrations: a macrophyte-dominated clear-water state and a phytoplankton-dominated turbid-water state. Little Budworth Pool, Cheshire, UK is a small (surface area 3 ha), shallow (max. depth < 1 m), clear-water lake with very high nitrate concentrations (annual mean 9.2 mg NO(3)-N l(-1)), relatively low phytoplankton growth (annual mean 13.5 mu g chlorophyll-a l(-1)) and high metaphytic filamentous green algal abundance (FGA, mainly Spirogyra), but without any submerged plant-beds. To understand the mechanism limiting phytoplankton biomass in summer, the lake was sampled every two weeks for two years (November 2001-October 2003) for water chemistry, phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthic macroinvertebrates, FGA and benthic diatoms. Phytoplankton growth was mainly dominated by small species like Cyclotella spp., Chroomonas acuta and Cryptomonas spp., whereas among the zooplankton Cladocera showed high abundance of both small and large species (Bosmina longirostris and Daphnia longispina) especially in summer and autumn. FGA attained highest biomass in the warmer months and showed negative correlations with nitrate-N and total nitrogen concentrations suggesting nutrient removal ability of these plants, but also possible increased denitrification in summer. While phytoplankton growth was negatively correlated with FGA biomass, cladoceran densities were positively related to the latter. A comparison among macrophyte-dominated lakes and FGA-dominated lakes showed similarities among them regarding water clarity, nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton growth and species composition, zooplankton assemblage and abundance, but not for abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates. We suggest that in a lake lacking submerged plants, abundance of FGA may act as a buffer against a forward switch to phytoplankton dominance, thus maintaining a clear-water state. The control of phytoplankton growth was primarily not through FGA removing nutrients from the water because sufficient available nutrients were recorded in water during summer. Rather it was by intense grazing by cladocerans ostensibly supported in refuges provided by FGA.					; , Haseeb/AAL-1498-2021	Irfanullah, Haseeb/0000-0002-5532-8922; 													0003-9136					MAY	2005	163	1					25	47		10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0163	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0163													WOS:000229699300002
J	Abnizova, A; Young, KL				Abnizova, Anna; Young, Kathy L.			Sustainability of High Arctic Ponds in a Polar Desert Environment	ARCTIC												Arctic wetland environments are sensitive to ongoing climate change as seen by the recent loss of lakes and ponds in southern Alaska, Siberia, and northern Ellesmere Island, Canada. A clearer picture of the mechanisms accounting for these losses or the persistence of ponds is presently required. To better understand and quantify the hydrologic processes that are leading to the sustainability or demise of High Arctic ponds, a detailed study was conducted during the summer seasons of 2005 and 2006 at Somerset Island, Nunavut (72 degrees 43' N, 94 degrees 15' W). A water balance framework that quantifies water inputs, losses, and storage was employed on four ponds situated in three broad geomorphic areas (coastal, bedrock, and glacial terrain, which includes plateau and moraine). The initial snow cover amount influenced the water level pattern for the summer season. Large end-of-winter snow accumulations in the deep Bedrock pond ensured large initial water storage and seasonal sustainability despite variable climatic conditions and a coarse substrate, which encouraged subsurface outflow. Connectivity to a stream draining an upland area and a melting late-lying snowbed nearby allowed the small Moraine pond to maintain stable water levels throughout both years. Sandy soils typical of the Coastal and Plateau ponds favored seepage and subsurface water losses, leading to desiccation of these ponds during dry periods. Lateral water losses from the Coastal pond were enhanced by the presence of a downslope frost crack that formed a steep hydraulic gradient with the pond. High initial snowfall and substantial rain maintain pond water levels, but in years with low snowfall and dry conditions, ponds are vulnerable to disappearance unless a range of dependable hydrological linkages exists.																			0004-0843	1923-1245				MAR	2010	63	1					67	84																WOS:000276634300007

Here, we compared the occurrence, abundance, and removal of 60 antibiotics and 27 ARGs in natural (Yeya Lake (YL)) and constructed (Bai River (BR)) riverine wetlands in Beijing, China. The concentrations of antibiotics in YL wetland were ND-51.9 ng/L. in water and ND-37.9 ng/g in sediments Significantly higher concentrations were found in BR wetland (ND-546 ng/L in water and ND-118 ng/g in sediments), which locates at the downstream of a reclaimed water treatment plant. The abundances of ARGs in YL and BR wetlands were up to 533 x 10(5) and 841 x 10(5) copies/mL in water, and 1.60 x 10(7) and 4.67 x 10(8) copies/g in sediments, respectively. These results suggest that wastewater greatly contributes to the elevated abundance of antibiotics and ARGs in both water and sediments. Compared to summer, higher levels of antibiotics in water were found in winter due to the higher usage, slower attenuation and the limited dilution. But higher abundances of ARGs were found in summer than in winter, in accordance with the favored microbial growth at higher temperature as denoted by copies of 16S rRNA. Compared to BR wetland, YL wetland achieved better removal of antibiotics and Sigma RGs, with average removal efficiencies of 70.0% and 87.5%. Antibiotics, ARGs and environmental factors showed strong correlations in water samples from YL wetland. However, in BR wetland that receives urban wastewater effluents, no correlation between antibiotics and ARGs was found although the distribution of antibiotics was affected by aquatic environmental factors. These results indicate that subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics may stimulate the prevalence of ARGs in natural wetlands. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we present both pathways and their contribution to the primary production in Lake Kinneret. Phytoplankton density, measured as chlorophyll a (Chl a), and photosynthetic primary productivity (PP), measured as radiocarbon isotope uptake, have been monitored in the lake for more than four decades. The average Chl a areal concentration in the lake is 208 mg m(-2) and the PP is 1.66 g C m(-2) day(-1). Both parameters displayed marked seasonal patterns, with highest values occurring in April and May. From July to December, Chl a and PP values were on average only 24 and 64 %, respectively, of the spring maxima. However, since the mid-1990s, a definite weakening of the seasonal periodicity of Chl a and PP was observed. Intensive chemosynthetic microbial activity, fueled by H2S oxidation, was measured at the chemoclines during its deepening below the photic zone in late autumn, and close to the sediment-water interface in May when the chemocline starts to form. Averaged depth-integrated chemoautotrophic primary production at the chemocline was 16 and 24 % of the photosynthetic primary production in May and during autumn, respectively. The delta C-13 of particulate organic matter at the chemocline ranged between -27 and -39 parts per thousand, suggesting the involvement of intensive chemosynthesis. Mass and isotopic balance of carbon and H2S suggest that chemosynthetic production contributes between 20 and 30 % of the total primary production in Lake Kinneret annually. This component should be considered when the lake's carbon budgets and food webs are assessed.																			1573-4595	2543-005X	978-94-017-8944-8; 978-94-017-8943-1				2014	6						417	+		10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8_24	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8_24	10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8												WOS:000459771400025

The three-dimensional state of stratified shear instability in cold water	PHYSICS OF FLUIDS												Stratified shear instability is one of the most widely studied routes to turbulence that occurs in natural waters. We report on simulations in the cold water regime relevant to late winter/early spring lakes, which is characterized by very small density differences and a nonlinear equation of state. The stratified shear instability in this regime achieves a three-dimensional state but it is not a priori clear that a substantial inertial subrange exists. We quantify the manner in which the three-dimensional state dissipates momentum and mixes scalars, and report on the nature of coherent structures in the flow with a focus on late times.

The epipelic algal community of Woods Lake (Herkimer Co., NY) was dominated by diatoms and cyanobacteria. Distinct depth zonation patterns of community composition were evident. Total algal biovolume increased with depth due to a dense cyanobacterial mat on the sediments in deeper water (5-8 m). This mat was dominated by a single species of cyanobacteria, Hapalosiphon pumilus (Kutz.) Kirchner, which accounted for the late summer maximum in total biovolume at 7 m. The shallower (1-4 m) epipelic communities were dominated by diatoms, which showed a spring maximum in total biovolume and were dominated by Fragilaria acidobiontica Charles, Navicula tenuicephala Hust, and N. subtilissima Cl.																			0022-3646	1529-8817				JUN	1988	24	2					146	152																WOS:A1988N927200004

Using Side-Scan Sonar and N-Mixture Modeling to Estimate Atlantic Sturgeon Spawning Migration Abundance	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Understanding the relationship between number of spawners and recruitment is essential for managing fish populations. Atlantic Sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus (ATS) are endangered anadromous fish inhabiting the rivers, estuaries, and marine environments along the Atlantic coast of North America. Atlantic Sturgeon are periodic life history strategists that exhibit both spring and fall spawning migrations. Traditional capture-mark-recapture techniques can be used to estimate spawning run abundance but are resource intensive and potentially stressful on migrating individuals. Noninvasive methods, such as side-scan sonar, can be a less stressful alternative to estimating abundance. We sampled the uppermost portion of the Savannah River, USA, over 50 occasions from August to November 2017 using side-scan sonar. Bayesian N-mixture modeling was used to estimate spawner abundance and covariate effects based on spatially and temporally replicated count data obtained from sonar recordings. We detected at least one ATS on each sampling occasion and estimated a maximum daily spawner abundance between 35 and 55 individuals (95% credible interval) within the sampled area during the 2017 fall spawning season. Maximum discharge significantly affected ATS detection, and site average maximum depth significantly affected ATS abundance. Our results suggest that side-scan sonar can be used as an alternative to traditional mark-recapture techniques for spawner abundance estimation. Routine sampling by using our methods will efficiently produce spawning run estimates and provide insight regarding the effects of environmental covariates on spawner abundance seasonally.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2019	39	5					939	950		10.1002/nafm.10326	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10326		AUG 2019											WOS:000488426000001

Arctic microbial ecosystems and impacts of extreme warming during the International Polar Year	POLAR SCIENCE												As a contribution to the International Polar Year program MERGE (Microbiological and Ecological Responses to Global Environmental change in polar regions), studies were conducted on the terrestrial and aquatic microbial ecosystems of northern Canada (details at: http://www.cen.ulaval.ca/merge/). The habitats included permafrost soils, saline coldwater springs, supraglacial lakes on ice shelves, epishelf lakes in fjords, deep meromictic lakes, and shallow lakes, ponds and streams. Microbiological samples from each habitat were analysed by HPLC pigment assays, light and fluorescence microscopy, and DNA sequencing. The results show a remarkably diverse microflora of viruses, Archaea (including ammonium oxidisers and methanotrophs), Bacteria (including filamentous sulfur-oxidisers in a saline spring and benthic mats of Cyanobacteria in many waterbodies), and protists (including microbial eukaryotes in snowbanks and ciliates in ice-dammed lakes). In summer 2008, we recorded extreme warming at Ward Hunt Island and vicinity, the northern limit of the Canadian high Arctic, with air temperatures up to 20.5 degrees C. This was accompanied by pronounced changes in microbial habitats: deepening of the permafrost active layer; loss of perennial lake ice and sea ice; loss of ice-dammed freshwater lakes; and 23% loss of total ice shelf area, including complete break-up and loss of the Markham Ice Shelf cryo-ecosystem. These observations underscore the vulnerability of Arctic microbial ecosystems to ongoing climate change. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.

Microscopic gut content analysis of Chironomus Chironomus plumosus (L.) and C. anthracinus Zett., collected from 18 m depth in mesotrophic Lake Erken, revealed significant seasonal differences between the two species. 2. C. plumosus dietary constituents showed greater seasonal variation than those of C. anthracinus, with diatom contribution to the gut contents reflecting temporal changes in the phytoplankton. 3. Overall the percentage of gut content constituted by detritus, algae, animal remains, and inorganic matter averaged 96%, 4%, 0.4% and 0.03% for C. plumosus and 97%, 3%, 0.6% and 0.03% C. anthracinus. 4. Coefficients of dietary overlap for non-detrital foods decreased markedly from August to September. During this period the proportion of centric diatoms in the guts of C. plumosus increased by 94% while no marked changes were noted in C. anthracinus. 5. C. plumosus ingested more diatoms than C. anthracinus, especially during diatom blooms in spring and autumn.

Multidecadal hydroclimatic variability in northeastern North America since 1550 AD	CLIMATE DYNAMICS												A network of varve and dendrochronological time series that provide annual resolution of Boreal tree growth conditions and Arctic snow pack and melt variability were used to investigate the imprint of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) on continental hydroclimatic variability in northeastern and northern North America from 1550 to 1986 AD. The hydroclimatic proxies show a coherent, AMO-like spectral pattern active since the late sixteenth and the early eighteenth century in the Canadian Arctic and southeastern Boreal regions, respectively. Positive AMO phases are associated with more intense spring runoff in the Arctic and with longer growth season and increased summer moisture availability in the southeastern boreal forest. These results offer new insights about the widespread response of North American hydroclimate to low frequency changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures.

J	Talling, JF				Talling, JF			Phytoplankton-zooplankton seasonal timing and the 'clear-water phase' in some English lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. An examination is made of the relative seasonal timing of the postwinter increase of phytoplankton and zooplankton populations in four English lake basins. It centres upon weekly sampling over 20 years and rough counts of larger Crustacea, as copepods and cladocerans, from filtered samples that were used for chlorophyll a (Chl) estimation. 2. Typically, a spring maximum of phytoplankton, dominated by diatoms and earlier in the shallower lakes, is accompanied or followed by a maximum of copepods and then one of cladocerans dominated by the Daphnia hyalina-galeata complex. Regarding timing, the maximum of copepods has no apparent relation with phytoplankton abundance ( Chl). The maximum of cladocerans appears to be largely independent of variation in the phytoplankton maximum, but is generally associated with a minimum in Chl. Evidence for some direct causality in this inverse correlation after the spring phytoplankton maximum is best displayed by the shallow Esthwaite Water in which the peaks of Chl and cladocerans are separated further than in the deep Windermere basins where phytoplankton growth is delayed. In Esthwaite Water, and possibly often in Windermere, a principal minimum in Chl is ascribable to grazing by Daphnia. 3. The typical inverse relationship of Chl and cladocerans is lost in some years when relatively inedible large phytoplankters ( e. g. colonial chrysomonads, filamentous cyanophytes) are abundant and Chl minima are less pronounced, although maxima of cladocerans still occur. Conversely, available edible phytoplankters include various small forms grouped as mu-algae and Cryptomonas spp.; their probable depletions by Daphnia appear to be sequential and may limit the latter's maxima, whose inception is temperature-dependent. 4. The spring-summer maxima of cladocerans and minima of Chl are generally coincident with a main seasonal maximum of Secchi disc transparency and light penetration - to which removal of non-phytoplankton particles by filtering cladocerans may contribute.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2003	48	1					39	52		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.00968.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.00968.x													WOS:000179693900004

The two proxies were calibrated for both global and local modern data sets (NMSDB). This multi-proxy approach was then applied to a sediment core collected from Lake Ayrag, Arkhangai, covering the Late Holocene. In addition to brGDGTs and pollen, we also performed magnetic susceptibility, micro-XRF, elemental and isotopic bulk chemistry, and Non-Pollen Palynomorph (NPP) analyses on the Lake Ayrag sediments in order to better understand the lake system and human impact dynamics. While the globally calibrated record (both for pollen and brGDGTs) displayed a slight millennial-scale cooling, the locally calibrated results exhibit centennial-scale climate oscillations such as the 4.2 and 3.5 kyr events, the Roman Warm Period (RWP), Dark Ages Cold Period (DACP), Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and Little Ice Age (LIA). These climate oscillations and vegetation changes are discussed with regard to the main Mongolian human historical occupation events documented by pastoralism proxies, especially the Xiongnu, Mongol Empire, Mandchou and Soviet periods. The climate systems currently dominating the Mongolian Plateau are difficult to resolve because inter-annual climate variability is pronounced. However, precipitation mainly occurs in summer (easterly monsoon driven) when the winter Westerlies lead the air mass movement. In the past, both pollen and biomarkers exhibited anti-correlated trends with annual precipitation and temperature: over the last 4000 kcal yr BP, the warm periods (MWP, RWP) were dry and the cold periods (LIA, DACP, 3.5 kyrs) were humid. Thus, the East Asian Summer Monsoon (i.e., warm and wet conditions dominant during summer) seems not to have influenced central Mongolian climate during the Late Holocene, which could have remained dominated by the Westerlies/Siberian High cells conflict. A comparison between the Ayrag record and other paleoclimate records from the Baikal area (Dulikha), Mongolian Plateau (D3L6, D1L1, NRX, ATM), and continental China (Kesang, Baluk and Tonnel caves, XRD section) to the Loess Plateau (Huangye and Xianglong caves) suggests that the monsoon front has oscillated since the Early Holocene. A climate synthesis following strictly the same approach (locally calibrated brGDGTs vs. pollen-inferred climate) for all the ACA records available for the Late Holocene helps us to resolve the climate systems paced by centennial to millennial-scale oscillations and their consequences for human societies.

Goals of this survey were to determine if and when algal toxins are present in the Salton Sea and to describe the phytoplankton composition during those times. A total of 29 samples was collected for toxicity analysis from both nearshore and midlake sites visited biweekly from January to December 1999. Dinoflagellates and diatoms dominated most samples, but some were dominated by a prymnesiophyte ( Pleurochrysis pseudoroscoffensis) or a raphidophyte (Chattonella marina). Several types of blooms were observed and sampled. The dinoflagellate Gyrodinium uncatenum formed an extensive, dense (up to 310 000 cells ml(-)1) and long-lasting bloom during the winter in 1999. A coccolithophorid, Pleurochrysis pseudoroscoffensis, occurred at high densities in surface films and nearshore areas during the spring and summer of 1999. These surface films also contained high densities of one or two other species (an unidentified scrippsielloid, Heterocapsa niei, Chattonella marina). Localized blooms were also observed in the Salton Sea. An unknown small dinoflagellate reached high densities (110 000 cells ml(-1)) inside Varner Harbor, and an unidentified species of Gymnodinium formed a dense (270 000 cells ml(-1)) band along part of the southern shoreline during the summer. Three species known to produce toxins in other systems were found. Protoceratium reticulatum (= Gonyaulax grindleyi) and Chattonella marina were found in several samples taken during summer months, and Prorocentrum minimum was found in low densities in several samples. Extracts of most samples, including those containing known toxic species, showed a low level (<10% mortality across all concentrations) of activity in the brine shrimp lethality assay and were not considered toxic. All sample extracts tested in the mouse bioassay showed no activity. One sample extract taken from the bloom of the small dinoflagellate was highly active (100% mortality across all concentrations) in the brine shrimp lethality assay, but the active material could not be isolated. While dense algal blooms are common at the Salton Sea, no evidence gathered in this study suggests that algal toxins are present within phytoplankton cells; however, toxins actively excreted by cells may have been missed. Blooms of phytoplankton likely contribute to wildlife mortality at the Salton Sea. Possible mechanisms including intoxication due to ingestion of feathers in grebes and waterlogging caused by changes in surface tension are discussed.

Growth rates in mass (G, per day) of the three species were similar and inversely related to dry mass (DM, micrograms) following the power relationship G = 0.11 DM-0.28; neither water temperature nor seston abundance and quality varied sufficiently during the study period to have a significant influence on growth rates. The allometric method was used to estimate production of the three species, and the resulting estimates are compared with cohort methods and size-frequency estimates. Large larvae were responsible for most of the production, and most of the production occurred before the spring rise in water temperature. Measured growth rates in winter are significantly lower than those reported for simuliids in warmer waters. A reanalysis of published data shows that growth rates of simuliids increase as the square root of water temperature (T, degrees Celsius) (G = 0.08 DM-0.21 T0.48).					; Morin, Antoine/J-9583-2013	Morin, Antoine/0000-0003-0043-2391; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	1988	45	2					315	324		10.1139/f88-037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f88-037													WOS:A1988M741100015

The variety of LSWT will affect water environment problems such as lake water quality, aquatic organism growth and reproduction. Therefore, this study selected six lakes that play a crucial role in China's economic and social development, and explored the causes and driving mechanisms of LSWT changes, which would provide support for the governance and protection of the ecological environment. Meanwhile, according to the fluctuation of lake boundary, the lakes were divided into two types, A and B. Based on the classification, the changing characteristics of LSWT from 2001 to 2018 were analyzed, and the stepwise polynomial regression analysis was used as new method to quantify the contribution from each driving factor to LSWT. Then, the driving mechanisms of natural and anthropogenic factors to LSWT was discussed. Results show that (1) the mean comprehensive change rates of LSWT-day and LSWT-night showed an upward trend in the past 18 years. The correlation between near surface air temperature (NSAT) and the annual average LSWT of the 6 lakes was higher than that of other factors, and this feature was most significant in spring, autumn and winter. The correlation between anthropogenic factors and annual average LSWT was affected by lake type, NSAT and precipitation in the basin. (2) Natural factors (especially NSAT) had higher contribution rates to LSWT. The contribution from anthropogenic factors to LSWT-night was higher than that in the daytime. For lakes classified in type B, the effect intensity of anthropogenic factors on LSWT-day was affected by NSAT, precipitation and lake area. The contribution rate to LSWT-night was related to the growth rate of the impervious surface area in the basin.

Paleoclimate records for the Southern Hemisphere are scarce and only a few quantitative high-resolution reconstructions exist for the past millennium. We present a record of annually laminated sediments of Lago Plomo (46 degrees 59'S, 72 degrees 52'W,203 m a.s.l.) located east of the Northern Patagonian Ice Field (NPI). Radiometric dating (Pb-210, Cs-137, C-14 AMS) is consistent with counts of millimetre-scale laminae, confirming the annual nature of the laminae couplets with a light summer and a dark winter layer. The varves were analyzed for thickness, mass accumulation rate (MAR), scanning x-ray fluorescence (XRF) and scanning reflectance spectroscopy in the visible range (VIS-RS). MAR data were calibrated against austral winter (JJA) precipitation data (CRU TS 3.0) for the period AD 1930-2002 (r = 0.67, p((aut)) < 0.05). Using a linear inverse regression model we reconstructed winter precipitation for Lago Plomo back to AD 1530. The root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) is small (13.3 mm/month; 12% of the average precipitation) compared with the pronounced decadal and multidecadal variability, suggesting that most of the reconstructed variability is significant. Wetter phases (reference AD 1930-2002) were observed around AD 1600, AD 1630-1690 and ad 1780-1850, and a prolonged drier period AD 1690-1780 with a multidecadal minimum centered on AD 1770. The spatial correlation for South America suggests that the JJA precipitation record from Lago Plomo is representative for large areas in the southwest between c.41 degrees S and 51 degrees S.

M.			Application of a Robotic Underwater Vehicle for Limnological Studies (Case Study of Lake Glubokoe, Ruzay District, Moscow Region)	WATER RESOURCES												A new approach to experimental studies in the water column of lakes and reservoirs using the Vinci robotic profilograph is presented. The autonomous underwater vehicle is designed to conduct regular multiparameter measurements of vertical profiles (to a depth of 60 m) over a long period of time (>1 month) in automatic mode at a moored hydrological station. Experimental operation of the device was carried out in Lake Glubokoe (Ruza district, Moscow region) in 2022-2023. The observations made it possible to describe in detail the seasonal evolution of the aquatic environment, including the transition from a state of homothermy to direct thermal stratification of the lake with the formation of hypoxia in the hypolimnion in the central deep-water basin of the lake. Intense diurnal fluctuations in the concentration of dissolved oxygen and water temperature and turbidity were found in the bottom layer. A hypothesis has been put forward that in the spring-summer period, hypoxia is formed not only due to the barrier effect of the metalimnion, but also due to the increase in oxygen consumption for the microbiological oxidation of detritus particles raised from the bottom by pulsating groundwater springs and stirred up in the bottom layer.

J	JEHL, JR				JEHL, JR			BIOLOGY OF RED-NECKED PHALAROPES (PHALAROPUS-LOBATUS) AT THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE GREAT-BASIN IN FALL MIGRATION	GREAT BASIN NATURALIST												Large numbers of Red-necked Phalaropes migrate overland across the Great Basin in fall, occurring commonly at highly saline lakes. Migrants occur at Mono Lake, California, from mid-July to mid-October. The earliest migrants are adult females, followed several weeks later by adult males, and finally by juveniles. Adults make up ca 75% of the population, with males outnumbering females by 5:4. From 1980 through 1984 an estimated 52,000-65,000 birds passed through the area each year, except in 1983, when only 36,000 were recorded. The low number might be attributable to high mortality on oceanic wintering grounds in the Southern Hemisphere in 1982 associated with the severe El Nino. At Mono Lake the phalaropes concentrate near the shore and feed almost exclusively on brine flies. The migrants neither gain much weight nor accomplish much molt during their sojourn, which suggests that the average stay is only a few days. Some aspects of the molt pattern differ from those reported elsewhere.																			0017-3614					APR 30	1986	46	2					185	197																WOS:A1986E107800001
J	Anwar, T; Kravchinsky, VA; Zhang, R				Anwar, Taslima; Kravchinsky, Vadim A.; Zhang, Rui			Magneto- and cyclostratigraphy in the red clay sequence: New age model and paleoclimatic implication for the eastern Chinese Loess Plateau	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH												The Chinese Loess Plateau red clay sequences display a continuous alternation of sedimentary cycles that represent recurrent climatic fluctuations from 2.58Ma to the Miocene. Deciphering such a record can provide us with vital information on global and Asian climatic variations. Lack of fossils and failure of absolute dating methods made magnetostratigraphy a leading method to build age models for the red clay sequences. Here we test the magnetostratigraphic age model against cyclostratigraphy. For this purpose we investigate the climate cyclicity recorded in magnetic susceptibility and sedimentary grain size in a red clay section previously dated 11Myr old with magnetostratigraphy alone. Magnetostratigraphy dating based on only visual correlation could potentially lead to erroneous age model. In this study the correlation is executed through the iteration procedure until it is supported by cyclostratigraphy; i.e., Milankovitch cycles are resolved in the best possible manner. Our new age model provides an age of 5.2Ma for the Shilou profile. Based on the new age model, wavelet analysis reveals the well-preserved 400kyr and possible 100kyr eccentricity cycles on the eastern Chinese Loess Plateau. Further, paleomonsoon evolution during 2.58-5.2Ma is reconstructed and divided into three intervals (2.58-3.6Ma, 3.6-4.5Ma, and 4.5-5.2Ma). The upper part, the youngest stage, is characterized by a relatively intensified summer monsoon, the middle stage reflects an intensification of the winter monsoon and aridification in Asia, and the earliest stage indicates that summer and winter monsoon cycles may have rapidly altered. The use of cyclostratigraphy along with magnetostratigraphy gives us an effective method of dating red clay sequences, and our results imply that many presently published age models for the red clay deposits should be perhaps re-evaluated.

Our test case is the Aral Sea, located in the arid zone of central Asia. Due to the diversion of its primary inlet rivers for irrigation purposes the lake suffered a devastating decline until its south eastern part had almost dried out in 2009. The study is focused on the period of the satellite gravity field mission GRACE from 2002 onwards. We present the change of the lake's surface extent based on optical remote sensing data from Landsat images that were analyzed for spring and autumn each year. Height variations of the lake surface were computed from multi-mission satellite altimetry. Both the surface extent and the water stage of the lake reached an absolute minimum in autumn 2009. However in 2010 a clear reversal of the negative trend of the previous years is visible. A geometrical intersection of the water level with a digital elevation model allows for estimating water volume changes. The resulting volume changes are subsequently analyzed with respect to satellite-based estimates of mass variations observed by GRACE. The results reveal that water storage variations in the Aral Sea are indeed the principal contributor to the GRACE signal of mass variations in this region. The different observations from all missions agree very well with respect to their temporal behavior.

J	Sorensen, K				Sorensen, K			Population characteristics of Siren lacertina and Amphiuma means in north Florida	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												I conducted a mark-recapture study of Siren lacertina and Amphiuma means for one year at a lake in north Florida and documented average individual movement, size class distribution, seasonal activity patterns, survival rates, and density estimates. I captured Siren lacertina more frequently in winter and A. means more frequently in spring. Recapture probabilities of both species were low, whereas survival rates and density estimates (1.3 salamanders/m(2) for S. lacertina, 0.28 salamanders/m(2) for A. means) were high. I recorded no individual movement of over 10 m for either species. Sirens and amphiumas are large, predatory generalists that can have substantial biomass in wetlands (233 g/m(2) and 44 g/m(2), respectively, at this study site), and therefore can impact many other wetland species. Thus, more attention must be focused on evaluating and monitoring their populations.																			1528-7092						2004	3	2					249	258		10.1656/1528-7092(2004)003[0249:PCOSLA]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/1528-7092(2004)003[0249:PCOSLA]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000222804000006

Osaka municipal waterworks, which is located downstream of lake Biwa, has made many efforts to treat musty-odor compounds produced in Lake Biwa from spring through autumn. With the development of analytical methods for the determination of musty-odor compounds, we have been able to confirm that planktonic blue-green algae are the major causes of the musty-odor occurrences. The relationship between the growth of blue-green algae and the water quality was not so apparent. However, through our data analysis focusing on the relationship between musty-odor occurrences due to Phormidium tenue or Oscillatoria tenuis and some nutrients in Lake Biwa, we found that the concentration of nitrate in water may be an important parameter for the estimation of growth of the algae and the musty-odor behavior.																			0273-1223						1995	31	11					153	158		10.1016/0273-1223(95)00470-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0273-1223(95)00470-8													WOS:A1995RW01400024

Four parasite species were found: the cestode Gangesia pseudobagri and the digeneans Orientocreadium siluri, Coitocoecum plagiorchis, and Echinoparyphium lingulatum. There was a significant difference in the mean abundance of O. siluri between male (8.12 +/- 16.99) and female hosts (3.19 +/- 5.42). Parasite distribution patterns were all overdispersed (s(2)/(x) over bar > 1) and followed the negative binomial distribution. In the analysis of changes in mean parasite abundance and variance to mean ratio with host age, convex curves were observed for G. pseudobagri and O. siluri. This suggests that these 2 helminths may have had deleterious effects on the hosts. Significant seasonal changes were detected in the prevalence and mean abundance of the 4 helminths other than for the prevalence of O. siluri. The mean abundance of O. siluri, C. plagiorchis, and G. pseudobagri reached a peak in the spring, and E. lingulatum had the highest infection levels in the spring and early summer.						nie, pin/0000-0002-9492-2940													1525-2647	1938-2952				JAN	2010	77	1					31	36		10.1654/4396.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1654/4396.1													WOS:000273545300006

This study considers the changes in assemblages at a fixed station during two consecutive annual cycles, as well as their distribution in summer and winter profiles of the lake. Total sample-assemblages have been quantified as species diversities, measured by the Shannon-Wiener index H (S). The trends of this index are compared to physical parameters (temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, CO2) of the bottom waters of this lake. The Ostracoda assemblages (8100 adults and juvenile living specimens, belonging to 20 species) are dominated by Cypria ophtalmica, Cypridopsis vidua and Pseudocandona marchica. Biocenotic assemblages are well developed in the western, flat shelf area of the lake (0 to 9 m in depth), where a major substrate of charophytes permits assemblages with moderate diversity levels to be maintained. Waters below 10 in are practically barren of living individuals, and only few specimens of the generalist species Cypria ophtalmica have been found alive at that depth. Differential responses of most abundant species to changes in the environmental parameters of the bottom of the lake have been interpreted in terms of the ecological requirements of those species. Most of these responses are clearly influenced by shifts in the parameters mentioned, and decreases in oxygen and increases in CO2 produce particularly marked falls in assemblage diversity levels. Conversely, when the oxygen increases and the CO2 falls, the diversity levels increase. The time delay in responding to these changes is estimated at less than one month. This general behaviour of the ostracod assemblages of Caicedo Lake is not followed by C. ophtalmica which is considered a particular species that can stand hypoxic waters, with relatively high CO2 concentrations, This ability of C. ophtalmica allows specimens of this species to occupy deep and environmentally unfavourable niches in the lake, that no other ostracod species of Caicedo Lake does. The knowledge of areal and temporal distribution of Ostracoda species in a temperate lake, such as Caicedo de Yuso, exhibits a good potential for applying these results to the interpretation of past lacustrine/palustrine environments of Neogene lakes in similar palaeogeographical contexts.

The paleolimnological record is used to show the magnitude of paleoclimatic changes in the area from 25,000 years to the present. Faunal assemblages consist of four species of the genus Limnocythere: L. sappaensis, L. ceriotuberosa, L. bradburyi and L. platyforma, all associated with Candona caudata, Candona patzcuaro and Cypridopsis vidua. A paleosalinity index developed from these assemblages indicates that the lake's salinity fluctuated frequently from oligo- to meso-haline conditions during the last less than or similar to 25,000 years. This pattern and low salinity range are in good agreement with modern TDS (here used as an indicator of salinity) values recorded from 26 wells and one spring from the area (258-975 mg l(-1)). To estimate paleotemperature we examined the trace element content (Mg/Ca ratios) from individual valves of L. ceriotuberosa and L. platyforma, the two species most commonly recorded in Laguna Babicora. Shell Mg/Ca ratios of 204 specimens of these two species were used to estimate water temperature (Mg/Ca) by means of experimental standard coefficients. Our data show that paleowater temperature ranged from 5.6-21.3 degreesC (with 2sigma values ranging from 0.2-4.8 degreesC), which suggest a close correlation with atmospheric temperatures around the lake. These results are in good agreement with a modern mean winter temperature (3.5 degreesC) and mean summer temperature (20 degreesC) recorded in the area between 1970 and 1980.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				FEB	2002	27	2					185	206		10.1023/A:1014215818589	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1014215818589													WOS:000173990500003

Thermal environment and maternal effects shape egg size in a freshwater fish	ECOSPHERE												Offspring size determines offspring survival rates; thus, understanding factors influencing offspring size variability could elucidate variation in population dynamics. Offspring size variation is influenced through multigenerational adaptation to local environments and within-lifetime plastic responses to environmental variability and maternal effects among individuals. Moreover, offspring size variation may represent trade-offs in energy allocation within individuals that influence lifetime reproductive success. However, the mechanisms whereby environmental conditions influence offspring size, e.g., via inducing adaptive and plastic variation in population-scale maternal effects, remain poorly understood. We evaluated intra-specific variation in maternal effects, egg size, and intra-individual egg size variation in six populations of walleye (Sander vitreus) and related among-and within-population patterns to thermal conditions. Egg size was conserved within populations and negatively related to long-term thermal conditions among populations, while maternal effect strengths were positively related to thermal conditions, suggesting that populations inhabiting warmer environments adapted to produce smaller eggs but stronger maternal effects. Within a population, egg size was positively related to colder winters, suggesting cold winters may alter egg size through effects on maternal condition or as an adaptive maternal effect to improve offspring survival. Intra-individual egg size variation varied little among populations or with female size, but declined with increasing summer and decreasing winter temperatures. Our result suggests that environmental conditions could impact not only short-term offspring production but also spur adaptive changes in offspring phenotypes. Thus, it is necessary to account for adaptive responses to predict population dynamics under environmental changes.					; Vandergoot, Christopher/JAO-1190-2023; Feiner, Zachary/A-2117-2009	Hook, Tomas/0000-0001-9185-6741; WANG, HUI-YU/0000-0002-9100-321X; Feiner, Zachary/0000-0001-7880-0778; 													2150-8925					MAY	2016	7	5							e01304	10.1002/ecs2.1304	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1304													WOS:000377215200024
J	Sullivan, AB; Jager, HI; Myers, R				Sullivan, AB; Jager, HI; Myers, R			Modeling white sturgeon movement in a reservoir: the effect of water quality and sturgeon density	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												We developed a movement model to examine the distribution and survival of white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) in a reservoir subject to large spatial and temporal variation in dissolved oxygen and temperature. Temperature and dissolved oxygen were simulated by a CE-QUAL-W2 model of Brownlee Reservoir, Idaho for a typical wet, normal, and dry hydrologic year. We compared current water quality conditions to scenarios with reduced nutrient inputs to the reservoir. White sturgeon habitat quality was modeled as a function of temperature, dissolved oxygen and, in some cases, suitability for foraging and depth. We assigned a quality index to each cell along the bottom of the reservoir. The model simulated two aspects of daily movement. Advective movement simulated the tendency for animals to move toward areas with high habitat quality, and diffusion simulated density dependent movement away from areas with high sturgeon density in areas with non-lethal habitat conditions. Mortality resulted when sturgeon were unable to leave areas with lethal temperature or dissolved oxygen conditions. Water quality was highest in winter and early spring and lowest in mid to late summer. Limiting nutrient inputs reduced the area of Brownlee Reservoir with lethal conditions for sturgeon and raised the average habitat suitability throughout the reservoir. Without movement, simulated white sturgeon survival ranged between 45 and 89%. Allowing movement raised the predicted survival of sturgeon under all conditions to above 90% as sturgeon avoided areas with low habitat quality. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

First survey of helminths in adult goats in Hunan Province, China	TROPICAL BIOMEDICINE												The objective of the present survey was to reveal the prevalence of helminths in adult goats in Hunan Province, the People's Republic of China. From July 2010 through February 2013, a total of 479 goats slaughtered in local abattoirs and markets were examined for the presence of helminths using a helminthological approach. Eighty-six percent of the examined goats were infected with at least one species of helminths. In total, 15 genera of helminths were found representing 2 phyla, 3 classes, 5 orders, and 11 families. Oesophagostomum, Ostertagia and Haemonchus were the most prevailing nematode genera, Eurytrema was the predominant trematode genus detected, whereas the infection of adult goats with cestodes was not common, with Cysticercus tenuicollis being the most common genus. The worm burdens showed obvious seasonal variation in that nematodes and cestodes were abundant in summer and winter, and the trematodes peaked in winter, which was consistent with the seasonal precipitation of Hunan Province. The geographical distribution of helminths in goats ascended with altitude. Goats in the mountainous areas were more severely infected with helminths than goats in the hilly areas, whereas infection of goats with helminths was much less in the lake areas. The present investigation highlights the high prevalence of helminths in adult goats in Hunan Province, China, which provides baseline data for assessing the effectiveness of future prevention and controlling measures against helminth infection in adult goats in this province and elsewhere.

J	Gronchi, E; Jöhnk, KD; Straile, D; Diehl, S; Peeters, F				Gronchi, Enzo; Johnk, Klaus D.; Straile, Dietmar; Diehl, Sebastian; Peeters, Frank			Local and continental-scale controls of the onset of spring phytoplankton blooms: Conclusions from a proxy-based model	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												A key phenological event in the annual cycle of many pelagic ecosystems is the onset of the spring algal bloom (OAB). Descriptions of the factors controlling the OAB in temperate to polar lakes have been limited to isolated studies of single systems and conceptual models. Here we present a validated modelling approach that, for the first time, enables a quantitative prediction of the OAB and a systematic assessment of the processes controlling its timing on a continental scale. We used a weather-driven, one-dimensional lake model to simulate the seasonal dynamics of the underwater light climate in 16 lake types characterized by the factorial combination of four lake depths with four levels of water transparency. We did so at 1962 locations across Western Europe and over 31 years (1979-2009). Assuming that phytoplankton production is light-limited in winter, we identified four patterns of OAB control across lake types and climate zones. OAB timing is controlled by (i) the timing of ice-off in ice-covered clear or shallow lakes, (ii) the onset of thermal stratification in sufficiently deep and turbid lakes and (iii) the seasonal increase in incident radiation in all other lakes, except for (iv) ice-free, shallow and clear lakes in the south, where phytoplankton is not light-limited. The model predicts that OAB timing should respond to two pervasive environmental changes, global warming and browning, in opposite ways. OAB timing should be highly sensitive to warming in lakes where it is controlled by either ice-off or the onset of stratification, but resilient to warming in lakes where it is controlled by incident radiation. Conversely, OAB timing should be most sensitive to browning where it is controlled by incident radiation, but resilient to browning where it is controlled by ice-off or the onset of stratification. Available lake data are consistent with our findings.

In order to develop an intelligent early warning system for HABs, big data and deep learning models were harnessed in this study. Data collection was achieved utilizing the vertical aquatic monitoring system (VAMS). Subsequently, the analysis and stratification of the vertical aquatic layer were conducted employing the "DeepDPM-Spectral Clustering" method. This approach drastically reduced the number of predictive models and enhanced the adaptability of the system. The Bloomformer-2 model was developed to conduct both single-step and multistep predictions of Chl-a, integrating the " Alert Level Framework" issued by the World Health Organization to accomplish early warning for HABs. The case study conducted in Taihu Lake revealed that during the winter of 2018, the water column could be partitioned into four clusters (Groups W1-W4), while in the summer of 2019, the water column could be partitioned into five clusters (Groups S1-S5). Moreover, in a subsequent predictive task, Bloomformer-2 exhibited superiority in performance across all clusters for both the winter of 2018 and the summer of 2019 (MAE: 0.175-0.394, MSE: 0.042-0.305, and MAPE: 0.228-2.279 for single-step prediction; MAE: 0.184-0.505, MSE: 0.101-0.378, and MAPE: 0.243-4.011 for multistep prediction). The prediction for the 3 days indicated that Group W1 was in a Level I alert state at all times. Conversely, Group S1 was mainly under an Level I alert, with seven specific time points escalating to a Level II alert. Furthermore, the end-to-end architecture of this system, coupled with the automation of its various processes, minimized human intervention, endowing it with intelligent characteristics. This research highlights the transformative potential of integrating big data and artificial intelligence in environmental management and emphasizes the importance of model interpretability in machine learning applications.					; Pu, Nan/JMQ-1195-2023; Norra, Stefan/G-7867-2012; qian, li/AAX-6369-2021	Qian, Jing/0000-0002-1120-4231; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				MAR 4	2024	58	35					15607	15618		10.1021/acs.est.3c03906	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c03906		MAR 2024						38436579					WOS:001179734400001

Reports for three years show that the number of anglers increased every year. The submission rate of catch reports was about 90%. Over this three-year period, the total number of fishing days and fish caught in the summer season were much larger than those in the winter season. Although about 10,000 fish were caught by anglers every year, 41.4-67.3% of them were released. The total amount of fish caught by the anglers was estimated to be 6.6-8.6 t, and the total annual commercial catch of Biwa salmon in Lake Biwa was 23.2-45.8 t.																			0021-5392	1349-998X				JAN	2014	80	1					45	52		10.2331/suisan.80.45	http://dx.doi.org/10.2331/suisan.80.45													WOS:000333318700008

The mean volume backscattering strength (MVBS), which is a proxy of suspended sediment concentration (SSC), continued to exhibit distinct signatures of sediment erosion (or resuspension) under different forcing conditions such as tides, winds, and precipitation. Results exhibit the different patterns of sediment resuspension between spring and neap tides. During spring tide, the extensive tidal forcing provided a favorable condition to resuspend sediments trapped near the bed. The MVBS with high SSC was consistently recorded. During neap tide, on the other hand, the MVBS with high SSC was intermittently recorded, which was related to the strong wind events. While the flow was being intensified by winds, the short-lasting (2-4 hours) sharp spikes of MVBS were observed. The stratification developed by increased precipitation might cause to block the upward transport of sediments near the bed, even though the strong winds (>13.6 m s(-1)) lasted over 4 days. These outcomes could give insight into the complexity of hydrodynamics and sediment transport occurring in the harbor where various natural and artificial forcings are combined.

Linking landscape-level change to habitat quality: an evaluation of restoration actions on the freshwater habitat of spring-run Chinook salmon	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Conservation planning is often hampered by the lack of causal quantitative links between landscape characteristics, restoration actions and habitat conditions that impact the status of imperilled species. Here we present a first step toward linking actions on the landscape to the population status of endangered stream-type Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). 2. We developed relationships between land use, landscape characteristics and freshwater habitat of spring Chinook salmon in the Wenatchee River basin. Available data allowed us to find relationships that described water temperatures at several life stages (prespawning, egg incubation and summer rearing) and substratum characteristics, including fine sediments, cobble and embeddedness. Predictors included altitude, gradient, mean annual precipitation, total and riparian forest cover, road density, impervious surface and alluvium. We used a model averaging approach to account for parameter and model selection uncertainty. Key predictors were total forest cover and impervious surface area for prespawning and summer rearing temperatures; precipitation and stream gradients were important predictors of the percent of fine sediments in stream substrata. 3. We estimated habitat conditions using these relationships in three alternative landscape scenarios: historical, no restoration and one that included a set of restoration actions from local conservation planning. We found that prespawning and summer temperatures were estimated to be slightly higher historically relative to current conditions in dry sparsely forested areas, but lower in some important Chinook salmon spawning and rearing areas and lower in those locations under the restoration scenario. Fine sediments were lower in the historical scenario and were reduced as a consequence of restoration actions in two areas currently unoccupied by Chinook salmon that contain reaches with some potential for high quality spawning and rearing. Cobble and embeddedness in general were predicted to be higher historically and changed little as a result of restoration actions relative to current conditions. 4. This modelling framework converts suites of restoration actions into changes in habitat condition, thereby enabling restoration planners to evaluate alternative combinations of proposed actions. It also provides inputs to models linking habitat conditions to population status. This approach represents a first step in estimating impacts of restoration strategies, and can provide key information for conservation managers and planners.					; McClure, Michelle/O-7853-2015	Jorgensen, Jeff/0000-0001-5112-4757; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JUL	2009	54	7					1560	1575		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02207.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02207.x													WOS:000266637400014

Elevated water temperature may promote such change. Here we report the impact of two warming regimes (continuous 3 degreesC above ambient and 3 degreesC above ambient during summer only), with two nutrient loadings and the presence or absence of fish, on 48 microcosm ecosystems created to mimic shallow pond environments. We found that warming did not significantly encourage phytoplankton blooms, even in combination with increased nutrients and fish. Instead, macrophyte communities remained dominant. Macrophyte-associated invertebrates (gastropods and ostracods) increased in numbers in the warmed microcosms, potentially helping to stabilize the macrophyte communities. Nevertheless, warming produced trends in water chemistry that could be problematic. It increased phosphorus concentrations, total alkalinity, and conductivity. It decreased pH and oxygen saturation and increased the frequency of severe deoxygenation. These trends were largely independent of the other experimental treatments and support the suggestion that moderate warming has the potential to exacerbate existing eutrophication problems.

Evidence for internal phosphorus loading in a large prairie reservoir (Lake Diefenbaker, Saskatchewan)	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Increasingly, our global water storage is contained in large reservoirs that retain nutrients. Given the value of reservoirs to ecosystem services, it is important to know the risks associated with the mobilization of legacy phosphorus (P) from sediments. From 2011 to 2013, Lake Diefenbaker was a significant sink for P retaining 91% of the external total phosphorus (TP) and 41% of the dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) loaded from the tributaries. We investigated if this retained P has the potential to re-enter the water column through internal P loading from sediments. In 2013, we estimated the rates of internal P loading with a specific focus on measuring TP, DRP, and total dissolved iron release from sediments. We estimated that over the whole reservoir, the internal load (based on TP increases) was 169 mg TP m(-2) summer(-1) and 229 mg TP m(-2) winter(-1). Year-round, the mean daily internal P loading rate was 1.8 mg TP m(-2) day(-1), representing similar to 24% of the annual external TP load. Although our internal load estimates are dependent upon sedimentation rates, they do suggest winter internal P loading is important, resulting in a continuous release of P from the sediments into the overlying water year-round. Internal loading from sediments is an unaccounted-for source of P to Lake Diefenbaker and should be considered in future management of this critically important reservoir. Our recommendations for other reservoirs in obtaining realistic estimates of internal P loading include year-round estimates considering both the stratification and flow regimes.

Shining a light on Laurentian Great Lakes cisco (Coregonus artedi): How ice coverage may impact embryonic development	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Changes in winter conditions, such as decreased ice coverage and duration, have been observed in the Laurentian Great Lakes for more than 20 years. Such changes have been hypothesized to be linked to low Coregonus spp. survival to age-1 as most cisco (Coregonus artedi) populations are autumn spawners whose embryos incubate under ice throughout the winter. The quantity of light during winter is regulated by ice coverage, and light affects embryo survival and development in some teleosts. We experimentally evaluated how cisco embryos from lakes Superior and Ontario respond to three light treatments that represented day-light intensity under 0-10, 40-60, and 90-100% ice coverage. Embryonic response measures included two developmental factors (embryo survival and incubation period) and two morphological traits (length-at-hatch and yolk-sac volume). Embryo survival was highest at the medium light treatment and decreased at high and low treatments for both populations, suggesting cisco may be adapted to withstand some light exposure from inter-annual variability in ice coverage. Light intensity had no overall effect on length of incubation. Increasing light intensity decreased length-at-hatch in Lake Superior but had no effect in Lake Ontario. Yolk-sac volume was positively correlated with increasing light in Lake Superior and negatively correlated in Lake Ontario. Contrasting responses in embryo development between lakes suggests differences in populations' response to light is flexible. Our results provide a step towards better understanding the high variability observed in coregonine recruitment and may help predict what the future of this species may look like under current climate trends.

Although the MERIS sensor ceased to operate in April 2012, the data capacities are now re-established through the recently launched Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). The development of a consistent time series for investigating phytoplankton phenology features is crucial if the potential of MERIS and OLCI data is to be fully exploited for inland water monitoring. This study presents a time series of phytoplankton abundance and bloom spatial extent for the highly eutrophic inland water of the Baltic Sea using the 10-year MERIS archive (2002-2011) and a chlorophyll-a based Summed Positive Peaks (SPP) algorithm. A gradient approach in conjunction with the histogram analysis was used to determine a global threshold from the entire collection of SPP images for identifying phytoplankton blooms. This allows spatio-temporal dynamics of daily bloom coverage, timing, phytoplankton abundance and spatial extent to be investigated for each Baltic basin. Furthermore, a number of meteorological and hydrological variables, including spring excess phosphate, summer sea surface temperature and photosynthetically active radiation, were explored using boosted regression trees and generalised additive models to understand the ecological response of phytoplankton assemblages to environmental perturbations and potential predictor variables of summer blooms. The results indicate that the surface layer excess phosphate available in February and March had paramount importance over all other variables considered in governing summer bloom abundance in the major Baltic basins. This finding allows new insights into the development of early warning systems for summer phytoplankton blooms in the Baltic Sea and elsewhere. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Four ears of data were analyzed for three lakes having similar TP concentrations but varied abundances of Daphnia and Ceriodaphnia. Mean TP did not correlate significantly with mean Chl a during the study period, although mean Daphnia density was a good predictor of Chl a concentration (p > 0.001). Both residuals from the TP - Chl a relationship (p > 0.001) and Secchi depth (p > 0.007) were negatively correlated with Daphnia abundance. Ceriodaphnia abundance was positively correlated with Chl a p > 0.002) and Secchi depth (p > 0.001). Mean size of Daphnia during spring was the best predictor of the Daphnia-Ceriodaphnia shift in mid-summer. Early establishment of a large-sized Daphnia cohort may prevent their summer elimination by Chaoborus and intensify competition with Ceriodaphnia. These results imply an important link between Daphnia and Ceriodaphnia thereby limiting the utility of Chl a -TP model predictions in these small, urban lakes. This linkage and the differential effect of these two zooplankton species on planktonic algae deserve further consideration in similar lakes where phytoplankon and zooplankton tend to be tightly coupled.																			0018-8158					AUG 5	1994	288	1					47	55		10.1007/BF00006805	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006805													WOS:A1994PE94900005

Biogeography of globally distributed bacteria in temperate and boreal Quebec lakes as revealed by tag pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Sequence data of 16S rRNA genes reveal that many bacterial taxa are found in all freshwater lakes. However, the global data set is highly weighted toward lakes in temperate regions of North America and northern Europe, and it is unclear whether bacterial communities in other northern latitude environments, such as boreal lakes in North America, differ from those in lower latitudes. This study used pyrosequences of the 16S rRNA gene to examine bacterial diversity in 37 temperate and boreal lakes in Quebec, Canada, over the course of a year. Nearly all taxa in the global data set were also found in the Quebec lakes, but relative abundances differed. Community structure varied geographically and seasonally for 97% similar operational taxonomic units (OTUs) but not at lower levels of similarity. Seasonal shifts in community structure were larger in temperate lakes than in boreal lakes, and community structure differed between boreal and temperate lakes in summer but not in winter. The differences in taxonomic composition between temperate and boreal lakes appear to be driven mostly by environmental processes influencing community structure of temperate lakes in summer. Our results provide a baseline for interpreting impacts of climate change in boreal biomes where community structure is driven by environmental factors.					del Giorgio, Paul/AAD-1315-2019; Cottrell, Matthew/C-3266-2009	del Giorgio, Paul/0000-0003-1866-8159; Cottrell, Matthew/0000-0003-0449-9999													0948-3055	1616-1564					2015	76	3					175	188		10.3354/ame01776	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01776													WOS:000371303900001

During the same period four lakes in the Kalix catchment were sampled at their outlets and in vertical profiles within the lakes, together with a stream draining a series of mires with shallow lakes. Snow melting in mid-May increased the dissolved Mn concentration in the river tenfold, compared with a concentration of 5-mu-g L-1 during the winter discharge (January to April). We suggest that the increase was caused by Mn-rich mire water mixing with melting snow and being transported to the river. Large concentrations of dissolved Mn built up in the hypolimnion of the lakes studied during the ice-covered period. Break-up of the ice and spring-overturn in June increased the dissolved Mn concentration tenfold in lake discharge and a concomitant peak in the dissolved Mn concentration was observed in the river. Lake-derived Mn was the dominant source for Mn in the river during this time. Suspended Mn in the river was hosted mainly in detrital particles during flood in May. In mid-June, non-detrital suspended Mn started to accumulate and reached a maximum in late July and early August. The Mn/Al ratio was 25 times higher during this period than during flood in May, suggesting the precipitation of an Mn-oxyhydroxide phase. The precipitation of the non-detrital Mn-rich phase was correlated in time with increased temperature, increased pH, and increased concentration of suspended biogenic particles. The precipitation of dissolved Mn was biologically mediated. Sedimentation and mineralisation of the non-detrital Mn phase in river and lake sediments resulted in a steady increase of the dissolved Mn concentration in the river water during autumn.																			0016-7037					APR	1992	56	4					1485	1494		10.1016/0016-7037(92)90218-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7037(92)90218-8													WOS:A1992HQ10000005

An annual cycle of biomass and productivity of Vallisneria americana in a subtropical spring-fed estuary	AQUATIC BOTANY												An annual cycle of biomass and productivity of wild celery (Vallisneria americana) was studied in Kings Bay, FL, USA. In situ growth rates were measured monthly between March 2001 and June 2002 in high-density stands, using a modified hole-punching technique, and applied to shoot density data to obtain areal estimates of production. Mean shoot density varied greatly over the study period, ranging between 200 and 800 shoots m(-2). Mean total biomass ranged between 162 and 1013 g m(-2), with aboveground material comprising, on average, 70% of total biomass. Total annual estimated production of new attached shoots was 519 g m(-2). Leaf growth rates peaked at >50 mg shoot(-1) d(-1), and mass-specific leaf growth ranged 0.6-1.8% d(-1). Annually, individual shoots produced 7.4 g of leaf material and completely replaced standing leaf biomass 3.5 times. Areal leaf production was highest in late spring/summer of 200 1, and ranged between 3.6 and 23. 0 g m(-2) d(-1). Annual total leaf 2 production was 2704 g m(-1). Seasonality was not apparent in most variables monitored monthly; only 1 of the 64 relationships we examined between environmental variables (nutrients, chlorophyll a, and irradiance) and Vallisneria biological variables were significant, with relative growth rate increasing linearly with irradiance. Peak biomass and productivity of Vallisneria in Kings Bay were high compared to literature values for other Vallisneria populations as well as global averages for well-studied seagrasses, emphasizing the potential importance of Vallisneria to whole ecosystem functioning in springs, lakes, and oligohaline reaches of many estuaries.

The species appears to have 2 spawning peaks, 1 in Aug. and the other in late winter to early spring. Proposed explanations for this observed spawning periodicity are a slight increase in water temperature and/or a decrease in flow. Ripe ovaries of preserved E. fonticola contain 3 distinct classes of ova based on their size and appearance. The number of mature ova (Size Group I) is positively correlated with total length of the fish while the mean diameter of mature ova is not positively correlated. E. fonticola provides no parental care to the ova and has very low fecundity (mean fecundity was 19). Sexual dimorphism is evident in the shape and size of the genital papillae and the pelvic fins and in the intensity of body coloration. The sex ratio of E. fonticola is 1.39:1.00 [male:female].																			0003-0031	1938-4238					1977	98	2					365	375		10.2307/2424987	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2424987													WOS:A1977EE92700010

Evaluation of threshold freezing conditions for winter road construction over discontinuous permafrost peatlands, subarctic Canada	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Winter roads provide an important transportation service in northern regions. The Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road (TCWR), traversing subarctic Canada, is the busiest heavy-haul road in the world with as many as 10,900 truckloads per season. In addition to lake-ice thickness, trafficability on the TCWR depends upon adequate freezeback of overland portages, which are primarily peatlands underlain by discontinuous permafrost. We investigate threshold requirements for the initiation of winter road operations in this region and assess the use of a recommended 305 degrees C-day air-freezing index (FDD305a) value as an operational predictor of ground freezing at 30 cm depth, the desired depth to allow winter road construction to commence. Snow compaction and flooding were found to enhance freezeback of portages with early winter overland flow having a similar effect. The majority of winter road portages were not adequately frozen to a depth of 30 cm by FDD305a. Our results indicate that for drained and wet peatlands in this discontinuous permafrost environment, an FDD a threshold of 1100 degrees Cdays is more appropriate than the 305 degrees C-day threshold. However, TCWR winter road operators presently plan the construction of the winter road by a calendar date rather than by evaluation of the air-freezing index. This practice results in a conservative approach to the start of the construction season, close to 1100 degrees C-days with a higher percentage of sites frozen to 30 cm depth than would be if the 305 degrees C-day air-freezing index was used as a guideline. In addition, the use of low-pressure vehicles for snow compaction during the start of the construction season is an effective adaptation practice to accelerate freezing penetration.																			0165-232X	1872-7441				FEB	2020	170								102930	10.1016/j.coldregions.2019.102930	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coldregions.2019.102930													WOS:000506666000024

Study focus: Alpine regions are particularly sensitive to climate change due to the pronounced effect on snow and glacial melt. In this context, large perialpine lakes play a crucial role in modulating climate change impacts on water resources, which brings together diverse interests. However, climate change studies on river systems rarely include lakes or lake level management. An open question is how to incorporate lake level management effects into hydrologic simulations to project climate change impacts. We combine the hydrologic model PREVAH with the hydrodynamic model MIKE11 to simulate lake level and outflow scenarios from 1981 to 2099, using the Swiss climate change scenarios CH2018. New hydrological insights for the region: The hydrological projections at the end of the century show pronounced seasonal changes in lake levels, characterised by an increase in winter and a decrease in summer when water demand is highest. Without climate mitigation measures, this summer decrease ranges from-0.04 m for a regulated lake to -0.4 m for an unregulated lake. In addition, the simulations indicate more frequent drought events. The projected changes intensify with time and missing climate mitigation measures. Future work could focus on interannual variability to explore regulatory strategies under changing conditions.					; Zappa, Massimiliano/C-1205-2009	Lustenberger, Florian/0000-0001-7240-6112; Wechsler, Tobias/0000-0001-9017-5346														2214-5818				OCT	2024	55								101914	10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101914	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101914													WOS:001291212100001

An abrupt wind shift in western Europe at the onset of the Younger Dryas cold period	NATURE GEOSCIENCE												The Younger Dryas cooling 12,700 years ago is one of the most abrupt climate changes observed in Northern Hemisphere palaeoclimate records(1-4). Annually laminated lake sediments are ideally suited to record the dynamics of such abrupt changes, as the seasonal deposition responds immediately to climate, and the varve counts provide an accurate estimate of the timing of the change. Here, we present sub-annual records of varve microfacies and geochemistry from Lake Meerfelder Maar in western Germany, providing one of the best dated records of this climate transition(5). Our data indicate an abrupt increase in storminess during the autumn to spring seasons, occurring from one year to the next at 12,679 yr BP, broadly coincident with other changes in this region. We suggest that this shift in wind strength represents an abrupt change in the North Atlantic westerlies towards a stronger and more zonal jet. Changes in meridional overturning circulation alone cannot fully explain the changes in European climate(6,7); we suggest the observed wind shift provides the mechanism for the strong temporal link between North Atlantic Ocean overturning circulation and European climate during deglaciation.

Improving Climate Sensitivity of Deep Lakes within a Regional Climate Model and Its Impact on Simulated Climate	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Regional climate models aim to improve local climate simulations by resolving topography, vegetation, and land use at a finer resolution than global climate models. Lakes, particularly large and deep lakes, are local features that significantly alter regional climate. The Hostetler lake model, a version of which is currently used in the Community Land Model, performs poorly in deep lakes when coupled to the regional climate of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) Regional Climate Model, version 4 (RegCM4). Within the default RegCM4 model, the lake fails to properly stratify, stifling the model's ability to capture interannual variability in lake temperature and ice cover. Here, the authors improve modeled lake stratification and eddy diffusivity while correcting errors in the ice model. The resulting simulated lake shows improved stratification and interannual variability in lake ice and temperature. The lack of circulation and explicit mixing continues to stifle the model's ability to simulate lake mixing events and variability in timing of stratification and destratification. The changes to modeled lake conditions alter seasonal means in sea level pressure, temperature, and low-level winds in the entire model domain, highlighting the importance of lake model selection and improvement for coupled simulations. Interestingly, changes to winter and spring snow cover and albedo impact spring warming. Unsurprisingly, regional climate variability is not significantly altered by an increase in lake temperature variability.																			0894-8755	1520-0442				APR	2014	27	8					2886	2911		10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00110.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00110.1													WOS:000334017400006

Lake surface area ranged from 40 to 160 ha. The stocked fingerlings were reared in 0.2-ha, plastic-lined ponds at the Governor Tommy G. Thompson State Hatchery in Spooner, Wisconsin and stocked during early summer. Stocked fingerlings ranged from 30 to 45 mm in total length and were stocked at densities of 124/ha (N = 18) or 248/ha (N = 8). Fall electrofishing surveys were conducted on all lakes after surface water temperatures were <= 22 degrees C. The Serns' Index was used to predict fingerling abundance, which was then used to calculate percent survival for the 3-month period between stocking and fall sampling. Mean survival was 0.4% (SE = 0.1%; N = 26) and ranged from 0.0% to 2.9% for all lakes. Fall fingerlings were not detected for 15 of the 26 stocking events. Stocking density did not appear to be important in determining contribution to the fall fingerling population. The current stocking program for lakes lacking natural reproduction has the potential to establish low-density populations of adult walleye. Creel data showed stocked Fisheries in the northern third of Wisconsin provided a mean harvest rate of 0.021 (SE = 0.0042; N = 18) walleye per hour of directed effort or one walleye harvested for every 48 h of directed fishing effort.

Iestyn; Sharma, Sapna			Lake ice quality in a warming world	NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT												Ice phenology has shifted with anthropogenic warming such that many lakes are experiencing a shorter ice season. However, changes to ice quality - the ratio of black and white ice layers - remain little explored, despite relevance to lake physics, ecological function, human recreation and transportation. In this Review, we outline how ice quality is changing and discuss knock-on ecosystem service impacts. Although direct evidence is sparse, there are suggestions that ice quality is diminishing across the Northern Hemisphere, encompassing declining ice thickness, decreasing black ice and increasing white ice. These changes are projected to continue in the future, scaling with global temperature increases, and driving considerable impacts to related ecosystem services. Rising proportions of white ice will markedly reduce bearing strength, implying more dangerous conditions for transportation (limiting operational use of many winter roads) and recreation (increasing the risk of fatal spring-time drownings). Shifts from black to white ice conditions will further reduce the amount of light reaching the water column, minimizing primary production, and altering community composition to favour motile and mixotrophic species; these changes will affect higher trophic levels, including diminished food quantity for zooplankton and fish, with potential developmental consequences. Reliable and translatable in situ sampling methods to assess and predict spatiotemporal variations in ice quality are urgently needed. Lake ice has witnessed considerable changes in its phenology, but less is known about ice quality - the ratio of black ice to white ice. This Review assesses the changes in lake ice quality and its ecosystem services, noting diminished ice quality in observations and projections.

J	JEHL, JR				JEHL, JR			MOLT AND MOLT MIGRATION IN A TRANSEQUATORIALLY MIGRATING SHOREBIRD - WILSON PHALAROPE	ORNIS SCANDINAVICA												In autumn, adult Wilson''s Phalaropes congregate at Mono Lake, California and other hypersaline lakes in the Great Basin of the western United States, where they moult and stage before migrating to South America. In 32-40 days some adults replace the entire body plumage, the rectrices, and several primaries. This phase of the moult, which is accomplished more quickly than in other waders, is facilitated by the abundant invertebrate resources in Mono Lake and probably by the prevailing warm temperatures. Primaries are moulted and replaced singly, insuring that the wing surface will be nearly intact whenever the birds accumulate sufficient fat to begin their non-stop migration to South America. The prebasic moult is resumed on the wintering grounds and is completed in January, when the prealternate moult of the rectrices commences. The Wood Sandpiper is the only other wader for which a moult migration has been demonstrated convincingly.																			0030-5693					SEP	1987	18	3					173	178		10.2307/3676763	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3676763													WOS:A1987J981700004

MODIS imagery revealed that dust deposited in snowpacks on the lake's ice acted as light-absorbing impurities (LAIs), reducing surface reflectance and increasing surface temperatures relative to normal snowpack years, causing early snowmelt and drainage of meltwaters into the lake. LAIs remaining on the ice surface melted into the ice, causing premature candling and one of the earliest ice-offs and longest ice-free seasons on record for Lake Hazen. Meltwater inputs from snowpacks resulted in dilution of dissolved, and increased concentration of particulate bound, chemical species in Lake Hazen's upper water column. Spring inputs of nutrients increased both heterotrophy and algal productivity under the surface ice following snowmelt, with a net consumption of dissolved oxygen. As climate change continues to alter High Arctic temperatures and precipitation patterns, we can expect further changes in dust storm frequency and severity with corresponding impacts for freshwater ecosystems.					; Serbu, Jessica/OAJ-7256-2025; Lehnherr, Igor/D-5707-2012; Emmerton, Craig/G-2900-2013; St. Louis, Vincent/G-6842-2011; St.Pierre, Kyra/G-7969-2015; Muir, Derek/F-6183-2011	Serbu, Jessica/0000-0002-0109-4550; Criscitiello, Alison/0000-0002-8741-709X; Lehnherr, Igor/0000-0002-4618-7128; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				APR 5	2024	58	17					7415	7424		10.1021/acs.est.4c00705	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c00705		APR 2024						38578215					WOS:001200603200001

The effects of dissolved organic carbon, acidity and seasonality on metal geochemistry within a forested catchment on the Precambrian Shield, central Ontario, Canada	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Metal pollution, in combination with other environmental stressors such as acid deposition and climate change, may disturb metal biogeochemical cycles. To investigate the influence of dissolved organic carbon, acidity and seasonality on metal geochemistry, this study has described concentrations of 19 metals as they pass through an acidified forested catchment on the Precambrian Shield in south-central Ontario, Canada. Metal, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and sulphate (SO4 (2-)) concentrations fluctuate throughout the catchment compartments as the water passes through and interacts with vegetation, soils and bedrock. Relationships among metals, DOC and SO4 (2-) are most pronounced in compartments where DOC and SO4 (2-) exhibit high variability, namely in the throughfall, organic horizon soil water, and wetland-draining stream. Metal, DOC and SO4 (2-) concentrations varied seasonally in the streams, and temporal coherence occurred among metal, DOC and SO4 (2-) concentrations in the organic horizon soil water and the wetland-draining stream (PC1). In the wetland-draining stream, the highest DOC, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, and V concentrations occur in the summer, whereas concentrations of SO4 (2-) and most other metals peak in the fall after a period of drought. Despite the rural location, provincial water quality objectives for surface water were exceeded for many metals when the peak fall values occurred.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				APR	2009	93	3					271	289		10.1007/s10533-009-9305-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-009-9305-0													WOS:000264546500006

AUTUMN RAPTOR BANDING AT HAWK RIDGE, DULUTH, MINNESOTA USA, 1972-2009: AN OVERVIEW	JOURNAL OF RAPTOR RESEARCH												We summarize autumn banding of 99 505 raptors (mean of 2619/yr) of 23 species at Hawk Ridge from 1972 to 2009. Excluding the first two years of banding (1972 and 1973) and despite consistent effort, the last six years (2004-09) were six of the seven lowest totals banded over a 36-yr period, primarily due to the low number of Sharp-shinned Hawks (Accipiter striatus). The majority of birds banded were Sharp-shinned Hawks (n = 60 147) and Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus; n = 20676). The totals also included 8103 Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), 2243 Long-eared Owls (Asio otus), and 92 Boreal Owls (Aegolius funereus). Numbers of Northern Goshawks banded at Hawk Ridge were correlated with raw counts (r = 0.68, P < 0.01) and effort-adjusted counts (r = 0.59, P < 0.01) observed at Hawk Ridge. Sharp-shinned Hawk counts when effort was included were correlated with the number banded (r = 0.58, P < 0.01). Three species have had a substantial number of encounters (any handling of a banded bird, alive or dead) and returns (first recapture of a banded bird at or near the site of banding at a different season of the year). These included 462 Northern Saw-whet Owls (n = 330 encounters and 132 returns), 388 Sharp-shinned Hawks (n = 327 encounters and 61 returns), and 280 Northern Goshawk (n = 230 encounters and 50 returns). Age ratios of Sharp-shinned Hawks, Northern Goshawks, and Northern Saw-whet Owls were highly variable, but ratios of hatch-year to after-hatch-year birds were negatively correlated (r = 0.40, P < 0.01) with the number of Northern Goshawks banded. Adult Northern Goshawks dominated peak years of Northern Goshawks, whereas hatch-year birds dominated when numbers were low.																			0892-1016	2162-4569				MAR	2012	46	1					36	49		10.3356/JRR-10-95.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.3356/JRR-10-95.1													WOS:000301965600005

The radionuclides initially remained confined to the hypolimnion and there was little loss from the water. Lake mixing during autumn turnover resulted in the rapid loss of Co-60 (first order rate constant, k, is 0.036 d(-1)) and much slower loss of Cs-134 (k = 0.006 d(-1)) from the water to sediment over the next 41 and 238 d, respectively. One year after the addition, <1% of the Co-60 and Cs-134 and 6% of the tritiated water added to trace water movement had been lost to the outflow. About 6% of the Co-60 and 19% of the Cs-134 remained in the water column. Loss rates to the sediment observed following autumn turnover in the present study were slower than those previously observed from the epilimnion; however, there was little difference in the amount of Co-60 and Cs-134 remaining in the water after 1 year when the input was to the hypolimnion as opposed to the epilimnion.																			0706-652X					OCT	1995	52	10					2276	2289		10.1139/f95-818	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f95-818													WOS:A1995TQ59400020

Effects of harmful algal blooms and associated water-quality on endangered Lost River and shortnose suckers	HARMFUL ALGAE												Anthropogenic eutrophication contributes to harmful blooms of cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystems worldwide. In Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, massive blooms of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and smaller blooms of other cyanobacteria are associated with cyanotoxins, hypoxia, high pH, high concentrations of ammonia, and potentially hypercapnia. Recovery of the endangered Lost River sucker Deltistes luxatus and shortnose sucker Chasmistes brevirostris in Upper Klamath Lake is obstructed by low survival in the juvenile life stage. Water quality associated with the harmful algal blooms and their decomposition (crashes) is often singled out as the primary cause of juvenile sucker mortality. We investigated this general hypothesis with a review of relevant literature and data from decades of monitoring in Upper Klamath Lake. Microcystins, hepatotoxins produced by some cyanobacteria, are unlikely to be directly lethal to suckers; potential effects of other cyanotoxins that are present in the lake warrant investigation. Dissolved-oxygen saturation declined following bloom crashes, but was infrequently low enough for long enough in Upper Klamath Lake to cause direct sucker mortality. Hypercapnia could potentially reach lethal concentrations in the fall and winter, but did not appear to be associated with the summer algal blooms. pH was highest during peaks in cyanobacteria growth, but infrequently reached directly lethal levels (> 10.3). However, pH frequently reached an observed sub-lethal effect level for juvenile suckers (10.0). Un-ionized ammonia rarely exceeded even the lowest effect level measured for suckers. Rather than act as a direct cause of large-scale mortality, the available evidence suggests that water quality associated with massive blooms of cyanobacteria in Upper Klamath Lake contributes to chronic stress for juvenile suckers and may increase mortality due to other factors.

P deficiency was shown by determination of alkaline phosphatase activity, surplus P, Michaelis constants of alkaline phosphatases and C : P and N : P ratios in particulate matter and in lake water, respectively. During P limitation, generally occurring in May-June, the specific alkaline phosphatase activity (nmol .mu.g chlorophylla-1 min-1) increased about 10 times. Surplus P (.mu.g P/100 .mu.g C) decreased 4-5 times. The Michaelis constant reached a minimum in May 1976 which was 1 order of magnitude lower than the maximum. The N : P ratio of inorganic nutrients turned from > 1200 : 1 in April 1978 to 8 : 1 in the autumn of the same year. All P deficiency indicators revealed a severe P limitation in May and June which probably changed to a N limitation in the late summer.																			0003-9136						1980	89	1-2					54	87																WOS:A1980KA38500005

DIVERSITY AND SEASONAL VARIATIONS OF ZOOPLANKTON IN JAISAMAND LAKE, UDAIPUR, INDIA	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL RESEARCH												In the present work, seasonal variations of zooplankton and selected physico-chemical parameters were studied in Jiasamand Lake, a large man-made reservoir in Udaipur (Rajasthan). In the study period, 51 species of zooplankton - 17 species of Rotifera, 18 species of Cladocera, 5 species of Ostracoda and 4 species of Copepoda were observed. Among zooplankton, Rotifera was (727 No.l(-1)) observed as the dominant group throughout the study period and the highest count Was recorded in the summer or pre-monsoon period while low incidence was observed in winter season. Zooplankton community is also correlated with certain physico-chemical parameters. The results of this study indicate that the distribution and density of zooplankton species were influenced by Prevailing physical and chemical factors of the aquatic environment.

Here, we present a multi-proxy paleoenvironmental study of an ombrotrophic bog in coastal British Columbia. Following decreases in relative sea level, the wetland was isolated from marine waters by 13,300 cal yr BP. Peat composition, non-pollen palynomorph, and C and N analyses demonstrate terrestrialization from an oligotrophic lake to a marsh by 11,600 cal yr BP, followed by development of a poor fen, and then a drier ombrotrophic bog by 8700 cal yr BP. Maximum carbon accumulation occurred during the early Holocene fen stage, when seasonal differences in insolation were amplified. This highlights the importance of seasonality in constraining peatland carbon sequestration by enhancing productivity during summer and reducing decomposition during winter. Pollen analysis shows that Pinus contorta dominated regional forests by 14,000 cal yr BP. Warm and relatively dry summers in the early Holocene allowed Pseudotsuga menziesii to dominate lowland forests 11,200-7000 cal yr BP. Tsuga heterophylla and P. menziesii formed coniferous forest in the mid- and late Holocene. Tephra matching the mid-Holocene Glacier Peak-Dusty Creek assemblage provides evidence of its most northwesterly occurrence to date.

J	Staehr, PA; Sand-Jensen, K				Staehr, Peter A.; Sand-Jensen, Kaj			Temporal dynamics and regulation of lake metabolism	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We studied temporal dynamics and regulation of oxygen metabolism in the upper mixed layer of a nutrient-rich shallow Danish lake by continuous measurements of oxygen, irradiance, wind, and temperature and frequent measurements of algal chlorophyll, organic pools, and inorganic nutrients. Chlorophyll, algal growth rate, and mean irradiance (E-mean) in the mixed surface layer were calculated daily from continuous measurements of irradiance and temperature with depth. There were three to four distinct maxima in gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (R) during the summer season and minima from fall to spring after broad-scale changes in irradiance, temperature, mixing depth, and biomass and growth rate of the algal community and concentrations of inorganic nutrients. Lake metabolism was annually balanced (mean GPP: R 1.04 in 2003 and 1.01 in 2004), with net autotrophy occurring mainly from mid-May to mid-September (mean GPP: R 1.14 in 2003 and 1.10 in 2004), and net heterotrophy outside this period (mean GPP: R 0.60 in 2003 and 0.81 in 2004). However, GPP: R varied two- to threefold from day to day because lower surface irradiance, higher mixing depth, and thus lower E-mean significantly reduced GPP. Normalizing GPP to chlorophyll provided an index of algal growth potential (GPP(B)), which followed a hyperbolic relationship to E-mean, and both parameters were related to blooms and collapses of algal biomass. Metabolic rates were much more variable from day to day than algal biomass, which integrates growth and loss processes over longer periods. The continuous approach to lake metabolism provides better data and can provide a more accurate picture than averages of a few discrete measurements. Weekly averages reflected the characteristic seasonal peaks and troughs also observed for algal biomass, whereas monthly averages did not. Daily measurements of lake metabolism, therefore, can provide the optimal background for evaluating temporal changes and regulation of algal biomass and organic pools in nutrient-rich shallow lakes.

J	Boersma, M; Vijverberg, J				Boersma, M; Vijverberg, J			The significance of nonviable eggs for Daphnia population dynamics	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Egg mortality was studied in populations of Daphnia galeata, Daphnia cucullata, and the hybrid between these species. In Tjeukemeer, a shallow eutrophic lake in the Netherlands, egg mortality in daphnids manifested itself as an apparent increase in the frequency of eggs in the early developmental stages. Close examination of these eggs revealed that many of them stopped their development. Egg mortality was observed during a 1-month period in autumn 1990 and for about 2 months in spring 1991. The percentage of females carrying nondeveloping eggs averaged 20% (SD = 11%) in the 1990 period and 35% (SD = 20%) in spring 1991, resulting in an average reduction of the birth rate of 0.043 (SD = 0.027) and 0.040 (SD = 0.030). The maximum incidence of nondeveloping eggs was as high as 70%. Because it is difficult to recognize nondeveloping eggs, little is known about the cause of this arrested development. Our results suggest that food quantity was not an important factor and that egg mortality was caused by nutritional deficiency of the lake seston in certain periods of the year. Egg mortality can have serious consequences for the population development of daphnids, and it might be a more common phenomenon than is supposed. An analysis of zooplankton population dynamics is essential to properly assess the viability of eggs, since ignoring egg mortality will cause both birth and death rates to be overestimated.

Approaching storm: Disappearing winter bloom in Lake Michigan	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Between 1990 and 2001, late-winter phytoplankton blooms were common in parts of the lower Great Lakes (southern Lake Michigan, Saginaw Bay and southern Lake Huron, and western Lake Erie), providing resources for over-wintering zooplankton. In Lake Michigan up to 2001, detailed remote sensing and ship studies documented well-developed late-winter blooms in the southern gyre (circular bloom termed the 'doughnut'). However, from 2001 to 2008, the winter blooms in Lake Michigan also supported early season veliger larvae from the introduced, cold-water adapted "profunda" morph of quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis). Remote sensing and ship studies revealed that settled mussels caused an extraordinary increase in water transparency and a simultaneous decrease of Chl a in the late-winter bloom. Before quagga mussels in 2001, water transparency was 74-85% at deep-water sites, whereas it increased progressively to 89% by 2006 and 94-96% by 2008. Chlorophyll a concentrations in the gyre rings were 1.1-2.6 mu g/L in 2001, declining to 0.5-1.7 mu g/L by 2006 and 0.4-1.5 mu g/L by 2008. The reduction of Chl a in the winter bloom rings from 2001 to 2008 was 56-78% for the western limb and 74-75% for the eastern limb. Zooplankton species abundance, composition and abundance also changed, as cyclopoid copepods became very scarce and over-wintering omnivorous calanoid copepods declined. Reduction in late-winter phytoplankton and zooplankton poses a serious threat to open-water food webs. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Seasonal changes in icefish diel feeding patterns in Lake Chaohu, a large shallow eutrophic lake of China	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												Seasonal changes in the diel feeding patterns of the zooplanktivorous icefish (Neosalanx taihuensis), which is an endemic species of China, were studied in the large, shallow eutrophic Lake Chaohu of China during the autumn of 2002 and summer of 2003. The results of the diel feeding rhythm indicate that icefish is a visual particulate feeder. There were large differences in diet composition and the selection indices of certain prey by icefish. In general, icefish fed more on calanoids than on cyclopoids, and fed more on larger cladocerans (i.e., Daphnia, Moina, Leptodora) than smaller cladocerans (i.e., Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia). Icefish is highly selective of individual food items, with prey selection also being dependent on fish size. There was no significant difference in the prey selection between male and female icefish. This study provides the first report of diel feeding rhythm in icefish, and is the first comparative study on prey selection between male and female icefish.

The record represents the southernmost annually laminated (i.e., varved) archive from the Balkan Peninsula spanning the Little Ice Age, allowing insights into critical time intervals of climate instability such as during the Maunder and Dalton solar minima. After developing a continuous, ca. 500-year-long varve chronology, high-resolution mu-XRF counts, stable-isotope data measured on ostracod shells, palynological (including pollen and dinoflagellate cysts), and diatom data are used to decipher the season-specific climate and ecosystem evolution at Etoliko Lagoon since 1450 AD. Our results show that the Etoliko varve record became more sensitive to climate change from 1740 AD onwards. We attribute this shift to the enhancement of primary productivity within the lagoon, which is documented by an up to threefold increase in varve thickness. This marked change in the lagoon's ecosystem was caused by: (i) increased terrestrial input of nutrients, (ii) a closer connection to the sea and human eutrophication particularly from 1850 AD onwards, and (iii) increasing summer temperatures. Integration of our data with those of previously published paleolake sediment records, tree-ring-based precipitation reconstructions, simulations of atmospheric circulation and instrumental precipitation data suggests that wet conditions in winter prevailed during 1740-1790 AD, whereas dry winters marked the periods 1790-1830 AD (Dalton Minimum) and 1830-1930 AD, the latter being sporadically interrupted by wet winters. This variability in precipitation can be explained by shifts in the large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns over the European continent that affected the Balkan Peninsula (e.g., North Atlantic Oscillation). The transition between dry and wet phases at Etoliko points to longitudinal shifts of the precipitation pattern in the Balkan Peninsula during the Little Ice Age. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Among them, microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is the most toxic with 1 mu g/L guideline value for potable waters. Therefore, it is very important to develop analytical methods for the detection and monitoring of MC-LR concentrations in raw water sources for public health protection. For this purpose, water samples were taken from a dam in south of Iran in a period of 2 years. MC-LR was extracted from samples by solid-phase extraction method using a C-18 cartridge and then measured by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography after calibration by standard solutions. Total phosphorous concentration and water temperature were measured for determination of environmental conditions in each season. Maximal and minimal concentrations of MC-LR were observed in early autumn (6.2 mu g/L) and late winter (0.4 mu g/L), respectively. MC-LR existed at all times in water source because of its resistance to natural physiochemical degradation and biodegradation. Thus, raw water source management is necessary to prevent MC-LR secretion for public health protection.

Ice duration drives winter nitrate accumulation in north temperate lakes	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY LETTERS												The duration of winter ice cover on lakes varies substantially with climate variability, and has decreased over the last several decades in many temperate lakes. However, little is known of how changes in seasonal ice cover may affect biogeochemical processes under ice. We examined winter nitrogen (N) dynamics under ice using a 30+ yr dataset from five oligotrophic/mesotrophic north temperate lakes to determine how changes in inorganic N species varied with ice duration. Nitrate accumulated during winter and was strongly related to the number of days since ice-on. Exogenous inputs accounted for less than 3% of nitrate accumulation in four of the five lakes, suggesting a paramount role of nitrification in regulating N transformation and the timing of chemical conditions under ice. Winter nitrate accumulation rates ranged from 0.15 mu g N L-1 d(-1) to 2.7 mu g N L-1 d(-1) (0.011-0.19 mu M d(-1)), and the mean for intermediate depths was 0.94 mu g N L-1 d(-1) (0.067 mu M d(-1)). Given that winters with shorter ice duration (< 120 d) have become more frequent in these lakes since the late 1990s, peak winter nitrate concentrations and cumulative nitrate production under ice may be declining. As ice extent and duration change, the physical and chemical conditions supporting life will shift. This research suggests we may expect changes in the form and amount of inorganic N, and altered dissolved nitrogen : phosphorus ratios, in lakes during winters with shorter ice duration.					; Lottig, Noah/AAE-4650-2020; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012	Stanley, Emily/0000-0003-4922-8121; Hampton, Stephanie/0000-0003-2389-4249; Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998; Lottig, Noah/0000-0003-1599-8144; Labou, Stephanie/0000-0001-5633-5983; Powers, Stephen/0000-0001-6267-2644														2378-2242				OCT	2017	2	5					177	186		10.1002/lol2.10048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10048													WOS:000456695200005

On average, speeds are 50% greater in spring (March-May) than the annual mean (69 m a(-1)) while winter speeds are close to the annual mean. While marine-terminating glaciers have their maximum speed near the terminus, both land- and lake-terminating glaciers flow fastest around the median glacier elevation. On average, the lake-terminating and tidewater glaciers flow 1.7 and 2.3 times faster than the land-terminating glaciers, respectively. Monthly variations over the 5-year period are strikingly synchronous regardless of terminus type suggesting that regional-scale meteorological drivers govern the temporal variability. Mean annual speeds fluctuate roughly +/- 10% of the period mean without an apparent trend. At lake-terminating Bear Glacier, a short-term tripling in ice speed in fall 2019 over the area below an ice-dammed lake coincides with an observed glacier lake outburst flood (GLOF). An earlier GLOF caused a persistent breach of the beach barrier between the proglacial lake and ocean which likely led to overall speed-up of the lower glacier part throughout 2019. A significant speedup was also observed at the lower part of the lake-terminating Ellsworth Glacier and attributed to rapid glacier retreat and lake expansion, probably further amplified by the terminus area becoming buoyant and a large tabular iceberg breaking off. Our results highlight the impact of GLOFs and proglacial characteristics in spatial and temporal glacier speed variations.

Reconstruction of Climate and Landscapes of the Medieval Period on the Basis of Palynological Study of Paleosols Buried under Kurgans and Dendrochronological Data from Altai (South of Western Siberia)	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												Light loamy ordinary chernozems buried under two kurgans of a large Early Medieval necropolis Srostki-1 constructed in 890 +/- 105 horizontal ellipsis 975 +/- 85 AD (calibration by 1 delta) were compared with the chernozem of the background territory in Biysk district of Altai. The analysis of pedological and 20 geochemical indices characterizing weathering, biological activity, and salt leaching demonstrated that the paleosols of the Medieval period in the phase before the construction of the kurgans had been formed in a somewhat drier climate compared to the modern conditions, and then the humidization of the paleoclimate began. According to palynological data, the considered period was characterized by a decrease in the area of pine stands, which could be due to colder winters. The areas of birch and riverine willow forests also decreased in comparison with the modern period because of the active cutting by humans of the Srostki ethnos. In the Medieval period, mesophytic rich forb communities occupied larger areas and predominated over dry-steppe communities. The growth of sedges was active on expanding marshes that appeared after drying of shallow water bodies upon the decrease in the water-protective role of forest vegetation. At the same time, a slight increase in the amount of pollen of xerophytic herbs, including representatives of Chenopodiaceae and Poaceae families and Artemisia genus took place. This could be related to the increased anthropogenic load, including soil disturbance upon the construction of 61 kurgans of the Srostki culture. Dendrochronological method was applied to reconstruct average summer temperatures over the past two thousand years. It was found that the heat supply of summer seasons in the Srostki period (8th-12th centuries AD) generally corresponded to that at present. However, the years of 850-870 and 930-950 AD were marked by summer cooling, and the years of 876-882 and 982 AD were marked by summer warming with average summer temperatures 1.5 degrees C higher than the reference values of 1961-1990. The climatic variability of the Medieval period in different regions of the south of Western Siberia attests to the metachronous dynamics of the climate specified by the local conditions against the background of general climatic trends typical of Central Asia.

Here we investigated the external and internal controls on oxygen consumption and effects of hypoxia on carbon dioxide (CO2) emission in a subtropical reservoir in southeast China based on detailed field measurements during 2017 and 2018. Hypoxia lasted 4 months starting in mid-July and expanded from the bottom to near surface water. Rainstorm hyperpycnal flow and unusual hydraulics (outflow exit 40 m from the bottom) resulted in two thermoclines and enhanced the oxygen deficit in deeper water. Microbial respiration accounted for 67.4%-96.5% of total oxygen consumption in the bottom water. The increased supply of organic matter from storm runoff and to a lesser extent primary production in summer enhanced subsequent oxygen consumption. We observed an imbalance between excess CO2 production and oxygen depletion in summer and winter which was likely associated with other processes in the hypolimnion (e.g., chemoautotrophy, anaerobic degradation of organic matter, proton buffering, and nitrification). The water-air CO2 fluxes suggest that the surface reservoir usually served as a CO2 source, but was a sink in summer due to high primary productivity. CO2 was always oversaturated in the hypolimnion; this layer was at the depth of the dam outflow and ultimately released 68% of annual CO2 efflux to the atmosphere. This research confirmed that construction of a hydropower dam has substantially altered reservoir metabolism and regulated the CO2 emission pathway.

The detrital fraction in the lake sediments is dominated by aeolian input of felsic-rock origin, with little contribution of local volcanic material. Based on the isotopic Sr-Nd composition of the lake core-sediments, we postulate that the deserts of northern China are the main source of allochthonous particles to the lake throughout the past similar to 80 kyr. Northwesterly winds associated with the East Asian winter monsoon and high latitude westerlies are the main carriers of dust from these deserts to the lake. The deserts of central China are an additional minor dust source. The episodic dust input from these deserts results from anomalous dry southwesterly winds. These could be related to either El Nino conditions, or to delays in the onset of the East Asian summer monsoon rains. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Islam, Z; Seneka, M				Islam, Zahidul; Seneka, Michael			Geometric shape, water availability and under ice volume of Alberta lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING												Water availability information can be vital to the execution of informed management decisions. Since only a small fraction of Alberta lakes have surveyed bathymetry data, accurate estimation of lake water availability is often challenging. In this study, we analyzed available bathymetry data from 77 lakes, distributed over six major river basins and five natural regions of Alberta, and developed dimensionless relationships between volume and depth. We compared these relationships with the analytical relationship between volume and depth for five idealized lake shapes, viz. as cylindrical, pseudo-parabolic, parabolic, conic, and inverse-parabolic. Our study shows that considering the volume-depth relationship, 48% of Alberta lakes fall under parabolic shape, 29% fall under conic shape, and the rest (23%) fall under either pseudo-parabolic, inverse-parabolic, or cylindrical shape. We also developed four different models to estimate maximum lake volume (a proxy of lake water availability) and 5% under ice volume (a proxy for winter allocation limit of lake water) assuming an ice thickness of 80 cm. These models have been developed in such a way that allows the user to apply the models based on data availability and can be used in absence of site-specific data (e.g., bathymetry) to estimate volume, and subsequently water availability in lakes. Finally, we propose a formulation of percent volume reduction due to small water withdrawal, which requires only maximum depth of a lake to estimate a potential volume reduction limit for a water withdrawal.

Satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentration estimates for 36 European lakes during a widespread double heatwave event in the summer of 2019 show that deep and medium depth lakes at higher latitudes displayed a synchronous chlorophyll-a increase with temperature, possibly as the result of an improved light climate resulting from increased stratification. Many deep or northern lakes had a notable response to the heatwaves. Warmer, southern shallow lakes had the most asynchronous response, tending to show a greater response to subsequent low pressure or storm events than to the heatwave itself. Chlorophyll-a peaks typically occurred five days after the peak of the heatwave for shallow lakes. For some shallow lakes, the sequential cycle of several heatwaves and low pressure events was found to punctuate the seasonal pattern of chlorophyll-a. Notably, in several of these nutrient-rich lakes the response to the heatwave was dwarfed by large algal blooms occurring later during the typical cyanobacterial bloom period in early autumn, underlining the importance of timing and phenology in response to heatwaves in addition to depth, latitude and trophic state.					; Free, Gary/IUO-8431-2023; Bresciani, Mariano/H-7501-2013; Liu, Xiaohan/AGS-6555-2022; Albergel, Clement/B-8896-2012; Giardino, Claudia/O-9923-2015; Simis, Stefan/B-1703-2008	Bresciani, Mariano/0000-0002-7185-8464; Simis, Stefan/0000-0002-6296-9146; 													1470-160X	1872-7034				SEP	2022	142								109217	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109217	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109217		JUL 2022											WOS:000874478300024

Ostracods as indicators of pollution in the lakes of Mysore	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Ostracods are small crustaceans found in aquatic habitats and the present paper deals with the role of water quality index on their population diversity and seasonal fluctuations in the four lakes of Mysore city. The present investigation was carried out from July 2004 to June 2005. The study revealed highest water quality index and population density of ostracods during summer and least during winter Dalvoi lake recorded higher water quality index (125.04), population density (60 l(-1)) but lower species diversity (2 species) of ostracods, whereas Kamana lake recorded lowest water quality index (63.49), population density (40 l(-1)) and highest species diversity (6 species) of ostracods. Increase in the water quality index indicates increase in the pollution load. As water quality index (WQI) increases, population density of ostracods increases but species diversity decreases.																			0254-8704					SEP	2008	29	5					711	714											19295069					WOS:000259755200012

Seasonal stratification of a deep, high-altitude, dimictic lake: Nam Co, Tibetan Plateau	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												We investigate the seasonal evolution of stratification in a deep (100 m), high-altitude (4,730 m a.s.l.) dimictic lake on the Tibetan Plateau using three years of observation of Nam Co. The lake is situated at relatively low latitude (30 degrees N) where it receives high solar radiative forcing (observed maximum daily average 400 W m(-2)), yet the annual average air temperature is close to 0 degrees C at this high altitude. These features make Nam Co distinct from most well-documented dimictic lakes, which are usually located at higher latitude and lower altitude. We classify seasonal stratification into six phases based on strength of stratification, surface temperature relative to the temperature of maximum density, ice-cover, and heat and mixing dynamics, which we use to compare Nam Co with better-documented, higher-latitude dimictic lakes. While the three warm stratification phases (i.e. when water is warmer than the temperature of maximum density) in Nam Co are relatively cold, they are otherwise similar to that observed in high-latitude dimictic lakes. Conversely, two of Nam Co's cold stratification phases are distinct from that reported in high-latitude lakes. These two phases are characterized by the interplay between the relatively strong radiative forcing and surface heat flux, and include the following: 1) during fall turnover, persistent winds aided by radiatively driven convection prolong vertical mixing (i.e. turnover) and surface heat loss such that the entire water column cools well below the temperature of maximum density (as low as 1 degrees C); and 2) in contrast, under ice-cover with relatively little snow, the entire water column of the lake warms continuously due to through-ice solar radiative flux. The intense cooling and heating during these two phases counteract each other such that hypolimnetic temperature at spring turnover is similar to that observed in high latitude lakes. Our observations highlight the relative importance of radiatively driven convection on the seasonal stratification dynamics of Nam Co, and underscore that these dynamics must be considered when attempting to predict climate change impacts on high-altitude, low-latitude lakes, including the > 1100, largely unstudied, lakes on the Tibetan Plateau.

In situ observations and a Numerical Weather Prediction model (HIRLAM) were used for the forcing data. HIRLAM forecasts, after orography correction, were comparable with the in situ data. Both lake-ice models predicted the ice thickness (accuracy 5 cm), surface temperature (accuracy 2-3 degrees C in winter, better in spring), and ice-breakup date (accuracy better than five days) well. HIGHTSI was better for ice thickness and ice-breakup date, while FLake gave better freezing date. Snow thickness outcome was worse, in particular for the melting season. Surface temperature was highly sensitive to air temperature, stratification and albedo, and the largest errors (positively biased) resulted in strongly stable conditions.

Hence, it is critical to extract water with a high precision method and monitor long-term sequence dynamic changes in lakes. As the greatest natural lake of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Baiyangdian Lake has a significant function in human life, socio-economic development, and regional ecological balance. This lake area has shown large changes due to human activity and climate change. The change monitoring process of the water surface is of great significance in providing support for the management and protection of the lake. The Spectrum Matching based on Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (SMDPSO) method is a new, robust, and low-cost method for water extraction, that has obvious advantages in extracting complex water surfaces. In this paper, the SMDPSO method was used to extract the water surface of Baiyangdian Lake by Landsat images from 1984 to 2018. This method has a good effect on complex water surface extraction with vegetation, shadows, and so forth, and the Landsat images have higher resolution and longer time series. The main contents and results of this paper are as follows: (1) We verified the applicability of the SMDPSO method in the Baiyangdian Lake using visual interpretation and correlation analysis. The relative errors between observed and extracted results were all less than 5% in spring, summer, and fall, and the correlation coefficient between the water area and water level was 0.96. (2) According to seasonal verification and comparison of the extraction results, the SMDPSO method was used to extract the water surface area of Baiyangdian Lake during spring of the years 1984-2018. Water area changes of Baiyangdian Lake can be divided into four periods: Dry period (1984-1988), degraded period (1989-2000), stable period (2000-2008), and recovery period (2008-2018). The water area reached a maximum of 280 km(2) in 1989 and a minimum of 44 km(2) in 2002. (3) The possible causes of the changes in the water area of Baiyangdian Lake were also analyzed. The changes were caused by climate and human activities during the first and second periods, but mainly human activities during the third and fourth periods. In fact, effective policies combined with water conservancy projects were directly conducive to improving or even recovering the water and ecological environment of Baiyangdian Lake. Considering its importance for the benign development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region and the construction of the Xiong'an New Area, a policy is necessary to ensure that the lake's ecological environment will not be destroyed under the premise of economic development.					; jiang, weiguo/AAM-1192-2020; Jia, Kai/AGH-8567-2022	Jiang, Weiguo/0000-0002-1352-1046; lv, jinxia/0000-0002-8762-3950; Jia, Kai/0000-0001-6192-7094; Wang, Xiaoya/0000-0003-0519-8661														2073-4441				NOV	2018	10	11							1616	10.3390/w10111616	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w10111616													WOS:000451736300123

For L. sardinella summertime capture-recapture data yielded mortality rates of order of 0.01 per day. From a survivorship curve of L. sardinella avg. rate of death on a yearly basis was only 0.0027 per day, although there was some evidence of age-specific mortality increasing from 0.0005 per day for 5-6 year-old fish to 0.0038 for 8-11 year-old fish. L. sardinella data were interpreted to mean that greatest death-rates occurred in summer. Direct obs. confirmed fact that fish died more readily when water was warmer than 10[degree]C. Winter mortality rates must have been very low even though sp. was confined in only 18 inches of water under very thick ice cover most of yr. From limited summer capture-recapture data, it is difficult to explain why Coregonus nasus mortality was so small. Application of capture-recapture techniques to estimation of season-al fish mortality is discussed. It is concluded that techniques are feasible if sampling can be carried out on a sufficiently large scale.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1954	35	3					388	396		10.2307/1930103	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1930103													WOS:A1954UZ52200013

A copepod Cyclops abyssorum prealpinus (Kiefer, 1939), the dominant species among planktonic crustaceans in the lake, served as the only intermediate host for this parasite. Infection with plerocercoids was higher in adult copepods (predominantly females) than in copepodite stages IV and V. The prevalence rate of 25% found in C. abyssorum prealpinus females in June 1998 represents a unique infection rate of intermediate hosts with fish tapeworms in natural conditions. The final host, the common whitefish Coregonus lavaretus (L.), was heavily infected with P. longicollis throughout the year (prevalence 90%; mean abundance 40.3; maximum intensity of infection more than 500 tapeworms per fish); immature tapeworms predominated in all samples (P<0.01). Transmission of tapeworm larvae from copepods to the common whitefish took place most intensively in summer and autumn, and depended on seasonal changes in the density of the C. abyssorum prealpinus population, infection of this copepod with plerocercoids and their density in the lake. In addition, transmission efficiency also seems to be determined by the longevity of tapeworm larvae in the intermediate host, timing of predation of the fish host and rapid development of the parasite within this host during the summer period. Overall transmission potential of P. longicollis was low, with only about 9% of juvenile specimens reaching maturity in common whitefish.																			0932-0113	1432-1955				SEP	2003	91	2					130	136		10.1007/s00436-003-0939-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-003-0939-x								12910414					WOS:000185602400006

There are thousands of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), and more than 1200 of them have an area larger than 1 km(2); they respond quickly to climate change, but few observation data of lakes are available. Therefore, the thermal condition of the plateau lakes under the background of climate warming remains poorly understood. In this study, the China regional surface meteorological feature dataset developed by the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ITPCAS), MODIS lake surface temperature (LST) data and buoy observation data were used to evaluate the performance of lake model FLake, extended by simple parame-terizations of the salinity effect, for brackish lake and to reveal the response of thermal conditions, radiation and heat balance of Qinghai Lake to the recent climate change. The results demonstrated that the FLake has good ability in capturing the seasonal variations in the lake surface temperature and the internal thermal structure of Qinghai Lake. The simulated lake surface temperature showed an increasing trend from 1979 to 2012, positively correlated with the air temperature and the downward longwave radiation while negatively correlated with the wind speed and downward shortwave radiation. The simulated internal thermodynamic structure revealed that Qinghai Lake is a dimictic lake with two overturn periods occurring in late spring and late autumn. The sur-face and mean water temperatures of the lake significantly increased from 1979 to 2012, while the bottom temperatures showed no significant trend, even decreasing slightly from 1989 to 2012. The warming was the strongest in winter for both the lake surface and air temperature. With the warming of the climate, the later ice-on and earlier ice-off trend was simulated in the lake, significantly influencing the interannual and seasonal variability in radiation and heat flux. The annual average net shortwave radiation and latent heat flux (LH) both increase obviously while the net longwave radiation and sensible heat flux (SH) decrease slightly. Earlier ice-off leads to more energy absorption mainly in the form of shortwave radiation during the thawing period, and later ice-on leads to more energy release in the form of longwave radiation, SH and LH during the ice formation period. Meanwhile, the lake-air temperature difference increased in both periods due to shortening ice duration.					; Gao, Xiaoqing/AAE-5934-2019; Li, Zhaoguo/HPC-2048-2023; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010; Su, Dongsheng/AAI-1211-2019	Su, Dongsheng/0000-0002-1546-4524; Wen, Lijuan/0000-0001-9243-9499; Kirillin, Georgiy/0000-0001-7337-3586; 													1027-5606	1607-7938				APR 26	2019	23	4					2093	2109		10.5194/hess-23-2093-2019	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2093-2019													WOS:000466118100001
J	Sadro, S; Sickman, JO; Melack, JM; Skeen, K				Sadro, Steven; Sickman, James O.; Melack, John M.; Skeen, Kevin			Effects of Climate Variability on Snowmelt and Implications for Organic Matter in a High-Elevation Lake	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Few coupled lake-watershed studies examine long-term effects of climate on the ecosystem function of lakes in a hydrological context. We use 32 years of hydrological and biogeochemical data from a high-elevation site in the Sierra Nevada of California to characterize variation in snowmelt in relation to climate variability and explore the impact on factors affecting phytoplankton biomass. The magnitude of accumulated winter snow, quantified through basinwide estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE), was the most important climate factor controlling variation in the timing and rate of spring snowmelt. Variations in SWE and snowmelt led to significant differences in lake flushing rate, water temperature, and nitrate concentrations across years. On average in dry years, snowmelt started 25 days earlier and proceeded 7mm/day slower, and the lake began the ice-free season with nitrate concentrations similar to 2 mu M higher and water temperatures 9 degrees C warmer than in wet years. Flushing rates in wet years were 2.5 times larger than those in dry years. Consequently, particulate organic matter concentrations, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, were 5-6 mu M higher in dry years. There was a temporal trend of increase in particulate organic matter across dry years that corresponded to lake warming independent of variation in SWE. These results suggest that phytoplankton biomass is increasing as a result of both interannual variability in precipitation and long-term warming trends. Our study underscores the need to account for local-scale catchment variability that may affect the accumulation of winter snowpack when predicting climate responses in lakes.

J	HONDZO, M; STEFAN, HG				HONDZO, M; STEFAN, HG			REGIONAL WATER TEMPERATURE CHARACTERISTICS OF LAKES SUBJECTED TO CLIMATE-CHANGE	CLIMATIC CHANGE												A deterministic, validated, one-dimensional, unsteady-state lake water quality model was linked to a daily weather data base to simulate daily water temperature profiles in lakes over a period of twenty-five (1955-79) years. Twenty seven classes of lakes which are characteristic for the north-central U.S. were investigated. Output from a global climate model (GISS) was used to modify the weather data base to account for a doubling of atmospheric CO2. The simulations predict that, after climate change, epilimnetic temperatures will be higher but increase less than air temperature, hypolimnetic temperatures in seasonally stratified dimictic lakes will be largely unchanged or even lower than at present, evaporative water loss will be increased by as much as 300 mm for the season, onset of stratification will occur earlier and overturn later in the season, and overall lake stability will become greater in spring and summer.																			0165-0009	1573-1480				JUL	1993	24	3					187	211		10.1007/BF01091829	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01091829													WOS:A1993LT29900003

Modeling surface waves and wind-driven circulation in eastern Lake Ontario during winter storms	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A spectral wave model coupled to a depth averaged hydrodynamic model was used to simulate the wave and flow conditions in the Kingston Basin of Lake Ontario during winter storm events. The simulations were verified using wave and current profiler data collected over the 2009-10 and 2011-12 winter periods. The model was forced with outputs from the Great Lakes Coastal Forecasting System (GLCFS) as open boundary conditions and winds from a local meteorological station. Wave simulations in the Kingston Basin were better represented using the GLCFS boundary forcing into a model domain of the Kingston Basin; whereas, a model domain that covered all of Lake Ontario yielded a better representation of flows with reasonable wave results. For five storm events that were simulated, approximately 80% of the wave energy outside the Kingston Basin entered the basin after crossing the Duck-Galloo Ridge. Flows throughout the basin showed a complex circulation pattern that is defined by both the forcing and the topographical features including islands, shoals and deep channels. The complex circulation within the basin is composed of several wind-driven gyres which are magnified during storm events. The impact of waves on the circulation patterns at the basin scale is negligible, since shoals are typically too deep (e.g. 20 m) relative to the wavelength and period (e.g. 7-10 s) to generate large-scale wave-driven flows. In general, the modeling system was successful in reproducing the waves and currents in eastern Lake Ontario and can be used for future engineering-type studies such as offshore wind farm impact assessment.

Prolonged Heavy Snowfall During the Younger Dryas	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												Snowfall is an important component of Earth's climate system; however, long, continuous high-resolution records of global snowfall are lacking because of the absence of suitable proxies. In this study, diatom record from the sediments of Yunlong Lake, in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, was used to reconstruct snowfall during the Younger Dryas (YD). Variations in the abundance of low-light-tolerant diatoms and diatom flux indicate that the duration of lake ice cover during the YD was significantly longer than that during the colder Heinrich event 1; this suggests that heavy snowfall, rather than temperatures, was responsible for the greater duration of lake ice cover during the YD. Thus, we conclude that prolonged, heavy snowfall occurred in the southeastern Tibetan Plateau during the YD. In addition, this conclusion is supported by the results of a climate model simulation that also suggest that heavy snowfall occurred at high latitude in the Northern Hemisphere during the YD. We propose that the heavy snowfall intensified cooling in Northern Hemisphere by increasing the albedo and that it increased hydrological variability at low latitudes by increasing the duration of the southward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and by delaying the onset of the Asian summer monsoon. The snowfall would have been a source of continuous freshwater that acted as a positive feedback and resulted in a prolonged weakened state of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, which lasted for more than 1,000years. Overall, our results emphasize the amplification and positive feedback function of heavy snowfall in triggering abrupt climate change.					; PENG, ZHANGYANG/NCV-5824-2025; Lu, houyuan/L-8661-2019; zhang, tian/GZK-6001-2022; Jiang, Dabang/I-2243-2014; Wang, Luo/A-1430-2009; Hao, Qingzhen/KCK-8974-2024; Zhang, Youchi/M-6989-2016; hao, qing zhen/E-4605-2010	Zhang, Deguo/0000-0003-3029-038X; Wang, Luo/0000-0003-2217-8478; Zhang, Enlou/0000-0002-8057-7760; Zou, Yafei/0000-0002-7605-4115; Liu, Yeyi/0000-0003-4809-4619; hao, qing zhen/0000-0002-6281-5817													2169-897X	2169-8996				DEC 27	2018	123	24					13748	13762		10.1029/2018JD029271	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JD029271													WOS:000455876300008

CDOM distribution is heavily influenced by biogeochemical processes and anthropogenic activity. However, little is known regarding the impact of component variation and phytoplankton growth on CDOM distribution variation in MDWSR. Therefore, samples were collected from a representative MDWSR (the Shanzai Reservoir) for analysis. CDOM absorption and fluorescence coupling with parallel factor analysis were measured and calculated. The results indicated that only two CDOM components were found in the surface water of Shanzai Reservoir, fulvic acid, and high-excitation tryptophan, originating from terrestrial and autochthonous sources, respectively. The types of components did not change with the season. The average molecular weight of CDOM increased in proportion to its fulvic acid content. The distribution variation in CDOM content mainly resulted from the variation in two CDOM components in summer and from high-excitation tryptophan in winter. Phytoplankton growth strongly influenced the distribution variation of CDOM content in summer; the metabolic processes of Cyanobacteria and Bacillariophyta consumed fulvic acid, while that of Cryptophyta produced high-excitation tryptophan.					; Sun, Qiyuan/AAV-9969-2021	Xie, Rongrong/0000-0002-2739-1107; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JUL	2017	24	21					17805	17815		10.1007/s11356-017-9448-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9448-9								28602005					WOS:000406479200046
J	Hofmann, N; Fischer, P				Hofmann, N; Fischer, P			Temperature preferences and critical thermal limits of burbot: Implications for habitat selection and ontogenetic habitat shift	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												In large lakes, burbot Lota Iota utilize several habitats during their ontogenesis. While juveniles are typically littoral dwellers, adults often prefer the cold profundal waters, especially during the summer months. Such distinct seasonal or ontogenetic habitat shifts are often induced by proximate abiotic factors that guide the fish toward another habitat in which either physiological performance is optimized or survival is increased. Temperature is often considered to be such a factor, especially in cold- stenothermal species. In thermal gradient experiments, the effects of the acclimation temperature (AT) on the preferred temperature (PT) and the critical thermal maximum and minimum of burbot were studied. A significant nonlinear relationship was found between PT and AT in small (10-20 cm total length) burbot (SEs in parentheses): PT = -2.1363 (+/-0.5455) AT + 0.0732 (+/-0.0207) AT(2) + 26.2708 (+/- 3.2075). The final temperature preferendum was 11.4degreesC. For large (20-30 cm) burbot, no such relationship between acclimation temperature and preferred temperature was found, and a final temperature preferendum of 14.2degreesC was calculated. Both sizeclasses showed a positive linear relationship between the critical thermal maximum (CTMa) and AT: CTMa = 0.3254 (+/-0.0198) AT + 25.1106 (+/-0.2676) (R-2 = 0.94) for small burbot, and CTMa = 0.3688 (+/-0.0276) AT + 24.2986 (+/-0.3742) (R-2 = 0.91) for large burbot. A critical thermal minimum of 3.3degreesC was found for small burbot acclimated to 19.6degreesC. The results show that even during summer the littoral water temperature in Lake Constance is very unlikely to force juvenile burbot towards the cold profundal zone. However, the data provide good evidence that changes in water temperature in spring do act as a trigger for the juveniles to leave the littoral to avoid a thermal trap during summer.

In the 1960s and early 1970s, the fish were widespread in the lake but scarce. We determined the more recent abundance and distribution of alewives by cross-contour trawling in the spring in 1978-1988. Alewives were scarce lake-wide; the mean catch rate was only 23 fish per 100 h of trawling and represented a density of 0.003 kg per hectare in the area swept by the trawls. Fish of six age groups were caught in trawls in spring and gill nets in fall in 1983-1987. Total annual mortality was 64%, a high natural rate in the absence of fishing. Alewives in Lake Superior were small at the end of their first growing season but later grew faster than those in the other Great Lakes. Fecundity, estimated to be 64,000 eggs (mean total length = 187 mm) was higher than in other freshwater stocks. Zooplankton was the major food of alewives < 100 mm long and Mysis was the main food of larger fish. Exposure to water temperatures below lethal minimums for overwintering fish and for developing eggs limits the success of this species in Lake Superior.																			0380-1330						1991	17	3					304	313		10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71367-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(91)71367-1													WOS:A1991GK77500003

Water quality ramifications of temporary drawdown of Oregon reservoirs to facilitate juvenile Chinook salmon passage	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												Hamilton SK, Murphy CA, Johnson SL, Pollock A. 2022. Water quality ramifications of temporary drawdown of Oregon reservoirs to facitiliate juvenile Chinook salmon passage. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XX-XX. Several high-head dams on the Willamette River system in Oregon create reservoirs that support the growth and survival of anadromous salmonids but may impede downstream passage of juvenile fishes, including the dam that creates the Fall Creek Reservoir (also known as Fall Creek Lake). Managers have been conducting brief "deep drawdowns" of Fall Creek Reservoir to promote downstream passage of juvenile threatened Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and to reduce reservoir populations of invasive fish species that prey on or compete with salmon. Over 4 years we studied downstream water quality changes during these drawdowns, which reach the original stream level for short periods in late autumn. In other regions, drawdown of lakes and reservoirs can cause nutrient release and eutrophication, often in conjunction with erosion of within-reservoir sediment and export of fine sediment downstream. In this case, although large amounts of sediment were released at the lowest water levels, there were only modest increases in available nutrient concentrations that were ephemeral and unlikely to cause downstream eutrophication. In addition, although the oxygen demand of the released sediments was not high enough to further reduce dissolved oxygen downstream, very brief (1-2 h) drops in dissolved oxygen occurred immediately downstream as the reservoir water level approached streambed but did not appear to harm fishes. Sedimentation of downstream habitats is of concern, but careful management of the drawdown could mitigate sediment export because most export occurred at the lowest reservoir water levels. Suggestions for predicting and minimizing impacts from reservoir drawdowns are offered.

Seasonal Variations in the Flow of Land-Terminating Glaciers in Central-West Greenland Using Sentinel-1 Imagery	REMOTE SENSING												Land-terminating sectors of the Greenland ice sheet flow faster in summer after surface meltwater reaches the subglacial drainage system. Speedup occurs when the subglacial drainage system becomes saturated, leading to a reduction in the effective pressure which promotes sliding of the overlying ice. Here, we use observations acquired by the Sentinel-1a and b synthetic aperture radar to track changes in the speed of land-terminating glaciers across a 14,000 km(2) sector of west-central Greenland on a weekly basis in 2016 and 2017. The fine spatial and temporal sampling of the satellite data allows us to map the speed of summer and winter across the entire sector and to resolve the weekly evolution of ice flow across the downstream portions of five glaciers. Near to the ice sheet margin (at 650 m.a.s.l.), glacier speedup begins around day 130, persisting for around 90 days, and then peaks around day 150. At four of the five glaciers included in our survey the peak speedup is similar in both years, in Russell Glacier there is marked interannual variability of 32% between 2016 and 2017. We present, for the first time, seasonal and altitudinal variation in speedup persistence. Our study demonstrates the value of Sentinel-1's systematic and frequent acquisition plan for studying seasonal changes in ice sheet flow.

J	Hollis, GE; Stevenson, AC				Hollis, GE; Stevenson, AC			The physical basis of the Lake Mikri Prespa systems: Geology, climate, hydrology and water quality	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Mikri Prespa is 47 km(2) in area, with a maximum depth of 8.4 m and a normal water level at around 850 m above sea level. It collects water from a granitic and karstic catchment of 189 km(2) which includes snowy mountains rising to over 2000 m. The main flat land is the sedimentary plain to the east and the sandy isthmus that separates Mikri Prespa from the much larger Megali Prespa into which the former normally drains. Rainfall averages around 750 mm because the 600 mm to 700 mm falling on the plains is augmented by heavier falls including much snow on the mountains. There is rainfall each month with an autumnal maximum. River inputs to the lake and the lake level itself peak in the spring with the snowmelt. Mikri Prespa normally rises by about a metre to flood the surrounding wet meadows landward of the reed fringe. The annual cycle of water level fluctuation is superimposed on infrequent upward surges in the level of Mikri and Megali Prespa because of particularly wet and snowy winters and, in recent years, the steady decline of the level of Megali Prespa because of tectonic activity. There has been considerable human modification of the hydrology of the area with the diversion of the Agios Germanos torrent from Mikri to Megali Prespa, the creation of a canal in Albania which can input or withdraw water from the lake, the culverting of the canal linking Mikri and Megali Prespa, and the creation of an irrigation scheme taking water directly from Mikri Prespa and from the Agios Germanos stream. The lake water is base rich because of the limestone in the catchment. Whilst concern has been expressed at the eutrophication of the lake, recent studies have proved that there has been no significant change in nutrient status this century and the lake is not eutrophic. There has been a significant increase in turbidity but this may be the result of sediment disturbance by an introduced fish species. The lake and its supporting hydrological system will need careful monitoring if it is to be effectively managed. A particularly high priority is the development and implementation of a water level management plan for the lake.

The presence or absence of the ice cover in winter can impact on the functioning of lake ecosystems. The research was carried out in two mesotrophic and dimictic lakes in winter with and without ice cover. The biomass and phytoplankton and its composition was analysed with reference to physical factors (PAR and temperature). The research proved that poor thermal-light conditions under the ice/snow cover favoured the development of nanoplanktonic species from the genus Cryptomonas (Cryptophyta) or Stephanodiscus (Bacillariophyceae), whereas microplanktonic species of dinoflagellates, diatoms or green algae prevailed during the ice-free winter. The highest phytoplankton biomass and species richness were recorded during ice-free winter, which affected a higher Shannon-Wiener diversity index and evenness. It has been shown that the mild winter creates good conditions for the development of phytoplankton species characteristic for the mixing periods. The lack of inverse thermal stratification during winter can lead to disturbance in the functioning of the water ecosystems throughout the year.

Santiago Lake is located on the Sete Cidades Volcano, at an altitude of 364 m, presenting a surface area of 0.25 km(2) and a maximum depth of 33 m. Congro Lake is located on the Congro Fissural Volcanic System, at an altitude of 420 m, and has a surface area of 0.04 km(2) and a maximum depth of 22 m. Both lakes are monomictic in character, with low mineralized waters of meteoric origin, being the temperature in the range between 12.4 degrees C (winter period) and 23.8 degrees C (summer period). The main water type is Na-HCO3, and the relative major-ion composition is HCO3- > Cl- > SO42- > F- for anions and Na+ > K+ > Mg2+ > Ca2+ for cations. Four sampling surveys were carried out between 2013 and 2016 in each lake in order to estimate surface diffuse CO2 degassing. A total of 1612 and 713 CO2 flux measurements were made with an accumulation chamber at Santiago and Congro lakes, respectively. The higher CO2 fluxes were measured during the winter surveys (0.2 t d(-1) in Congro and 5.6 t d(-1) in Santiago), while the lowest values (0.1 t d(-1) and 0.2 t d(-1), respectively, in Congro and Santiago lakes) were recorded in the summer. These seasonal differences observed in both lakes are associated with the monomictic character of the lakes, as the CO2 is not able to ascend to the surface when the water column is stratified during the warmer period. Due to the physical processes that occur in both lakes, the CO2 emission is mostly associated to a biogenic origin, but the higher CO2 emissions measured in Santiago Lake suggest that a volcanic influence cannot be excluded, as also shown through the heavier delta C-13 isotopic measured in this water body. The tectonic structures that cross Santiago Lake probably enable the observed degassing. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The focus of this study is to get a stable treatment water through four seasons under no pre-sedimentation systems. All experiments were done at the lake side, and raw water was introduced from the lake continually. There is no sedimentation tank in the reactors and biofilm carrier clogging dose not occur and biofilm growth is uniform through the whole reactors by reciprocating motion carrier. RMSBP was able to decrease NH4-N, and NO2-N and NO3-N simultaneously under unaerated conditions. Decrease of nonpurgeable DOC and ultraviolet(UV) absorbance (1 cm path length, pH7.0, 260nm) is possible almost two to ten times more expensive than the traditional biological filtration process.

J	Kirkland, DW				Kirkland, Douglas w.			A GENETIC EXPLANATION FOR THE ANHYDRITE-HALITE CYCLIC LAYERS IN THE MIDDLEJURASSIC LOUANN SALT, US GULF COASTAL REGION	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												Successions of bipartite layers (couplets) form the bedding fabric of salt stocks of the U.S. Gulf Coastal Region, south-central U.S.A. The cyclic couplets typically have a thickness range of 3-20 cm and a mean of about 10 cm. Each couplet consists of a white band of halite interstratified with a thinner, gray band of halite mixed with anhydrite (generally 3-8 wt % of each couplet). Successions of couplets, which lack siliciclastic beds and significant hiatuses, make up the thick (similar to 1.5 km) Middle Jurassic Louann Salt. Deeply buried (by up to similar to 18 km), the Louann couplets moved laterally by ductile flow into the base of salt stocks and rose (or appeared to). The Dead Sea is a unique, modern analog of the Louann Salt. The huge lake is a model of how surface evaporation, brine temperature, and double-diffusive salt fingering combined to form the Louann couplets. Halite varves (couplets) presently precipitate from the Dead Sea's deep (similar to 300 m), marine-like brine. If these modern varves are to be a valid genetic model for the Louann couplets, they too must be annual layers. An explicit similarity of the Louann couplets with two modern and four ancient varve-established evaporitic couplets demonstrates that the Louann anhydrite-halite couplets are truly varves. The Louann varves accumulated at such a rapid rate (similar to 1 m every 10 years) that a deep-water depositional basin must have pre-existed. In the basin, an abrupt destabilized thermocline existed in summer between a surface zone (tens of meters thick) of warm, high-salinity brine and a deep zone (hundreds of meters thick) of cooler, lesser-salinity brine. This disposition resulted in a vertical flux from the thermocline of alternating rising and sinking salt fingers (millimeter wide, centimeter long, and millions per km(2)). When heat diffused from the warm surface zone into the cooler fingers, their density decreased, they rose, and blended with the ambient brine; and when heat diffused from the warm fingers into the cooler deep zone, their density increased, they sank, and blended with the ambient brine. Salinity also diffused into and from fingers but at a rate similar to 100 x slower than heat. In summer, the Louann surface zone was NaCl undersaturated because: 1) solar heating caused enhanced NaCl solubility, 2) ascending fingers transferred low-salinity brine into the higher-salinity surface zone, and 3) descending fingers transferred high-salinity brine into the lower salinity deep zone. The Louann surface zone, however, was CaSO4<middle dot>2H(2)O supersaturated because of: 1) gypsum's retrograde solubility and 2) gypsum concentration by evaporation in the surface zone. Gypsum cumulates rained from the surface zone onto the seafloor. As fingers descended from the thermocline into the Louann deep zone, their NaCl salinity state changed from saturated to supersaturated. Cumulate and bottom-growth halite precipitated, and the halite and gypsum accumulated together on the seafloor. With subsequent dehydration of the gypsum, the precipitates formed the thin, gray, anhydrite(halite) summer band of the Louann varves. In the fall, brine above the thermocline began to cool. By mid-winter, energized by wind and convection, the brine column overturned, became significantly cooler, and intensely NaCl-supersaturated. Halite cumulates crystallized throughout and rained onto the seafloor to form the thicker, white, halite winter band of the Louann varves.																			1527-1404	1938-3681				OCT	2024	94	5					541	558		10.2110/jsr.2023.052	http://dx.doi.org/10.2110/jsr.2023.052													WOS:001369033000003
J	LOWE, RH				LOWE, RH			THE INFLUENCE OF LIGHT AND OTHER FACTORS ON THE SEAWARD MIGRATION OF THE SILVER EEL (ANGUILLA-ANGUILLA L)	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Observations were collected for 3 years from 6 field sites in the English Lake District. The data confirmed that silver eel runs occur only between late summer and early winter. The higher up-stream the eels are, the earlier in the season they are trapped. The migration was confined to very few nights, on which large numbers of silver eels travelled seawards; eels ran on the same nights at widely separated sites. Most eels migrated when floods coincided with moonless periods. Few eels ran when there was a full moon; the run could be checked experimentally by artificial light. The start of the eel season was delayed until there was a flood, after which some eels ran on dark nights when there was no flood. The greatest catches were made on rising floods. Weather conditions were not as important as floods in determining whether eel runs occurred. Eels tended to run in the early hours of the night except on a rising flood. Silver eels have to be stimulated into a "migration mood", a state of extreme activity, before they will migrate. This mood appeared to be related to conditions of flood, possibly fall in temperature and darkness of the night. Eels kept in tanks in the laboratory were particularly active the same nights that eels were migrating in the field. Expts. in the field and laboratory have shown that the downstream migration of silver eels may be checked and deflected by artificial underwater lights. The extreme activity of the silver eel associated with migration appears to lower the threshold of response to light, artificial lights having most effect on the nights when the eels were most active. In an artificial river in the laboratory the downstream swim was delayed by light, and eels chose a dark channel in preference to a lit one; there was evidence from laboratory experiments that once the shock effect of the light wore off the eels responded photokinetically instead of negatively phototactically. In the artificial river the eels swam upstream against a flow of 1.1 ft./ sec., but tired rapidly against a current of 1.7 ft./sec. It was concluded that flood, or some associated factor, possibly fall in water temp. acts as a trigger stimulus starting the downstream migration. Eels then run continuously, except when inhibited by light during the day and on nights with bright moonlight or starlight, until the effect of the activating stimulus wears off. Most eels will probably need restimulating several times before they reach the sea.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1952	21	2					275	309		10.2307/1963	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1963													WOS:A1952XX15900008
J	Ugedal, O; Forseth, T; Jonsson, B				Ugedal, O; Forseth, T; Jonsson, B			A functional model of radiocesium turnover in brown trout	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												We describe a mechanistic model to explore the environmental and metabolic determinants of radiocesium kinetics in a freshwater fish, the brown trout (Salmo trutta). Our model, which incorporates submodels for fish growth, food consumption, ambient temperature, and radiocesium turnover, was validated and calibrated to observations in three year-classes of brown trout from a Norwegian lake contaminated with Chernobyl fallout. Observed growth and independent estimates of food consumption matched simulations. Whereas our model successfully described trends and seasonal dynamics of radiocesium in brown trout, it was highly sensitive to the temperature submodel with model uncertainty largely driven by uncertainties in absorption efficiency, feeding rate, and temperature. We used the model to simulate both fallout and steady-state (constant prey radiocesium) conditions. Peak radiocesium in fish after a fallout depended upon time of year, fish size, rate of food consumption and growth, and water temperature regime. Among the modeled lake types (temperate, boreal, and subalpine), peak radioactivity was highest for brown trout living in the warmest lake, feeding and growing at a maximum rate, and for fallout occurring early in spring. In these lakes, increasing growth rate from 80 to 100% of the maximum nearly doubled peak radioactivity. The model predicted that the relationship between body size and fish radioactivity changed from negative to positive within 2 yr after a fallout. At steady state, the model predicted seasonal dynamics in accumulation of radiocesium, with maximum biomagnification in autumn and minimum in early spring. Maximum biomagnification was related to fish size (weak negative slope), growth rate, and temperature regime, and a metamodel was developed for predicting biomagnification.

The inorganic water insoluble portions were found to be composed mainly of four non-clay minerals: quartz, feldspars, calcite and dolomite. The principal clay minerals, about 10% of the IWI, were palygorskite, kaolinite, illite and smectite. A seasonal non-clay mineral distribution variation was noticed, being richer in quartz in the winter and richer in carbonates, especially calcite, in the summer. During dust storm episodes the amount of quartz (and also feldspar) in the dustfall increased markedly. Near basalt and volcanic tuff quarries, the predominant minerals are of the feldspar group. The origin of the quartz was found to be long range transport, whilst the other minerals are mainly of intermediate and local origin.																			0049-6979					MAR	2000	118	3-4					245	262		10.1023/A:1005167230795	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005167230795													WOS:000085478300003
J	JASSBY, AD; POWELL, TM; GOLDMAN, CR				JASSBY, AD; POWELL, TM; GOLDMAN, CR			INTERANNUAL FLUCTUATIONS IN PRIMARY PRODUCTION - DIRECT PHYSICAL EFFECTS AND THE TROPHIC CASCADE AT CASTLE LAKE, CALIFORNIA	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Direct physical effects and cascading trophic interactions operate together to determine interannual variability in the seasonal pattern of primary productivity at Castle Lake, California. Principal component analysis was used to investigate the depth-time distributions of productivity for summers 1961-1986. Two characteristic patterns were found, together accounting for 60-70% of the year-to-year variability. The first pattern corresponds to the deep productivity maximum that forms in the hypolimnion in June and July. Variability in this first pattern arises from the direct effects on phytoplankton populations of year-to-year changes in timing of ice breakup and hydraulic flushing in spring. The first pattern is unusually strong or weak, compared to the long-term average, during the phenomenon of El Nino-Southern Oscillation. A second characteristic pattern corresponds to the mixed-layer productivity maximum that develops in August and September. Variability in this second pattern arises from trophic interactions at higher levels: rainbow trout feed on late-summer Daphnia rosea populations, which in turn graze on the mixed-layer algal community. In addition, some of the variability in the rainbow trout population arises from year-to-year differences in angling pressure from humans. These results demonstrate how interannual variability in an ecosystem property (primary productivity) can be controlled by forces acting simultaneously through the top and the base of the food web.																			0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	1990	35	5					1021	1038		10.4319/lo.1990.35.5.1021	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1990.35.5.1021													WOS:A1990EE63200003
J	Frantz, A; Perga, ME; Guillard, J				Frantz, Amelie; Perga, Marie-Elodie; Guillard, Jean			Parasitic versus nutritional regulation of natural fish populations	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Although parasites are expected to affect their host's fitness, quantitative proof for impacts of parasitism on wild populations is hampered by confounding environmental factors, including dietary resource. Herein, we evaluate whether the physiological conditions of European perch (Perca fluviatilis) in three large peri-alpine lakes (Geneva, Annecy, and Bourget) depend on (a) the nutritional status of the juvenile fish, as revealed by stable isotope and fatty acid compositions, (b) the prevalence of the tapeworm Triaenophorus nodulosus, a parasite transmitted to perch through copepod preys, or (c) interactive effects of both factors. At the scale of lake populations, the deficit in growth and fat storage of juvenile perch during their first summer coincides with a high parasite prevalence and also a low quality of dietary resource. Yet, at the individual level, parasites had no evident effect on the growth of the juvenile perch, while impacts on fat storage appeared only at the highest prevalence of the most infected lake. Fatty acid and stable isotope analyses of fish tissue do not reveal any impact of T.nodulosus on diet, physiology, and feeding behaviour of fish within lakes. Overall, we found a low impact of parasitism on the physiological condition and trophic status of juvenile perch at the end of their first summer. We find instead that juvenile perch growth and fat storage, both factors tied to their winter survival, are under strong nutritional constraints. However, the coinciding nutritional constraints and parasite prevalence of perch juveniles in these three lakes may result from the indirect effect of lake nutrient concentrations, which, as a major control of zooplankton communities, simultaneously regulate both the dietary quality of fish prey and the host-parasite encounter rates.					; GUILLARD, Jean/A-2577-2011	Perga, Marie-Elodie/0000-0002-9003-0769; Guillard, Jean/0000-0003-0116-1167													2045-7758					SEP	2018	8	17					8713	8725		10.1002/ece3.4391	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.4391								30271539					WOS:000445606000007
J	Karetnikov, S; Naumenko, M				Karetnikov, Sergey; Naumenko, Mikhail			Lake Ladoga ice phenology: Mean condition and extremes during the last 65 years	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Winter conditions play an important role for the largest lake in Europe-Lake Ladoga. The ice cover lasts for 171 +/- 3 days on average from the early November until the mid-May. We investigated the ice regime of Lake Ladoga using a constructed ice database of aircraft surveys and satellite images. More than 1250 surveys of the lake's ice cover from 1943 to 2010 were collected and analysed to determine mean and extreme ice conditions for winters of different types of severity. The time series of ice cover percentage over the lake was plotted. On average, 18 observational ice charts were made every winter. Individual ice phenology records show considerable year-to-year variation. For this reason, records typically have been combined and analysed as groups (categories). Extremely cold winters were determined as winters with complete ice cover that lasts more than three months which is approximately 90% quartiles from all winters with complete ice cover. The lake surface was completely covered with ice for more than three months during 5 seasons. Extremely warm winters when the maximum ice cover was less than 70% of the lake area occurred during 5 seasons as well. A basic relationship between the winter severity as winter maximum of accumulated freezing degree-days (AFDD) and the earlier derived Relative Ice Cover Index (RICI) was established. We have used teleconnection indices such as North Atlantic Oscillations (NAO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO) for the period from October to May for estimation of different types of Lake Ladoga's ice conditions. The AO index in winter months and local winter maximum of AFDD explained much of the interannual variation in ice cover. Copyright. (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Vandersteen, W; Biro, P; Harris, L; Devlin, R				Vandersteen, Wendy; Biro, Pete; Harris, Les; Devlin, Robert			Introgression of domesticated alleles into a wild trout genotype and the impact on seasonal survival in natural lakes	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS												We tested the fitness consequences of introgression of fast-growing domesticated fish into a wild population. Fry from wild and domesticated rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) crosses, F1 hybrids, and first- and second-generation backcrosses were released into two natural lakes. Parentage analysis using microsatellite loci facilitated the identification of survivors, so fitness was estimated in nature from the first-feeding stage. Results indicated that under certain conditions, domesticated fish survived at least as well as wild fish within the same environment. Relative growth and survival of the crosses, however, were highly dependent on environment. During the first summer, fastest-growing crosses had the highest survival, but this trend was reversed after one winter and another summer. Although the F1 hybrids showed evidence of outbreeding depression because of the disruption of local adaptation, there was little evidence of outbreeding depression in the backcrosses, and the second-generation backcrosses exhibited a wild-type phenotype. This information is relevant for assessing the multigenerational risk of escaped or released domesticated fish should they successfully interbreed with wild populations and provides information on how to minimize detrimental impacts of a conservation breeding and/or management programme. These data also further understanding of the selection pressures in nature that maintain submaximal rates of growth.

J	McGlone, MS; Moar, NT				McGlone, MS; Moar, NT			Dryland Holocene vegetation history, Central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin, South Island, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Pollen and charcoal analyses are presented from three south-central South Island Holocene age deposits. A spring bog site in the Idaburn Valley records small-leaved Olearia scrub and grassland in its immediate vicinity from c. 7100 yr B.P., when peat growth began, to 5000 yr B.P. After that date the valley bottom vegetation became increasingly short and open, and the bog ceased growing, probably as a result of increasingly droughty summers. The adjacent hilly country supported a forest/scrub cover of Podocarpus hallii, Phyllocladus alpinus, Halocarpus bidwillii, and small-leaved shrubs. A site in the Mackenzie Basin near Lake Pukaki recorded near total dominance by Phyllocladus alpinus scrub from c. 8000 yr B.P. until 5000 yr B.P. after which time Halocarpus bidwillii, Aciphylla, and grassland became increasingly important in response to drought and local fires. At a third site, again in the Mackenzie Basin, Halocarpus bidwillii formed a complete scrub cover at the time of Maori settlement at about 800-600 yr B.P. but fire then rapidly reduced the scrub to grassland. On the evidence of these and other southern South Island vegetation history records, the early Holocene appears to have had a relatively stable climate with moist summers. From 5000 yr B.P. on, evidence for drought and fire point to drier summers and unstable, ENSO-affected climates.																			0028-825X					MAR	1998	36	1					91	111																WOS:000073488900008
J	KING, RD; TYLER, PA				KING, RD; TYLER, PA			LIMNOLOGY OF PERCHED LAKE, SOUTHWEST TASMANIA	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Perched Lake is one of the few lakes of lowland parts of southwest Tasmania. It is a warm monomictic lake, stratifying for 7-8 mo. each summer and, unlike most other bodies of standing water in the southwest, is only moderately dystrophic. O2 concentrations of the hypolimnion decline late in the stratification period but do not fall below 20% saturation, indicating low area productivity. Though only moderately dystrophic, there is sufficient organic color to cause marked attenuation of photosynthetically active radiation, particularly in the blue wavelengths. Its water chemistry is that of dilute sea water. Certain thermal and chemical anomalies are possibly explained by subsurface inflows of artesian water. The plankton of Perched Lake is dominated by chrysophytes and chlorophytes, with no well-defined seasonal change of biomass or species composition. An unusual dinoflagellate with marine affinities, probably Phalacroma sp., occurs in the lake.																			0067-1940						1981	32	4					501	515																WOS:A1981MM64300003

The initial colonization of periphyton on natural and artificial apices of Myriophyllum heterophyllum Michx was compared at three depths in the littoral zone of Lake Winnipesaukee, a soft-water New England [USA] lake. After a 1 week incubation period, the apices were sampled and the periphyton was removed and counted as numbers of periphyton organisms per centimetre of stem. 2. Initial colonization on both substrates was characterized by diatoms, particularly small single-celled species, throughout the spring and summer. Blue-green and green algae occurred in low numbers on both substrates during mid-summer, usually forming a greater percentage of the population of the natural apices. Blooms of the green alga Zygnema sp. dominated both substrates in late August. 3. Community composition generally did not differ significantly by depth or substrate on the natural and artificial apices; however, total abundance was significantly greater on the natural apices. M. heterophyllum appeared to serve as a neutral substrate in terms of community composition but had a positive effect on the total numbers of algae.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				OCT	1986	16	5					685	694		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1986.tb01010.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1986.tb01010.x													WOS:A1986E407900010

Natural and human-induced environmental change in southern Albania for the last 300 years - Constraints from the Lake Butrint sedimentary record	GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE												A sediment core from Lake Butrint in southwestern Albania contains an annually-layered sequence covering the last similar to 300 years. It provides thus an exceptionally well-dated time series to study past climate-driven environmental changes, as well as anthropogenic perturbations along the coast of the Ionian Sea. The varves are composed of organic-rich carbonate couplets and detritus-dominated clay layers. The first are deposited during spring-to-fall, and reflect the chemistry of the lake, which, in turn, is sensitive to 1) the relative importance of marine versus freshwater inputs, 2) relative evaporation rates, and 3) the productivity cycle within the lake. The detrital laminae are deposited during winter, reflecting precipitation and runoff conditions during the wet season. A 2-3 parts per thousand stable carbon isotope ratio shift in both bulk organics and authigenic carbonates was attributed to increasing eutrophication towards the end of the 20th century, and validated by historical and instrumental data. An increase in the delta O-18 of authigenic carbonates by more than 8 parts per thousand indicates the progressive salinization of the lake, which can primarily be attributed to man-made perturbations that reduced the freshwater input to the lake and/or enhanced the exchange with seawater from the nearby Ionian Sea. A recent increase in the relative evaporation versus precipitation rates may have additionally contributed to the observed O-18 enrichment in the Lake Butrint carbonates. The interdecadal cyclicity in the thickness of the detrital laminae seems to be at least partially controlled by NAO and/or ENSO-like phenomena that modulate precipitation patterns in the eastern Mediterranean. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential of combining microstratigraphic and stable isotopic tools to disentangle anthropogenic and natural environmental changes in Lake Butrint, validated by historical records.

Ciliate abundances peaked in spring (May) and in late summer (July, August) reaching values up to 191.1 x 10(3) cells/l. The biomass maxima did not coincide with maximum abundances and were tied with the mass occurrences of large-sized carnivorous species. Ciliates accounted for 50 to 64% of the zooplankton biomass (in 1995 and 1996, respectively). Oligotrichs, haptorids, scuticociliates and prostomatids dominated the community of ciliates.

J	JENSEN, JW; BERG, T				JENSEN, JW; BERG, T			THE ANNUAL GROWTH-RATE CYCLE OF BROWN TROUT	PROGRESSIVE FISH-CULTURIST												Growth of age-0 and age-1 brown trout (Salmo trutta) was studied at a Norwegian hatchery situated at latitude 63 degrees N. The fish were fed pelleted food and exposed to the temperature cycles of that latitude. The weight distributions of the hatchery brown trout differed from those of a wild population by being skewed to the right and by having much wider ranges at comparable mean weights. A temperature of 3.5 degrees C was found to be the minimum for growth. The optimum temperature was 15 degrees C or higher. The maximum size-independent growth rates in weight of age-0 and age-1 brown trout were 4.24% per day and 5.80% per day, respectively. At given temperatures, the age-0 fish initially grew more slowly than age-1 fish but reached the growth level of the age-1 brown trout after 5 months. Growth rates were higher in spring than at corresponding temperatures in autumn. At particular temperatures, the age-1 brown trout had twice the growth rates previously found for brown trout fed to satiation, but less than half the rates recorded for some Norwegian lake brown trout populations. The growth rates of the age-1 brown trout, when the initial autumn temperature decrease is ignored, were strongly related to temperature below the optimum, as demonstrated by a logarithmic equation. Equations are also presented for the growth of age-0 fish and the known maximum growth of brown trout.																			0033-0779					JUL	1995	57	3					231	237		10.1577/1548-8640(1995)057<0231:TAGRCO>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8640(1995)057<0231:TAGRCO>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1995RJ68300010

Stickleback appeared along shore in relatively low numbers prior to mid-April and most were between 30-59 mm long. Following spawning in June and July, initially stickleback were smaller, but as fish of the year became more available, both the number and average size of stickleback increased. They were absent in the littoral zone by Nov., but their presence in the pelagic zone in winter could not be established. Over the diel cycle the large individuals apparently move offshore during the day. The populations in the 2 yr did not differ greatly in size. In each of the 2 yr stickleback had a wide but similar diet. They fed predominantly on 2 cladocerans (Holopedium gibberum, Bosmina coregoni), 2 copepods (Epischura nevadensis, Diaptomus oregonensis) and a cyclopoid copepod (Cyclops bicuspidatus). Larvae and pupae of the family Chironomidae were also of some importance. Other food items, of minor importance, included harpacticoid copepods, insects, pelecypods, ostracods, acarids, Araneida, planaria, Odonata and fish. Variations in diet in relation to season, size and sexual mautrity of stickleback, and time of day were observed. The daily ratio for stickleback was estimated to be 6.55% of their body weight in July and 7.80% in Oct. Stickleback and juvenile sockeye salmon in the littoral zone exhibited considerable dietary overlap, especially during the late spring and summer. Since sockeye salmon in this zone are relatively few in number, and stickleback do not inhabit the limnetic zone, serious interspecific competition for food in the lake is probably lacking, especially in years of abundant food supply.																			0090-0656	1937-4518					1976	74	3					647	668																WOS:A1976CH88300012
J	Schmid, M; Köster, O				Schmid, M.; Koster, O.			Excess warming of a Central European lake driven by solar brightening	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Recent trends in summer surface temperatures of many lakes exceed the corresponding air temperature trends. This disagrees with expectations from lake surface heat budgets, which predict that lake surface temperatures should increase by 75-90% of the increase in air temperatures. Here we investigate the causes for this excess warming for Lower Lake Zurich, a representative deep and stratified Central European lake, by a combined data analysis and modeling approach. Lake temperatures are simulated using a one-dimensional vertical model driven by 33 years of homogenized meteorological data. The model is calibrated and validated using an equally long time series of monthly water temperature profiles. The effects of individual forcing parameters are investigated by scenarios where the trends of single variables are retained while those of all other forcing variables are removed. The results show that approximate to 60% of the observed warming of spring and summer lake surface temperatures were caused by increased air temperature and approximate to 40% by increased solar radiation. The effects of the trends of all other forcing variables were small. Following projections of climate models, the increasing trends in solar radiation, and consequently the excess warming of lake surface temperatures, are not likely to continue in the future.					; Schmid, Martin/C-3953-2009	Koester, Oliver/0009-0005-7517-3023; Schmid, Martin/0000-0001-8699-5691													0043-1397	1944-7973				OCT	2016	52	10					8103	8116		10.1002/2016WR018651	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016WR018651													WOS:000388493400032

Carbon-based food web models were used to investigate the effects of chytrids during the spring diatom bloom in Lake Pavin (oligo-mesotrophic) and the autumn cyanobacteria bloom in Lake Aydat (eutrophic). Linear inverse modeling was employed to estimate undetermined flows in both lakes. The Monte Carlo Markov chain linear inverse modeling procedure provided estimates of the ranges of model-derived fluxes. Model results confirm recent theories on the impact of parasites on food web function through grazers and recyclers. During blooms of "inedible" algae (unexploited by planktonic herbivores), the epidemic growth of chytrids channeled 19-20% of the primary production in both lakes through the production of grazer exploitable zoospores. The parasitic throughput represented 50% and 57% of the zooplankton diet, respectively, in the oligo-mesotrophic and in the eutrophic lakes. Parasites also affected ecological network properties such as longer carbon path lengths and loop strength, and contributed to increase the stability of the aquatic food web, notably in the oligo-mesotrophic Lake Pavin.					; Sime-Ngando, Télesphore/M-4134-2019; Niquil, Nathalie/N-2561-2013; Niquil, Nathalie/C-8233-2009; GRAMI, Boutheina/MBV-6366-2025	Rasconi, Serena/0000-0001-6667-8904; GRAMI, Boutheina/0000-0001-5537-4817; Niquil, Nathalie/0000-0002-0772-754X; Sime-Ngando, Telesphore/0000-0002-7240-5803; 													1664-302X					MAY 23	2014	5								229	10.3389/fmicb.2014.00229	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00229								24904543					WOS:000336656400001

Leann; Li, Ireyena			NORTHERN SAW-WHET OWL: REGIONAL PATTERNS FOR FALL MIGRATION AND DEMOGRAPHICS REVEALED BY BANDING DATA	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												We describe attributes of Northern Saw-whet Owls (Aegolius acadicus) during fall migration using 167,774 records from the U.S. Bird Banding Laboratory for central and eastern North America from 1929-2010. We describe movement among 18 geographic regions using records of 1,444 birds captured and recaptured between 1 September and 31 December of the same year. These data show little exchange between western Lake Superior and eastern North America. The direction of movement within a region was strongly influenced by large water bodies, varied greatly among regions, and showed high dispersal in the absence of shorelines of large water bodies. We used recent banding data to analyze population demographics from northwestern Minnesota to the coast of Maine in the north, and from southern Minnesota and southern Wisconsin to southern Appalachia and the mid-Atlantic coastal region in eastern United States. The weighted mean proportion of Hatch Year (HY) birds declined significantly from 63% in northwestern Minnesota to 42% in southern Minnesota/southern Wisconsin and from 70% in northern Ontario to 48% in southern Appalachia. Annual variation in the proportion of HY birds showed little correlation between eastern and central origin sites but moderate correlation within each of these regions. We define irruptions as years when the proportion of HY birds is 15% or greater than the weighted mean for each site, a level that occurs once in 4 years on average but at irregular intervals. We determined a very high correlation between the proportion of HY birds banded in northeast of Lake Ontario and the abundance of small mammals, suggesting a close relationship between food supply and reproductive success.																			1559-4491	1938-5447				JUN	2014	126	2					305	320		10.1676/13-011.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/13-011.1													WOS:000338975600012

There were three OCP hotspots in the sediment, mainly caused by the transportation of lindane and dicofol from adjacent Swan Lake and Guhe River. Waterborne OCP levels were highest in winter and lowest in spring, without vertical variability, suggesting that the Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass was governing the spatio-temporal distribution of OCPs in seawater. There was substantial accumulation of HCHs and DDTs in organisms via sediment, as indicated by the relatively low fraction of sedimental fugacity, high bio-sediment accumulation factor, and a positive linear correlation between log Sigma HCHs and trophic level. This is the first study that has focused on the accumulation of OCPs in entire sediment-seawater-organism system involving multi-phyla of species.

The main driving factors of water quality evolution trends are the increasing pollutant loads and hydrological regime alterations. The water levels in the lake have declined, which led to the shortening of the limnetic faces period of the lake. The seasonal allocations of basin inflow and lake outflow have also been altered mildly by some hydraulic facilities in the basin. To study the impacts of changing hydrological regime on water quality, a two-dimensional depth-averaged model for hydrodynamics and water quality is set up, validated, and applied to simulate two hydrological processes before and after Three Gorges Reservoir as 1956-2002 and 2003-2015 scenarios. The results reveal that water quality in lake are mainly determined by the pollutant loads and are influenced by the hydrological regime particularly in spring and autumn. The hydrological regime changes of Poyang Lake have resulted in 10.6 and 11.7% increases in TN concentrations associate with 12.4 and 13.6% increases in TP concentrations during the periods of April-May and September-October.

Revealing organic carbon-nitrate linear relationship from UV spectra of freshwaters in agricultural environment	CHEMOSPHERE												A strong non linear relationship between nitrate and organic matter (assessed by dissolved organic carbon, DOC) has been recently demonstrated by Taylor and Townsend (2010), namely for freshwaters. In this context, our study explores this relation from the behavior of sets of normalized UV spectra (same area under each spectrum) of different water samples showing a hidden isosbestic point (HIP) around 225 nm. This HIP is linked to the existence of a simple relation between nitrate and DOC, the proportions of which vary according to the sampling location and environmental factors. In a second step, a simple linear model is proposed for nitrate-DOC relationship (alpha-NO3 + beta.DOC = 1) and a validation is proposed for more than 150 samples of different Brittany rivers and lakes. For samples of the largest watershed, a complementary exploitation from data acquired during the different campaigns confirmed the seasonal evolution between spring (high nitrate/low DOC) and autumn (high DOC/low nitrate). Further investigation on other freshwater samples is needed in order to improve the limits of this linear model. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Organic matter (OM)-rich thermokarst lakes are characteristic features of the permafrost landscape in this region, where monomethylmercury (MMHg) production can be enhanced, as this process is mainly carried out by prokaryotes. To better understand the complex Hg biogeochemical cycle, two distinct thermokarst lakes (SAS 1A and SAS 2A) in sporadic permafrost in the Sasapimakwananistikw (SAS) River Valley, Canadian Subarctic, were sampled during winter and summer of 2022. Water column analysis showed no seasonal variation in total Hg (THg) and MMHg concentrations in SAS 2A but significantly higher THg and MMHg in winter in SAS 1A. Biogeochemical parameters affecting the activity of known methylating communities drive both inter-lake and seasonal variations in the water column. Strong correlations between MMHg and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were found, with SAS 1A showing almost seven times more MMHg variability with DOC than SAS 2A. This difference is potentially linked to variations in OM composition between the sites. The lakes showed high THg seasonality in sediments, with higher concentrations in winter. In contrast, no seasonal variation was observed in MMHg concentrations with SAS 1A exhibiting higher values. Different divalent mercury (Hg(II)) bioavailability might explain these differences. By conducting incubation experiments with isotope-enriched Hg in the sediment, the important role of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the methylation process was revealed. This study highlights the complexity of thermokarst lakes which are increasing in Northern landscapes and might be hotspots for MMHg formation.

J	Ladyman, M; Bradshaw, D; Bradshaw, F				Ladyman, Mitchell; Bradshaw, Don; Bradshaw, Felicity			Physiological and hormonal control of thermal depression in the tiger snake, Notechis scutatus	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY												Plasma sodium concentrations in field-caught Western tiger snakes, Notechis scutatus, from semi-arid Carnac Island (CI) varied seasonally, with snakes exhibiting significant hypernatraemia during summer and normal concentrations following autumn rain. In contrast, field-caught tiger snakes from a perennial fresh-water swamp (Herdsman Lake, HL) exhibited no significant increase in plasma sodium concentrations during summer. Laboratory-induced hypernatraemia caused thermal depression in both populations; there was a weak negative relationship between plasma sodium concentration and temperature selection that was significant for CI snakes. Hypernatraemia significantly elevated circulating concentrations of the neuropeptide arginine vasotocin (AVT) in both CI and HL snakes. CI snakes injected with a physiological dosage of AVT also evidenced thermal depression. Despite the positive correlation between AVT and both plasma sodium concentration and osmolality for laboratory snakes, field samples from CI snakes indicate that circulating levels of AVT may be influenced more by plasma osmolality than sodium levels. The data suggest that, in CI snakes, chronic dehydration in the field leads to hypernatraemia which may lead to elevated levels of AVT if plasma osmolality also increases. This will in turn invoke a depression in thermal behaviour that may improve the water economy and survival of snakes on semi-arid CI. Although HL snakes do not experience seasonal dehydration, physiological changes away from the stable homeostatic state appear to prompt the same behavioural shifts, illustrating the intrinsic nature of the thermal behaviour in different populations of the same species of snake.																			0174-1578					AUG	2006	176	6					547	557		10.1007/s00360-006-0077-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00360-006-0077-8								16520994					WOS:000239021900007

J	Effler, SW; Matthews, DA				Effler, Steven W.; Matthews, David A.			Implications of redox processes for the rehabilitation of an urban lake, Onondaga Lake, New York	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												A synthesis of the impacts of domestic and industrial wastes on oxygen resources and redox conditions of polluted Onondaga Lake, Syracuse, N.Y., is presented based on a long-term (1978-2005) monitoring program. Insights from this retrospective analysis are used to evaluate management alternatives for the remediation of oxygen resources and redox conditions. Reduced byproducts of anaerobic metabolism accumulated annually in the hypolimnion, causing low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations in the upper waters during fall turnover. The high natural sulfate (SO(4)(2-)) concentration of the lake promoted DO depletion and the production of methylmercury (CH(3)Hg(+)). Severe depletions of DO occurred annually in the upper waters during fall mixing, representing violations of water quality standards for extended intervals from 1978 to 1996. Depletions of DO during fall were less severe from 1997 to 2004. The improvement is reported to be in response to: ( 1) more routine occurrence of spring turnover following closure of an industry; ( 2) reduction in primary productivity; ( 3) return of large bodied Daphnia from closure of the industry; ( 4) satisfaction of historic debt from earlier higher primary production levels; and (5) year-round nitrification at a contributing domestic wastewater facility. Additional improvements in oxygen resources and decreases in SO(4)(2-) reduction are anticipated based on mandated future upgrades of phosphorus and ammonia treatment at the wastewater facility. Prevailing DO conditions during fall turnover, particularly within the context of anticipated improvements from the mandated upgrades, indicate hypolimnetic aeration or oxygenation is not required to meet water quality goals. Amendments to the hypolimnetic pool of NO(3)(-) are recommended instead of aeration or oxygenation to inhibit production of CH(3)Hg(+) by SO(4)(2-) reducing bacteria.																			1040-2381						2008	24	2					122	138		10.1080/07438140809354056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438140809354056													WOS:000269666100003

A plague of waterfleas (Bythotrephes): impacts on microcrustacean community structure, seasonal biomass, and secondary production in a large inland-lake complex	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												The spiny cladoceran (Bythotrephes longimanus) is an invasive, predaceous zooplankter that is expanding from Great Lakes coastal waters into inland lakes within a northern latitudinal band. In a large, Boundary Water lake complex (largely within Voyageurs National Park), we use two comparisons, a 2-year spatial and a 12-year temporal, to quantify seasonal impacts on food webs and biomass, plus a preliminary calculation of secondary production decline. Bythotrephes alters the seasonal biomass pattern by severely depressing microcrustaceans during summer and early fall, when the predator is most abundant. Cladoceran and cyclopoid copepods suffer the most serious population declines, although the resistant cladoceran Holopedium is favored in spatial comparisons. Microcrustacean biomass is reduced 40-60 % and secondary production declines by about 67 %. The microcrustacean community shifts towards calanoid copepods. The decline in secondary production is due both to summer biomass loss and to the longer generation times of calanoid copepods (slower turnover). The Bythotrephes "top-down" perturbation appears to hold across small, intermediate, and large-sized lakes (i.e. appears scale-independent), and is pronounced when Bythotrephes densities reach 20-40 individuals L-1. Induction tests with small cladocerans (Bosmina) suggest that certain native prey populations do not sense the exotic predator and are "blind-sided". Failure of prey to deploy defenses could explain the disproportionate community impacts in New World versus Old World lakes.																			1387-3547	1573-1464				APR	2016	18	4					1121	1145		10.1007/s10530-015-1050-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-015-1050-9													WOS:000373225700015

In the late larval stage, the T. akamusi population did not change significantly from spring until autumn because the larvae were aestivating in a deeper layer of the sediment but a large decrease in number was observed during the adult emergence period from Oct.-Nov. Estimated emergence, mortality due to predation, and survival on numerical basis was 7-11%, 45-51% and 30-45%, respectively. Predation by benthic species, i.e., goby, Tridentiger obscurus and freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium nipponense estimated by field and laboratory observations, was 11-12% of the number of larvae before emergence. Surviving mature larvae which did not pupate might emerge after 1 yr.

Understanding the characteristics of spatial-temporal variation on WT in the river continuum will help to develop the rational river-water-resource utilization plan, to avoid the possible ecology crisis, and to take full advantages of the natural resources in the involved region. As the biggest international river continuum in Asia, the Lancang-Mekong river subregion (known as Greater Mekong Subregion, GMS) has become a famous economic, political, and ecological natural territory. This study examined the spatial-temporal distribution characteristics of the Lancang River water. temperature, using the observational data of WT values from 11 hydrological stations in 1960s. Furthermore, the WT differences between Yunjinghong hydrological station (one representative station in China) and Chiang Saen hydrological station (one representative station in Thailand) were analyzed. Results indicated that: 1) Water temperature was higher in the lower part of the river continuum than the upper part. Latitude variation is the main influencing factor. This effect is more obvious in dry season than in rainy season, more obvious in winter than in summer, and more obvious of the average minimum WT than the average maximum WT, 2) WT difference between the upper and the lower parts of the river continuum was decreasing due to little increase of WT in the upper part (Yunjinghong hydrological station) and obvious decrease of the WT in the lower part (Chiang Saen hydrological station) during the research period. Therefore, the parameters of WT are affected by the latitude, and the Lancang-Mekong river continuum lies in the north-south direction, so the tropical aquatic creatures, such as the tropical aquatic fishes, cannot survive in the upper part of this river continuum in winter season, while in summer season, the tropical aquatic creatures properly swim to the upper stream. The water temperature in the lower Mekong River is mainly influenced by the regional water temperature and regional climate change.

We summarize the latest findings and point out that further research should be conducted to investigate the possibility of abundant ancient carbon emission from thermokarst lakes under climate warming and quantify the contribution of ice-melt CH4 emission from northern lakes on a large scale.																			2523-3963	2523-3971				DEC	2021	3	12							883	10.1007/s42452-021-04869-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42452-021-04869-x													WOS:000722225200003

To obtain a continuous records of Ebinur Lake area change, this study identified its lake areas by synthesizing Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) based on EOS/MODIS satellite data from 2000 to 2007. This study showed that the area of Ebinur Lake decreased from 2000 to 2001, and subsequently increased in the next two years till the peaks in 2003, at last it lowly decreased from 2004 to 2007. Seasonally, the lake surface area was larger in spring than in summer. According to the analysis of the water resource bulletin in Bortala Autonomous Prefecture, the result showed that Ebinur Lake was significantly affected by global climatic change and human activities.																					978-1-84626-174-9				2009							200	203																WOS:000268886700049

According to its physical and chemical factors, this lake is oligotrophic, has a monomictic temperate with winter circulation and thermal stratification in summer. Transparency is high (11-17 m, Secchi disk). The main nutrients were low and vertically homogeneous in both years of the study. The mean concentration of nitrate was 0.212 mg L-1, phosphate 0.019 mg L-1 and the mean concentration of total phosphorus was 0.137 mg L-1. Mean chlorophyll-a concentration was low (0.246 mug L-1 in 1996 and 0.363 mug L-1 in 1997). The availability of these nutrients correlated to abundance in phytoplankton biomass. The Lake Vrana phytoplankton showed a wide biomass range, from 0.55 to 172.61 mg L-1. The cell number showed late autumnal and early spring maxima (9,834 cells L-1 in November 1997 and 9,983 cells L-1 in May 1996). The species Ceratium hirundinella (Dinophyceae) was dominant in the phytoplankton community. The other important species were Chroococcus limneticus (Cyanobacteria), Dinobryon sociale (Chrysophyceae), Cyclotella comta (Bacillariophyceae), Cosmarium abbreviatum, Oocystis lacustris, Schizochlamys gelatinosa, and Sphaerocystis schroeteri (Chlorophyceae). Zooplankton of wet weight biomass varied: 1078.57 mug L-1 (1996) and 126.24 mug L-1 (1997). Four species of copepods and three species of cladocerans were observed in the plankton of the Lake Vrana: Cyclops abyssorum "divulsus", Macrocyclops albidus, Macrocyclops distinctus, Megacyclops viridis, Daphnia longispina, Diaphanosoma brachyurum and Bosmina longirostris. Temporal distribution is characterised with maxima in May and June (1996) and February and June (1997). The abundance of zooplankton coincided with those of the phytoplankton.

J	Bitschofsky, F; Nausch, M				Bitschofsky, Franziska; Nausch, Monika			Spatial and seasonal variations in phosphorus speciation along a river in a lowland catchment (Warnow, Germany)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Losses of phosphorus (P) from arable land lead to P enrichment in surface waters and thus to eutrophication. To gain deeper insights into riverine P processing and transport, the temporal and spatial changes of P compounds along the lowland river Warnow and its tributaries were investigated. Surface water samples were taken monthly between August 2016 and August 2017 and analyzed for the four P fractions: dissolved reactive (DRP), dissolved nonreactive (DNP), particulate reactive (PRP) and particulate nonreactive (PNP) phosphorus. P-composition differed between the courses of the upper Warnow and the impounded middle Warnow clue to differences in their hydrological conditions. In the catchment of the upper course, riverine lakes were the sources of PNP and DRP during the summer and autumn. Prom the catchment of the middle course, mainly PRP and DRP had been introduced into the river. The negative relationship between PRP and the chlorophyll (Chla) concentration (rho = -0.43, p < 0.001) indicated that this P fraction is potentially bioavailable. During the rainy summer of 2017, substantially higher amounts of DRP occurred in the whole Warnow river. The potentially bioavailable P fractions (DRP, PRP, DNP) supported phytoplankton growth in the middle course, and the PNP loads increased with increasing biomass. Total phosphorus (TP) loads increased along the Warnow flow path, due to increasing discharge volume. The annual TP load of 40 t to the estuary was dominated by DRP (32%) and PNP (31%), with smaller contributions by PRP and DNP (19% and 18%, respectively). Our results demonstrate that detailed information on P fractions are helpful to understand P-cycling in rivers and its influence on eutrophication processes. This knowledge should be included in the development of effective management strategies for the improvement of water quality. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Woo, MK; Young, KL				Woo, MK; Young, KL			Hydrogeomorphology of patchy wetlands in the High Arctic, polar desert environment	WETLANDS												Patchy wetlands are commonly found in the polar desert at localities where ample water supply is available during the thawed season. These wetlands can occur on a wide range of topography, and they support more luxuriant vegetation than their surrounding areas. Snowbank wetlands are characterized by a zonation of vegetation, with increasingly rich plant coverage away from the snowbed edge. Ground-water wetlands usually occupy topographic concavities or depressions, with exfiltration of subsurface water to sustain a high water table and to provide an enrichment of nutrients. Riverine wetlands experience prolonged flooding during the peak snowmelt season, and their vascular plant cover is low owing to inundation by the cold, turbulent stream water. Lakes and ponds are associated with topographic depressions, receiving surface- and ground-water inputs from catchment areas larger than the surface extent of the water bodies. Their evaporation rates are high, but the open water season is curtailed by ice cover. Lake outflow wetlands are supported by spillage and seepage from lakes, and they maintain a relatively lush vegetation cover. Coastal wetlands form narrow strips enclosed by raised beaches, with high salinity that limits plant diversity. Strong interactions exist among the water and heat fluxes to the wetland, the vegetation, and the hydrogeomorphology. Locally enhanced water supply and shallow permafrost enable frequent saturation, augmenting nutrient enrichment and encouraging vegetation development. Slow vegetation decay in a cold environment facilitates the formation of peat. The saturated soil conditions give rise to large ground-ice content in the winter, requiring much latent heat for ground thaw in subsequent summers. This, together with the insulating properties of the organic layer, creates shallow frost tables during the summer and produces a positive feedback that maintains high water tables in the wetlands to favor plant growth.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				JUN	2003	23	2					291	309		10.1672/8-20	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/8-20													WOS:000184016200008
J	HERMAN, G				HERMAN, G			THE TIME-DEPENDENT RESPONSE OF LAKE-KINNERET TO AN APPLIED WIND STRESS AND HYDRAULIC FLOW - ADVECTION OF SUSPENDED MATTER	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The two-dimensional vertically integrated steady state circulation model of Serruya et al. (1984), which was applied to Lake Kinneret, was extended to include the time dependent response. The same homogeneous winter conditions were assumed. It was found that under calm conditions, the Jordan flow pattern was strongly perturbed by the Coriolis force and locally by the withdrawal through the National Water Carrier. The circulation pattern established by a uniform wind stress (0.065 N/m2), was found to be about two orders of magnitude larger than the Jordan flow, so that at least three days between wind events was required before the Jordan flow could be discerned. The circulation model was used in conjunction with an advection routine to compute the horizontal distribution of matter subjected to a uniform summer westerly wind and winter SE wind. It was found that under the latter conditions, the resulting water column concentrations of suspended matter closely resembled measured sediment concentrations. Finally, using a free-surface model, oscillations of the surface elevation were computed.																			0003-9136					MAR	1989	115	1					41	57																WOS:A1989U052000004

The first during summer 1979 in the North Basin, the second in the autumn of 1984 in the South Basin and the last in 1989 again in the North Basin. It is expected that analysis of the collected data in conjunction with theoretical concepts will yield conclusive findings on the driving forces and hydrodynamics of the lake. Numerical models have been applied to the lake and the results have been compared to the measurements. Some models calculate the periods and distributions of amplitude, as well as surface velocities and internal seiches. Other models calculate wind-induced water circulation. Evidence is given to the peculiarities of the North Basin and the difficulties related with the depth-width ratio and with its deep chemical stratification.																			1015-1621						1992	54	3-4					187	204		10.1007/BF00878136	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00878136													WOS:A1992KD90400002

Apart from Fig concentration, the measurement included: the pH, soluble oxygen, water saturation with oxygen, electrolytic conductivity and total hardness of water. Hg concentration varied from lake to lake, but remained at the same levels in consecutive years. It has been found that Hg concentration in the bottom zone is higher than that ill file surface zone. Significant differences were found between mean Fig concentrations in the bottom Zone both during the summer and winter stagnation.

J	Gertman, I; Hecht, A				Gertman, I; Hecht, A			The Dead Sea hydrography from 1992 to 2000	JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS												The modern hydrological regime of the Dead Sea is strongly affected by anthropogenic activity. The natural fresh water budget has changed mainly due to the drastic reduction of runoff. Since 1977, the surface level of the Dead Sea has been lowered by an average rate of about 60 cm/year and for the period from 1998 to 2000, the lowering rate has reached about 100 cm/year. As a result of the runoff reduction, the upper layer salinity of the Dead Sea has increased and the gravitational stability of the water body was diminished. Eventually, during the winter of 1978-1979, the lake waters overturned, bringing to an end the long-term stable meromictic(1) hydrological regime. The lake entered a new phase in which its hydrological regime switches between holomictic and meromictic regimes, depending on the size of the runoff into the lake (i.e. the amount of precipitation in the lake's watershed). The first holomictic period, 1979-1980, lasted for 2 months only. It was succeeded by a 4-year meromictic period (1980-1983). The second holomictic period lasted for 9 years (1983-1991). The rainy winter of 19911992 resulted in an almost 2-m sea level rise. The upper layer with a relatively low salinity was restored and a new meromictic period persisted for 4 years, until winter 1995-1996. During the last meromictic period, the hydrological regime of the Dead Sea was characterized by following long-term trends: the depth of the summer thermocline increased from 12-15 to 25-30 m; the quasi-salinity of the upper layer, initially of about 164 kg/m(3), increased rapidly at a rate of about 16-18 kg/m(3)/year; the quasi-salinity of the deep water, initially of about 235 kg/m(3), decreased slowly at a rate of about 0.08-0.10 kg/m(3)/year (for the sake of comparison, a quasi salinity of 235 kg/m(3) is the equivalent of 280parts per thousand "usual" salinity); and the winter minimal temperature of the upper layer, initially of about 16 degreesC, increased rapidly at a rate of about 2 degreesC/year. In November 1995, the latest meromictic period of the Dead Sea came to an end. During the present holomictic period, 1996-2000, the hydrological regime of the Dead Sea is also characterized by long-term trends: the quasi-salinity of the entire Dead Sea increased at a rate of about 0.5 kg/m(3)/year, with practically no decrease during the winters; the temperature of the deep water mass increased with a rate of about 0.25 degreesC/year; and the period of vertical convection of the entire water column, initially about 3 months, increased at a rate of about 1 week/year. Moreover, we observed that the temperature and salinity of the bottom layer in the deepest part of the Dead Sea raised by about 0.5- 0.6 degreesC and 0.15-0.25 kg/m(3) during each holomictic summer.

Endorheic steppe lakes are important ecosystems with significant ecological value. They play an important role in maintaining biodiversity, they provide water resources for living organisms, they serve as breeding and migration sites for various animal species, and their zooplankton communities have a key role in the trophic web of these waters. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to study the diversity of zooplankton communities in some small steppe lakes in the northern part of Kazakhstan (Pavlodar, Kostanay, North Kazakhstan, and Akmola regions), which have different environmental conditions. Sampling to study the species diversity of zooplankton in the steppe water bodies of Northern Kazakhstan was carried out from 13 areas, 12 of which are plain lakes, and 1 of which is a reservoir, and sampling was performed in 2021 and 2022 during in the spring, summer, and autumn periods. Within the research period of 2021-2022, between 6 and 36 species of zooplankton were found in small steppe lakes. A total of 92 taxa were found. Rotifers (46 taxa) were found to have the richest number of species representatives. Cladocera were represented by 21 taxa, and Copepods by 25 taxa. All studied steppe lakes in the northern part of Kazakhstan are characterized by high specificity in terms of taxonomic composition, since the similarity indices did not exceed 0.632. According to cluster analysis, the studied samples of water bodies are divided into five clusters, in which lakes with a relatively similar taxonomic composition are combined. The halophile species (e.g., Arctodiaptomus salinarus) indicate water salinization. Our results confirm the applicability of the use of zooplankton in assessing water quality and the current ecological state of aquatic ecosystems.					; Inelova, Zarina/AAT-5204-2021; Krupa, Elena/I-7537-2019; Sapargaliyeva, Nazym/AFP-6214-2022; Sharakhmetov, Sayat/JCE-4554-2023	Sharakhmetov, Sayat/0000-0001-7278-5351; Krupa, Elena/0000-0001-9401-0258; 														2073-4441				DEC	2023	15	23							4054	10.3390/w15234054	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15234054													WOS:001116457000001

More than 20 years of estimated internal phosphorus loading in polymictic, eutrophic Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												This study represents the first attempt to estimate internal phosphorus (P) loading over many years in polymictic eutrophic Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, North America's 7th largest lake. Using long-term data, internal load was quantified by several approaches in Lake Winnipeg's North and South Basins and the connecting Narrows. Internal P loading occurred almost every year in the summer and fall and perhaps under ice in the winter during the study period 1999-2012 and even before (probably as early as a decade before 1969). Several independent approaches (L-int_1, in situ estimates involving TP concentration changes, L-int_2, mass balance, and L-int_3, based on sediment P release rates and active release area) identified an appreciable loading from the sediments that is consistent with redox related processes. Mean gross internal load (L-int_2 and L-int_3) was about 1.3 times the external load for the whole lake in 1999-2012, while the net estimate (L-int_1) was 0.75 times. Internal loads varied between basins: South Basin contributed 18-23% to total internal load and the Narrows about 16-20% for approaches L-int_1 and L-int_3, while South Basin and Narrows combined contributed about 21% in the mass balance approach (L-int_2). North Basin contributed 57-79% to total internal load. Internal load from upstream sections probably affects the North Basin because of the relatively high flushing rate. The potential effect of internal load on phytoplankton and cyanobacterial biomass is highlighted by several significant positive correlations. Internal load can be expected to rise because forecasted regional climatic warming will increase sediment oxygen demand and P release. (C) 2015 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Spatial and Seasonal Variations of C, Nutrient, and Metal Concentration in Thermokarst Lakes of Western Siberia Across a Permafrost Gradient	WATER												Thermokarst lakes and ponds formed due to thawing of frozen peat in high-latitude lowlands are very dynamic and environmentally important aquatic systems that play a key role in controlling C emission to atmosphere and organic carbon (OC), nutrient, and metal lateral export to rivers and streams. However, despite the importance of thermokarst lakes in assessing biogeochemical functioning of permafrost peatlands in response to climate warming and permafrost thaw, spatial (lake size, permafrost zone) and temporal (seasonal) variations in thermokarst lake hydrochemistry remain very poorly studied. Here, we used unprecedented spatial coverage (isolated, sporadic, discontinuous, and continuous permafrost zone of the western Siberia Lowland) of 67 lakes ranging in size from 10(2)to 10(5)m(2)for sampling during three main hydrological periods of the year: spring flood, summer baseflow, and autumn time before ice-on. We demonstrate a systematic, all-season decrease in the concentration of dissolved OC (DOC) and an increase in SO4, N-NO3, and some metal (Mn, Co, Cu, Mo, Sr, U, Sb) concentration with an increase in lake surface area, depending on the type of the permafrost zone. These features are interpreted as a combination of (i) OC and organically bound metal leaching from peat at the lake shore, via abrasion and delivery of these compounds by suprapermafrost flow, and (ii) deep groundwater feeding of large lakes (especially visible in the continuous permafrost zone). Analyses of lake water chemical composition across the permafrost gradient allowed a first-order empirical prediction of lake hydrochemical changes in the case of climate warming and permafrost thaw, employing a substituting space for time scenario. The permafrost boundary shift northward may decrease the concentrations and pools of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), Li, B, Mg, K, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ni, Cu, As, Rb, Mo, Sr, Y, Zr, rare Earth elements (REEs), Th, and U by a factor of 2-5 in the continuous permafrost zone, but increase the concentrations of CH4, DOC, NH4, Cd, Sb, and Pb by a factor of 2-3. In contrast, the shift of the sporadic to isolated zone may produce a 2-5-fold decrease in CH4, DOC, NH4, Al, P, Ti, Cr, Ni, Ga, Zr, Nb, Cs, REEs, Hf, Th, and U. The exact magnitude of this response will, however, be strongly seasonally dependent, with the largest effects observable during baseflow seasons.					; Manasypov, Rinat/S-2135-2016; Pokrovsky, Oleg/C-8078-2016; Kirpotin, Sergey/E-4095-2014; Vorobyev, Sergey/J-1474-2016; Krickov, Ivan/C-9827-2017; Lim, Artyom/O-4069-2017	Vorob'ev, Sergei/0000-0003-2547-9663; Manasypov, Rinat/0000-0001-5191-2817; Lim, Artem/0000-0003-0165-4754; Pokrovsky, Oleg/0000-0002-3155-7069; Kritskov, Ivan/0000-0001-8818-0496														2073-4441				JUN	2020	12	6							1830	10.3390/w12061830	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12061830													WOS:000550762100001

Four of the campaigns were performed over seawater surface during the summer and winter of 1997 and the summer of 1998 at Kristineberg Marine Research Station (KMRS). The fifth campaign was conducted over a river surface during the summer of 1999 at Knobesholm in southwestern Sweden. The major purpose of these campaigns was to determine emissions of mercury from natural waters in northern Europe. The influence of some physical parameters, i.e. temperature in water and air, relative humidity and solar radiation were also examined. Dynamic flux chamber technique coupled with automatic mercury vapour-phase analysers (Gardis IA or Tekran 2357) was used. Both sites show net evasion during summer season, however, the surficial evasion rate of the river is more than one order of magnitude higher than that of the seawater. The high content of organic matter in the river in conjunction with strong insolation and subsequent water temperature variations may explain the high mercury evasion measured at the river site. An average evasion of +11 ng m(-2) h(-1) (varying from -2.5 to +88.9 ng m(-2) h(-1) was obtained during the course of the river measurement. At the sea site, mercury evasion was found in the interval between -2.72 and +8.84ngm(-2)h(-1) with an average evasion of +0.61 ng ms(-2) h(-1). Mercury evasion measured over both river and seawater surfaces exhibits a consistently diurnal pattern with maximum evasion during the daytime period and minimum evasion during the nighttime period. At the freshwater site, mercury evasion is strongly correlated with the intensity of net insolation, and negatively correlated with relative humidity. An exponential relationship between mercury evasion and water temperature was also observed at the freshwater measurement site. At the seawater site, a strong correlation between mercury evasion and intensity of UVA part of insolation was obtained. Insolation is speculated to play an important role in the formation of dissolved gaseous mercury in both river and seawater. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The findings highlight pronounced seasonal shifts in canyon reservoirs within the study region. During spring and summer, meanpCO2 levels were recorded at 211 mu atm, indicative of a net carbon sink, with an average areal CO2 flux (fCO2) of-5.9 mmol/m2/d. However, in autumn, pCO2 levels markedly increased to 1316 mu atm, signifying a substantial carbon source, with an average fCO2 of 42.8 mmol/m2/d. In contrast, shallow water lakes exhibited relatively stable seasonal dynamics, consistently functioning as atmospheric carbon sinks throughout the ice-free period, with a mean fCO2 of-8.76 (+/- 3.74) mmol/m2/d across all seasons. Fixed-site experiments further revealed distinct diurnal fluctuations inpCO2 across different seasons, with the most pronounced daily variation (1350 mu atm) occurring in September within reservoirs. Correlation analyses between water quality parameters and pCO2 suggest that the seasonal differences in canyon reservoirs are primarily driven by the formation and breakdown of thermal stratification. Conversely, the higher nutrient availability in shallow water lakes appears to enhance CO2 uptake from the atmosphere. Additionally, diurnal pCO2 fluctuations are largely governed by variations in surface water photosynthetic activity, modulated by solar radiation. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating both stratified and mixed periods into sampling protocols, with an emphasis measurements between 10:00 and 12:00 pm, to improve the accuracy of CO2 flux assessments. This study advances the understanding of carbon cycling in temperate lakes and reservoirs and contributes to reducing uncertainties in future carbon budget estimations.

Temperature estimates, derived from the best analogue technique, indicate a cooling trend, between 14 500 and 12 600 calendar years before present (cal yr B.P.) of 4 degrees C in summer and 8 degrees C in winter preceding the Younger Dryas event. The intense warming following the Younger Dryas stadial corresponds to increasing values of the same magnitude in 600 yr. A cooling event, weaker than the Younger Dryas, of 1 degrees C in both seasons is recorded between 8000 and 8500 cal yr B.P. These reconstructions from a European Holocene continental sequence are in agreement,vith fluctuations already described in North Atlantic and Mediterranean cores, ice cores, and African and Tibetan lake records.

We emphasize lakes and quantitative implications. The region is warmer and wetter than it has been over most of the last 12000 years. Since 1911 observed air temperatures have increased by about 0.11 degrees C per decade in spring and 0.06 degrees C in winter; annual precipitation has increased by about 2.1% per decade. Ice thaw phenologies since the 1850s indicate a late winter warming of about 2.5 degrees C. In future scenarios for a doubled CO2 climate, air temperature increases in summer and winter and precipitation decreases (summer) in western Ontario but increases (winter) in western Ontario, northern Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. Such changes in climate have altered and would further alter hydrological and other physical features of lakes. Warmer climates, i.e. 2 x CO2 climates, would lower net basin water supplies, stream flows and water levels owing to increased evaporation in excess of precipitation. Water levels have been responsive to drought and future scenarios for the Great Lakes simulate levels 0.2 to 2.5 m lower. Human adaptation to such changes is expensive. Warmer climates would decrease the spatial extent of ice cover on the Great Lakes; small lakes, especially to the south, would no longer freeze over every year. Temperature simulations for stratified lakes are 1-7 degrees C warmer for surface waters, and 6 degrees C cooler to 8 degrees C warmer for deep waters. Thermocline depth would change (4 m shallower to 3.5 m deeper) with warmer climates alone; deepening owing to increases in light penetration would occur with reduced input of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) from dryer catchments. Dissolved oxygen would decrease below the thermocline. These physical changes would in turn affect the phytoplankton, zooplankton, benthos and fishes. Annual phytoplankton production may increase but many complex reactions of the phytoplankton community to altered temperatures, thermocline depths, light penetrations and nutrient inputs would be expected. Zooplankton biomass would increase, but, again, many complex interactions are expected. Generally, the thermal habitat for warm-, cool- and even cold-water fishes would increase in size in deep stratified lakes, but would decrease in shallow unstratified lakes and in streams. Less dissolved oxygen below the thermocline of lakes would further degrade stratified lakes for cold water fishes. Growth and production would increase for fishes that are now in thermal environments cooler than their optimum but decrease for those that are at or above their optimum, provided they cannot move to a deeper or headwater thermal refuge. The zoogeographical boundary for fish species could move north by 500-600 km; invasions of warmer water fishes and extirpations of colder water fishes should increase. Aquatic ecosystems across the region do not necessarily exhibit coherent responses to climate changes and variability, even if they are in close proximity. Lakes, wetlands and streams respond differently, as do fakes of different depth or productivity. Differences in hydrology and the position in the hydrological flow system, in terrestrial vegetation and land use, in base climates and in the aquatic biota can all cause different responses. Climate change effects interact strongly with effects of other human-caused stresses such as eutrophication, acid precipitation, toxic chemicals and the spread of exotic organisms. Aquatic ecological systems in the region are sensitive to climate change and variation. Assessments of these potential effects are in an early stage and contain many uncertainties in the models and properties of aquatic ecological systems and of the climate system.

We estimated the effects of two experimental flows, fall-timed floods and elimination of sub-daily variation in flows on weekends, on growth rates of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the Colorado River downstream from Glen Canyon Dam. Experimental flow effects were compared to effects of water temperature, phosphorous concentration, solar insolation, and competition, by fitting mixed effect von Bertalanffy models to similar to 10 000 observations of growth from mark-recapture between 2012 and 2021. There was strong support for models predicting faster growth during intervals with higher solar insolation, and lower water temperature and competition for prey. Effects of phosphorus and experimental flows were small and uncertain. Drought -related increases in dam release temperatures during summer and fall were predicted to result in severe weight loss for larger trout and could eventually threaten the viability of the population and the fishery it supports. The effects of water temperature and competition on fish growth substantially exceeded the effects of controlled floods and steadier flows.

J	Zhang, YC; Hu, MQ; Shi, K; Zhang, M; Han, T; Lai, L; Zhan, PF				Zhang, Yuchao; Hu, Minqi; Shi, Kun; Zhang, Min; Han, Tao; Lai, Lai; Zhan, Pengfei			Sensitivity of phytoplankton to climatic factors in a large shallow lake revealed by column-integrated algal biomass from long-term satellite observations	WATER RESEARCH												There are some uncertainties of using chlorophyll a (Chla) concentrations in water surface to address phytoplankton dynamics, especially in large shallow lakes, because of the dramatic vertical migration of phytoplankton. The column-integrated algal biomass (CAB) can reflect the whole water column information, so it is considered as a better indicator for phytoplankton total biomass. An algal biomass index (ABI) and an empirical algorithm were proposed previously to measure algal biomass inside and outside euphotic zone from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data. A long-term CAB time series was generated in this study to clarify the temporal and spatial changes in phytoplankton and address its sensitivity to climatic factors in Lake Chaohu, a shallow eutrophic lake in China, from 2000 to 2018. Overall, the CAB for Lake Chaohu showed significant temporal and spatial dynamics. Temporally, the annual average CAB (total CBA within the whole lake) was increased at rate of 0.569 t Chla/y, ranging from 62.06 +/- 8.89 t Chla to 76.03 +/- 10.01 t Chla during the 19-year period. Seasonal and periodic variations in total CAB presented a bimodal annual cycle every year, the total CAB was highest in summer, followed by that in autumn, and it was the lowest in winter. The pixel-based CAB (total CAB of a unit water column), ranging from 112.42 to 166.85 mg Chla, was the highest in the western segment, especially its northern part, and was the lowest in the central parts of eastern and central segments. The sensitivity of CAB dynamics to climatic conditions was found to vary by region and time scale. Specifically, the change of pixel-based algal biomass was more sensitive to the temperature change on the monthly and annual scales, while wind speed impacted directly on the short-term spatial-temporal redistribution of algal biomass. High temperature and low wind speed could prompt the growth of total CAB for the whole lake, and the hydrodynamic situations affected by wind and so on determined the spatial details. It also indicated that Lake Chaohu may face more severe challenges with the future climatic warming. This study may serve as a reference to support algal bloom forecasting and early warning management for other large eutrophic lakes with similar problems.

We use repeat-pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques to investigate the form and flow of the FIIC. European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS-1 and ERS-2) data acquired in winter 1996 were used to form a 100 m resolution digital elevation model (DEM), which we constrained using Ice Cloud and Elevation satellite (ICESat) laser altimeter elevation measurements from 2007. This InSAR DEM was used to isolate the phase due to motion from seven ERS-tandem (1 day) pairs of SAR scenes acquired between 15 August 1995 and 7 February 1996, to produce one wintertime and two summertime velocity maps. Five of the eight major outlet glaciers draining the FIIC are marine terminating, and two terminate at a lake margin. A maximum ice velocity of 581 m yr(-1) was observed in mid-August 1995. Six of the eight major outlet glaciers exhibit seasonal velocity variations between late summer and winter, and flow speeds vary by up to 20% over a 10 day period in August 1995. Our findings show that while marine terminating glaciers flow faster than land terminating glaciers, there is no simple relationship between glacier type and seasonality of ice motion.					; Palmer, Steven/D-5170-2013	Shepherd, Andrew/0000-0002-4914-1299; Palmer, Steven/0000-0003-3977-8509; Rinne, Eero/0000-0002-4796-3387; 													2169-9003	2169-9011				DEC 21	2010	115								F04037	10.1029/2010JF001686	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2010JF001686													WOS:000285636800004
J	Forbes, V; Ledger, PM; Cretu, D; Elias, S				Forbes, Veronique; Ledger, Paul M.; Cretu, Denisa; Elias, Scott			A sub-centennial, Little Ice Age climate reconstruction using beetle subfossil data from Nunalleq, southwestern Alaska	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												There is myriad evidence that global warming is exerting a profoundly disruptive influence on the lifeways of modern native (Yup'ik) communities living in the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) delta of southwestern Alaska. Yup'ik subsistence is intimately tied to seasonal change and the ability to accurately predict the availability of plant and animal resources. It therefore seems reasonable to suggest that periods of climatic instability such as the Little Ice Age (LIA) may have had a deleterious effect on Yup'ik communities in the past. However, at present there are no palaeotemperature records that document the localised climatic changes of the last millennium in the Y-K Delta region. This lack of data hinders our understanding of the archaeological record from the site of Nunalleq, which is situated at the heart of the delta and was occupied during the LIA. To address this oversight, this paper presents the results of a Coleoptera (beetle) based climate reconstruction from a peat profile in the vicinity of Nunalleq to investigate the magnitude of Late Holocene climatic changes. Using the Mutual Climatic Range (MCR) method, we reconstruct mean summer and winter temperatures from the mid-15th to late-19th centuries. The results indicate that the past environments of Nunalleq were characterised by a climate significantly cooler than the present. The earliest definitive evidence for Little Ice Age cooling dates from the late 16th century, when mean summer temperatures were at least 1.2 degrees C below the modern mean. Temperatures appear to have remained lower than modern until the early 19th century. The coolest Nunalleq record - 1.3 degrees C below the modern mean summer temperatures - is centred on AD 1815, after which there is evidence for climatic amelioration. These data present differences with observations from other regions of Alaska and underline the importance of more local palaeoclimate reconstructions, particularly when interrogating the relationships between past climatic and social change.					; Elias, Scott/ISB-2829-2023	Forbes, Veronique/0000-0002-1302-7603; 													1040-6182	1873-4553				MAY 30	2020	549						118	129		10.1016/j.quaint.2019.07.011	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2019.07.011													WOS:000564795500002

The climate and vegetation of Marine Isotope Stage 11-Model results and proxy-based reconstructions at global and regional scale	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The climate of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11, the interglacial roughly 400,000 years ago, is investigated for four time slices, 416, 410, 400, and 396 ka. We compare results from two climate models, the earth system model of intermediate complexity CLIMBER2-LPJ and the general circulation model CCSM3, to reconstructions of MIS 11 temperature, precipitation and vegetation, mainly from terrestrial records. The overall picture is that MIS 11 was a relatively warm interglacial in comparison to preindustrial, with Northern Hemisphere (NH) summer temperatures early in MIS 11 (416-410 ka) warmer than preindustrial, though winters were cooler. Later in MIS 11, especially around 400 ka, conditions were cooler in the NH summer, mainly in the high latitudes. Climate changes simulated by the models were mainly driven by insolation changes, with the exception of two local feedbacks that amplify climate changes. Here, the NH high latitudes, where reductions in sea ice cover lead to a winter warming early in MIS 11, as well as the tropics, where monsoon changes lead to stronger climate variations than one would expect on the basis of latitudinal mean insolation change alone, are especially prominent. Both models used in this study support a northward expansion of trees at the expense of grasses in the high northern latitudes early during MIS 11, especially in northern Asia and North America, in line with the available pollen-based reconstructions. With regard to temperature and precipitation changes, there is general agreement between models and reconstructions, but reconstructed precipitation changes are often larger than those simulated by the models. The very limited number of records of sufficiently high resolution and dating quality hinders detailed comparisons between models and reconstructions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

J	Chaichana, R; Leah, R; Moss, B				Chaichana, Ratcha; Leah, Rick; Moss, Brian			Seasonal impact of waterfowl on communities of macrophytes in a shallow lake	AQUATIC BOTANY												From 2005 to 2007, we established bird-proof enclosures in a small, shallow and semi-permanent lake, lacking fish, at Brown Moss, Shropshire, UK, to investigate the effects of aquatic birds on seasonal growth of submerged and emergent macrophytes. The highest density of birds on the lake was in winter (110 individuals ha(-1)) and the lowest in summer 2005 (6 ha(-1)). Plant growth varied with season but there were significantly different (F=8.03, p<0.05, df = 1) standing crops of macrophytes between bird-proof enclosures (proportion of volume occupied, 0.47 +/- 0.04) and control treatments (0.36 +/- 0.11). Different densities of birds occurred in different areas and this was reflected in their effects. Ducks, mainly mallard (Anas platyrhynchos, Linnaeus), and teal (Anas crecca, Linnaeus), damaged plants by direct consumption, uprooting and trampling, whereas larger birds, such as mute swan (Cygnus olor, Gmelin), were able to remove Typha latifolia (Linnaeus). In summer, grazing pressure was reduced as the population of birds declined. Waterfowl caused seasonal impacts on the re-development of the water plant community. However, waterfowl herbivory had low potential to shift a macrophyte-dominated state into a phytoplankton-dominated state because aquatic plants could recover, during the growing season, when bird populations declined.

The intrastrain variability of length and width of the loricae is significantly smaller than the interstrain variability. The shells are shorter in autumn than in spring. The lorica of C. cratera consists of biogenic and non-biogenic flakes, irregularly cemented by a substance which is released from the organism. Building of the shell is not restricted to the time of binary fission. T. fluviatile and T. cylindrata have soft and sticky loricae which are heavy agglutinated by various biogenic and non-biogenic particles. The material used for lorica-building and/or agglutination depends on environment and season. There is a relationship between the structure of the lorica and the degree of eutrophication in the lake. The significance of these findings for paleolimnology and taxonomy and the function of the lorica in freshwater Tintinnina are discussed.																			0300-3256	1463-6409					1981	10	2					81	90		10.1111/j.1463-6409.1981.tb00486.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-6409.1981.tb00486.x													WOS:A1981LW08000001

This ecosystem suffers recurrent blooms of potentially toxic nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, mostly during summertime. Here we analyze environmental drivers and potential impacts of blooms of the toxic cyanobacteria Raphidiopsis raciborskii in Laguna del Sauce from 2003 to 2020, and assess its effects on governance and biomonitoring. We registered three blooms of R. raciborskii, in 2004, 2015, and 2020, the last two expressed saxitoxin (lack of toxicity information for 2004). The 2015 bloom occurred in autumn, reaching an absolute biovolume of 104 mm(3) l(-1), and had high saxitoxin concentrations (up to 9.8 mu g l(-1)) which continued to be detected even after the bloom collapsed. This was the first saxitoxin register in this ecosystem and drastically affected the drinking water supply. After this massive bloom, a monitoring program was established which continues up to date. The 2020 bloom also occurred in autumn and lasted until winter; it was of lower magnitude (up to 6.3 mm(3) l(-1)) and had lower saxitoxin concentration (up to 0.9 mu g l(-1)) compared to the 2015 bloom. Blooms of R. raciborskii were associated with a combination of persistent low water level, low water color, and high water transparency, conditions that rarely coincide in this ecosystem. Hence, the programs which started after the 2015 bloom, allowed better characterizing the environmental drivers of R. raciborskii blooms in Laguna del Sauce. Furthermore, these implied adapting the ecosystem management and water treatment strategies, and strengthening of academia-stakeholders' interactions.

J	Lohlein, B				Lohlein, B			Seasonal dynamics of aufwuchs Naididae (Oligochaeta) on Phragmites australis in a eutrophic lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA					VI International Symposium on Aquatic Oligochaetes	SEP 05-10, 1994	STROMSTAT, SWEDEN					The Oligochaeta and Aphanoneura in the aufwuchs on Phragmites australis in a eutrophic hardwater lake were studied at two sites over a period of one year, in order to elucidate the structure and dynamics of this assemblage. The naidids Chaetogaster diastrophus, Nais spp., and Stylaria lacustris dominated the assemblage at any season. At both sites these taxa showed the same distinct pattern of successive population maxima in spring and summer: Chaetogaster diastrophus reached its peak density first, followed by Nais species, and eventually by Stylaria lacustris. Differences in temporal dynamics between sites were small apart from a second Stylaria maximum which was only observed at one site. Total naidid densities reached peak values of 3.8 individuals per cm(2) reed stem surface area. With mean individual biomass of 2.2 mu g dry mass for Chaetogaster diastrophus, 13.3 mu g for Nais, and 86 mu g for Stylaria lacustris, respectively, maximum total naidid biomass on reed stems was 44 mu g dry mass per cm(2). The biomass peak occurred later than that of total naidid density because in summer larger naidids dominated the assemblage. The observed succession appears to be consistent with seasonal changes in periphytic algal communities on the reed stems.																			0018-8158					OCT 14	1996	334	1-3					115	123		10.1007/BF00017360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017360													WOS:A1996VY79600014
J	Naselli-Flores, L; Barone, R				Naselli-Flores, L; Barone, R			Steady-state assemblages in a Mediterranean hypertrophic reservoir. The role of Microcystis ecomorphological variability in maintaining an apparent equilibrium	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Lake Arancio is a hypertrophic Mediterranean man-made lake, located on the southern coast of Sicily. Its artificial origin and the climate make it a very dynamic environment, strongly characterised by very wide water-level fluctuations. These vertical water movements interfere with the thermal stability of the water body often causing the breaking of the thermocline in mid-summer. In addition, the summer level-decrease influences the nutrient dynamics and modifies the z(mix)/z(eu) ratio. All these modifications were observed to support a high environmental variability, which was reflected by the richness of its phytoplankton composition and by its dynamics. Nevertheless, an investigation carried out from March 2001 to March 2002 showed that the assemblage was strongly dominated by a few species, one by one. In particular, two different Microcystis morphotypes dominated the assemblage from mid-April till the beginning of October. The prolonged dominance of these 'species' should suggest that a steady state condition took place in Lake Arancio during spring and summer 2001. This is in contrast with previous investigations, which showed high diversity values especially occurring in the period of strong environmental instability when the continuous dewatering caused the breaking of the thermocline in the middle of summer. Nevertheless, this dominant species showed a very wide morphological variability and alternated among 'more S', 'S', and 'R' (sensu Reynolds) ecotypes. The ever-changing morphological features suggest a different ecological behaviour of the species involved. They seem to confirm that the environmental variability of Mediterranean reservoirs sustains high diversity values, even though this diversity has to be sought in the amplitude of morphological plasticity of one or a few species, rather than in the coexistence of a variety of species.

Ashraf; Nazir, Nageena			Impact of pollution load of water and sediment of Hokersar wetland on nutrient concentration and biochemical parameters of Trapa natans L.: An economically important plant species of Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir, India	ANNALS OF PHYTOMEDICINE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL												Hokersar wetland is very important for the survival of migratory birds, but during the last four decades, the topography of the wetland has drastically changed. The wetland has reduced from 1875.04 ha in 1969 to 1300 ha in 2008 due to encroachments, sediment load carried by Doodah Ganga River and extension of willow plantations. It has shrunk and depleted due to the human settlements, domestic/sewage pollution, pollution due to the addition of fertilizers, siltation due to floods, conversion into agricultural land, encroachments and unwanted growth of aquatic weeds, etc. Keeping these facts in view, present study titled "Impact of polluted water and sediment of Hokersar wetland on nutrient concentration and biochemical parameters of Trapa natans L.: An economically important plant species of Kashmir, Jammu and Kashmir, India". In T. natans highest mean NPK content (4.07 x 104 mg kg(-1), 0.35 x 10(4) mg kg(-1) and 4.47 x 10(4) mg kg(-1)) was recorded during summer season and lowest (2.85 x10(4) mg kg(-1), 0.18 x10(4) mg kg(-1) and 2.41 x10(4) mg kg(-1)) was recorded during autumn season. With respect to sites, highest mean NPK content was recorded at Inlet site (4.17 x 10(4) mg kg-1, 0.30 x 10(4) mg kg(-1), 3.99 x 10(4) mg kg(-1)) and least at Outlet site (control site). Similar was the case with heavy metal concentration, i.e., higher concentration was recorded during summer season and lowest was recorded during autumn season. With respect to sites, highest mean heavy metal content was recorded at Inlet site and least at Outlet site (control site). The high metal concentration beyond permissible limits may damage the normal metabolism of plant. Chlorophyll 'a' varied from 1.95 to 2.14 mg/kg during all three seasons. The chlorophyll 'b' content also varied from 0.253 to 0.310 mg/kg and total chlorophyll content ranged from 2.18 to 2.46 mg/kg in three different seasons. The maximum chlorophyll 'a', 'b', and total chlorophyll contents were recorded near Trapa abundance site and the minimum values were recorded at Inlet. The concentration of carotenoid varied significantly from 1.10 to 1.29 mg/kg during the entire study period. The significant increase in the above studied parameters may be attributed to high nutrient availability in the wetland because of high pollution load.																			2393-9885	2278-9839				JAN-JUN	2021	10	1					298	306		10.21276/ap.2021.10.1.32	http://dx.doi.org/10.21276/ap.2021.10.1.32													WOS:000668146000032

Leaves on the terminal shoots of 5 such clones tested in southern Michigan and northern Wisconsin had substantial leaf conductances to CO2 and photosynthetic rates (PG) during this late-season period of leaf retention. PG was high enough to suggest that autumn retention of green leaves may be an important factor contributing to the rapid growth of poplars under SRIC in this cold northern temperate area. Leaf conductances and PG declined gradually before the first hard frosts of the autumn in the northern Wisconsin experiment, indicating normal autumn leaf aging and senescence, but did not change appreciably in the southern Michigan experiment until the first hard frosts. The 1st hard frosts reduced PG and leaf conductance in most of the clones, dramatically in the northern Wisconsin experiment. Leaf conductances and PG in 2 of the clones in the southern Michigan experiment were reduced only moderately by the first hard frosts. Leaf conductance and PG exhibited generally parallel seasonal trends in both experiments.																			0300-3604	1573-9058					1982	16	3					321	333																WOS:A1982PV22000001
J	Panwar, S				Panwar, Sugandha			Vulnerability of Himalayan springs to climate change and anthropogenic impact: a review	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												The climate change and unsustainable anthropogenic modification can intensify the vulnerability of the Himalayas. Natural springs are the principal source of potable water security for the Himalayan population. The changes in the trend of precipitation, temperature and glacier melt are expected to impact the quantity and quality of spring water significantly. This review presents an insight to unravel the effects of climate change and land use land cover changes on the spring resources and outline the essential elements of spring hydrology in the Himalayas. The sensitive response of spring flow to the climate has been observed to follows an annual periodic pattern strongly dependent on snowmelt, rainfall, and evapotranspiration. Among all types, Karst aquifers were found to be highly vulnerable. The changes in the forest and urban landscapes are affecting the recharging sites in the headwater region. In the Central Himalayan region (Kosi River basin, Kumaun), the number of perennial springs is decreasing at a rate of three springs year(-1), and non-perennial springs are increasing at the rate of one spring year(-1). The high concentration of NO3-, Cl-1, SO42-, and coliform counts reported from the spring water evidence a high susceptibility of shallow aquifers to the non-point source of pollution. Future projections indicate high surface-runoff and occurrence of extreme events such as floods, glacial lake outbursts, and landslides can affect the flow and water quality of springs. As the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities are expected to increase with time remarkably, there is an urgent need to promote regional scientific studies on springs targeting hydrogeochemical evolution, vulnerability assessment, recharge area dynamics, and development of springshed management program.

J	Dean, W				Dean, W			A 1500-year record of climatic and environmental change in Elk Lake, Clearwater County, Minnesota - II: geochemistry, mineralogy, and stableisotopes	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Most of the sediment components that have accumulated in Elk Lake, Clearwater County, northwestern Minnesota, over the past 1500 years are authigenic or biogenic (CaCO3, biogenic SiO2, organic matter, iron and manganese oxyhydroxides, and iron phosphate) and are delivered to the sediment-water interface on a seasonal schedule where they are preserved as distinct annual laminae (varves). The annual biogeochemical cycles of these components are causally linked through the 'carbon pump', and are recapitulated in longer-term cycles, most prominently with a periodicity of about 400 years. Organic carbon is fixed in the epilimnion by photosynthetic removal of CO2, which also increases the pH, triggering the precipitation of CaCO3. The respiration and degradation of fixed organic carbon in the hypolimnion consumes dissolved oxygen, produces CO2, and lowers the pH so that the hypolimnion becomes anoxic and undersaturated with respect to CaCO3 during the summer. Some of the CaCO3 produced in the epilimnion is dissolved in the anoxic, lower pH hypolimnion and sediments. The amount of CaCO3 that is ultimately incorporated into the sediments is a function of how much is produced in the epilimnion and how much is consumed in the hypolimnion and the sediments. Iron, manganese, and phosphate accumulate in the anoxic hypolimnion throughout the summer. Sediment-trap studies show that at fall overturn, when iron-, manganese-, and phosphate-rich bottom waters mix with carbonate- and oxygen-rich surface waters, precipitation of iron and manganese oxyhydroxides, iron phosphate, and manganese carbonate begins and continues into the winter months. Detrital clastic material in the sediments of Elk Lake deposited over the last 1500 years is a minor component (<10% by weight) that is mostly wind-borne (eolian). Detailed analyses of the last 1500 years of the Elk Lake sediment record show distinct cycles in eolian clastic variables (e.g. aluminum, sodium, potassium, titanium, and quartz), with a periodicity of about 400 years. The 400-yr cycle in eolian clastic material does not correspond to the 400-yr cycles in redox-sensitive authigenic components, suggesting that the clastic component is responding to external forcing (wind) whereas the authigenic components are responding to internal forcing (productivity), although both may ultimately be forced by climate change. Variations in the oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of CaCO3 are small but appear to reflect small variations in ground water influx that are also driven by external forcing.																			0921-2728					APR	2002	27	3					301	319		10.1023/A:1016054522905	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1016054522905													WOS:000176505000002

The monthly data of human schistosomiasis cases in Hubei, Hunan, and Anhui provinces (lake and marshland regions) released by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) display a periodic pattern with more cases in late summer and early autumn. Based on this observation, we construct a deterministic model with periodic transmission rates to study the seasonal transmission dynamics of schistosomiasis in these lake and marshland regions in China. We calculate the basic reproduction number R-0, discuss the dynamical behavior of solutions to the model, and use the model to fit the monthly data of human schistosomiasis cases in Hubei. We also perform some sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number R-0 in terms of model parameters. Our results indicate that treatment of at-risk population groups, improving sanitation, hygiene education, and snail control are effective measures in controlling human schistosomiasis in these lakes and marshland regions.

Daily weather information recorded in old Japanese diaries can provide useful information on the historical occurrences of snowfall days. Here, this information was combined with recently recovered early daily instrumental temperature data collected during the 19th century to reconstruct the occurrence of winter monsoon outbreak days (WMDs) from the 1840s to the early 1850s in Japan. Analyses of inter-annual and intra-seasonal variations in WMDs revealed active winter monsoon outbreaks in the early 1840s. In 1840/41 and 1841/42, these synchronously occurred with extreme snow events reported in central and southern China. However, winter monsoon outbreaks were absent during the middle to late winters of the mid-1840s and 1853/1854. Freezing records of Lake Suwa in central Japan showed that it did not freeze during 1844/1845 and 1853/1854, which was in agreement with our finding of inactive winter monsoons in these years. Comparing the occurrences of WMDs with early instrumental surface pressure data revealed that WMDs were associated with the active phases of the winter monsoon, as represented by an east-west surface pressure gradient over East Asia.																			1814-9324	1814-9332				FEB 25	2022	18	2					327	339		10.5194/cp-18-327-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-18-327-2022													WOS:000763311600001
J	Outridge, PM				Outridge, PM			Lead biogeochemistry in the littoral zones of south-central Ontario lakes, Canada, after the elimination of gasoline lead additives	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Stable Pb isotope ratios were used to trace the sources and pathways of Pb between the atmosphere, surficial sediment fractions, the white water-lily Nymphaea odorata, and waters collected at 26 littoral sites in 23 Ontario lakes in summer 1993, three years after alkyl Pb additives were finally eliminated from Canadian gasoline. Based on similarities of isotopic composition, the exchange of Pb between lakewater and sediment 'carbonate', and subsequently between 'carbonate', 'oxide' and other sediment fractions, was the most likely water-sediment pathway of Pb movement. pH controlled Pb fractionation within surficial sediments, with the 'organic' pool comprising 80-97% of total Pb in most acidic lakes and 15-60% in alkaline lakes. About 28% of the Pb in N. odorata shoots was accumulated directly from water, whereas there was no evidence of root uptake of Pb from sediments. The Pb in plant tissues was isotopically homogeneous and dissimilar to the variable composition exhibited in ambient waters and sediments. Plant Pb isotopes strongly resembled the historical Canadian atmospheric (alkyl Pb) signature. A possible explanation is that, like essential trace metals, historically-accumulated Pb was highly conserved during the annual growth cycle of this long-lived, clonal macrophyte, being stored over-winter in underground rhizomes and recycled into spring growth. Given the low rate of 'new' Pb uptake, historical alkyl Pb may continue to dominate plant tissues for some time, even though it was not detectable in littoral waters and sediments.																			0049-6979	1573-2932				FEB	2000	118	1-2					179	201		10.1023/A:1005194309413	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005194309413													WOS:000085313800014

Decline in angler use despite increased catch rates: Anglers' response to the implementation of a total catch-and-release regulation	FISHERIES RESEARCH												A mandatory total catch-and-release regulation and a bait ban were implemented on Lower Kananaskis Lake, Canada, due to the drastic decline of the native bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) population. In the decade following harvest-regulation changes, the adult bull trout population experienced a 28-fold increase in abundance. Two roving creel surveys of winter ice-anglers, the first conducted just prior to the regulation changes (1992) and the second 10 years later (2002), were used to compare catch rates, the size structure of fish caught, and angler effort before and after the bull trout population rebuilt. Supplementary information from voluntary creel cards (1996-2003) was used to evaluate temporal trends in summer catch-related fishery attributes as the fish population recovered. Winter catch rates were three-fold and 12-fold higher in 2002 than in 1992, for all bull trout and large (>50 cm) bull trout, respectively. The proportion of large fish in the catch also increased. Voluntary creel card information suggested summer catch rates and the frequency of large fish in the catch both increased as the population rebuilt. However, despite the increase in fishing "quality", angler numbers were three- to 10-fold lower in 2002 than 1992, indicating reduced utilization of the fishery. We speculate that harvest-oriented anglers were displaced from Lower Kananaskis Lake because of restrictive regulations. Our study shows anglers are not necessarily attracted to high-catch-rate fisheries, suggesting angler behaviour is complex and not driven by catch rates alone. Thus, to meet management objectives, understanding angler effort responses to regulatory changes is fundamentally important. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Secondary phytoplankton biomass contributors are cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, and diatoms, whereas cryptophytes are always present at a low biomass. The main bloom-forming dinoflagellate, Peridinium gatunense, bloomed every spring till the mid-1990s, but since then, it bloomed only during high-rainfall years. This change and a suite of additional changes in phytoplankton dynamics since 1994, changes that occurred after more than two decades of recorded constancy, were interpreted as early responses to increasing stress at the ecosystem level. In particular, the loss of the previously predictable annual pattern (spring bloom of P. gatunense, summer low-biomass, high-diversity assemblage), the appearance and establishment of toxin-producing cyanobacteria, a major loss in species richness, and a shift to dominance of less grazed species in summer are all manifestations of this change that can be viewed as a regime shift. Surface and remote sensing of chlorophyll a (Chl a)-a proxy of algal biomassindicates that phytoplankton concentration extremes at the lake surface mostly do not surpass a ratio of 1:2. Exceptional is a situation when Lake Kinneret is dominated by P. gatunense, and then the spatial heterogeneity of phytoplankton increases to a ratio of 1:50 between extreme concentrations. Chl a concentrations were often higher in the northern part of the lake, near the Jordan River inflow, where nutrient enrichment apparently boosts the growth of phytoplankton. The unique Chl a optical properties enable the identification and quantification of that substance using reflectance spectra emerging from the water surface and are recorded by sensors carried onboard satellites. Since 2006, images derived from optical information acquired by MERIS are utilized for mapping of the spatial distribution of phytoplankton in Lake Kinneret.																			1573-4595	2543-005X	978-94-017-8944-8; 978-94-017-8943-1				2014	6						161	190		10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8_10	10.1007/978-94-017-8944-8												WOS:000459771400011
J	HARGEBY, A				HARGEBY, A			MACROPHYTE ASSOCIATED INVERTEBRATES AND THE EFFECT OF HABITAT PERMANENCE	OIKOS												Invertebrate abundance differed in stands of the two characeans Chara tomentosa L. and Nitellopsis obtusa (Desv.) J. Groves in a shallow eutrophic lake. The plants are similar in morphology but differ in growth cycle. In stands of the winter-green Chara tomentosa, Asellus aquaticus L. (Isopoda) dominated in abundance over Chironomidae (Diptera) and Gammarus lacustris G. O. Sars (Amphipoda) occurred frequently. In stands of Nitellopsis obtusa, which dies off during winter, Chironomidae was the dominating taxon, while the abundance of Asellus was one to orders of magnitude lower than in Chara, and Gammarus was not found. Field and laboratory preference tests showed that Asellus and Gammarus did not colonize or prefer Chara over Nitellopsis, suggesting that active avoidance was not the cause of their low abundance in Nitellopsis. Exclusion of fish for 90 d in a Nitellopsis stand did not increase the density of Asellus, but introduction of Asellus to exclosures showed that the species was able to grow rapidly and reproduce in the habitat. In a recently established Chara stand the species structure of associated invertebrates shifted from a dominance of Chironomidae in September of the first year to a dominance of Asellus the following year. These results all support the hypothesis that the die-off of Nitellopsis in autumn limits slow colonizers like Asellus and Gammarus from establishing dense populations in this habitat. The invertebrate community in this seasonally changing habitat is thus suggested to be in an early phase of colonization, where animal interactions are less important and the species composition is mainly determined by colonization ability. In the more permanent Chara habitat, density-dependent animal interactions are suggested to determine the abundance and species composition.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				APR	1990	57	3					338	346		10.2307/3565963	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3565963													WOS:A1990DC02200009

Characterization of residence time variability in a managed monomictic reservoir	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												The average length of time land-borne compounds remain within an aquatic system is one of the key parameters controlling its biochemical processes. This study explores the magnitude and sources of daily, seasonal, and interannual variability of river water residence time in the Sau Reservoir, a prototypical example of a Mediterranean water supply. Daily estimates of residence time from 1998 to 2005 were obtained from a series of tracer experiments simulated with a one-dimensional physical model, based on actual observations and synthetic scenarios. Results highlight that multiple in situ factors, both natural and managed by humans, affect the residence time in reservoirs. Simulated residence times varied on average similar to 30% on a daily basis, as a result of natural meteorological (17%) and river inflow temperature (11%) variability. The management of withdrawal depths largely controlled the seasonal variations: The practice of withdrawing water from the shallowest outlet, which was close to the intrusion level of summer inflows, promoted shorter residence times in summers than winters. Interannual variability was primarily associated with the natural variability of inflow volume (25%), and secondarily with surface meteorology (8%). Excessive withdrawals prior to and during long dry periods, however, drastically reduced the reservoir storage capacity and withdrawal options, leading to shorter residence times in dry years. The flushing time, calculated as the ratio of storage volume and flow rates, captured the trends in annual mean residence times reasonably well but not daily and seasonal residence times.

In this study, we analyzed 33-years of high resolution (30 m) Landsat (LT) data for reconstructing seasonal patterns of chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration in four lakes across Finland, between 60 degrees N and 64 degrees N. Chl a models based on LT spectral bands were calibrated using 17-years (2000-2016) of field measurements collected across the four lakes. These models were then applied for estimating chl a using the entire LT-5 and 7 archives. Approximately 630 images, from 1984 to 2017, were analyzed for each lake. The chl a seasonal patterns were characterized using phenology metrics, and the time-series of LT-based chl a estimates were used for identifying temporal shifts in the seasonal patterns of chl a concentration. Our results showed an increase in the length of phytoplankton growth season in three of the lakes. The highest increase was observed in Lake Koylionjarvi, where the length of growth season has increased by 28 days from the baseline period of 1984-1994 to 2007-2017. The increase in the length of season was mainly attributed to an earlier start of phytoplankton blooms. We further analyzed surface temperature (T-s) and precipitation data to verify if climatic factors could explain the shifts in the seasonal patterns of chl a. We found no direct relationship between T-s and chl a seasonal patterns. Similarly, the phonological metrics of Ts, in particular length of season, did not show significant temporal trends. On the other hand, we identify potential links between changes in precipitation patterns and the increase in the phytoplankton season length. We verified a significant increase in the rainfall contribution to the total precipitation during the autumn and winter, accompanied by a decline in snowfall volumes. This could indicate an increasing runoff volume during the beginning of spring, contributing to an earlier onset of the phytoplankton blooms, although further assessments are needed to analyze historical streamflow values and nearby land cover data. Likewise, additional studies are needed to better understand why chl a patterns in some lakes seem to be more resilient than in others.					; Brotas, Vanda/A-2410-2012; Koponen, Sampsa/AAX-5895-2021; Maeda, Eduardo/E-7327-2011; Lisboa, Filipe/O-7997-2016	Kuikka, Sakari/0000-0001-8802-8013; Brotas, Vanda/0000-0001-8612-4167; Koponen, Sampsa/0000-0002-2959-5699; Lisboa, Filipe/0000-0002-9143-0692; Kaikkonen, Laura/0000-0002-4390-9295													0034-4257	1879-0704				FEB	2019	221						609	620		10.1016/j.rse.2018.12.006	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2018.12.006													WOS:000456640700045

The seasonal dynamics of these lakes is poorly understood despite this being potentially crucial for disentangling contributions from glacier melt and precipitation, which are all sensitive to climate, to lake water budget. Using in situ observations, satellite altimetry and gravimetry data, we identified two patterns of lake level seasonality. In the central, northern, and northeastern TP, lake levels are characterized by considerable increases during warm seasons and decreases during cold seasons, which is consistent with regional mass changes related to monsoon precipitation and evaporation. In the northwestern TP, however, lake levels exhibit dramatic increases during both warm and cold seasons, which deviate from regional mass changes. This appears to be more connected with high spring snowfall and large summer glacier melt. The variable lake level response to different drivers indicates heterogeneous sensitivity to climate change between the northwestern TP and other regions.

Following holomixis in autumn the previously buoyant colonies sedimented from the water column onto the bottom mud. In all samples gas vesicles, which provided the colonies with buoyancy, were present in sufficient volume to negate the combined ballast provided by protein, carbohydrate, lipid and PO3-4, the major cell components. The gas vesicles, which accounted for .apprx. 10% of the cell protein, were too strong to be collapsed or regulated by cell turgor pressure. The loss of buoyancy could not be explained by an increase in cell ballast or by disappearance of gas vesicles. Colonies collected in sediment traps were buoyant after they had been agitated and diluted with lake water, which removed a colloidal precipitate from them. Similarly, 66% of the sinking fraction of a net tow sample was found buoyant after it had been treated in the same way. Previously buoyant colonies could be made to sink on mixing with the colloidal precipitate. This demonstrated the ability of the precipitate to trap colonies and to cause their sedimentation. The colloid comprised approximately equal amounts of organic and inorganic matter and was rich in Fe. Colloids of this type form when the dissolved Fe in the anoxic water of the hypolimnion becomes oxidized on mixing with the aerated water of the epilimnion.

To this end, we studied water quality and quantity in springs in Oulanka National Park, north-east Finland. Multivariate statistical methods were employed to relate spring water quality and quantity to hydrogeology and land use of the spring capture zone. This revealed that most springs studied were affected by locally atypical dolostone-limestone bedrock, resulting in high calcium, pH, and alkalinity values. Using Ward's hierarchical clustering, the springs were grouped into four clusters based on their water chemistry. One cluster consisted of springs affected by past small-scale agriculture, whereas other clusters were affected by the variable bedrock, e.g., springs only 1 km from the dolostone-limestone bedrock area were beyond its calcium-rich impact zone. According to a random forest model, the best predictors of spring water chemistry were spring altitude and the stable hydrogen isotope ratio of the water (delta H-2). Thus stable water isotopes could be widely applicable for boreal spring management. They may also provide a rough estimate of groundwater flow route (i.e., whether it is mainly local or regional), which largely determines the chemical characteristics of spring water. Our approach could be applied in other boreal regions and at larger spatial scales for improved classification of springs and for better targeted spring management. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We compiled 26 years of monitoring data from interconnected monomictic humic lake and dimictic clear-water lake to estimate the mean daily lakes' imports, pools and exports of manganese. The humic lake, surrounded by peatlands, exported annually 1.7-fold more manganese per lake area than the clear-water lake, which is enclosed by mineral soils. Hydrodynamical events initiated lake-type-specific manganese refilling and removing periods lasting for months. Both lakes accumulated manganese in the near-bottom water layers during the period of ice-cover. However, the incomplete spring turnover in the humic lake left the manganese in the bottom layers untouched, and manganese was flushed to the clear-water lake mainly with surface water. The manganese that accumulated in the bottom layers was transported to the surface and exported to the clear-water lake only after the autumn turnover. In the clear-water lake, import from the humic lake and the spring turnover filled the surface water pool, which enhanced the export of manganese originating from both the catchment and lake itself. Most of the lake's manganese was exported during ascending spring flooding while descending flooding enhanced in-lake removal. We conclude that lake-type-specific hydrodynamical events must be considered when using manganese as an indicator of redox-changes. Further research is needed to determine how climate-change induced shifts in the timing of hydrodynamical events affect manganese dynamics and exports in humic and clear-water lakes in boreal catchments.

Here, we present and analyse 30 years of chemical and biological data from the shallow and 16 ha large Lake Vaeng, Denmark, which has been biomanipulated twice with a 20-year interval by removing roach (Rutilus rutilus) and bream (Abramis brama). After both biomanipulations, Lake Vaeng shifted from a turbid, phytoplankton-dominated state to a clear, water macrophyte-dominated state. Chlorophyll a was reduced from 60-80 mu g.L-1 to 10-30 mu g.L-1 and the coverage of submerged macrophytes, dominated by Elodea canadensis, increased from <0.1% to 70%-80%. Mean summer total phosphorus was reduced from about 0.12 to 0.07 mg.L-1 and total nitrogen decreased from 1.0 to 0.4 mg.L-1. On a seasonal scale, phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations changed from a summer maximum during turbid conditions to a winter maximum under clear conditions. The future of Lake Vaeng is uncertain and a relatively high phosphorus loading via the groundwater, and the accumulation of a mobile P pool in the sediment make it likely that the lake eventually will return to turbid conditions. Repeated fish removals might be a relevant management strategy to apply in shallow lakes with a relatively high external nutrient loading.

Here we produce, for the first time, a high-resolution record of the supraglacial drainage network (including both rivers and lakes) and its seasonal behaviour at Humboldt Glacier, a wide-outlet glacier draining a large melt-prone hydrologic catchment (13 488 km 2 ), spanning the period 2016 to 2020 using 10 m spatial resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. Our results reveal a perennially extensive yet interannually variable supraglacial network extending from an elevation of 200 m a.s.l. to a maximum of similar to 1440 m a.s.l. recorded in 2020, with limited development of the network observed in the low-melt years of 2017 and 2018. The supraglacial drainage network is shown to cover an area ranging between 966 km 2 (2018) and 1566 km 2 (2019) at its maximum seasonal extent, with spatial coverage of up to 2685 km 2 recorded during the early phases of the melt season when a slush zone is most prominent. Up-glacier expansion and the development of an efficient supraglacial drainage network as surface runoff increases and the snowline retreats is clearly visible. Preconditioning of the ice surface following a high-melt year is also observed, with an extreme and long-lasting 2019 melt season and over-winter persistence of liquid lakes, followed by low snow accumulation the following spring, culminating in earlier widespread exposure of the supraglacial drainage network in 2020 compared to other years. This preconditioning is predicted to become more common with persistent warmer years into the future. Overall, this study provides evidence of a persistent, yet dynamic, supraglacial drainage network at this prominent northern GrIS outlet glacier and advances our understanding of such hydrologic processes, particularly under ongoing climatic warming and enhanced runoff.					; Rippin, David Manish/AAW-5063-2021; Yang, Kang/I-1439-2013	Livingstone, Stephen/0000-0002-7240-5037; Rippin, David Manish/0000-0001-7757-9880; Yang, Kang/0000-0002-7246-8425; Rawlins, Lauren/0000-0001-7538-7228; Sole, Andrew/0000-0001-5290-8967													1994-0416	1994-0424				NOV 9	2023	17	11					4729	4750		10.5194/tc-17-4729-2023	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-17-4729-2023													WOS:001169037600001

The literature and recent data were used to assess species diversity. Out of around 95 studied alpine water bodies, beetles were found in 61. Altogether, 54 taxa from six families were identified. The different altitudinal zones and lake areas were compared with species richness and species incidence concerning the sites sampled. Besides faunistics, some ecological notes on Agabus bipustulatus are provided. The seasonal dynamics of this species is influenced by its life cycle. The larvae and adults comprised a regular part of the samples during the whole period of the study with a decrease in density from June to the late fall. During the summer and the early fall, fast growth of the larvae was observed. The adults reached their abundance peak in September-October. For the first time, analysis is provided of the genetic diversity of the macroinvertebrate species of the alpine lakes. We used a 345bp fragment of cytochrome b in two dytiscids, Agabus bipustulatus and A. guttatus. Seven and eight haplotypes were identified, respectively, with slightly different distribution patterns of genetic diversity across the study area in both species. A high proportion of the lakes was characterized by a single haplotype and the majority of the haplotypes were restricted to only one of the sampled valleys.					; Čiampor, Fedor/AAR-7555-2020	Ciamporova-Zatovicova, Zuzana/0000-0003-0506-6212; Ciampor, Fedor/0000-0001-6269-3592; 													1961-9502						2011		402							10	10.1051/kmae/2011064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae/2011064													WOS:000299114500011

Based on the monthly precipitation data of 18 meteorological stations from 1959 to 2018 in the PYLB, Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF), Wavelet Analysis, and Pearson Correlation Analysis were used to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of summer precipitation and their correlations with the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM). The results demonstrate that there were two leading modes of summer precipitation at inter-annual time scales: the mode being consistent over the whole area and the mode of opposite relationship between the south/north PYLB. Both modes had obvious trend variations and periodic characteristics. The East Asian Summer Monsoon Index (EASMI) showed a decreasing trend of fluctuation, existing in periods of 2-3 years and 11 years. Cross Wavelet Transform revealed that the time coefficients of the second EOF mode and EASMI had an anti-phase resonance period of 2-3 years. Pearson Correlation Analysis also indicated that there was a significant negative correlation relationship between them. These results not only contribute to an understanding of characteristics of summer precipitation in the PYLB and the influences of the East Asian Summer Monsoon on them but also provide a reference for a regional response to climate change and precipitation prediction.					; Fan, Hongxiang/AAC-7159-2022; Xu, Ligang/K-2584-2013	Fan, Hongxiang/0000-0001-7626-1344; Zhu, Hua/0000-0002-0464-5792; 														2073-4441				AUG	2019	11	8							1705	10.3390/w11081705	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11081705													WOS:000484561500178

Simulated and Observed Surface Energy Fluxes and Resulting Playa Breezes during the MATERHORN Field Campaigns	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model simulations of the autumn 2012 and spring 2013 Mountain Terrain Atmospheric Modeling and Observations Program (MATERHORN) field campaigns are validated against observations of components of the surface energy balance (SEB) collected over contrasting desert-shrub and playa land surfaces of the Great Salt Lake Desert in northwestern Utah. Over the desert shrub, a large underprediction of sensible heat flux and an overprediction of ground heat flux occurred during the autumn campaign when the model-analyzed soil moisture was considerably higher than the measured soil moisture. Simulations that incorporate in situ measurements of soil moisture into the land surface analyses and use a modified parameterization for soil thermal conductivity greatly reduce these errors over the desert shrub but exacerbate the overprediction of latent heat flux over the playa. The Noah land surface model coupled to WRF does not capture the many unusual playa land surface processes, and simulations that incorporate satellite-derived albedo and reduce the saturation vapor pressure over the playa only marginally improve the forecasts of the SEB components. Nevertheless, the forecast of the 2-m temperature difference between the playa and desert shrub improves, which increases the strength of the daytime off-playa breeze. The stronger off-playa breeze, however, does not substantially reduce the mean absolute errors in overall 10-m wind speed and direction. This work highlights some deficiencies of the Noah land surface model over two common arid land surfaces and demonstrates the importance of accurate land surface analyses over a dryland region.

(wild celery) beds and adjacent habitats in coastal Louisiana	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												We compared nekton use of Vallisneria americana Michx. (submerged aquatic vegetation, SAV) with marsh shoreline vegetation and subtidal nonvegetated bottom (SNB) using a 1-m(2) drop sampler in the oligohaline area of Barataria Bay, Louisiana. Mean densities of most abundant species were significantly different among six habitat types. Harris mud crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii, Ohio shrimp Macrobrachium ohione, blue crab Callinectes sapidus, daggerblade grass shrimp Palaemonetes pugio, white shrimp Litopenaeus setiferus (fall), rainwater killifish Lucania parva, naked goby Gobiosoma bosc, code goby Gobiosoma robustum (fall), speckled worm eel Myrophis punctatus (fall), and gulf pipefish Syngnathus scovelli (spring), were much more abundant, and species richness also was greater, in Vallisneria than over SNB. Vallisneria supported densities of most species that were similar to those in marsh vegetation, although naked goby and gulf pipefish were more abundant in Vallisneria, and speckled worm eel and saltmarsh topminnow Fundulus jenkinsi were more abundant in marsh. Within the Vallisneria bed, densities of Harris mud crab, rainwater killifish, and speckled worm eel were higher at sites near the marsh (SAV Inside Edge) than at sites more distant from the marsh (SAV Outside Edge), and Ohio shrimp (fall) densities were higher in the interior of the bed than along the edges. The mean size of blue crab was larger in marsh than Vallisneria and larger in Vallisneria than SNB. White shrimp did not differ in size among habitat types. Vallisneria beds may provide an important nursery habitat for young blue crab and white shrimp that use oligohaline estuarine areas. These SAV beds can provide an alternative structural habitat to emergent vegetation during periods of low water, because Vallisneria occurs in the subtidal and generally persists throughout the year on the Gulf coast. Species whose young thrive in low-salinity waters and also depend on structure would benefit most from Vallisneria habitat in estuaries.

Typically, these wetlands are poorly utilized by breeding waterfowl in spite of generally reliable water conditions during spring and summer. Nutrient additions were made throughout the growing season to 18 PVC enclosures installed in a low productivity wetland near Lundar, Manitoba. Inorganic phosphorus (as H3PO4) and nitrogen (as NH4NO3) were added at bi-weekly intervals during the summer of 1988 at target rates of 0 and 0, 30 and 800, and 60 and 1600 mug l-1 (P and N respectively). Algal and invertebrate communities were monitored from mid-June to September, 1988. Phytoplankton, epiphytic periphyton and metaphyton communities demonstrated significant increases in biomass over the treatment period. No significant differences in epipelon community biomass were noted. An examination of several indicators of nutrient deficiency indicated that algal productivity was moderately to severely limited in all enclosures, with little or no mitigative effects noted due to nutrient addition treatment.

Nutrient additions did increase community productivity, however the levels used in this study were insufficient to yield a sustained increase in primary or secondary productivity.																			0018-8158					APR 1	1994	279						483	495		10.1007/BF00027879	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00027879													WOS:A1994NK39900045

Nonlinear instrument drift was removed using a new empirical staircase function built from multiple station loops. The new technique was developed between March 1999 and September 2000 in a pilot study conducted in the southern Salt Lake Valley along an east-west profile of eight stations from the Wasatch Mountains to the Jordan River. Gravity changes at eight profile stations were referenced to a set of five stations in the northern Salt Lake Valley, which showed residual signals of < 10 mu Gal in amplitude, assuming a reference station near the Great Salt Lake to be stable. Referenced changes showed maximum amplitudes of -40 through +40 mu Gal at profile stations, with minima in summer 1999, maxima in winter 1999-2000, and some decrease through summer 2000. Gravity signals were likely a composite of production-induced changes monitored by well-water levels, elevation changes, precipitation-induced vadose-zone changes, and local irrigation effects for which magnitudes were estimated quantitatively.																			0016-8033	1942-2156				NOV-DEC	2008	73	6					WA71	WA82		10.1190/1.2996303	http://dx.doi.org/10.1190/1.2996303													WOS:000261211600042

Ageing dams can be repaired to preserve function and maintain safety, removed to promote full connectivity or retrofitted with a fish passage structure to increase connectivity without reservoir loss. The success of rock ramp structures is not well documented, especially for cool- and warm-water fishes in the Great Lakes basin. The success of a recently built (2009) rock ramp for increasing upstream fish passage on the Shiawassee River in Michigan, USA, was evaluated. While there was evidence of limited fish passage during the study period (2011-2016), catches of spring migratory fishes, fish eggs and larvae were significantly higher below the rock ramp than above, indicating the dam with rock ramp fish pass continues to limit upstream migration. Overall connectivity appears improved relative to a reference, dammed river, but falls short of full connectivity.

An annual eelgrass bed was found bordering the perennial meadow. We monitored the morphology, growth and survival of Z. marina in both annual (AB, disturbed site) and perennial beds (PB, reference site) in Moon Lake from December 2012 to January 2014. Nearly all eelgrass shoots in AB were removed or buried in sediments due to clam harvesting, which occurred during low tides in the winter and early spring of 2012-13. Seedlings were observed in February 2013 right after the end of the clamming season. They were less abundant but exhibited higher survival rates in AB than in PB. In June, the newly established seedlings in the AB formed numerous patches, indicating that the disturbed site recovered via seedling recruitment. However, these annual plants could not survive the winter of 2013-14 as perennials did, including those free from clamming disturbance in experimental enclosures. The annual Z. marina bed had smaller plant size and much lower biomass, density and potential seed production than the perennial stand. The recovery of the disturbed bed probably mainly depended on seeds recruited from the nearby perennial bed where the potential seed production was much higher. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The late glacial/Holocene transition of the region was characterised by the development of mega-linear dunes. These dunes became stabilised and vegetated during the early Holocene and interdunal lakes formed in response to the incursion of the IOM at approximately 8500 cal yr BP with the development of C3 dominated savanna grasslands. The IOM weakened ca. 6000 cal yr BP with the onset of regional aridity, aeolian sedimentation and dune reactivation and accretion. Despite this reduction in precipitation, the take was maintained by winter dominated rainfall. There was a shift to drier adapted C4 grasslands across the dune field. Lake sediment geochemical analyses record precipitation minima at 8200, 5000 and 4200 cal yr BP that coincide with Bond events in the North Atlantic. A number of these events correspond with changes in cultural periods, suggesting that climate was a key mechanism affecting human occupation and exploitation of this region.

J	Prentice, IC; Harrison, SP; Jolly, D; Guiot, J				Prentice, IC; Harrison, SP; Jolly, D; Guiot, J			The climate and biomes of Europe at 6000 yr BP: Comparison of model simulations and pollen-based reconstructions	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												C-14-dated pollen and lake-level data from Europe are used to assess the spatial patterns of climate change between 6000 yr BP and present, as simulated by the NCAR CCM1 (National Center for Atmospheric Research, Community Climate Model, version 1) in response to the change in the Earth's orbital parameters during this period. First, reconstructed 6000 yr BP values of bioclimate variables obtained from pollen and lake-level data with the constrained-analogue technique are compared with simulated values. Then a 6000 yr BP biome map obtained from pollen data with an objective biome reconstruction (biomization) technique is compared with BIOME model results derived from the same simulation. Data and simulations agree in some features: warmer-than-present glowing seasons in N and C Europe allowed forests to extend further north and to higher elevations than today, and warmer winters in C and E Europe prevented boreal conifers from spreading west. More generally, however, the agreement is poor. Predominantly deciduous forest types in Fennoscandia imply warmer winters than the model allows. The model fails to simulate winters cold enough, or summers wet enough, to allow temperate deciduous forests their former extended distribution in S Europe, and it incorrectly simulates a much expanded area of steppe vegetation in SE Europe. Similar errors have also been noted in numerous 6000 yr BP simulations with prescribed modern sea surface temperatures. These errors are evidently not resolved by the inclusion of interactive sea-surface conditions in the CCM1. Accurate representation of mid-Holocene climates in Europe may require the inclusion of dynamical ocean-atmosphere and/or vegetation-atmosphere interactions that most palaeoclimate model simulations have so far disregarded.

J	Burn, CR				Burn, CR			Lake-bottom thermal regimes, western Arctic Coast, Canada	PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES												Lake-bottom temperatures have been measured for several years at two lakes with littoral terraces on north-central Richards Island, a residual pond of the Illisarvik experimental drained lake site, and a taiga lake near Inuvik. The tundra lakes possess distinct thermal regimes: in (1) the deep central pools; (2) shallows where winter ice may reach bottom; and (3) on littoral terraces, where water depth is less than I m. In summer, the tundra lakes are uniformly well mixed and reach similar lake-bottom temperatures at all depths. In winter, conditions vary, depending on the proximity of the ice cover to lake bottom. The annual mean lake-bottom temperatures have been about 3 degrees C in the deep central pools, 0 degrees C in the shallow pools, and -2 degrees C on the terraces of the tundra lakes. For the taiga lake, where late-winter ice cover reaches only about half the thickness of the two tundra lakes, annual lake-bottom temperatures follow the same pattern as in the central pools of the tundra lakes, but the mean temperature is over 5 degrees C. If the thermal regime of the taiga lake is an analogue for tundra conditions following climate warming, then the width of lakes with through taliks on Richards Island may decline by between 20 and 100 m. At equilibrium, about 45% of the lakes and 20% of the surface area of Richards Island may then be underlain by taliks that penetrate permafrost.

A comparison was made between a marsh which had been grazed for more than 15 years, and a site which had not been grazed for at least that period. Both marshes bordered the same lake. Net above-ground primary production (NAPP) and N and P allocation to above-ground parts were estimated for two growing seasons from regular measurements of the standing shoot biomass and its N and P content, and by using temporary exclosures during goose grazing. Annual NAPP was similar between grazed and ungrazed areas (1997) or higher in the grazed area (1999). Rhizome biomass was similar between areas but the timing of minimum biomass shifted from June to September with grazing. A higher spring shoot emergence due to lower standing dead mass in the grazed area and relocation of reserves from rhizomes to shoots were important in sustaining/increasing NAPP with grazing. Grazing by moulting Greylag geese in spring approximately doubled the annual allocation of N and P to shoots, and almost tripled the annual above-ground losses of these elements compared to an ungrazed reed vegetation. In the grazed area, 50% or more of the annual nutrient losses were due to goose activity, as no nutrients were resorbed from the nutrient-rich tissue that was consumed or tom and rejected. Differences in timing of shoot emergence in spring were important in affecting the extent of nutrient loss due to goose activity. The increased N and P losses as a result of grazing were associated with consistently lower N and P concentrations in the rhizomes, but only in 1999 were nutrient reserves in rhizomes over winter lower in the grazed reed stand. Resorption efficiency from senescent tissue was increased with grazing in 1997 but not affected in 1999. Our results indicate that grazing increased growth and nutrient dynamics of P australis in this eutrophic reed marsh. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	BURKE, CM; BURTON, HR				BURKE, CM; BURTON, HR			THE ECOLOGY OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC BACTERIA IN BURTON LAKE, VESTFOLD HILLS, ANTARCTICA	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Photosynthetic bacteria in Burton Lake, a seasonally tidal, meromictic lake of maximum depth 18 m, located in the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica, were studied throughout 1983. The dominant species were Chlorobium vibrioforme and Chlorobium limicola (up to 5.4 .times. 106 cells ml-1) and minor species were Thiocapsa roseopersicina (< 1.25 .times. 105 cells ml-1 and Rhodopseudomonas palustris (< 100 cells ml-1). The Chlorobium spp. and T. roseopersicina were found throughout the anoxic water, which ranged in temperature from -0.5.degree. C to -2.2.degree. C, but did not form discrete layers at the O2-H2S interface. The growth zone, however, of the Chlorobium spp. was delineated by the presence of light and H2S and was restricted to less than 3 m below the O2-H2S interface. R. palustris was found in oxic and anoxic water. Available light, which varied from 0-4.9 .mu.E m-2 s-1 at the O2-H2S interface, was considered to be the major environmental factor controlling growth of the bacterial phototrophs. Growth was initiated in spring in low light levels (< 1 .mu.E m-2 s-1) following 3 months of darkness during winter. It is concluded that the dominance of the Chlorobium spp. was a result of their more efficient maintenance metabolism in winter and of their greater efficiency in utilizing low intensity light.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				AUG 15	1988	165						1	11		10.1007/BF00025569	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00025569													WOS:A1988Q014900003
J	COTTAM, WP; TUCKER, JM; DROBNICK, R				COTTAM, WP; TUCKER, JM; DROBNICK, R			SOME CLUES TO GREAT-BASIN POSTPLUVIAL CLIMATES PROVIDED BY OAK DISTRIBUTIONS	ECOLOGY												Recent discovery of a large number of discontinuous clones of a hybrid oak along the upper shore line of the eastern boundary of Pluvial Lake Bonneville in the Great Basin of Utah provided a living source to indicate some temperature characteristics of postpluvial climates. This hybrid oak resulted from a cross between the deciduous, cold-enduring scrub oak Quercus gambelii, common to the southern half of the mountain chain that limits the Great Basin on the east, and the heat-loving live oak Q. turbinella Greene, whose present northern limits of distribution approximate the southeastern divide that separates the Great Basin from the Colorado River drainage, some 260 miles south of the most northerly hybrids. Evidence indicates that the live oak parent migrated north nearly to this present site of Ogden, Utah, during the Altithermal period, consorted with Gambel oak, then succumbed to the cold of the present climate, leaving its hybrid offspring, genetically endowed with lower temperature tolerance, as proof of this ancient journey. Since many of these hybrid oaks are sterile (F1''s), they have persisted through vegetative proliferation from the plant of the original cross; thus their position marks the precise former location of the live oak parent. Assuming that the climate under which the relictual hybrids were produced must have approximated the present climate in southern Utah where hybridization is now occurring, it was possible by means of recording thermographs to compare the climates of these 2 areas and thus assess the probable seasonal temperature characteristics of the Altithermal period. The data obtained suggest that Q. turbinella disappeared from the Great Basin not because of a general decrease of temperature throughout the year nor of colder winter minimal temperatures, but because of a significant drop in total warmth during a period from late fall to early spring.																			0012-9658	1939-9170					1959	40	3					361	377		10.2307/1929752	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1929752													WOS:A1959WR63400004

Planktonic biomass size spectra were used to summarize the ecological quality of six shallow lakes sampled in spring, early summer and late summer. 2. A simple additive model fitted to the data was used to assess the applicability of the size spectrum theory to shallow lake ecosystems. 3. The additive model replicated the hierarchical pattern of biomass predicted by the predator-prey theory of aquatic production, and was a more appropriate model for predicting biomass size spectra than the frequently used linear regression. 4. Lakes with varying ecological quality were a significant source of variation in the additive model, and further research into using size spectra to monitor ecological quality in shallow lakes is warranted. Specifically, the production of size spectra from a wider range of sites is needed to provide greater statistical validation. 5. The use of size spectra can provide an attractive and cost-effective way for classifying lake ecosystems because it circumvents the need for difficult taxonomic description.

Despite their substantial contribution to bacterial biomass, microbial food webs, and carbon cycle, their phenology in freshwater lakes remains unknown. Hence, we investigated seasonal variations of AAP abundance and community composition biweekly across 3 years in a temperate, meso-oligotrophic freshwater lake.Results AAP bacteria displayed a clear seasonal trend with a spring maximum following the bloom of phytoplankton and a secondary maximum in autumn. As the AAP bacteria represent a highly diverse assemblage of species, we followed their seasonal succession using the amplicon sequencing of the pufM marker gene. To enhance the accuracy of the taxonomic assignment, we developed new pufM primers that generate longer amplicons and compiled the currently largest database of pufM genes, comprising 3633 reference sequences spanning all phyla known to contain AAP species. With this novel resource, we demonstrated that the majority of the species appeared during specific phases of the seasonal cycle, with less than 2% of AAP species detected during the whole year. AAP community presented an indigenous freshwater nature characterized by high resilience and heterogenic adaptations to varying conditions of the freshwater environment.Conclusions Our findings highlight the substantial contribution of AAP bacteria to the carbon flow and ecological dynamics of lakes and unveil a recurrent and dynamic seasonal succession of the AAP community. By integrating this information with the indicator of primary production (Chlorophyll-a) and existing ecological models, we show that AAP bacteria play a pivotal role in the recycling of dissolved organic matter released during spring phytoplankton bloom. We suggest a potential role of AAP bacteria within the context of the PEG model and their consideration in further ecological models.					; Mujakić, Izabela/JXY-3221-2024; Piwosz, Kasia/B-1131-2010; Kavagutti, Vinicius/G-9109-2019; Sunagawa, Shinichi/Q-5950-2019; Socha, Magdalena/LRS-8829-2024; Villena'Alemany, Cristian/KEI-8008-2024; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017; Andrei, Adrian-Stefan/Q-9155-2018; Mujakic, Izabela/JXY-3221-2024	Sunagawa, Shinichi/0000-0003-3065-0314; Piwosz, Kasia/0000-0002-3248-3364; Villena-Alemany, Cristian/0000-0002-6158-1879; Andrei, Adrian-Stefan/0000-0003-1425-7168; Mujakic, Izabela/0000-0001-5602-7331													2049-2618					MAR 27	2024	12	1							65	10.1186/s40168-024-01786-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40168-024-01786-0								38539229					WOS:001195082300001
J	Chen, RS; Wang, KL; Wu, CY				Chen, Rong-Song; Wang, Kuo-Liang; Wu, Chia-Ying			Assessment of the camellia seed meal impact on loaches in paddy fields	PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT												In Taiwan, Camellia seed meal is often sprayed on rice paddies during rice transplantation season to stop the growth of Pomacea canaliculata. However, the application of camellia seed meal endangers muciferous mollusks and fishes in paddy fields. Though researchers have examined the effects of the saponin in the camellia seed meal on Pomacea canaliculata, previous studies ignore the effects of saponin on fish. Loaches often inhabit the rivers, lakes, ponds, paddy fields, and canals of low elevation where there have muddy layer with plant chips. This study uses vanillin-sulfuric acid method and field tests on loaches in paddy fields to determine the duration of camellia seed meal's effect on loaches (Misgurnue Angullicaudatus). Results indicated that the best application to stop the growth of Pomacea canaliculata is to seal the rice field immediately after transplantation, apply the camellia seed meal, and then irrigate the field 2 days after camellia seed meal application for the summer transplantation, and 3 days for the spring transplantation. Water should not be drained from the paddy field after the application of camellia seed meal to reduce the chance of endangering loaches in irrigation canals. Field Tests show that high water temperature during summer also has a negative effect on loaches in paddy fields and irrigation canals.																			1611-2490	1611-2504				DEC	2012	10	4					291	300		10.1007/s10333-011-0280-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10333-011-0280-4													WOS:000311676000004

Climate Change Impacts on Reservoir Inflow in the Prairie Pothole Region: A Watershed Model Analysis	WATER												The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) is known for its hydrologically complex landscape with a large number of pothole wetlands. However, most watershed-scale hydrologic models that are applied in this region are incapable of representing the dynamic nature of contributing area and fill-spill processes affected by pothole wetlands. The inability to simulate these processes represents a critical limitation for operators and flood forecasters and may hinder the management of large reservoirs. We used a modified version of the soil water assessment tool (SWAT) model capable of simulating the dynamics of variable contributing areas and fill-spill processes to assess the impact of climate change on upstream inflows into the Shellmouth reservoir (also called Lake of the Prairie), which is an important reservoir built to provide multiple purposes, including flood and drought mitigation. We calibrated our modified SWAT model at a daily time step using SUFI-2 algorithm within SWAT-CUP for the period 1991-2000 and validated for 2005-2014, which gave acceptable performance statistics for both the calibration (KGE = 0.70, PBIAS = -13.5) and validation (KGE = 0.70, PBIAS = 21.5) periods. We then forced the calibrated model with future climate projections using representative concentration pathways (RCPs; 4.5, 8.5) for the near (2011-2040) and middle futures (2041-2070) of multiple regional climate models (RCMs). Our modeling results suggest that climate change will lead to a two-fold increase in winter streamflow, a slight increase in summer flow, and decrease spring peak flows into the Shellmouth reservoir. Investigating the impact of climate change on the operation of the Shellmouth reservoir is critically important because climate change could present significant challenges to the operation and management of the reservoir.

Similar Environmental Conditions are Associated with Walleye and Yellow Perch Recruitment Success in Wisconsin Lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Since the mid-2000s, recruitment of Walleye Sander vitreus in some northern Wisconsin lakes has declined, potentially because of climate-induced changes in lake environments. Yellow Perch Perca flavescens is also an ecologically and culturally important fish species in this region, but mechanisms driving Yellow Perch recruitment are unclear because of a lack of targeted sampling. Previous studies have suggested that recruitment of these two species may be regulated by similar factors, and observed declines in Walleye recruitment may be cause for concern about Yellow Perch recruitment. Our objectives were to determine if abiotic factors related to recruitment success were similar between Walleye and Yellow Perch populations in northern Wisconsin lakes and if the probability of successful Walleye recruitment was related to estimates of juvenile Yellow Perch abundance before Walleye recruitment declines were observed. We addressed these objectives using historical data from Wisconsin lakes. Random forest analysis incorporating lake-specific averages of predictor variables indicated that winter conditions (duration or severity), growing degree days, variation in spring temperatures, peak summer temperature, and Secchi depth were important predictors of recruitment success for both species. Logistic regression indicated that before Walleye recruitment declines were observed on some lakes (2000-2006), Walleye recruitment success was related to relative abundance of juvenile Yellow Perch in mini-fyke-net sampling. Our results indicate that landscape-level patterns in recruitment success for the two species are likely similar and additional research to understand Yellow Perch recruitment trends is warranted. Better information on Yellow Perch recruitment could contribute to a better understanding of Walleye recruitment trends as declines in Yellow Perch could influence prey availability and survival of age-0 Walleye. Furthermore, potential declines in Yellow Perch could lead to changes in the numbers and size of Yellow Perch caught by anglers, which may have implications for harvest management.

J	Tvede, AM				Tvede, AM			Hydrology of Lake Atnsjoen and River Atna	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The hydrological investigations in the Atna basin started in 1917 with discharge measurements at the outlet of Lake Atnsjoen. Ice data are available from the lake since 1950 and water temperature data from 1980. With the start of the FORSKREF program in 1986 the number of hydrological stations increased substantially and included also snow measurements. During the FORSKREF period 1986-98 the annual mean discharge was 8% lower than during the normal period 1931-60. The annual flood is highest during the snow melt in spring, an exception was 1987 when a rain flood in October was the annual high. The spring flood in early June 1995 was the largest ever recorded and had a 100-200 year return period. The water temperature is low above tree-line at 1000 m a. s. l., rarely exceeding 7-8. C. The temperature increases gradually with decreasing altitude and is periodically above 15degreesC at 400 m a. s. l. The Atna Lake is an important heat source for the river downstream. In this lake, wind mixing normally prevents the development of a strong summer thermocline. The lake usually freezes over in late November and has a stable ice cover of 50-90 cm thickness in early spring. The ice normally breaks up in late May; thus the mean ice-covered period is 6 months. The ice cover on the river is less stable and rather large ice-runs are common on the lower part of River Atna. The snow measurements are carried out in April in a small subbasin between 800 and 1200 m a. s. l. The snow cover is unevenly distributed due to strong wind transport, but the pattern is more or less the same from one season to another. The mean snow accumulation in this basin is equivalent to 205 mm of precipitation.																			0018-8158					JUN	2004	521	1-3					21	34		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000026348.47636.cf	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000026348.47636.cf													WOS:000221177900004

Feeding intensity of immature amphipods follows the changes in percent of carbon of the settling organic matter, being highest during the late spring and fall. Gut filling time ranged from 6.7 to 3.4 h at 5 and 14.degree. C. Daily ingestion of organic matter ranged from 0.05 g .cntdot. m-2 d-1 at the deepest station sampled (125 m) to 0.17 g .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. d-1 at the shallowest (35 m). The organic matter ingested by the Pontoporeia present represented 8.8 and 7.9% of the average daily rate of organic matter deposited at these two stations respectively. The lakewide estimate of the organic matter consumed by Pontoporeia in Lake Ontario was about 19 g .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr-1 during 1981 and 21 g .cntdot. m-2 .cntdot. yr-1 1982.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				NOV	1988	45	11					1886	1895		10.1139/f88-220	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f88-220													WOS:A1988Q956100002

Climate change alters the egg development dynamics in cold-water adapted coregonids	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												We tested experimentally how the eggs of coregonid fish from the same parents develop at different incubation temperatures under natural long and climate change induced short winter conditions. The experimental scenarios simulating the water temperature in the spawning areas were constructed using a meteorological model including the climate change scenarios and a thermodynamic water quality model. Northern latitude stocks of vendace (Coregonus albula) and European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) had high flexibility in the egg developmental rates: the physiologically distinct temperature-dependent regulation of the ontogenetic steps during incubation caused over 3 months long hatching-to-feeding window to adjust the hatching and start of external feeding in optimal conditions. Survival of embryos and larvae did not differ between scenarios and even in the shortest winter scenario, the survival and growth rate of embryos and larvae was high. An among-family effect on the hatching time of the offspring was also observed. Our results showed that spring warming of the water already under the ice is the key cue to synchronize the hatching of coregonids close to the ice break-up period.					; Karjalainen, Juha/B-4079-2015	Marjomaki, Timo J./0000-0002-0563-3099; Karjalainen, Juha/0000-0001-9302-1174													0378-1909	1573-5133				APR	2015	98	4					979	991		10.1007/s10641-014-0331-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-014-0331-y													WOS:000350567300001

The results demonstrate that Danish coastal waters were heavily eutrophied and had high particle concentrations and turbid waters. Median values were 5.1 mug chl a l(-1), 10.0 mg DW l(-1) of suspended particles, and Secchi depth of 3.6 m. Chlorophyll concentration was strongly linked to the total-nitrogen concentration. The strength of this relationship increased from spring to summer as the concentration of total nitrogen declined. During summer, total nitrogen concentrations accounted for about 60% of the variability in chlorophyll concentrations among the different coastal systems. The relationship between chlorophyll and total phosphorus was more consistant over the year and correlations were much weaker than encountered for total nitrogen. Secchi depth could be predicted with good precision from measurements of chlorophyll and suspended matter. In a multiple stepwise regression model with In-transformed values the two variables accounted for most of the variability in water transparency for the different seasons and the period March-October as a whole (c. 80%). We were able to demonstrate a significant relationship between total nitrogen and Secchi depth, with important implications for management purposes.					; Borum, Jens/K-5167-2014; Sand-Jensen, Kaj/F-3041-2015	Nielsen, Soren Laurentius/0000-0003-4309-5153; Borum, Jens/0000-0002-4861-6563; Sand-Jensen, Kaj/0000-0003-2534-4638													0160-8347					OCT	2002	25	5					930	937		10.1007/BF02691341	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02691341													WOS:000178996800004

The role of internal nitrogen loading in supporting non-N-fixing harmful cyanobacterial blooms in the water column of a large eutrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Western Lake Erie cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) occur every summer as a result of anthropogenic nutrient loading. Although the physiological importance of nitrogen (N) in supporting bloom biomass and toxin production is established, the role of internal N recycling in the water column to support bloom maintenance is not as well understood. Over three field seasons (2015-2017), we collected water from western Lake Erie and employed bottle incubations with 15 N-ammonium (NH4+) enrichments to determine NH4+ regeneration and potential uptake rates in the water column. Potential NH4+ uptake rates followed spatial and seasonal patterns, with greatest rates measured nearest the Maumee River inflow and during peak bloom months (August and September). Regeneration followed a similar spatial pattern but was greatest in early summer (June and July) and supported similar to 20-60% of potential NH4+ demand during the height of the bloom. Basinwide internal NH4+ regeneration during the April-October period could supply NH4+ at 60-200% of annual external N loading to the western basin. These results help explain how non-N-fixing cyanoHABs in Lake Erie and other large, eutrophic lakes continue producing biomass and N-rich toxins long after spring nutrient loads are exhausted or transported to other areas. Internal N loads are ultimately driven by external N loads; in low precipitation years, external nutrient loads result in smaller blooms, producing less substrate for subsequent internal N loads. Overall, these findings, along with others, confirm that both internal and external N loading must be considered when evaluating cyanoHAB management strategies.					; McCarthy, Mark/E-3071-2015; Newell, Silvia/M-4336-2014	Boedecker, Ashlynn/0000-0003-1667-3990; Hoffman, Daniel/0000-0003-0094-6632; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				SEP	2022	67	9					2028	2041		10.1002/lno.12185	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.12185		JUL 2022											WOS:000829098900001

Thus, to verify the responses of vegetation to climate changes over the orbital timescales, analysis of pollen in marine sediments is needed. Here, we present the pollen record of hemipelagic sediments of core DD09-ST21 obtained from the northern Ulleung Basin in the East Sea. The palynofloral assemblages were dominated by warm temperate broadleaved trees and boreal conifers during interglacial and glacial periods, respectively. We also demonstrated that bisaccate pollen and herbaceous pollen in the palynological sequence can be used as indicators of the variation in the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) intensity during the last glacial period and freshwater inflow into the East Sea, respectively. During glacial periods, the EAWM intensified in response to weakening of the summer insolation at 60 degrees N, while freshwater influx into the East Sea decreased due to a decrease in precipitation.

A sediment core (ON12C) obtained from Lake Onuma is used to study the evolution of precipitation in Northern Japan. The age-depth model for the core is based on three identified tephra layers, combined with accelerator mass spectrometry C-14 measurements of plant remnants, Cs-137 dating, and lithology. Multi-proxy records, including pollen concentration, Alnus pollen percentages and C/N atomic ratios, indicate that the delta N-15 record reflects nitrogen availability in the catchment where precipitation may exert a significant impact. The delta N-15 record shows that the precipitation was gradually increasing from 1640 AD, reaching peak strength in the middle of the 19th century, followed by a dry interval during the 20th century. The reconstructed variability in the precipitation from Lake Onuma is supported by other precipitation records from the Asian monsoon region. Solar irradiance is likely responsible for the changes in the summer monsoon precipitation on the centennial timescales during the late Little Ice Age, and the winter monsoon may also have played an important role in snow precipitation. However, the 20th century anomaly indicates that the Asian summer monsoon precipitation variability might be affected by anthropogenic forcing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

This development is influenced by various parameters, including the role of water chemistry. This article presents a spatio-temporal analysis of various hydrochemical parameters, including conductivity, pH, temperature, magnesium, calcium, and others. It's worth noting that the water from the Ras Elma Vauclusian spring, a key driver of travertinization in the region, is sourced from water infiltrating through faults and flowing into Lake Tompraire, known as Dayat Chikker near the Bab Boudir area. The findings suggest that the water in Ras Elma has turned aggressive, as revealed by the examination of the calcaro-carbonic equilibrium. CaCO3 precipitation occurs predominantly in the summer, significantly impacting the formation of travertines, particularly those of the spring and dam types. However, valley-type travertines exhibit more extensive development compared to the other two types.

It is found that the decrease in photosynthetic activity of plankton is almost synchronous to the increase in the CO2 flux from atmosphere to water. It follows from comparison of the spring and summer data with December measurements that the daily decrease in variable fluorescence of phytoplankton is caused by the internal daily rhythm of the photosynthetic activity of plankton.

Intracellular concentrations of surplus stored P remained high and alkaline phosphatase activity remained low during the formation and decline of the surface bloom, which indicated that available P does not become limiting to growth. In contrast, declining rates of nitrogenase activity and net photosynthesis were recorded, particularly in those blooms of shorter duration. An increase in numbers of bacteria during the summer may account for the observed fall of net photosynthetic rates, since gross rates did not change as markedly. There was appreciable nitrogenase activity preceeding and during the differentiation of akinetes, and the cellular C/N atomic ratio of sporulating populations was lower than in non-sporulating algae. The onset of sporulation in surface blooms may be initiated by an imbalance of the normal vegetative growth of the algal cells and of their C and N metabolism.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1979	9	4					369	379		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01521.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1979.tb01521.x													WOS:A1979HC33500009

Because of the potential implications of these die-offs on waterfowl in non-native settings, it is necessary to better understand the trematodes that cause the die-offs. Here, we studied the spatio-temporal dynamics of two trematodes, Cyathocotyle bushiensis and Sphaeridiotrema spp., known to infect waterfowl in northern Minnesota, USA, via their intermediate host, the faucet snail (Bithynia tentaculata). We studied prevalence (% of snails infected within a sample) and intensity (mean number of parasites per infected snail within a sample) of faucet snail infection with these two trematodes in small lakes, large lakes, ponds, and rivers in northern Minnesota in the spring, summer, and fall of 2011-2013. We tested whether parasite prevalence and infection intensity could be explained spatially (as a function of the abundance of faucet snails, average snail size, water depth, and proximity to known waterfowl groups) and temporally (across years and seasons) using generalized estimating equation models. The spatial and temporal patterns we observed varied within and among waterbodies. For both parasite species, parasite prevalence and intensity of infection were consistently higher in samples with larger snails and in deeper portions of the waterbodies. In Lake Winnibigoshish, prevalence was lower farther from the large waterfowl groups we observed, but the abundance of snails in a sample had no effect on prevalence or intensity of infection. Our findings help improve understanding of this multi-species system, but also illustrate the complexity of modeling the spatial and temporal dynamics of infections in waterbodies that are so variable in size, shape, waterfowl use, and function.

Effects of river floods and sedimentation on a naturally dynamic Great Lakes estuary	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Some of the most biologically diverse coastal wetlands and estuaries are found along the Great Lakes, but the spatial extent and timing of river-related inundation and sedimentation vary greatly among natural and altered systems. We used hydrologic data, geomorphic change detection, and satellite imagery to study inundation and sedimentation patterns in the naturally dynamic estuary of the Bad River (Mashkiiziibii) that flows into Lake Superior (Anishinaabeg-gichigami), and the Kakagon River (Ogaakaagaang-ziibii) that flows into a sheltered bay (Chi-Kaamigong). In 2016, an extreme summer flood (annual exceedance probability < 0.2 %) caused total inundation of the 46-km(2) estuary. Floods from the sediment-rich Bad River, with an annual exceedance probability of <= 50 %, have overflowed into the upper wetlands and channels of the Kakagon River about 60 times over the last 75 years, including 20 floods during the most recent 10-year wet period. Sedimentation patterns were associated with proximity to river channels, shoreline erosion, and wind action. Early winter ice-up coupled with a storm surge and an early spring snowmelt into the iced-over bay changed inundation duration and sedimentation patterns. Climate-change projections for more intense rainfall and warmer temperatures will likely cause more frequent flooding and sedimentation; however, patterns may differ depending on the timing of the floods relative to storm surges and ice formation, or other factors. The approach of integrating readily available data helped give a broader temporal and spatial context to the possible causes for inundation and sedimentation, some expected and others not, in natural and restored estuaries of the Great Lakes.

We examine the impacts climate variables, especially wind speed, had on water temperature and thermal stratification at three sites in Candlewood Lake (Connecticut, U.S.A.) between 1985 and 2015. Despite the lack of regional time-related trends in air temperature or precipitation over the 31year period, there was a significant decline in wind speed during spring and summer months, with a mean decline of 31% over the study period. Even though a wide range in mean July epilimnetic temperature (22.8-28.2 degrees C) was observed, there was no trend over time. In contrast, a significant cooling trend was recorded for the hypolimnion that was highly correlated with the declining wind speed. Decreasing wind speed was also correlated with an increase in the strength of the thermocline estimated from maximum RTRM values. Despite the lack of a warming trend in surface waters over the entire study period, the strength of summer thermal stability estimated using total RTRM scores was highly correlated with epilimnetic temperature. The potential consequences of declining wind speed, a cooling hypolimnion, and a stronger thermocline are discussed.																			2054-4049					JUL-DEC	2018	5	2							e00056	10.1002/geo2.56	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/geo2.56													WOS:000454686500002

Non-resident definitive host presence is sufficient to sustain avian schistosome populations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY												To control swimmer's itch in northern Michigan inland lakes, USA, one species of bird, the common merganser (Mergus merganser), has been relocated from several lakes since 2015. Relocation efforts are driven by a desire to reduce the prevalence of the swimmer's itch-causing parasite Trichobilharzia stagnicolae. The intention of this state-sponsored control effort was to interrupt the life cycle of T. stagnicolae and reduce parasite egg contribution into the environment from summer resident mergansers such that infections of the intermediate snail host Stagnicola emarginata declined. Reduced snail infection prevalence was expected to substantially reduce the abundance of the swimmer's itch-causing cercarial stage of the parasite in water. With no official programme in place to assess the success of this relocation effort, we sought to study the effectiveness and impact of the removal of a single definitive host from a location with high definitive host and parasite diversity. This was assessed through a comprehensive, lake-wide monitoring study measuring longitudinal changes in the abundance of three species of avian schistosome cercariae in four inland Michigan lakes. Environmental measurements were also taken at these lakes to understand how they can affect swimmer's itch incidence. This study demonstrates that the diversity of avian schistosomes at the study lakes would likely make targeting a single species of swimmer's itchcausing parasite meaningless from a swimmer's itch control perspective. Our data also suggest that removing the common merganser is not an effective control strategy for the T. stagnicolae parasite, likely due to contributions of the parasite made by non-resident birds, possibly migrants, in the autumn and spring. It appears likely that only minimal contact time between the definitive host and the lake ecosystem is required to contribute sufficient parasite numbers to maintain a thriving population of parasite species with high host specificity.

Significant variations were observed between tissues (p < 0.05), with the liver being the most contaminated. A seasonal increase in Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs) was observed during the wet season, particularly for As, Cd, Hg and Zn in S. pilchardus. The Metal Pollution Index (MPI) showed no overall toxicity except in the liver (3.07-6.69). The Estimated daily intake (EDI) values remain below the provisional tolerable daily intake limits, indicating no health risk. However, Cd and Fe values exceed these limits in children. The Hazard Quotient (HQ) and Total Hazard Quotient (THQ) indices associated with muscle consumption suggest a non-carcinogenic risk for adults. For children, a hazard was identified for iAs in S. pilchardus in winter and in T. trachurus in both seasons. Furthermore, the carcinogenic risk indices (CRiAs and CRCr) indicate a potential risk for certain species, both for adults and children, highlighting the need for measures to reduce PTE contamination. In the short term, PTE concentrations in fish do not appear to pose an immediate risk to human health or ecosystems. However, there is evidence of long-term accumulation due to human activities, which could be of concern. It is recommended that bioaccumulation analyses and exposure monitoring of local populations be included in future studies to better anticipate and manage potential risks.

However, pollution from various anthropogenic activities negatively impacts their ecological status. This study aimed to develop and compare the performance of a minimu m water quality index (WQImin) and phytoplankton inde x of biotic integrity (P-IBI) in assessing the rivers' ecological status for protection purposes. Samples were collected and analyzed seasonally from March to December 2019. The results revealed that TP , DO, COD, TN, and turbidit y were critical for developing the WQImin. The WQImin values showed no significant spatial and seasonal differ-ences. Thus, it rated the rivers "moderate," with the highest and lowest WQImin values in winter and summer. The P-IBI was developed using phytoplankton density, Chl-a, biomass, and Margalef richness. Notably, the P-IBI values differed significantly at seasonal but not spatial scales. It rated Changwang and Wuyuan "moderate," whereas Meishe was "low." Moreover, Autu m n and summer had the highest and lowest P-IBI values. Interest-ingly, the P-IBI demonstrated that parameters such as COD, T N , NH4+-N, EC, pH, turbidity, and temperature decreased with improving water quality, while water transparency increased with improved water quality. The WQImin and P-IBI assessment results were consistent. The indices showed that summer had poor water qualit y than other seasons. In addition, the indices negatively correlated with the trophic level index (TLI). In contrast, the P-IBI ratings were significantly lower than WQImin at spatial and seasonal scales. Hence, this study suggests that WQImin and P-IBI can effectively assess the ecological conditions of the rivers and that the critical parameters and metrics for their development might va r y in different regions. In addition, P-IBI may provide stricter stan-dards than WQImin for water quality assessment.

J	ERIKSSON, C; PEDROSALIO, C				ERIKSSON, C; PEDROSALIO, C			SELENIUM AS A NUTRIENT FOR FRESH-WATER BACTERIOPLANKTON AND ITS INTERACTIONS WITH PHOSPHORUS	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												The influence of selenite on the growth of bacterioplankton present in samples of three lakes was analyzed; these samples were collected in sulfate-rich, oligotropic Lake Banyoles, moderately eutrophic Lake Erken, and hypereutrophic Lake Vallentunasjon. Experiments were set up in a completely randomized factorial design to analyze the effect of selenite alone and, in the same experiment, the effect of selenite in the presence of phosphate. Cultures of bacterioplankton, free of algae and zooplankton, diluted with filtered natural water, were used in the bioassays. The addition of 100 .mu.g P .cntdot. L-1 to samples from Lake Banyoles, collected during the winter, enhanced cell yield 2.7 times; the addition of 10 .mu.g P .cntdot. L-1 to samples from Lake Erken, collected during the spring, doubled the yield. Strong effects of phosphate on growth rates were found in samples from lakes Banyoles and Vallentunasjon. When bacteria from Lake Banyoles were exposed to 100 .mu.g P .cntdot. L-1, the specific growth rate was 0.08 h-1 (log units), compared with 0.03 h-1 in the control. In spring, Lake Vallentunasjon contained water with a considerable amount of dissolved organic phosphorus (18 .mu.g P .cntdot. L-1); the addition of 100 .mu.g P .cntdot. L-1, in the form of phosphate, resulted in a shorter lag phase of at least 48 h and reduced the specific growth rate to about half that in the control. Selenite had a significant positive effect on cell yield in samples from lakes Banyoles (p = 0.0001) and Vallentunasjon (p = 0.020), whereas the effect on cell yield in samples from Lake Erken was slightly negative (p = 0.110). The addition of selenite alone (550 ng Se .cntdot. L-1) to samples from Lake Banyoles, collected during the summer, doubled the biovolume of bacterioplankton within 37 h. Among winter bacteria from Lake Banyoles, selenite, at concentrations of 55 and 550 ng Se .cntdot. L-1, increased the number of bacteria twofold and threefold, respectively, but only when the phosphate level was high (100 .mu.g P .cntdot. L-1). A high inorganic phosphorus level of 100 .mu.g P .cntdot. L-1 was also necessary to stimulate the effect of selenite on bacterial growth in samples from Lake Vallentunasjon; 550 ng Se .cntdot. L-1 enhanced yield 24%. The negative effect of selenite on samples from Lake Erken was most obvious when phosphate (10 or 100 .mu.g P .cntdot. L-1) had been added simultaneously (p = 0.030 for selenium and phosphorus interaction). Cell yields were always greater at the highest temperature. With samples from Lake Vallentunasjon, selenite stimulated bacterial growth at 25.degree. C but had no effect at 10.degree. C. With samples from Lake Banyoles, the simultaneous addition of phosphate and selenite increased cell yield threefold at 15.degree. C and only twofold at 30.degree. C.

A majority of CH4 is thought to be released through ebullition (bubbling), a pathway with extreme spatial variability that limits the accuracy of measurements. We assessed ebullition during early and late winter by quantifying bubbles trapped in the ice cover of two lakes in a landscape with degrading permafrost in arctic Sweden using random transect sampling and a digital image processing technique. Bubbles covered up to similar to 8% of the lake area and were largely dominated by point source emissions with spatial variabilities of up to 1056%. Bubble occurrence differed significantly between early and late season ice, between the two lakes and among different zones within each lake (p < 0.001). Using a common method, we calculated winter fluxes of up to 129 +/- 486 mg CH4 m(-2) d(-1). These calculations are, on average, two times higher than estimates from North Siberian and Alaskan lakes and four times higher than emissions measured from the same lakes during summer. Therefore, the calculations are likely overestimates and point to the likelihood that estimating CH4 fluxes from ice bubble distributions may be more difficult than believed. This study also shows that bubbles quantified using few transects will most likely be unsuitable in making large-scale flux estimates. At least 19 transects covering similar to 1% of the lake area were required to examine ebullition with high precision in our studied lakes.					; Crill, Patrick/ABC-1357-2021	Bastviken, David/0000-0003-0038-2152; Crill, Patrick/0000-0003-1110-3059; 													2169-8953	2169-8961				SEP 30	2011	116								G03044	10.1029/2011JG001761	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2011JG001761													WOS:000295531100002

Using a standard procedure, extracts of the sediments were prepared for diagnostic tests. These extracts were tested for acute toxicity to fresh-water organisms. The ecotoxicological tests were performed on the fresh-water alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, the vascular water plant Lemna minor, on a representative of invertebrates - the water flea Daphnia magna and on the Xenopus laevis frog embryo and luminiscent Vibrio fischeri bacteria. Possible toxic effects were evaluated using the test determining the inhibition of the growth of white mustard root Sinapis alba. Results of ecotoxicological assessment of sediment leachates showed that their quality varied significantly during the year. Differences were found between results of sediment evaluations from different collection profiles, which may indicate effects of point source pollution. Of the ecotoxicological tests used, the most sensitive organisms included the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, bioluminiscent bacteria Vibrio fischeri and the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis. The highest concentrations of arsenic were found by chemical analysis in both spring and autumn sediment leachate samples collected at Site L1 ( Leskava). The highest organic pollutant concentrations were found in autumn sediment leachate samples from Site L1. In total PAH sums, phenanthrene was the dominant pollutant at all the sites investigated.

J	Notaro, M; Bennington, V; Vavrus, S				Notaro, Michael; Bennington, Val; Vavrus, Steve			Dynamically Downscaled Projections of Lake-Effect Snow in the Great Lakes Basin	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												Projected changes in lake-effect snowfall by the mid- and late twenty-first century are explored for the Laurentian Great Lakes basin. Simulations from two state-of-the-art global climate models within phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are dynamically downscaled according to the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5). The downscaling is performed using the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) Regional Climate Model version 4 (RegCM4) with 25-km grid spacing, interactively coupled to a one-dimensional lake model. Both downscaled models produce atmospheric warming and increased cold-season precipitation. The Great Lakes' ice cover is projected to dramatically decline and, by the end of the century, become confined to the northern shallow lakeshores during mid-to-late winter. Projected reductions in ice cover and greater dynamically induced wind fetch lead to enhanced lake evaporation and resulting total lake-effect precipitation, although with increased rainfall at the expense of snowfall. A general reduction in the frequency of heavy lake-effect snowstorms is simulated during the twenty-first century, except with increases around Lake Superior by the midcentury when local air temperatures still remain low enough for wintertime precipitation to largely fall in the form of snow. Despite the significant progress made here in elucidating the potential future changes in lake-effect snowstorms across the Great Lakes basin, further research is still needed to downscale a larger ensemble of CMIP5 model simulations, ideally using a higher-resolution, nonhydrostatic regional climate model coupled to a three-dimensional lake model.																			0894-8755	1520-0442				FEB	2015	28	4					1661	1684		10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00467.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00467.1													WOS:000349670000019

In current study, concentration of fine particles, coarse particles and meteorological data were collected during the daytime in an artificial forest, wetland and a water surface in the Beijing Olympic Park. Dry deposition velocity, fluxes and vegetation collection were calculated by different models and the results were compared. The results show: (1) the deposition velocity onto the forest canopy was higher than which onto the wetland and the water surface and the velocity varied in different seasons; (2) the fine particles deposited most in the winter while the coarse particles was in the spring; (3) the vegetation collection rates of fine particles were lower than coarse particles, and the forest collected more PMs than the wetland plants.

J	LIVINGSTONE, DM; SCHANZ, F				LIVINGSTONE, DM; SCHANZ, F			THE EFFECTS OF DEEP-WATER SIPHONING ON A SMALL, SHALLOW LAKE - A LONG-TERM CASE-STUDY	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Limnological data collected over a period of five years before and eleven years after the introduction of deep-water siphoning to combat the eutrophication of Lutzelsee, a small, shallow Swiss lake, allowed both positive and negative effects of this internal lake restoration measure to be assessed. Short-term negative effects of the measure included a temporary increase in biomass and productivity immediately following installation of the system. No further effect of the measure on the phytoplankton community could be ascertained during the three years following its introduction. The thermal regime of the lake was strongly affected by deep-water siphoning, the most important effects being an increase in deep-water temperature in summer and a reduction in Schmidt stability in late summer and autumn, leading to an increased propensity for the lake to circulate at high temperatures. No long-term net effect of the measure was observed on either deep-water oxygen conditions (probably because higher deep-water temperatures resulted in increased oxygen consumption rates, thus offsetting the effect of advective oxygen transport from above) or on total phosphorus in surface waters. Positive signs pointing to a possible long-term improvement in lake trophic status were a tendency to reduced deep-water total phosphorus and dissolved phosphorus concentrations, and to increased water transparency.																			0003-9136					NOV	1994	132	1					15	44																WOS:A1994PW43300002
J	Wang, HT; Zhao, C; Huo, TB				Wang, Haitao; Zhao, Chen; Huo, Tangbin			The Distribution of Microplastic Pollution and Ecological Risk Assessment of Jingpo Lake-The World's Second Largest High-Mountain Barrier Lake	BIOLOGY-BASEL												To investigate the influence of factors such as tourism, agriculture, and population density on the presence of microplastic (MP) content in aquatic environments and their associated ecological risks, Jingpo Lake, a remote high-mountain lake situated away from urban areas, was selected as the research subject. This study examined the abundance, types, sizes, colors, and polymer compositions of MPs within the water body, fish, and sediments. By considering variables, including fishing practices, agricultural activities, population dynamics, and vegetation cover, an analysis was conducted to unravel the spatial and temporal distribution of MPs concerning human activities, ultimately leading to an assessment of the ecological risks posed by MP pollution. The findings revealed that the average abundance of MPs in the lake's surface water was recorded as (304.8 +/- 170.5) n/m3, while in the sediments, it averaged (162.0 +/- 57.45) n/kg. Inside the digestive tracts of fish, the MP abundance was measured at 11.4 +/- 5.4 n/ind. The contamination of MPs within the aquatic environment of Jingpo Lake was found to be relatively minimal. Variations in MP loads across time and space were observed, with MPs predominantly falling within the size range of small planktonic organisms (50-1000 mu m). Additionally, the prevalent colors of MPs in the water samples were white or transparent, constituting approximately 55.65% of the entire MP composition. Subsequently, they were black, red, and blue. This colors distribution were consistent across MPs extracted from fish and sediment samples. The chemical compositions of the MPs predominantly comprised PE (31.83%) and PS (25.48%), followed by PP (17.56%), PA (11.84%), PET (6.71%), EVA (4.56%), and PC (2.03%). Regarding the seasonal aspect, MP concentrations were highest during summer (46.68%), followed by spring (36.75%) and autumn (16.56%). The spatial distribution of MPs within Jingpo Lake's water body, fish, and sediments was notably influenced by human activities, as confirmed by Pearson correlation coefficients. A strong association was observed between MP levels and water quality indicators such as ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), total phosphorus (TP), and chlorophyll-a (Chla), suggesting that human-related pollution contributed significantly to MP contamination. The diversity assessment of MP pollutants exhibited the highest variability in chemical composition (1.23 to 1.79) using the Shannon-Wiener Index. Subsequently, the diversity of colors ranged from 0.59 to 1.54, shape diversity from 0.78 to 1.30, seasonal diversity from 0.83 to 1.10, and size diversity from 0.44 to 1.01. The assessment results of ecological risk highlighted that the risk categories for MPs within the surface water, fish, and sediments of Jingpo Lake were categorized as I for the PHI and PLI and as "Minor" for the PERI. These relatively low-risk values were attributed to the predominantly low toxicity of the distributed MPs within the Jingpo Lake basin. Moreover, the results of the risk assessment were found to be interconnected with the distribution of the local population and agricultural activities around the sampling sections. Usage patterns of coastal land and population density were recognized as influential factors affecting MP loads within the water body, sediments, fish, and other components of the lake ecosystem.																				2079-7737				FEB	2025	14	2							201	10.3390/biology14020201	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology14020201								40001969					WOS:001430485800001
J	STAUFFER, RE				STAUFFER, RE			EFFECTS OF AN EARLY FALL COLD-FRONT ON HEAT, PHOSPHORUS, SILICA, AND MANGANESE DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE HYPOLIMNION OF LAKE MENDOTA, WISCONSIN	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												I examined the effects of an early fall (8-10 September 1977) cold.front on eutrophic Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, during which 'Lake Number' L(N) (dimensionless) attained a minimum 3 h value of 0.45, and remained below 1.0 for a total of 39 h. The front accelerated heat transport downward through the main thermocline, resulting in hypolimnetic warming; the vertical eddy conductivity K(z) increased monotonically with depth from a minimum 0.8 m2 day-1 at 16 m to 1.9 m2 day-1 at 21 m. The front also affected significant lateral and vertical redistribution of three passive solute 'tracers': phosphate (P), silicic acid (Si) and soluble reduced manganese (Mn2+). Lateral concentration gradients along isopycnals predating the storm were erased. For Mn, especially, the vertical redistribution within the hypolimnion agreed with modeled changes based on vertical gradients and the K(z) profile. Mn and P behaved quasi-conservatively within the anoxic hypolimnion (no net sources or sinks), but additional supplies of Si appeared in the hypolimnion (8.0 +/- 1.5 Mg m-3 day- 1). This rate over 4 days agreed with the mean rate of hypolimnetic Si accumulation over the 80 day interval preceding 7 September 1977 (8.7 mg m-3 day-1). These results corroborate other environmental evidence that Mn and P both enter Lake Mendota's hypolimnion mainly during the first half of the summer, prior to the onset of bulk hypolimnetic anoxia, whereas Si is released by hypolimnetic sediments continuing into the late summer.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				OCT 15	1993	151	1					1	18		10.1016/0022-1694(93)90245-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-1694(93)90245-5													WOS:A1993MC78600001

Nutrient Release from Living and Terminated Cover Crops Under Variable Freeze-Thaw Cycles	AGRONOMY JOURNAL												Cover crops (CC) are planted into fields during the non-growing season as a best management practice (BMP) for agronomic and environmental benefits. However, freeze-thaw cycles (FTC) may increase the availability of water extractable P (WEP) from damaged plant tissues, leading some to question their efficacy as a nutrient BMP due to their potential to release P during snowmelt. The objectives of this study were to experimentally determine the influence of: (1) FTC magnitude (4 degrees C, -4 to 4 degrees C, -18 to 4 degrees C, and -18 to 10 degrees C), (2) CC species [ cereal rye (Secale cereale L.), oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. oleoferus Metzg Stokes), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth)], and (3) termination using herbicide on the magnitude of WEP, NH4+, and NO3- release. Shoot tissue clippings underwent five FTC followed by extraction. Large magnitude FTC from -18 to 4 and -18 to 10 degrees C (heavy frost) elevated WEP release, whereas the -4 to 4 degrees C (light frost) treatment did not. Responses varied with plant type, where frost-intolerant species released more WEP than frost-tolerant species. In contrast, NH4+, and NO3- release did not increase following FTC. Termination elevated WEP and NH4+ release across all temperature treatments. The use of CC as a nutrient BMP should be used with caution in some regions, but in areas with mild winter climates, growing frost tolerant species without termination may reduce the risk of P leaching from vegetation in winter and early spring.

Full-scale flooding of the tailing pond with free running water was undertaken after the construction of an impervious dam; approximately 2 million m(3) of surface water at pH 7,4 completely covered the tailings after 16 months. The minimal water column over the tailings was established at 1,20 m and reached 4,5 m, depending on the site topography. Water and tailings samples were collected from 9 different locations from the surface of the man-made lake using a specially designed borer and were analyzed for pH, conductivity, iron- and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria activity and numbers as well as the sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) population. We showed that over a four year period of flooding, the overall population of iron-oxidizers decreased considerably; their numbers drastically fell from 1 x 10(6) to 1 x 10(2) active cells per g of oxidized tailings while the SRBs increased from 10(1) to 10(5)/g. The pH of the influent, the reservoir and the effluent water remained fairly constant between 6,9 up to 7,4 over the entire period. During this time, interstitial water pH increased from 2,9 to 4,3 in flooded tailings where lime could not be incorporated in the first 20 cm of tailings; elsewhere, the pH of the tailings suspensions remained fairly constant around neutral values (pH 7,0). Dissolved oxygen was measured at fixed intervals and remained also constant between 6 and 7.5 mg/L while water temperatures fluctuated below freezing point to +20C respectively in winter and summer season.																					0-444-50193-2				1999	9		B				635	643		10.1016/S1572-4409(99)80153-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1572-4409(99)80153-9													WOS:000086245100066

Zooplankton was collected in autumn 2007 and spring 2008 in two shallow lakes, one being predominantly polluted with aluminium compounds as result of water treatment process (Lake Njivice; 45A degrees 10' N, 14A degrees 30' E) and the other unpolluted (Lake Ponikve; 45A degrees 05' N, 14A degrees 30' E) used as control. Water and sediment chemistry parameters were assessed at both lake sampling sites. The results indicated that the main pollutant in both matrices was aluminium, whose concentrations exceeded the value of 0.15 mg/L-1 legally accepted for drinking water by Croatian water quality regulations. Plankton composition of the investigated lakes showed that only a few species are dominant and appear at both sites. Cladocerans are represented by Daphnia magna Straus 1820, and copepods by the calanoid Eudiaptomus padanus etruscus (Losito 1901), the cyclopoid Cyclops sp. and dipterans by larvae of Chaoborus flavicans (Meigen 1830). Other species were determined only occasionally and with low abundance. As observed, the comet assay had adequate sensitivity to detect the differences in levels of DNA damage among the dominant zooplankton taxa. Zooplanktons collected in Lake Njivice show a lower degree of DNA integrity compared with animals from the reference lake (Lake Ponikve). Inter-species variability in DNA damage was observed, indicating different genome susceptibility to the same genotoxic pollutants present in the aquatic environment. Furthermore, in the polluted Lake Njivice, seasonal differences in the levels of DNA damage within particular species of zooplankton were also noted. Calanoida, Daphnia and Chaoborus mainly had higher values of all three comet parameters in autumn 2007 than in spring 2008. Feeding modes strongly influenced the level of DNA damage in zooplankton species studied. We assume that the mechanisms of DNA damage and genotoxicity, as detected in the present comet assay study, were similar as those described in previous studies dealing with pollution by toxic metals. Although it was a preliminary study, obtained results confirmed the high sensitivity of the comet assay for the detection of DNA damage in cells of zooplankton organisms. The alkaline comet assay on simple aquatic organisms, as confirmed here, might represent an additional parameter useful in environmental risk assessment, especially in cases when other bioindicator species are very scarce or absent.

The filtration rate of Dreissena polymorpha Pallas measured in the field in three shallow Dutch lakes shows an inverse exponential relationship with the dry matter content of the water. 2. Temperature seems to set only a gross level to the filtration rate in summer and winter season respectively; within a season no clear relation between the filtration rate and temperature exists. 3. Under laboratory conditions the risk of measuring abnormal behaviour of Dreissena polymorpha is shown to be substantial; hence field-measurements of the filtration rate are preferable. 4. The clearing capacity of the Dreissena polymorpha populations in Lakes IJsselmeer and Markermeer is sufficient to filter both lakes at least once or twice a month. This indicates the potential importance of this species for restoration of turbid, eutrophic lakes by means of biomanipulation.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				AUG	1989	22	1					133	141		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1989.tb01088.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1989.tb01088.x													WOS:A1989AK46800010

To evaluate virioplankton distribution in the Charente Estuary and identify which environmental variables control dynamic of virioplankton abundance, five stations defined by a salinity gradient (0-0.5, 0.6-5, 13-17, 20-24, and higher than 30 PSU) were surveyed over a year. Viral abundance was related to bacterioplankton abundance and activities, photosynthetic pigments, nutrient concentration, and physical parameters (temperature and salinity). On a spatial scale, virus displayed a decreasing pattern seaward with abundance ranging over the sampling period from 1.4 x 10(7) to 20.8 x 10(7) viruses mL(-1) making virioplankton the most abundant component of planktonic microorganisms in the Charente Estuary. A good correlation was found between viral and bacterial abundance (r(s) = 0.85). Furthermore, bacterial abundance was the most important predictor of viral abundance explaining alone between 66% (winter) and 76% (summer) of viral variability. However, no relation existed between viral abundance and chlorophyll a. Temporal variations in viral distributions were mainly controlled by temperature through the control of bacterial dynamics. Spatial variations of viral abundance were influenced by hydrodynamic conditions especially during the winter season where virioplankton distribution was entirely driven by mixing processes.

However, the relationship of overwintering survival to hunting season structure, weather and body condition are not well understood. We measured survival of 235 radio-marked adult female and male mallards Anas platyrhynchos along the South Platte River corridor in northeastern Colorado, USA, during the overwintering seasons of 2005/06 (pilot year), 2006/07 and 2007/08, and we determined the primary factors affecting survival. Hunting was the most important factor affecting survival. Of mortality, 67% were direct results of hunting, and survival was lower during hunting periods compared to non-hunting periods. Within hunting periods, survival was lowest during the first 2-3 weekends of the hunting periods. During the seasons 2006/07 and 2007/08, survival of radio-marked mallards was monitored during September-February. The estimated survival was 0.65 (95% CI=0.50-0.78) for females and 0.54 (95% CI=0.39-0.68) for males during 2006/07, and 0.55 (95% CI=0.40-0.69) for females and 0.42 (95% CI=0.28-0.58) for males during 2007/08. We did not observe a strong correlation between body condition index and survival ((beta) over bar =0.36, SE = 0.43). Accumulated snowfall and daily minimum temperature were unimportant variables for predicting survival. Of hunting recoveries, 89% occurred in our study area, and 15% and 18% of radio-marked mallards went missing during 2006/07 and 2007/08, respectively. Our results suggest that split hunting seasons are an effective management tool to increase hunter harvest and affect overwintering survival. Given a set bag limit and season length, managers may be able to increase hunter harvest by: 1) having hunting periods of at least three weeks in length, 2) including as many weekend days (i.e. Saturdays and Sundays) within hunting periods as possible and 3) interspersing hunting periods with non-hunting periods of at least 2-3 weeks.																			0909-6396					DEC	2010	16	4					357	366		10.2981/09-094	http://dx.doi.org/10.2981/09-094													WOS:000287629500002
J	Borodulina, G; Tokarev, I; Yakovlev, E				Borodulina, Galina; Tokarev, Igor; Yakovlev, Evgeny			Isotope Composition of Natural Water in Lake Onega Basin	WATER												In 2009-2018, the isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen in the atmospheric precipitation, groundwater and river and lake water of Lake Onega basin was studied. The weighted annual isotope composition of precipitation at Petrozavodsk was delta O-18 = -11.7% and delta H-2 = -84% and varied from -30.9 to -4.1% for delta O-18 and from -23 to -22% for delta H-2. The isotopic composition of the water in Lake Onega was relatively uniform from -11.5 to -9.3% for delta O-18 and from -85 to -71% for delta H-2. In the bays, the isotopic composition of the water varied more substantially than in the central part of the lake due to the river runoff during springtime flooding. In late summer, the concentrations of deuterium and oxygen-18 increased in the lake water, and figurative points on the delta H-2 vs. delta O-18 diagram shifted above the meteoric line. The absorption of the isotopically heavy summer precipitation and disequilibrium isotope fractionation during evaporation led to the enrichment of the lake water by heavy isotopes. Experiments were conducted to estimate the evaporation influence on the isotope enrichment of the residual water, and a comparison of the obtained isotope data with the experimental function showed that commonly, about 4% and up to 12% of water was lost during the spring and summer, respectively. In the water of the tributaries, the abundance of the deuterium and oxygen-18 varied in a wider scale than in the lakes, from -14.4 to -9.1% for delta O-18 and from -102 to -73% for delta H-2. An evaporation loss of up to 35% was found for the rivers in late summer, and this value was proportional to the area of lakes and wetlands in the elementary watershed. The initial isotope composition of the water in the tributaries prior to evaporation was estimated to be delta O-18 approximate to -14.1% and delta H-2 approximate to -103% on average and crossed the approximation and meteoric lines. This estimation was close to the average composition of the groundwater, i.e., delta O-18 approximate to -13.4% and delta H-2 approximate to 94% on the Lake Onega catchment. The slightly increased isotope depletion of the calculated composition in the initial river water in comparison with the groundwater was the result of the contribution of the spring snowmelt water, which had a significant influence on the lake water balance.

The maximum amount of the fungi occurred in winter and the minimum in summer. The seasonal changes of the fungi were closely related to dissolved O2 of water in the bottom layer and differed with species. Saprolegnia and Achlya flourished only in the circulation period, while Pythium was observed throughout a full year. The fungi were distributed only in the surface layer of bottom mud in deep lakes, but in mud .apprx. 10 cm deep in shallow lakes. The aquatic fungi in the lake bottom were distributed correlatively with lake types. The frequency and number of species of aquatic fungi were high in eutrophic lakes. However, the fungi were scarce in oligotrophic, distrophic and acidotrophic lakes.																			0143-1471						1981	25	4					249	257		10.1016/0143-1471(81)90087-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0143-1471(81)90087-8													WOS:A1981LY77300002

Spatial distribution and temporal variability in the forms of phosphorus in the Beaver River subwatershed of Lake Simcoe, Ontario, Canada	INLAND WATERS												Agricultural runoff is an important source of phosphorus (P) to surface waters. This paper investigated the relationship between agricultural land use and the forms of P (i.e., total phosphorus [TP], total dissolved phosphorus [TDP], and soluble reactive phosphorus [SRP]) in streams draining 8 headwater subcatchments in the Beaver River subwatershed, a major inflow to Lake Simcoe, which is a large hard-water lake in south-central Canada. The time period of analysis had a strong influence on the results. There was no relationship between percent total agriculture and average TP when concentrations were averaged over the entire 12-month (Jun 2010-May 2011) monitoring period, whereas there were significant positive correlations between agricultural land use and average TP during the summer season (Jun-Aug). Significant correlations between average stream TDP and SRP and percent pastureland were observed, although relationships were again dependent on the time period of analysis. Concentrations of TP, TDP, and SRP were highly variable over time, with maximum concentrations occurring during the winter months. This was illustrated by a single rain-on-snow event (11 mm) on 5 March 2011, when samples taken 3-4 h apart varied by as much as 100%. These results indicate that winter storm-targeted sampling is likely necessary to capture the full range of annual variability in P forms and concentrations.

The varying intensity is attributed to the different origin of the cormorants. No negative clinical signs in the cormorants were ascertained. Presumably a highly infected host is damaged seriously due to the feeding of C. rudolphii on the host's tissue in the case of reduced food availability. A coprological investigation carried out by flotation procedure refers to an intermittent excretion of eggs during the summer and winter. In vitro, larvae (L 2) hatching from eggs stay infectious in freshwater for at least 13 days. The common freshwater copepod Cyclops abyssorum praealpinus is infected by L 2 of C. rudolphii. Thus this copepod belongs to the first intermediate hosts. Cormorants shot during the summer at Lake Chiemsee (D) (n = 13) showed statistically significant lower abundance and prevalence (19,4 and 85%) of C. rudolphii compared to birds shot last winter in the same region. Presumably the occurrence of C. rudolphii in these birds indicates that fishes of Lake Chiemsee or nearby bodies of water are also infected with larvae of C. rudolphii. The presence of the parasite was not reported previously in these localities. Further investigation are needed particularly regarding to possible pathogenic effects on fishes and the public health question.																			1434-1239					JUL	1999	27	4					274	279																WOS:000081713800011
J	Nausch, M; Nausch, G				Nausch, Monika; Nausch, Guenther			Bioavailable dissolved organic phosphorus and phosphorus use by heterotrophic bacteria	AQUATIC BIOLOGY												Dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) concentrations were measured in surface water at 3 stations in the central Baltic Sea from May to July 2005. The amount of bioavailable DOP (BAP) was estimated in time course experiments using 0.8 mu m filtered seawater and carbon plus nitrogen additions with the aim of verifying results obtained in 2004. The consumption of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) and DOP by heterotrophic bacteria under natural water conditions was determined in parallel experiments without any substrate amendment. In both years, most DOP and BAP concentrations were in the same range of between 0.20 and 0.31 mu M, and 0.04 and 0.12 mu M, respectively, with a tendency to decline from spring to summer. BAP constituted a proportion of 33.2 to 60.0% of DOP. Bacterial phosphorus use differed between the Gotland and Bornholm Basins. In the eastern and south-eastern Gotland Basin, DIP was taken up completely, independently from initial concentrations in substrate addition experiments. Without any substrate addition, less DIP was used in May. In subsequent investigations in June and July, the DIP was taken up in full. Under natural conditions, the uptake of BAP ranged between 18 and 78% and reached 100% in summer when heterocystous cyanobacteria occurred in surface water. In the Bornholm Basin, all the BAP was used in July despite the availability of DIP. These results indicate that the phosphorus uptake in both basins may be carbon and/or nitrogen limited in May. The limitation was repressed in summer in the Gotland Basin, but was sustained in the Bornholm Basin. Thus, the BAP use could satisfy the carbon demand in the Bornholm Basin, whereas it fulfils the phosphorus demand in the Gotland Basin.																			1864-7790						2007	1	2					151	160		10.3354/ab00012	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ab00012													WOS:000259452200006
J	BOHNCKE, SJP				BOHNCKE, SJP			LATE-GLACIAL ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGES IN THE NETHERLANDS - SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The history of vegetational changes during the Weichselian Lateglacial in the Netherlands is based primarily on pollen records derived from lacustrine sediments. They provide a fairly consistent picture of progressive, followed by retrogressive, vegetation succession through time. Problems arise, however, when we try to match pollen records obtained from terrestrial peat sequences with those obtained from lacustrine deposits. This is especially the case at around about 12,000 BP: conditions seem to have varied significantly depending on the geomorphological position of individual site. Terrestrial sites are more prone to hiatuses in response to episodes of pronounced reductions in effective precipitation. The spread of Pinus from ca. 11,300 BP, which has been interpreted traditionally as a successive phase in vegetational development, coincides with changes in the local vegetation that indicate more intense freeze-thaw conditions. More continental conditions are assumed, implying more severe winters by comparison with the preceding time-interval. At ca. 10,850 BP, both vegetation and coleopteran evidence indicate a distinct drop in the average July temperature, from 18-15-degrees-C to 11-10-degrees-C. Consequently, the mean annual temperature was also lowered (estimated to between -2 and -5-degrees-C) and conditions approximated those of permafrost environments. Simultaneously, effective precipitation increased considerably resulting in a pronounced rise in lake-levels arid large-scale floodings of rivers. Soon after, at ca. 10,500 BP, summer temperatures appear to have risen while effective precipitation declined considerably resulting in a fall in lake-levels and periodic exposure of river beds, which provided sources for the accumulation of large inland dunes.																			0277-3791						1993	12	8					707	717		10.1016/0277-3791(93)90008-A	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-3791(93)90008-A													WOS:A1993NW63200008

This species was found to breed all the year except for the coldest periods but a larger spring peak and a smaller autumn peak were discernible. Cyclic changes in the proportion of adults (specimens > 7.0 mm. length) and in size-structure of the population together with low fecundity suggested that a period of acute starvation coincided with the later period of breeding. The ratio of food to population size seemed to be readjusted by mortality. This hypothesis was supported by results of field experiments in which increasing the absolute and relative amounts of food eliminated or delayed symptoms of food shortage. Evidence was also obtained by observing the entire populations of two small habitats that mortality was a readjusting factor. Field experiments with P. tenuis which behaves similarly but with different timing, corroborated these results. Examination of seasonal changes in the reproductive organs of P. nigra showed that cyclic events stemmed from ecological rather than physiological causes with water temperature a modifying factor.																			0021-8790	1365-2656					1962	31	2					273	291		10.2307/2141	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2141													WOS:A1962WV72900006

The solute composition of stream waters at the ELW can be divided into three periods: snowpack runoff, a transition period in summer as snowpack runoff decreases and little precipitation occurs, and a low-flow period from late summer through winter. Each period has different geochemical controls on the solute composition of surface waters. During snowpack runoff approximately 50% of stream flow was from direct surface runoff and approximately 50% of stream flow was return flow from subsurface reservoirs. Hydrologic residence time of subsurface water at maximum snowpack runoff was measured directly with a (LiBr)-Li-6 tracer and varied from 9 to 20 h. Three independent measurements show that the acidity in snowpack runoff was neutralized by cation exchange in soils and talus. Discharge from soil reservoirs was the primary source of stream flow during the summer transition period when the composition of stream flow was congruent with the stoichiometry of plagioclase weathering. Processes occurring below the soil zone exerted the dominant geochemical controls on the composition of stream waters during the period of low flow, with preferential weathering of the anorthite component of plagioclase in subsurface rock and further weathering of kaolinite to gibbsite.																			0024-3590					JUN	1993	38	4					775	797		10.4319/lo.1993.38.4.0775	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1993.38.4.0775													WOS:A1993LP66200006
J	Aroviita, J; Hämäläinen, H				Aroviita, Jukka; Hamalainen, Heikki			The impact of water-level regulation on littoral macroinvertebrate assemblages in boreal lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Regulation of lake water level for power production and flood control is among the major anthropogenic disturbances in boreal aquatic ecosystems. In Finland, over 300 lakes, representing one third of the total inland water area of the country, are artificially regulated. To study the effects of regulation on lake littoral macroinvertebrate communities, samples were taken from upper stony littoral and from lower soft bottom littoral habitats of 11 lakes with different regulation amplitudes (wintertime fall in water level 1.19-6.75 m). Twelve unregulated (wintertime fall in water level 0.11-0.55 m) lakes with otherwise similar characteristics were used as a reference. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling ordinations showed that the composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages was strongly associated with the amplitude of water level regulation. Taxon richness also decreased with increasing intensity of regulation. Freezing and flushing of sediments in late winter are probably the most important factors leading to the impoverished littoral macroinvertebrate fauna. Invertebrates with long life cycle seem to be particularly vulnerable to unnatural water level fluctuation. Our results show that regulation of water level has a major impact on functionally significant lake littoral macroinvertebrates.

J	Kasahara, S; Koyama, K				Kasahara, Satoe; Koyama, Kazuo			Population trends of common wintering waterfowl in Japan: participatory monitoring data from 1996 to 2009	ORNITHOLOGICAL SCIENCE												We analyzed population trends of 13 waterfowl (Anseriformes) species wintering in Japan during a 14-year period (1996-2009). We used data from annual volunteer-participatory waterfowl count surveys which were conducted in Japan by the Ministry of the Environment and local prefectural governments. Population indices and long-term trends of each species were calculated using TRIM (TRends and Indices for Monitoring data). TRIM is a freeware program developed for analysis of time series count data with missing observations. During the 14 years, seven species exhibited significant long-term declines, while four species showed long-term increases. Most of the species that showed long term declines were characterized as being water-surface foraging species, species breeding in both middle and high latitude regions, or species using rice fields. Most species that showed long-term increases were characterized as diving species, species breeding at high latitude or species rarely using rice fields. We calculated composite indices for these groups. The group of water-surface foraging species showed declines in river, natural lakes and artificial lakes, except reservoirs, when each habitat was analyzed separately. In contrast, the group of diving foraging species showed an increase in estuarine habitat. We suggest that changes in: water quality, breeding habitat in the middle latitude region, and in cultivation methods in rice fields, have affected population changes of some species and groups.																			1347-0558					JUN	2010	9	1					23	36		10.2326/osj.9.23	http://dx.doi.org/10.2326/osj.9.23													WOS:000282418500003

During the winter and spring, chloride (Cl ) is readily transported from paved surfaces to stormwater management facilities in a matter of hours to days. According to earlier studies, densimetric stratification in end-ofpipe stormwater management facilities such as wet stormwater management ponds (SWMPs) can result in latencies in Cl transport to receiving waters. As a result, wet SWMPs may generate Cl pulses in streams that exceed thresholds of acute toxicity to aquatic biota. This study identified the prevalence of this phenomenon at five headwater streams receiving discharge from wet SWMPs within the Greater Toronto Area over two years. All receiving streams in this study experienced exceedances of the chronic CWQG for Cl downstream of the SWMP outlet, while only some experienced exceedances of the acute CWQG for Cl . For most of the salting season, SWMP contributions exacerbate downstream Cl concentrations, and occasionally are the primary driver of exceedances. Bottom-draw SWMPs were found to accumulate Cl and flush rapidly following a rain or melt event. Top-draw SWMPs accumulated Cl throughout the salting season and released diluted concentrations of Cl near the end of the season. Streams with large upstream catchments diluted SWMP contributions and ameliorated downstream Cl concentrations.

Particularly during the high-temperature summer months, localized regions of Qiandaohu Reservoir have exhibited markedly elevated concentrations of odor compounds. To investigate the intricate relationships among odor compounds, algae communities, and environmental factors in Qiandaohu Reservoir, and to forestall the impact of odor compounds on the quality of drinking water, this research implemented a systematic monthly survey to monitor several types of odor compounds, algal communities, physicochemical factors, and associated synthetases. The result demonstrated that the odor issue in Qiandaohu Reservoir is not yet severe. Among the detected compounds, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyldisulfide, and beta-cyclocitral were all below the odor threshold, while dimethyl trisulfide, 2-methylisoborneol, geosmin, and beta-ionone exceeded the odor threshold in some samples. The odor compounds are jointly influenced by abiotic environmental conditions and algae, presenting conspicuous horizontal, vertical, and seasonal distribution disparities. Notably, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and the TN/TP ratio exert a substantial influence. Algae play a pivotal role in contributing to these odor compounds, warranting particular attention to the composition and dynamic alterations of the algal community during the summer and autumn seasons. This research comprehensively investigates the spatiotemporal patterns, sources, and controlling factors of odor compounds in a large drinking water source reservoir with relatively lower trophic status, providing new insights into odor management in such ecosystems.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				AUG 20	2025	197	9							1031	10.1007/s10661-025-14505-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-025-14505-5								40836189					WOS:001554601100001

Recent studies have shown that global warming potentially affects the risk of flooding and that the decisive factor for flood events is not temperature, but precipitation characteristics and hydrological conditions. Flood events have numerous impacts on social, economic and environmental aspects depending on how humans have altered lands, natural rivers and lake dynamics. Flood protection measures can cause conflicts with conservation measures and with ecosystem services because natural capital is not considered able to control floods and to contribute control floods and that it can contribute to human health and safety. In this paper we analysed the flood events in Lake Maggiore for return time periods of 3 - 5 - 10 - 25 - 50 - 100 - 250 - 500 years, considering the flood frequency in the last ten years using 1868-2021 as a reference period. We discussed the probability distribution of flood peaks, the correlation and linear regression between the lake level fluctuations and macroinvertebrates occurrence. We also presented lake coasts flood hazard mapping. The probability distribution that better describes the annual peak level distribution, is the Gumbel function, while for spring and autumn flood events the better distribution is the Log-Pearson type III. One of the historical flood events in terms of magnitude was in 2000, characterized by a return time of about 50 years. The last flood event in 2020, was characterized by a return period of about 10 years. Considering the seasonal frequency of flood, the autumn magnitude was higher than the spring one, and the differences between seasonal flood events progressively increased. For a return time period of 3 years, a difference of a few cm is expected, while for a return time of 500, years a difference of 1.5 m is feasible. The results suggested a high probability of a flood event every three years and also a forecast of a flood of about 197 m asl (3.14 m above the average lake level) every 10 years. Raising the lake level will affect the reed bed area from 193 m asl, and it will be more effective at 194.5 m (up to a 10% reduction). During flood events, the whole reed bed area is submerged. As regard macroinvertebrates composition and abundance, the first results show significant negative relationships between all sampling stations altogether vs the abundance of Cladotanytarsus sp. (Chironominae) and nearly significant positive relationships between water levels at Magadino vs Pscectrocladius sordidellus (Orthocladiinae) abundances. These few results are perhaps due to the current limited data availability.					; Kamburska, Lyudmila/ABG-2391-2020; Ciampittiello, Marzia/AAY-1694-2020; Boggero, Angela/F-2950-2016; Saidi, Helmi/M-3880-2016	Ciampittiello, Marzia/0000-0001-6403-0493; Kamburska, Lyudmila/0000-0001-5071-6953; Zaupa, Silvia/0000-0001-7379-6087; Boggero, Angela/0000-0002-7534-3126; Saidi, Helmi/0000-0002-8437-0249													1129-5767	1723-8633					2022	81			2					2141	10.4081/jlimnol.2022.2141	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2022.2141													WOS:001089390500007

Scale samples were collected from wild (intergrade) and stocked (Florida) largemouth bass during spring 1995. Stocked fish were tagged with coded wire tags to ensure proper identification. During fall 1995, 88 age-0 wild and stocked largemouth bass were collected by electrofishing. Using linear discriminant function analysis, correct classification for the 71 wild fish was 97%, while correct classification for the 17 stocked fish ranged from 53% to 82%. Scale pattern analysis is an alternative technique for evaluating large mouth bass stocking programs.																									1998							104	110																WOS:000165216700012

Aphanizomenon ovalisporum reappeared in diminished amounts in the summer and fall of 1995. These events are the first record of significant quantities of a potentially toxic nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium in this lake. No definite provenance of inoculum has been identified, although A.ovalisporum was also observed in a newly reflooded area (Lake Agmon) in the catchment. Unusually high water temperatures and low wind inputs were observed prior to and during the A.ovalisporum bloom period. These, together with possibly enhanced availability of phosphorus or other growth factors, may have contributed to the cyanobacterium growth in 1994. Phosphorus limitation, as indicated by high cellular alkaline phosphatase activity, the onset of stormy conditions and a fall in water temperatures led to the demise of the 1994 bloom. Although the A.ovalisporum bloom in 1994 had no serious direct impact on water quality, the continued presence of a potentially toxic cyanobacterium in Lake Kinneret, a major national water supply source, is a cause for serious concern.																			0142-7873					JUL	1998	20	7					1321	1339		10.1093/plankt/20.7.1321	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/20.7.1321													WOS:000075260000009

The current velocity magnitudes were generally found to be small. The most pronounced currents had an oscillating character, with velocity amplitudes on the order of millimeters per second. The oscillation period, obtained from spectral density calculations, corresponded to that of a barotropic uninodal seiche. The seichelike nature of the current oscillations was supported by the results from analysis of ice-level fluctuations, giving identical periods and a phase shift of one-fourth the period between the two types of oscillations. Mean currents measured during the winter were on the order of millimeters per second. Because Lake Vendyurskoe does not have any significant river inflow or outflow during winter, the most probable cause of these currents is horizontal temperature (pressure) gradients. Scaling analysis indicated that these currents are geostrophic. This was supported by theoretical estimates, based on observed horizontal temperature gradients, being of the same order as the observed currents. The mean current velocities increased considerably after spring convection from <1 to several millimeters per second.

J	Zhang, B; Schwartz, FW; Liu, G				Zhang, Bo; Schwartz, Franklin W.; Liu, Ganming			Systematics in the size structure of prairie pothole lakes through drought and deluge	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												This study examines the response of a complex lake-wetland system to variations in climate. The focus is on the lakes and wetlands of the Prairie Coteau, which is part of the larger Prairie Pothole Region of the Central Plains of North America. Information on lake size was enumerated from satellite images and aerial photos and yielded power law relationships for different hydrological conditions. Of particular interest is a recent drought and deluge sequence, 1988-1992 and 1993-1998. Results showed that lake sizes followed well-defined power laws that changed intra-annually and interannually as a function of climate. The power laws for spring seasons in 1987, 1990, 1992, 1997, and 2002 have a relatively constant slope. However, slopes changed with time within each year. These lines produced from Landsat images and aerial photos describe a systematic variation in sizes for lakes ranging in area from 100 m(2) to more than 30,000 m(2). This tendency for lake size to follow a power law coupled with area measurement from aerial photos taken on 29 July 1939 provides a basis for reconstructing the distribution of pothole lakes in summer 1939, near the end of the Dust Bowl drought. The study shows that the areas of smaller lakes are profoundly affected seasonally by the spring snowmelt and evaporation. The areas of larger lakes are influenced more slowly by longer-term periods of drought and deluge.																			0043-1397					APR 22	2009	45								W04421	10.1029/2008WR006878	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2008WR006878													WOS:000265539800001
J	Tirok, K; Gaedke, U				Tirok, Katrin; Gaedke, Ursula			Regulation of planktonic ciliate dynamics and functional composition during spring in Lake Constance	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Protozoans are among the most important grazers of phytoplankton and remineralizers of nutrients in marine and freshwater ecosystems, but less is known about the regulation of their population dynamics. We analyzed a 12 yr data set of ciliate biomass and species composition in large, deep Lake Constance to understand the factors influencing ciliate spring development. The start of ciliate net growth in spring was closely linked to that of edible algae, chlorophyll a and the vertical mixing intensity, but independent of water temperature. During ciliate spring growth, the relative contribution of ciliated interception feeders was positively related to that of cryptomonads, whereas the relative contribution of filter feeders correlated positively with that of non-cryptomonads. The duration of ciliate dominance in spring was largely controlled by the highly variable onset of the phytoplankton bloom, as the termination of the ciliate bloom was less variable. During years with an extended spring bloom of algae and ciliates, internally forced species shifts were observed in both communities. Interception feeders alternated with filter feeders in their relative importance as did cryptomonads and non-cryptomonads. Extended spring blooms were observed when vertical mixing intensity was low at low temperatures during early spring, which will become less likely under the anticipated climate change scenarios. The termination of the ciliate spring bloom occurred prior to a reduction in food concentration and mostly also prior to the mass development of daphnids alone, but coincided with increased grazing by various predators together, such as rotifers, copepods and daphnids in late May/early June.																			0948-3055	1616-1564				OCT 16	2007	49	1					87	100		10.3354/ame01127	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame01127													WOS:000250858600008
J	Redwan, M; Elhaddad, E				Redwan, Mostafa; Elhaddad, Engy			Heavy metal pollution in Manzala Lake sediments, Egypt: sources, variability, and assessment	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The environmental pollution of lake systems due to anthropogenic factors is of growing concern worldwide. Manzala Lake is the largest northern coastal-deltaic lakes of Egypt and has socioeconomic impacts. In this study, the concentrations and origins of seven heavy metals (HMs) and the organic content in the Manzala Lake sediments were explored during the winter and summer. The concentration of the HMs and the organic content were quantified using inductively coupled plasma and loss-on-ignition techniques. Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied to evaluate the sources of the metals in the sediments. The HMs and organic matter were enriched during the winter season. The average concentrations of the HMs in the sediments conformed to the following sequence: Fe (14.13) > Mn (0.8) > Cu (0.11) > Zn (0.11) > Ni (0.06) > Pb (0.5) > Cd (0.002) (mg/kg). Sediment quality protocols showed that Mn, Cd, Cu, and Ni pose a significant threat to the aquatic environment in Manzala Lake. The geoaccumulation index (I-geo) values indicated pollution of the sediments with most metals, excluding Fe and Ni. The periodic mean I-geo pollution level followed the sequence Cd > Cu > Zn > Mn > Pb > Ni > Fe. The greatest pollution load index noted during the winter season was principally induced by Cd and Cu. The overall ecological risk index was moderate, with Cd being the most prominent HM. PCA combined with PCC showed that the HM enrichments in the southern (Bahr Al-Baqar Drain [S1], Bashteer [S3], Legan [S5], and Al-Ginka [S8]) and the extreme northeastern (El-Qapouti [S6]) parts of Manzala Lake sediments were mainly due to the discharge from different drains (industrial, agricultural, and municipal wastes) and the industrial region in Port Said, respectively. The lower HM concentrations from the extreme northern parts (Al-Boghaz [S2], Al-Temsah [S4], Al-Hamra [S7], and Al-Kowar [S9]) were due to their isolation from urban areas compared with the other localities. Extensive waste disposal was responsible for the HM pollution in the Manzala Lake sediments. Advanced treatment technologies and monitoring of the pollution in the water and sediments of Manzala Lake are required to decrease the accumulation of the heavy metals.

SIMULATING PLANKTON BIOMASS AND THE TIMING OF PHYTOPLANKTON BLOOMS	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The response of plankton biomass in Lake Mjosa, Norway, to changes in exogeneous factors during the years 1976-87 is studied by using a simulation model of the lake ecosystem. The model includes mechanisms required to test the Sverdrup hypothesis for the initiation of the spring phytoplankton bloom, and it includes zooplankton grazing and thermocline erosion which is important factors contributing to the formation of a second autumn bloom. The model describes 45% of the observed inter annual variance in chl-a, but only the right order of magnitude for the zooplankton biomass. The model describes 35% of the variance in the timing of the onset of phytoplankton growth (p = 0.03) and 41% of the variance in the timing of the second bloom (p = 0.07). However, 4 of 12 simulated annual time series showed only one bloom. The OECD regression model for chl-a as a function of TP concentration and flushing rate explained 50% of the variance in chl-a, but a zooplankton regression model did not explain the observed variance in zooplankton biomass. A published regression model for the timing of the spring bloom gave a negative correlation with the observed bloom.																			1015-1621						1991	53	2-3					239	262		10.1007/BF00877061	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00877061													WOS:A1991FZ65600005

Estimated numbers of migrant dragonflies involved in these flights were approximately 1.2 million, >400,000, and 200,000, respectively We also document other recent observations of large swarm migrations of dragonflies in eastern North America, review previous reports of this phenomenon, and compare these events to the flights at Chicago, Cape May and Crescent Beach. Records of large drag onfly migrations show several distinct patterns: (1) all reports fell between late July and mid-October, with a peak in September; (2) most of the large flights occurred along topographic leading lines such as coastlines and lakeshores; (3) massive swarm migrations generally followed the passage of synoptic-scale cold fronts; and (4) the common green darner (Anax junius) was the principal species involved in the majority of these flights. Striking parallels between the patterns of seasonal timing, geographical distribution, and meteorological context of dragonfly migrations and those of birds suggest that similar causal factors are involved.																			0003-0031	1938-4238				OCT	1998	140	2					325	342		10.1674/0003-0031(1998)140[0325:MSMODO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1674/0003-0031(1998)140[0325:MSMODO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000076836500013

Diversity of freshwater Epsilonproteobacteria and dark inorganic carbon fixation in the sulphidic redoxcline of a meromictic karstic lake	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												Sulfidic redoxclines are a suitable niche for the growth and activity of different chemo- and photolithotrophic sulphide-oxidizing microbial groups such as the Epsilonproteobacteria and the green sulfur bacteria ( GSB). We have investigated the diversity, abundance and contribution to inorganic carbon uptake of Epsilonproteobacteria in a meromictic basin of Lake Banyoles. CARD-FISH counts revealed that Epsilonproteobacteria were prevalent at the redoxcline in winter ( maximum abundance of 2 x 10(6) cells mL(-1), approximate to 60% of total cells) but they were nearly absent in summer, when GSB bloomed. This seasonal trend was supported by 16S rRNA gene pyrotag datasets, which revealed that the epsilonproteobacterial community was mainly composed of a member of the genus Arcobacter. In situ incubations using (NaHCO3)-C-14 and MAR-CARD-FISH observations showed that this population assimilated CO2 in the dark, likely being mainly responsible for the autotrophic activity at the redoxcline in winter. Clone libraries targeting the aclB gene provided additional evidence of the potential capacity of these epsilonproteobacteria to fix carbon via rTCA cycle. Our data reinforce the key role of Epsilonproteobacteria in linking carbon and sulphur cycles, extend their influence to freshwater karstic lakes and raise questions about the actual contribution of chemolithotrophy at their redoxcline and euxinic water compartments.

In 1986, Plexiglas incubators filled with fertilized lake trout eggs were buried by scuba divers in rock rubble at two sites. The incubators then were attached to chains between large trap-net anchors on the bottom and left over winter. At one site, egg hatch rate was significantly higher in incubators that remained buried in substrate (24%) than in incubators that were dislodged out onto the substrate (13%). At the other, more exposed site, no significant difference was found in percent hatch between eggs that incubated in (10%) and on (8%) the substrate. Percent hatch at both sites was significantly lower than that (40%) of eggs from the same source that were incubated in controlled laboratory conditions. In autumn, concentrations of dissolved ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and nitrate near bottom and in the substrate posed no threat to lake trout embryos and were not correlated with hatch rate; concentrations differed significantly between the two sites. During winter, 15 cm of sediment settled from the water onto the reef but did not accumulate or smother the eggs. The bioassay procedure is easy to implement, is recommended for the use in the Great Lakes, and could be adapted easily for use elsewhere.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				MAR	1989	118	2					175	182		10.1577/1548-8659(1989)118<0175:FTOABP>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1989)118<0175:FTOABP>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1989DC50200008

The wt-length relationship of all mature charr differed very significantly from that of mature charr of normal growth, and can be described by the equation y = -2.36 + 3.27 x. Some mature charr tentatively identified as dwarfs by their slow growth differed very significantly in wt-length relationship from mature charr of normal growth. But there were no significant differences between mature dwarfs and immature charr of both normal and dwarf growth as regards wt-length relationship.																			0020-6466						1978	38	2					216	219																WOS:A1978GC11300008

A Survey of Bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) of the Indiana Dunes and Northwest Indiana, USA	JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY												The Indiana Dunes, and nearby natural areas in northwest Indiana, are floristically rich Midwest U.S. locales with many habitat types. We surveyed bees along a habitat gradient ranging from grasslands to forests in these locales, collecting at least 175 bee species along this gradient plus 29 additional species in other nearby habitats. About 25% of all species were from the genus Lasioglossum and 12% of the species were associated with sandy soils. Several bumblebee (Bombus) species of conservation concern that should occur in this region were not collected during our surveys. Similarity of the northwest Indiana bee fauna to other published U.S. faunas decreased about 1.3% per 100 km distance from northwest Indiana. Thirty percent or bees netted from flowers were males. Males and females differed significantly in their frequency of occurrence on different plant species. For bees collected in bowl traps, the percentage captured in fluorescent yellow traps declined and in fluorescent blue traps increased from spring to late summer. Capture rates for different bee genera varied temporally, with about a quarter of the genera being captured most frequently in late spring and a quarter in late summer. Capture rates for most genera were higher in more open than in more closed canopy habitats. The maximum number of plant species on which a single bee species was captured plateaued at 24, on average. Forty-nine percent of bee species known to occur in Indiana were found at these northwest Indiana sites. Having this relatively high proportion of the total Indiana bee fauna is consistent with Indiana Dunes existing at a biogeographic crossroads where grassland and forest biomes meet in a landscape whose climate and soils are affected by proximity to Lake Michigan. The resulting habitat, plant, edaphic, and climatic diversity likely produces the diverse bee community documented.

J	Williams, GP; Walton, AC				Williams, Gustavious Paul; Walton, Ashley Childers			Method for Estimating Sediment Mass Movement from Delta Recutting: A Case Study Using Single Beam Sonar in Deer Creek Reservoir	WATER												The recutting of delta sediments typically occurs during reservoir drawdown in the summer months. It can affect various reservoir processes and can impact water quality because of resuspending nutrients during warm periods supports phytoplankton growth. Quantifying this sediment movement is a key element for evaluating the life and quality of a reservoir. This study targets reservoirs in the intermountain region of the U.S. These reservoirs are filled in the spring, then drawdown through the summer to provide irrigation water. Incoming sediment loads are generally restricted to spring high flows, with little new sediment entering the reservoirs during the remainder of the year. As the reservoirs undergo drawdown, the sediment deposited in the delta region during spring flows is re-cut from the exposed delta and moved into submerged delta region. The majority of flow and sediment movement both above and below the water surface occurs in channels cut into the sediments during spring deposition. During recutting, channels in the exposed sediments often move, but the submerged channels are more stationary. Traditional single-beam sonar surveys are performed on a grid and changes are used to quantify sediment movements. This approach is not applicable to delta recutting as the grid resolution is not sufficient to resolve the relevant changes that occur in the narrow excised flow channels. This study explores the ability to quantify and monitor sediment mass movement in Deer Creek Reservoir (DCR) using a single beam sonar. Our method uses surveyed cross-sections across the flow channels. It is difficult to position boat passes exactly on previous survey lines, and small location differences in an up-stream or down-stream location can be significant because of the slope of the channel. To address this, we surveyed each line in two directions, then interpolated both the position and elevation data. We performed periodic surveys over a two-month period. We were able to document and quantify both sediment deposition and erosion areas. As expected, sediment movement was from the inlet areas toward the reservoir. The data showed both deposition and erosion depending on the distance from the reservoir head, which changed over the survey period. This method can be used to quantify sediment recutting and resuspension that can affect nutrient loads during critical warm, low-reservoir conditions, but is difficult to implement accurately.

J	HOBBIE, JE; CORLISS, TL; PETERSON, BJ				HOBBIE, JE; CORLISS, TL; PETERSON, BJ			SEASONAL PATTERNS OF BACTERIAL ABUNDANCE IN AN ARCTIC LAKE	ARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												Total bacterial numbers were determined at different times of the year in an arctic lake (0.1-3.1 .times. 106 cells ml-1), its inlet and outlet streams (0.4-2.9 .times. 106 cells ml-1) and in the nearby Kuparuk River (0.3-2.7 .times. 106 cells ml-1). Bacterial counts were made with epifluorescence microscopy and acridine orange staining. The highest numbers of bacteria in Toolik Lake were found in the summer. The distribution with depth was irregular and maximum cell numbers in the water column were found at various depths. Small cells with a volume .ltoreq. 0.1 .mu.m3 made up the majority of the population in the streams. The peak spring-time bacterial counts observed in the streams and the lake presumably reflected the input of terrestrial bacteria and nutrients in run-off water. Within the lake, the spring peak of bacteria numbers occurred at the same depths that streamwater occurred (as traced with a fluorescent dye). Within a stream, no consistent correlations were found between discharge and bacterial numbers. A comparison of cell numbers between the Kuparuk River and the Toolik Inlet stream revealed a good correlation indicating common controlling factors such as the timing of surface run-off entering the streams. In general, the numbers found are similar to those in temperate lakes and streams.																			0004-0851						1983	15	2					253	259		10.2307/1550926	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1550926													WOS:A1983QU36100010
J	Prasad, S; Brauer, A; Rein, B; Negendank, JFW				Prasad, S; Brauer, A; Rein, B; Negendank, JFW			Rapid climate change during the early Holocene in western Europe and Greenland	HOLOCENE												Based on microfacies analyses of seasonally laminated varved sediments from lake Holzmaar, Germany, we report evidence of decadal- to century-scale climate variability during the early Holocene. The shifts in climate are documented in the thickness variations and changes in the composition of the varves in response to subtle shifts in limnological conditions. The close similarity between the Holzinaar varve record and the GRIP oxygen isotope record during 7.4-9.0 calendar (cal.) ka suggests that the high frequency climatic variations in both regions were controlled by the same mechanism. Our more detailed studies covering the central 409-yr period (similar to 7.846-8.255 cal. ka, encompassing the 8.2 ka event) document for the first time, on a seasonal scale, the changing precipitation regimes in western Europe during these climate shifts. We show (i) that winters were drier and summers shorter and cooler in western Europe during colder periods in Greenland, (ii) in contrast to the present-day climate in the Holzmaar region, summer rains were clearly reduced during the early Holocene, and (iii) the climate not only changed rapidly (< 5 years) but recurring drier events were common during the studied period. In the Holzmaar record, the 8.2 ka event is the most prominent and longest of a series of short-term climatic oscillations.

J	Yang, DQ; Peterson, A				Yang, Daqing; Peterson, Amber			River Water Temperature in Relation to Local Air Temperature in the Mackenzie and Yukon Basins	ARCTIC												Water temperature has an important impact on many aspects of basin hydrology and ecology. In the northern regions, investigation of river thermal regimes and their changes over space and time is a challenge because of data limitations. This study determines the water temperature regimes at several locations within the Yukon and Mackenzie River basins and examines their relationship with air temperature. The Yukon and Mackenzie Rivers have distinct water temperature dynamics. They remain near zero from freeze-up in the fall to ice breakup in the spring and reach their peak temperature during mid-summer. For the locations examined, peak mean monthly water temperatures ranged from 9 degrees to 15 degrees C, and mean July air temperatures ranged from 13 degrees to 16 degrees C. The lags between water and air temperatures ranged from 1 to 40 days. The largest lag was found at the Great Bear River monitoring location, since water temperature at this site is strongly influenced by the heat storage of Great Bear Lake. Tests of three models, linear regression, logical regression (s-shape), and the physically based air2stream model, show that the air2stream model provided the best results, followed by logical regression. Linear regression gave the poorest result. Model estimates of water temperature from air temperature were slightly improved by the inclusion of discharge data. The water temperature sampling regimes had a considerable effect on model performance; long-term data provide a more robust test of a model. Comparisons of mean monthly water temperatures suggest significant spatial variability and some inconsistency between upstream and downstream sites that is due mainly to differences in data collection schemes. This study strongly demonstrates the need to improve water temperature monitoring in the northern regions.

J	Moradi, M				Moradi, Masoud			Interannual and intra-annual cycles of satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Caspian Sea	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Variability of phytoplankton in the Caspian Sea (CS) is related to the complex orography, the variety of physical and chemical processes, and climatic indices. Here, interannual and intra-annual variability of satellite-derived chlorophyll -a concentrations (Chl-a) were studied using wavelet analysis during 2002-2019 in different regions of the CS. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) analysis performed to classify the CS into the areas of similar variability of satellite-derived Chl-a. Wavelet spectral analysis showed that the Chl-a variability regulated by four primary periodic cycles: 0.5-year, 1-year, 2 to 2.5-year, and 3 to 5-year. The 0.5 and 1-year wavelet cycles mostly depicted the intensity of seasonality patterns. The 2-2.5-year and 3-5-year cycles of Chl-a showed non-stationary coherence with corresponding low-frequency cycles of NAO and ENSO. The 3-5-year wavelet amplitudes of Chl-a strongly correlated with NAO and ENSO in the southern CS. Weak correlations of 2-2.5-year cycle wavelet amplitudes of Chl-a with NAO and ENSO suggested that variations do not always directly translate to a biological response. A negative anomaly in the Chl-a autumn peaks observed during 2011-2016 in the middle and southern CS, when NAO phases were persistently positive. The interannual variations of summer peaks in the northern CS, and autumn peaks in the middle and southern CS were broadly related to the precipitation. SST and wind stress. Moreover, it was shown that the Volga discharge has a significant influence on Chl-a variability in the northern CS. (c) 2021 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

J	Casamitjana, X; Serra, T; Soler, M; Colomer, J				Casamitjana, X; Serra, T; Soler, M; Colomer, J			A study of the evolution of the particle boundary layer in a reservoir, using laser particle sizing	WATER RESEARCH												The dynamics of the particle boundary layer in the Boadella reservoir was studied using an in situ laser optical particle-sizing instrument. This layer was found at the bottom of the reservoir from summer until the end of the year, when the reservoir was fully mixed. Most of the particles in this layer are remnants of the summer algae bloom and are trapped in the boundary layer due to the thermal stratification. The phytoplankton bloom is mainly composed of diatoms, with diameter d similar to 5 mum and green algae with diameter d similar to 15 mum. Inorganic particles and decomposed organic particles with d < 3 mum are also encountered in the boundary layer. On the other hand, particles with diameter between 30 and 100 mum are mostly found in the epilimnion of the reservoir. These are a mixture of aggregates of inorganic particles, colonies of phytoplankton, zooplankton, detritus, etc. Different mixing events occurring during autumn resuspended the small particles in the boundary layer, while the greater particles settled down. The extent of the resuspension has been parameterized with a non-dimensional number that balances the stress across the interface and the strength of the stratification.

J	Obolkina, LA				Obolkina, L. A.			Planktonic ciliates of Lake Baikal	HYDROBIOLOGIA					3rd Symposium on Species in Ancient Lakes	SEP 02-07, 2002	Quincy, WA					The current list of planktonic ciliates dwelling in Lake Baikal numbers 102 species, 81 of which are considered as euplanktonic. This plankton ciliate community is characterised by high percentages of oligotrichs and gymnostomes, 28 and 27%, respectively. One third of these ciliates are cold-stenothermic species, with temperature optimum preference of 0-4 degrees C, including all the species believed endemic. They develop only in under-ice plankton though remaining present in the water column until June-July. The other two thirds of planktonic ciliates are eurythermic and widespread in lakes of the Northern Hemisphere or cosmopolitan. Two maxima occur annually in baikalian planktonic ciliates: the first in March-April and the other in August-September. They coincide with the annual maximal development of phytoplankton. During years of low to middle-level primary production, the summer maximum of protozooplankton has been higher than the spring one. But the latter can exceed the former in years of high primary production. Mean biomass of ciliates (in 0-50 m) reaches 140-500 mg m(-3) during maximum abundance, decreasing by 5-10 times in the rest of the year. Mixotrophic ciliates contribute up to 6% of the under-ice pelagic ciliate community but sharply increase to 80-90% in summer, augmenting the autotrophic plankton biomass by 30-10%. In the last decade, pelagic ciliates have seldom exceeded 4-5 thousand cells 1(-1) at maximum development, averaging 1-2 thousand cells 1(-1). The dominant role of nanooligitrichs and high percentage of mixotrophic ciliates are characteristic of summer plankton of Baikal. Planktonic ciliates in interstitial water of melting ice also make a significant contribution to total abundance. Their rapid increase in population, which can exceed 10 thousand cells 1(-1), is another peculiarity. It is thought that inter-annual dynamics of the ciliates are related with long-term cycles of baikalian phytoplankton.																			0018-8158					SEP 15	2006	568			1			193	199		10.1007/s10750-006-0315-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0315-9													WOS:000240688900028

Modelling climate change impacts on nutrients and primary production in coastal waters	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												There is high confidence that the anthropogenic increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) is causing modifications in the Earth's climate. Coastal waterbodies such as estuaries, bays and lagoons are among those most affected by the ongoing changes in climate. Being located at the land-sea interface, such waterbodies are subjected to the combined changes in the physical-chemical processes of atmosphere, upstream land and coastal waters. Particularly, climate change is expected to alter phytoplankton communities by changing their environmental drivers (especially climate-related), thus exacerbating the symptoms of eutrophication events, such as hypoxia, harmful algal blooms (HAB) and loss of habitat. A better understanding of the links between climate-related drivers and phytoplankton is therefore necessary for projecting climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Here we present the case study of the Zero river basin in Italy, one of the main contributors of freshwater and nutrient to the salt-marsh Palude di Cona, a coastal waterbody belonging to the lagoon of Venice. To project the impacts of climate change on freshwater inputs, nutrient loadings and their effects on the phytoplankton community of the receiving waterbody, we formulated and applied an integrated modelling approach made of: climate simulations derived by coupling a General Circulation Model (GCM) and a Regional Climate Model (RCM) under alternative emission scenarios, the hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the ecological model AQUATOX. Climate projections point out an increase of precipitations in the winter period and a decrease in the summer months, while temperature shows a significant increase over the whole year. Water discharge and nutrient loads simulated by SWAT show a tendency to increase (decrease) in the winter (summer) period. AQUATOX projects changes in the concentration of nutrients in the salt-marsh Palude di Cona, and variations in the biomass and species of the phytoplankton community. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Linnik, PN; Zhezherya, VA				Linnik, P. N.; Zhezherya, V. A.			Features of the Hydrochemical Regime of Water Bodies of Urbanized Areas in Summer: II. Coexisting Forms of Metals	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY												The article summarizes the results of studies of coexisting forms of metals (Al, Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, Zn, and Pb) in some lakes of the Kiev city for the period of 2007-2019. The data on seasonal distribution of the metals into the suspended and dissolved forms are presented. It is shown that some of them migrate mainly in the dissolved state, while others - in the composition of suspended solids. The temperature and oxygen stratification in the studied lakes significantly affects the content of metals and their distribution in the surface and bottom horizons. The deficiency of O-2 and the formation of anaerobic conditions contribute to intensified migration of some metals (Mn, Fe) from the bottom sediments to the water mass and reduces the migration mobility of other metals (for example, Cu, Pb), most likely due to the formation of metal sulfides. The data on the absolute and relative content of the labile fraction of dissolved metals as bioavailable and potentially toxic for aquatic organisms are presented. Special features of the metals distribution among complex compounds with various groups of natural organic matter (humic substances, carbohydrates, and protein-like compounds) are discussed. It is shown that in the summer and autumn period there is an increase in the share of neutral metal complexes with carbohydrates, as well as anionic and neutral compounds with a relatively low molecular weight (<= 5 kDa). It is noted that under conditions of climate change, these transformations can manifest themselves to an even greater extent.					; Linnik, Peter/S-5725-2019; Zhezherya, Vladislav/AAK-5774-2020	Linnik, Peter/0000-0002-2144-4052; 													1070-3632	1608-3350				DEC	2021	91	13					2827	2838		10.1134/S1070363221130119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1070363221130119													WOS:000751345400008

Diet of yellow-billed loons (Gavia adamsii) in Arctic lakes during the nesting season inferred from fatty acid analysis	POLAR BIOLOGY												Understanding the dietary habits of yellow-billed loons (Gavia adamsii) can give important insights into their ecology, however, studying the diet of loons is difficult when direct observation or specimen collection is impractical. We investigate the diet of yellow-billed loons nesting on the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska using quantitative fatty acid signature analysis. Tissue analysis from 26 yellow-billed loons and eleven prey groups (nine fish species and two invertebrate groups) from Arctic lakes suggests that yellow-billed loons are eating high proportions of Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis), broad whitefish (Coregonus nasus) and three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) during late spring and early summer. The prominence of blackfish in diets highlights the widespread availability of blackfish during the early stages of loon nesting, soon after spring thaw. The high proportions of broad whitefish and three-spined stickleback may reflect a residual signal from the coastal staging period prior to establishing nesting territories on lakes, when loons are more likely to encounter these species. Our analyses were sensitive to the choice of calibration coefficient based on data from three different species, indicating the need for development of loon-specific coefficients for future study and confirmation of our results. Regardless, fish that are coastally distributed and that successfully overwinter in lakes are likely key food items for yellow-billed loons early in the nesting season.					; Padula, Vinicius/H-7294-2012; Rosenberger, Amanda/R-9578-2018; Bromaghin, Jeffrey/B-5058-2009	Iverson, Sara/0000-0003-2842-4094; Rosenberger, Amanda/0000-0002-5520-8349; Bromaghin, Jeffrey/0000-0002-7209-9500													0722-4060	1432-2056				AUG	2015	38	8					1239	1247		10.1007/s00300-015-1690-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00300-015-1690-3													WOS:000358041600013

The government has enforced a fishing ban policy to restore and protect local fish populations. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of the early stage of the fishing ban by examining and analyzing the fish communities in Poyang Lake and its surrounding waters, and investigating the impacts of environmental factors on fish distribution and growth between 2022 and 2023. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the current status of fish resources in the Poyang Lake basin but also offer a scientific foundation for the restoration and management of the water ecosystem. Between 2022 and 2023, four systematic fish surveys were carried out in the Poyang Lake basin (PLB), capturing 49,192 fish (7017 kg) and identifying 120 species from 10 orders, 21 families, and 70 genera. Cypriniformes were the most dominant, accounting for 79 species. The spring and autumn surveys collected 25,734 and 23,458 individuals, respectively, with corresponding biomasses of 3978 kg and 3038 kg. Dominant species (IRI > 1000) in the study area included Hemiculter leucisculus, Megalobrama skolkovii, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, and Aristichthys nobilis. Additionally, critically endangered species such as Ochetobius elongatus, Myxocyprinus asiaticus, and Acipenser sinensis as well as exotic species like Cirrhinus mrigala and euryhaline species like Cynoglossus gracilis and Hyporhamphus intermedius were observed. Hierarchical clustering grouped the survey stations into three distinct areas (PYS, XBMS, and XBUS), with the ANOSIM analysis showing highly significant differences (R = 0.893, p < 0.01). Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that in spring, total phosphorus (TP) and temperature were the main factors influencing variability (80.50%), while in autumn, temperature, oil, and pH were the key factors (75.20%). This study emphasizes the predictable changes in fish community composition caused by environmental gradients and highlights the need for ongoing monitoring to effectively manage and protect the ecosystem, particularly in the post-fishing ban period.

Helminth communities of the Turkish endemic fish, Pseudophoxinus crassus (Ladiges, 1960): four helminth parasites for a new host record	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Tuz Golu (Salt Lake) Basin is one of the largest hypersaline lakes in the world and of extremely high biological importance owing to its high diversity and high level of endemism. It is hypothesized that the basin environment and the endemism of Pseudophoxinus crassus - a species of ray-finned fish in the Cyprinidae family and found only in Turkey - might contribute to the host-specific parasite characters. A total of 92 P. crassus specimens were collected by electrofishing between spring 2009 and autumn 2010 from the Incesu Stream in Konya Province, Turkey. By the end of the study period, four parasitic helminth species (Gyrodactylus latus, Asymphylodora imitans, Bothriocephalus acheilognathi and Pomphorhynchus laevis) were recorded. All had been reported previously from other hosts (non-host specific). Among these parasites G. latus and A. imitans are new records for the helminth fauna of Turkey. Prevalence and infestation intensity, length classes, and sex compositions of infested populations, as well as the seasonality of infestation were obtained and the results compared with other studies.

We set out to investigate environmental conditions and ecosystem metabolism in the macrophyte-dominated littoral zone (0.6 m depth) of a shallow, mesotrophic lake and compared this with the pelagic zone (3.0 m deep). We found that, during summer, vertical water column gradients only occasionally occurred and were weak in the pelagic zone, while dense littoral macrophyte stands of charophytes exhibited strong diel changes and steep daytime temperature and oxygen depth gradients. Oxygen showed daytime surface supersaturation and bottom anoxia, alternating with nighttime mixing. In spring, before charophytes appeared, the vertical gradients were largely absent. Ecosystem metabolism was primarily positive in spring, but areal rates of daily gross primary production (GPP) and closely related respiration increased 6-fold in summer. Ecosystem metabolism calculated based on oxygen or DIC was very similar, with a 1:1 M basis. Daytime DIC loss by CaCO3 precipitation on charophyte surfaces averaged 6.3% of total DIC loss, and this loss was restored during nighttime. The contribution of shallow littoral macrophyte communities to whole-lake summer GPP exceeded that estimated for phytoplankton. Environmental conditions in the macrophyte-covered littoral zone differed markedly from pelagic waters with steep vertical gradients in temperature and chemistry during daytime including anoxic micro-habitats in stark contrast to deep pelagic waters. The study highlights the significant influence of the littoral zone and macrophytes on whole-lake ecosystem processes. Plain Language Summary In shallow water in clear-water lakes where light reaches the bottom, dense stands of submerged plants may develop. Dense plant stands promote stratification of the water column resulting in large differences in water temperature, oxygen, pH, and dissolved inorganic carbon between surface and bottom waters. We set out to investigate how dense plant stands in the shallow water of a nutrient-poor lake influence environmental conditions and compare this to open waters. During summer, we found small differences between the surface and bottom water at the open water site, while pronounced differences developed in dense plant stands in the shallow water site. During daytime, oxygen was high in surface water with high photosynthesis, while respiration consumed virtually all oxygen in dim light below the plant canopy close to the bottom. During nighttime, differences vanished due to surface cooling, which promotes mixing of the entire water column. Two independent methods showed a close 1:1 balance between oxygen production and consumption and complementary carbon consumption and production in photosynthesis and respiration, respectively. Our study highlights the differences between shallow and open waters and the prominent role that plants may play in productivity and environmental conditions in the whole lake.

The immigration of new species (Cyclops vicinus, Daphnia galeata), the disappearance of Diaphanosoma and Heterocope and the expansion of litoral species into the pelagic region (Acanthocyclops robustus) imply a regrouping of the planktonic communities. Since the immigration of D. galeata, more and more intermediate types between D. galeata and D. hyalina were observed. New forms of Daphnia appeared in the last years in summer and early autumn and have not been determined to date. The annual average values of population densities (animals/m2) show the tendencies in the long-term development of the crustacean communities: The Cladocera (apart from Diaphanosoma) considerably raised their numbers, especially the adult Daphnia spp. Eudiaptomus gracilis also increased its stocks; Mesocyclops decreased its numbers. C. vicinus developed great population densities.																			0003-9136						1978	82	1-4					300	315																WOS:A1978EN32500019

Reasonable water environment management measures are very important for improving water quality and controlling eutrophication. In this study, the coupled models of hydrodynamics, water quality, and eutrophication were used to predict artificial Playground Lake water quality in the Zhenjiang, China. Recommended "unilateral" and "bilateral" river numerical models were constructed to simulate the water quality in the Playground Lake without or with water diversion by pump, sluice and push pump. Under "unilateral" and "bilateral" river layouts, total nitrogen and total phosphorus meet the landscape water requirement through water diversion. Tourist season in spring and summer and its suitable temperature result in heavier eutrophication, while winter is lighter. Under pumping condition, water quality and eutrophication of "unilateral" river is better than "bilateral" rivers. Under sluice diversion, the central landscape lake of "unilateral river" is not smooth, and water quality and eutrophication is inferior to the "bilateral". When the water level exceeds the flood control level (4.1 m), priority 1 is launched to discharge water from the Playground Lake. During operation of playground, when water level is less than the minimum level (3.3 m), priority 2 is turned on for pumping diversion or sluice diversion to Playground Lake. After opening the Yangtze river diversion channel sluice, priority 3 is launched for sluice diversion to the Playground Lake. When the temperature is less than 15 degrees C, from 15 degrees C to 25 degrees C and higher than 25 degrees C, the water quality can be maintained for 15 days, 10 days and 7 days, respectively. Corresponding to the conditions of different priority levels, reasonable choices of scheduling measures under different conditions to improve the water quality and control eutrophication of the Playground Lake. This article is relevant for the environmental management of the artificial Playground Lake, and similar lakes elsewhere.					song, weiwei/ADA-3788-2022	Zhang, Peng/0000-0002-2972-3566; Li, Lanyimin/0000-0002-2838-6035														1660-4601				OCT	2018	15	10							2110	10.3390/ijerph15102110	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15102110								30257493					WOS:000448818100052

Results indicated that planktonic primary production was the major energy source fueling the zooplankton community. In spring, delta(15)N of Daphnia was strongly influenced by atmospheric nitrogen derived from a N-2-fixing blue-green algal bloom. In winter, delta(13)C evidence suggested that phytoplankton comprised a small fraction (similar to 15%) of particulate organic matter (POM) in the water column, largely due to low primary productivity. The disparity between delta(13)C oi POM and Daphnia in winter may result from preferential assimilation of isotopically light algal carbon from POM. Nitrogen isotope values showed that Heterocope, a presumed carnivore, probably relied heavily on POM as a nutrient source. In common with some arctic lakes, the delta(15)N data showed less than three trophic levels in this plankton food web. The energy transfer pathways and trophic levels revealed a simple plankton trophic structure in this subarctic lacustrine system.																			0706-652X					JUN	1994	51	6					1338	1344		10.1139/f94-133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f94-133													WOS:A1994PG14600012

In the current study, we concentrated on this knowledge gap regarding factors controlling lake water quality. We combined long-term monitoring data with the studies on sediment P mobility in August 2018 by measuring redox potential, pore water concentrations of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), dissolved iron (Fe), sediment P fractions, and by calculating diffusive P flux. Using lake water total P (TP) concentrations for 21 years (1997-2018), we quantified internal P load based on water column summer increase of TP (ILin situ). Significant positive correlations were found between the diffusive P flux and the Fe-bound P concentration in the sediment for conditions of well-oxidized sediment surfaces. The analysis of long-term data showed that P mobilized in sediments is likely to be released via sediment disturbances. Sediment resuspension is favoured by decreased water level during late summer-early autumn. Additionally, the release of P from anoxic sediment surfaces is also possible, as was indicated by significant positive correlations of ILin situ with the anoxic factor (a measure of extent of anoxia) and August water temperature. The potential P release from anoxic sediment surfaces contributed about 80% to ILin situ in the northern basin, and about 280% in the more productive southern basin. Hence, the redox-related P release seems to sustain the high productivity of these large and shallow lake basins and is supported by sediment resuspension as a transport mechanism.

As a target of the International Continental scientific Drilling Program (ICDP), a successful deep drilling campaign was carried out within the scope of the Scientific Collaboration on Past Speciation Conditions in Lake Ohrid (SCOPSCO) project in 2013. Here, we present lithological, sedimentological, and (bio-) geochemical data from the upper 247.8m composite depth of the overall 569m long DEEP site sediment succession from the central part of the lake. According to an age model, which is based on 11 tephra layers (first-order tie points) and on tuning of bio-geochemical proxy data to orbital parameters (second-order tie points), the analyzed sediment sequence covers the last 637 kyr. The DEEP site sediment succession consists of hemipelagic sediments, which are interspersed by several tephra layers and infrequent, thin (< 5 cm) mass wasting deposits. The hemipelagic sediments can be classified into three different lithotypes. Lithotype 1 and 2 deposits comprise calcareous and slightly calcareous silty clay and are predominantly attributed to interglacial periods with high primary productivity in the lake during summer and reduced mixing during winter. The data suggest that high ion and nutrient concentrations in the lake water promoted calcite precipitation and diatom growth in the epilimnion during MIS15, 13, and 5. Following a strong primary productivity, highest interglacial temperatures can be reported for marine isotope stages (MIS) 11 and 5, whereas MIS15, 13, 9, and 7 were comparably cooler. Lithotype 3 deposits consist of clastic, silty clayey material and predominantly represent glacial periods with low primary productivity during summer and longer and intensified mixing during winter. The data imply that the most severe glacial conditions at Lake Ohrid persisted during MIS16, 12, 10, and 6, whereas somewhat warmer temperatures can be inferred for MIS14, 8, 4, and 2. Interglacial-like conditions occurred during parts of MIS14 and 8.

Using 114 matchups data pairs during 2013-2019, the SDD satellite algorithms suitable for the Qiandao Lake were obtained through both the linear regression and machine learning (Support Vector Machine) methods, with remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at different OLI bands and the ratio of Rrs (Band3) to Rrs (Band2) as model input parameters. Compared with field observations, the mean absolute relative difference and root mean squared error of satellite-derived SDD were within 20% and 1.3 m, respectively. Satellite-derived results revealed that SDD in the Qiandao Lake was high in boreal spring and winter, and reached the lowest in boreal summer, with the annual mean value of about 5 m. Spatially, high SDD was mainly concentrated in the southeast lake area (up to 13 m) close to the dam. The edge and runoff area of the lake were less transparent, with an SDD of less than 4 m. In the past decade (2013-2020), 5.32% of Qiandao Lake witnessed significant (p < 0.05) transparency change: 4.42% raised with a rate of about 0.11 m/year and 0.9% varied with a rate of about -0.09 m/year. Besides, the findings presented here suggested that heavy rainfall would have a continuous impact on the Qiandao Lake SDD. Our research could promote the applications of land observation satellites (such as the Landsat series) in water environment monitoring in inland reservoirs.					; Sun, Hao/AAG-5676-2020; Li, Teng/GRN-9280-2022	Zhu, Bozhong/0000-0002-5853-1061; 														2072-4292				JUL	2021	13	13							2570	10.3390/rs13132570	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs13132570													WOS:000670958300001
J	Welch, EB; Brattebo, SK; Overland, C				Welch, Eugene B.; Brattebo, Shannon K.; Overland, Christopher			Four decades of diluting phosphorus to maintain lake quality	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Dilution with low-nutrient Columbia River Water (CRW) has markedly improved Moses Lake quality for 42 years. There were two phases of CRW volume input, which proportionately lowered total phosphorus (TP). Initially, spring-summer inputs averaged 130 x 106 m(3) during 1977-1988 reducing average TP from 152 to 65 mu g/L in half the lake proximal to the inputs. That input represented 1.5 volumes of that half-lake volume. Inputs doubled through the mid-1990s, and nearly 2.5 times since 2000, decreasing TP to a 18-year average of 24 mu g/L. Chlorophyll a (chl) decreased further from 18 mu g/L during the early dilution years to about 6 mu g/L as TP declined. Cyanobacteria biovolume declined to 57% of total biovolume during 1977-1988 from 98% before dilution. Less (65%) CRW water since 2016 led to higher TP (41 mu g/L) and chl (18 mu g/L) in 2018, while cyanobacteria averaged 87% of total biovolume. More TP and cyanobacteria in 2018 are attributed to more internal TP loading. Increased N:P ratios have possibly given more advantage to the non-N-fixing cyanobacteria Microcystis, which comprised 82% and 74% of maximum cyanobacteria biovolume in 2017 and 2018. Practitioner points Lake total phosphorus (TP) was reduced 57% in the 1970s-1980s by adding large volumes of low-nutrient Columbia River water (CRW). Total P was further reduced by 65% since 2000 by more than doubling the earlier CRW input to an average spring-summer concentration of 24 mu g/L. Less (65%) CRW during 2017-2018 led to higher lake TP (41 mu g/L) and a worse cyanobacteria bloom in 2018. Microcystis, an non-nitrogen fixer, was the dominant cyanobacteria in 2017-2018 likely related to higher N:P ratios.

J	Kennedy, CR				Kennedy, CR			Establishment, survival and site selection of the cestode Eubothrium crassum in brown trout, Salmo trutta	PARASITOLOGY												Population dynamics, site selection, growth and maturatian of the cestode Eubothrium crassum in a natural population of Salmo trutta in a small lake were studied over a period of 1 year, the life-span of a cohort in fish. Infection of fish commenced in spring but peaked in July. Small, plerocerciform parasites initially located in the intestine, but then some mol ed into the pyloric caecae whilst others, the majority in heavy infections, were lost from the fish causing a fall in abundance from 460 to 10 over 2 months. This mortality was density dependent. Initially, parasites were distributed more evenly throughout the caecae but as time increased larger parasites were found preferentially in the anterior caecae before moving back into the intestine when gravid, preparatory to being lost in the following summer. Only a small proportion of the infrapopulation became gravid. Although the proportion of caecae occupied was initially density dependent, by the time of maturation several preferred anterior caecae remained unoccupied and mean intensity always exceeded unity. Neither growth nor maturation was affected by intraspecific competition. It was concluded that caecal availability did not set a limit or threshold of infrapopulation density, and in this respect E. crassum-S. trutta differed from some acanthocephalan-fish systems but was similar to others. Heavy infection followed by heavy mortality appeared to be typical of this parasite-host system in other localities, and of several other cestode-fish systems. The implications of this for population regulation are discussed.																			0031-1820	1469-8161				MAR	1996	112		3				347	355		10.1017/S0031182000065872	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182000065872								8728999					WOS:A1996UD06100011

The study area consisted of two distinct river segments, the Yellowstone River near Intake, Montana (Williston-Yellowstone segment), a quasi-natural segment, and the Missouri River near Bismarck, North Dakota (Bismarck segment), a flow-regulated, altered segment. A total of 710 fish were aged by assessing pectoral fin sections, 565 from the Williston-Yellowstone segment and 145 from the Bismarck segment. Shovelnose sturgeon from the Yellowstone-Williston segment grew significantly faster and reached a larger size than shovelnose sturgeon from the Bismarck segment. The closure of Garrison Dam upstream of the Bismarck segment in December 1953 resulted in cooler summer water temperatures, less flow variation, and greater water clarity in the Bismarck segment. These habitat changes, coupled with a decrease in productivity in the Bismarck segment, may explain much of the difference in growth observed between the two segments.

An Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) Habitat Suitability Model to Identify Overwinter Conditions for Coregonine Whitefishes in Arctic Lagoons	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Lagoons provide critical habitats for many fishes, including coregonine whitefishes, which are a mainstay in many subsistence fisheries of rural communities in Arctic Alaska. Despite their importance, little is known about the overwintering habits of whitefishes in Arctic Alaska due to the challenges associated with sampling during winter. We developed a habitat suitability (HS) model to understand the potential range of physical conditions that whitefishes experience during the Arctic winter, using three indicator lagoons that represent a range of environmental characteristics. The HS model was built using a three-step approach. First, remote sensing that uses interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) identified areas of floating and bottomfast ice. Second, through in-field ground-truthing, we confirmed the presence and quality of liquid water (water depth, temperature, and dissolved oxygen) beneath the ice cover. Third, we assessed the suitability of that liquid water as habitat for whitefishes based on published literature and expert interpretation of water quality parameters. InSAR determined that 0, 65.4, and 88.2% of the three lagoons were composed of floating ice corresponding with areas of liquid water beneath a layer of ice. The HS model indicated that all three lagoons had reduced suitability as whitefish habitat in winter than in summer due to the loss of habitat because of the presence of bottomfast ice and a reduction in the quality of liquid water due to cold temperatures, high salinities, and low dissolved oxygen levels. However, only the shallowest lagoon had lethal conditions and zero suitability as whitefish habitat. The methods outlined here provide a simple, cost-effective method to identify habitats that consistently provide critical winter habitat and integrate remote sensing in a HS model framework.

J	Mousavi, SK; Amundsen, PA				Mousavi, Seyed Karim; Amundsen, Per-Arne			Seasonal variations in the profundal Chironomidae (Diptera) assemblage of a subarctic lake	BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												Zoobenthos samples were collected over a 12-month period in the profundal zone of the subarctic Fjellfrosvatn, a lake in northern Norway. Chironomid larvae numerically dominated the profundal zoobenthos and their mean density decreased with increasing depth. Procladius (Holotanypus) sp. A, Mesocricotopus thienemanni, Psectrocladius (Mesopsectrocladius) sp. and Heterotrissocladius subpdosus exhibited the highest densities at the depth of 20 m, whereas H. subpilosus dominated the chironomid assemblage at 30-40 m. At 20-m depth, the chironomid density was highest in June, decreased towards autumn, and was relatively stable during the ice-covered period. The peak density in June was mainly related to a strong seasonal pattern in the density of Heterotrissocladius maeaeri and M. thienemanni. At 30-40-m depth, no significant seasonal variations in total density of chironomid larvae were observed, although the density of H. subpdosus exhibited a significant seasonal peak in winter. Larval instar groups of H. subpilosus were identified from a classification based on head capsule width. The profundal dwelling H. subpilosus were hemivoltine, having predominantly a two-year life cycle.

With the development of urbanization, anthropogenic activities have posed serious threats to the water quality and biodiversity of Liangzi Lake. To assess the aquatic ecosystem health of Liangzi Lake, the structure, the environmental response, and the interactions of plankton were investigated in 2022 and 2023. The results indicated that water temperature was a pivotal factor regulating plankton dynamics, with the assemblage patterns predominantly shaped by the phytoplankton species, which were Bacillariophyta in spring and Chlorophyta in summer. In terms of the phytoplankton, dissolved oxygen and the N:P ratio significantly affect cyanobacteria distribution. The high biomass and abundance of cyanobacteria in summer highlight the potential risk of harmful algal blooms. In contrast to the phytoplankton, the zooplankton exhibited enhanced resilience to changes in the surrounding environment. Rotifera was the dominant group in summer in terms of both abundance and biomass. Most core genera of plankton were jointly identified by eDNA metabarcoding and microscopical analysis, and eDNA metabarcoding had advantages in revealing a higher diversity. However, some taxa among rotifers such as Liliferotrocha were only identified using microscopical analysis. Therefore, a combination of both the methods is recommended to better understand the structuring mechanisms of plankton assemblages in lake ecosystems.																				2073-4441				MAR 31	2025	17	7							1021	10.3390/w17071021	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w17071021													WOS:001463564800001

Mysis diluviana population and cohort dynamics in Lake Ontario before and after the establishment of Dreissena spp., Cercopagis pengoi, and Bythotrephes longimanus	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												We investigated population responses of Mysis to ecosystem changes induced by invasion of dreissenids and predatory cladocerans, Cercopagis and Bythotrephes. Lake productivity declined as dreissenids invaded the offshore region. Whole-lake mysid biomass was compared before (early 1990s) and after (2002-2007) the invasion period; it declined 40%-45%. Abundance of young mysids and presence of a summer cohort increased with summer, epilmnetic, nighttime zooplankton biomass (i.e., food biomass index). Cercopagis + Bythotrephes biomass was negatively correlated with this index, implicating them in the mysid decline. Eggs per gravid female increased with autumn, total-water-column zooplankton biomass, reflecting the greater use of hypolimnetic waters by adults. Reproductive success was below replacement during the period 2002-2005. First-year mysid growth rate was maintained while population abundance declined, suggesting selection for individuals that feed effectively at low food concentrations. Mortality rates in the first and second years were dependent on cohort density, indicating that competition for food limited abundance in the first 2 years. Fish predation indices (smelt and alewife combined) were correlated positively with mortality rates and negatively with abundance in the third year. Thus, mysids cannot support as many fish in invaded compared with non-invaded lakes. They may also not be a stable food resource; unusual cohort losses occurred in some years.																			0706-652X					MAY	2011	68	5					795	811		10.1139/F2011-028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F2011-028													WOS:000291445900006

After the diversion, nutrient concentrations declined, consistent with a simple dilution model, and by the mid-1990s the chlorophyll concentration was reduced by 80%. The favourable development was supported by a 5-year mass removal of planktivorous and benthivorous fish and the stocking of predatory pikeperch (Sander lucioperca(L.)), although the exact mechanisms behind their effects remain obscure. Starting in 2010, oxygen-rich water from the top of the water column was pumped to the deepest parts of the lake, resulting in high deepwater oxygen concentration in winter. In summer, hypoxic or even anoxic conditions could not be avoided, but the duration of the anoxic period was markedly shortened. Because nitrate was never depleted, leaching of total nitrogen from the sediment was reduced and the same was also true for total phosphorus, but only in winter. The oxygenation stabilized deepwater nutrient concentrations to a low level, but this was not reflected in the epilimnetic total nutrient concentration or in a further decrease in the chlorophyll concentration.

J	Gasse, F; Van Campo, E				Gasse, F; Van Campo, E			Late Quaternary environmental changes from a pollen and diatom record in the southern tropics (Lake Tritrivakely, Madagascar)	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												A pollen and diatom study of a 40 m-sedimentary sequence from Lake Tritrivakely in the central highlands of Madagascar provides evidence for climatic and environmental changes during the late Pleistocene and the Holocene. The major features of the modern regional climate and vegetation distribution and the hydrological characteristics of the lake basin are first summerized, Lithological units and specific methods used to establish the pollen and the diatom biozones are then presented. The chronology of the upper 13 m of the sequence (0-41 kyr) is supported by AMS radiocarbon dates. It has not been possible to acquire absolute ages fur the lower 27 m of the core. However, a tentative age model based on comparisons between the terrestrial pollen and the Vostok deltaD isotopic temperature records suggests an age of about 150 kyr for the core base. The vegetation primarily responded to variations in temperature. Six major cold/warm cycles are identified. During the cold phases, Ericaceous bush surrounded the site. Assuming that the age model is correct, cold phases (prior to 143, 115-110, 94-88, 75-69, and 22-17 kyr) coincide with periods of high local summer insolation. The warm phases are of different amplitude. They show first the development of a wooded grassland under a dry climate, which may coincide with periods of low summer insolation (around 125, 100, 83, 60 and 10-5 kyr), and then the growth of mid-latitude trees under wetter conditions. The diatom record primarily documents changes in the precipitation minus evaporation balance (P - E) in the lake catchment, which appear consistent with orbitally-induced changes in P and seasonal contrasts as suggested by our pollen-based age model and the C-14-dated section of the record. An overall trend from a relatively deep, nutrient-rich lake to a shallow, oligotrophic peat-marsh, is partly attributed to the basin infilling. However, wet-dry oscillations are superimposed over this trend. The two first lake high stands (before 143 and around 115 kyr if the age model is correct) and low stands (around 125 and 105 kyr) match pollen-inferred cold and warming phases, respectively. Later, periods of low P - E also fit cold phases, and occur apparently every 12-10 kyr. Summer rain during phases of high summer insolation was not heavy enough to compensate for the large evaporation-evapotranspiration losses during warm summers and dry winters, especially during the cold Last Glacial Maximum, which was drier than today.

For both species, year-class strength began to correlate positively with water temperature one month after the assumed hatching. Recruitment was estimated as relative year-class strength at the adult stage, and water temperature as degree-day sums over 10 degreesC. Temperature-corrected age-0 littoral catches imply that year-class strength is determined in early summer. The results, thus, suggest similarities in the recruitment of perch and pikeperch.

J	Macrae, ML; Bello, RL; Moot, LA				Macrae, ML; Bello, RL; Moot, LA			Long-term carbon storage and hydrological control of CO2 exchange in tundra ponds in the Hudson Bay Lowland	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Carbon dioxide fluxes and water balance were examined in 43 tundra ponds in the northern portion of the Hudson Bay Lowland near Churchill, Manitoba. Most of the ponds were hydrologically disconnected from their catchments during dry periods throughout the post-melt season. However, episodic reconnection occurred following large precipitation events where depression storage was exceeded. Significant shifts in pond chemistry were observed following precipitation events, with the degree of CO2 saturation increasing during these periods. Pond CO2 concentrations rapidly fell to pre-event levels following events, suggesting that hydrological connectivity can affect the magnitude and direction of CO2 gas fluxes in tundra ponds. Atmospheric CO2 invaded ponds with highly organic sediments for most of the summer, suggesting that terrestrially derived inorganic carbon was insufficient to meet the demands of algal net production. In contrast, ponds with highly mineral sediments continued to evade CO2 during the summer. In a subset of I I ponds, long-term rates of carbon accumulation in sediment ranged from 0.6 to 2.2 mol C m(-2) year(-1). Very strong correlations existed between average sediment accumulation rates and pond perimeters and basin areas suggesting that peat may be a major source of sediment carbon. Aeolian transport is also a potentially large source of sediment carbon. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

Here we conducted a coordinated lake ice quality sampling campaign across the Northern Hemisphere during one of the warmest winters since 1880 and show that lake ice during 2020/2021 commonly consisted of unstable white ice, at times contributing up to 100% to the total ice thickness. We observed that white ice increased over the winter season, becoming thickest and constituting the largest proportion of the ice layer towards the end of the ice cover season when fatal winter drownings occur most often and light limits the growth and reproduction of primary producers. We attribute the dominance of white ice before ice-off to air temperatures varying around the freezing point, a condition which occurs more frequently during warmer winters. Thus, under continued global warming, the prevalence of white ice is likely to substantially increase during the critical period before ice-off, for which we adjusted commonly used equations for human ice safety and light transmittance through ice. Under continued global warming, lakes will increasingly be covered by white ice, in particular towards the end of the ice cover season when fatal winter drownings occur most often and light limits the growth and reproduction of primary producers.

Abundance and spatial distribution of Mysis diluviana in Lake Ontario in 2008 estimated with 120 kHz hydroacoustic surveys and net tows	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Mysids are an important component of Great Lakes foodwebs, both as a prey for fish and as a predator on zooplankton. We monitored mysid abundance in Lake Ontario using lake-wide hydroacoustics data and vertical net hauls collected 1-5 August 2008 during the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and New York State Department of Conservation forage fish survey. Acoustic volume backscattering strength was highly correlated with both density and biomass of mysids although the correlation with biomass was stronger. The slopes of these relationships were not significantly different from theory (0.10) indicating a linear relationship between abundance and backscattering strength. Size structure significantly affected the relationship between backscattering strength and density but not between backscattering strength and biomass. Average target strength for areas with small mysids was -91.9 dB per mysid, and in areas with both small and large mysids it was -88.2 dB per animal. Acoustic estimates for Lake Ontario calculated with these regressions provided a lake-wide estimate weighted by lake area within depth intervals, of 228 mysids m(-2) (CV 17.6%) and 0.93 g dw m(-2) (CV 12.9%). Density and biomass in 14 net hauls averaged 316 mysids m(-2) (range 0 to 1113) and 1.35 g dw m(-2) (range 0 to 3.89). Mysid biomass was 33% of the biomass of other crustacean zooplankton in the summer of 2008. As in 2005, areas of low mysid abundance were detected in the middle of the transects and along the north shore. Lakewide mysid abundance in the summer of 2008 was higher than in a similar acoustic survey in the summer of 2005 and in whole-lake autumn 2000-2007 net surveys, suggesting that mysids are persisting in Lake Ontario and abundant relative to other Great Lakes.

Oil sands development contributes elements toxic at low concentrations to the Athabasca River and its tributaries	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												We show that the oil sands industry releases the 13 elements considered priority pollutants (PPE) under the US Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water Act, via air and water, to the Athabasca River and its watershed. In the 2008 snowpack, all PPE except selenium were greater near oil sands developments than at more remote sites. Bitumen upgraders and local oil sands development were sources of airborne emissions. Concentrations of mercury, nickel, and thallium in winter and all 13 PPE in summer were greater in tributaries with watersheds more disturbed by development than in less disturbed watersheds. In the Athabasca River during summer, concentrations of all PPE were greater near developed areas than upstream of development. At sites downstream of development and within the Athabasca Delta, concentrations of all PPE except beryllium and selenium remained greater than upstream of development. Concentrations of some PPE at one location in Lake Athabasca near Fort Chipewyan were also greater than concentration in the Athabasca River upstream of development.

Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that the pH, date of autumn mixing (A(mix)), mean August water temperature (T(Aug)), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and relative water depth (Z(rel)) made significant contributions to explain the diatom assemblage variation in the lakes of the training set. A weighted averaging partial least square regression and calibration model was used to establish Di-pH (R(boot)(2) = 0.72, RMSEP(boot) = 0.131), and a thermistor measurements-based PLS model for A(mix) (R(boot)(2) = 0.71, RMSEP(boot) = 0.006 log(10) Julian days). The latter showed a better prediction than T(Aug), and was used in terms of climate change. These transfer functions, together with analyses of loss on ignition (LOI), the total carbon/nitrogen (C/N)-ratios, and selected pollen, were applied to an early to mid-Holocene (11.5-4 cal. ky BP) sediment core section from an Austrian Alpine treeline lake on crystalline bedrock. Additionally, passive sample scores in the CCA of the diatom training set were used to show trends in the variables DOC and Z(rel). During the early Holocene, diatoms indicative of increased pH, extended warm summers, and low water levels dominated. Between 10.2 and 7.6 cal. ky BP it was followed by diatom assemblages that indicated an increase in lake water depth and an earlier A(mix). The multi-proxy data suggest that the Amix decline is the result of a series of snow-rich summer cool and wet climate fluctuations, which were divided by climate warming at similar to9 cal. ky BP. Increased A(mix), LOI and DOC, and the correspondent decline in the C/N-ratios, show subsequent climate warming between 7.3 and 6 cal. ky BP. The long-term trend in Di-pH indicates the impact of catchment-related processes during the early-Holocene, that were superimposed by climate.																			0921-2728					AUG	2004	32	2					177	196		10.1023/B:JOPL.0000029428.97961.43	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:JOPL.0000029428.97961.43													WOS:000221687100005

Historically, the species was widely distributed throughout the floodplain but now approximately 95% of the population is confined to three closely-situated wetlands in Anhui and Jiangxi Provinces. Recent counts indicate that at one of these sites, Shengjin Lake (in Anhui), a decline of about 10,000-20,000 birds, to about 1,000 currently, has taken place during the last five years. The likely cause of the decline in Swan Goose abundance at Shengjin Lake is the recent decrease in submerged vegetation, particularly tuber-producing Vallisneria which is the species's main food; this decrease has been linked with the introduction of intensive aquaculture in the main areas used by Swan Geese within the lake. Earlier range contractions in the Yangtze floodplain may also be linked to reductions in submerged vegetation cover at other sites, where intensive aquaculture has also been implicated. Changes in lake hydrology following construction of the Three Gorges Dam may also have adversely affected submerged vegetation productivity. Key information needs for the effective implementation of conservation measures for Swan Goose include an understanding of (1) the fitness consequences of Swan Geese being forced to switch to different foods; (2) how aquaculture can be managed to minimise impacts on submerged vegetation; (3) the impact of changing lake hydrology on key Swan Goose food plants; and (4) the optimal management of wetlands to ensure that adequate food is both produced during the summer period and is available throughout the winter.

J	Kværner, J; Klove, B				Kvaerner, Jens; Klove, Bjorn			Tracing sources of summer streamflow in boreal headwaters using isotopic signatures and water geochemical components	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Content of O-18, H-2, H-3 and geochemical components in rainfall, stream water, peat water and bedrock groundwater in four headwater catchments were compared to reveal differences in sources of runoff and hydrological vulnerability to tunnel drainage during summer. Water previously stored within the catchments was the predominant component of streamflow during small and moderate events. The proportion of event water increased at high discharge in autumn. Neither the isotopic nor the hydrochemical composition of stream water indicated any considerable contribution from old bedrock groundwater. Stream water hydrochemistry revealed clear influence of soil water pathways. The differences in land cover could be seen in water quality and runoff generation. Water storage and mixing in lakes and lowland wetlands reduced fluctuations in runoff and water quality. Runoff retention and the solute trapping effect in peadands were most efficient in flat areas near the catchment outlet. In lowflow periods fluxes from hillslopes were of minor importance compared to discharges from wetland water storage. Water delivery from hillslopes with thin till cover (< 0.6 m, average depth 0.3 m), short slope lengths (< 100 m) and steep inclines (17%) was very restricted in drought periods. An increase of slope from 13% to 17% can influence the delivery of water from uplands in lowflow periods. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Five epizoic ciliate species, Trichodina jadranica (Raabe, 1958) Haider, 1964; Trichodina domerguei Wallengren, 1897; Riboscyphidia sp.; Ambiphrya sp.; and Vorticella sp., were found after examination of 296 juvenile flounder. Among these, T jadranica was the dominant species. The prevalence and mean intensity values of the 5 epizoic ciliates were given as pooled data for 2 groups, namely mobiline ciliates and sessiline ciliates. Mobiline ciliates were commonly found on the gills of juvenile flounders, whereas sessiline ciliates were found only on fins. The highest prevalence and mean intensity levels of mobiline ciliates were recorded in the winter and spring seasons. Sessiline ciliates were absent in winter. The largest-sized juvenile flounder among the established 6 length classes had a higher intensity of mobiline ciliates. This study is the first on the epizoic ciliate fauna present on the juvenile flounder in Turkey. While T. jadranica is a new parasite record, the juvenile flounder is a new host record for T. domerguei in Turkey.

Genetic Pedigree Reconstruction Facilitates Lakewide Estimates of Age-0 Largemouth Bass Dispersal	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Dispersal from natal areas is an important event for fishes, ultimately affecting individual adult reproductive success and population levels of recruitment and genetic diversity. However, quantification of dispersal rates and distance and the associated environmental covariates is difficult when individuals are too small to physically mark. Using genetic techniques, we studied the dispersal of largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides from their natal nests in two southern Michigan lakes. In Warner Lake, we sampled larvae from 33 nests during spring 2010 and collected 33 age-0 fish during summer. In Lake Chemung, we collected 138 and 140 age-0 fish during the summers of 2009 and 2010, respectively. Pedigree reconstruction techniques were used to determine (1) the dispersal distance of age-0 largemouth bass from nests to late-summer points of capture (Warner Lake) and (2) interindividual distances between age-0 full-sibling pairs (Lake Chemung). Age-0 fish in Warner Lake dispersed an average of 301 +/- 41 m (mean +/- SE). In Lake Chemung, intersibling dispersion distances varied substantially among pairs, but the distribution of distances was not significantly different from that of randomly selected pairs of individuals. Together, the data showed that age-0 largemouth bass dispersed considerable distances from their nests and that the distance and direction of dispersal by siblings appeared to be independent of nest site. Our methods can be widely used for detailed evaluation of fish dispersal and effects of physical and biotic lakescape features on dispersal and recruitment.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV 1	2012	141	6					1672	1681		10.1080/00028487.2012.720632	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2012.720632													WOS:000315216000022

Moose at their bioclimatic edge alter their behavior based on weather, landscape, and predators	CURRENT ZOOLOGY												Populations inhabiting the bioclimatic edges of a species' geographic range face an increasing amount of stress from alterations to their environment associated with climate change. Moose Alces alces are large-bodied ungulates that are sensitive to heat stress and have exhibited population declines and range contractions along their southern geographic extent. Using a hidden Markov model to analyzemovement and accelerometer data, we assigned behaviors (rest, forage, or travel) to all locations of global positioning system-collaredmoose (n = 13, moose-years = 19) living near the southern edge of the species' range in and around Voyageurs National Park, MN, USA. We assessed how moose behavior changed relative to weather, landscape, and the presence of predators. Moose significantly reduced travel and increased resting behaviors at ambient temperatures as low as 15 degrees C and 24 degrees C during the spring and summer, respectively. In general, moose behavior changed seasonally in association with distance to lakes and ponds. Moose used wetlands for travel throughout the year, rested in conifer forests, and foraged in shrublands. The influence of wolves Canis lupus varied among individual moose and season, but the largest influence was a reduction in travel during spring when near a wolf home range core, primarily by pregnant females. Our analysis goes beyond habitat selection to capture how moose alter their activities based on their environment. Our findings, along with climate change forecasts, suggest that moose in this area will be required to further alter their activity patterns and space use in order to find sufficient forage and avoid heat stress.

Standing crops of C. ovata ranged from 0.4 to 52% of total phytoplankton cell number. Its productivity varied from 2.8 to 137.9 mug Cl-1 hr(-1) (ca. 1 to 74 % of total productivity) and contributed ca. 28 % of total phytoplankton productivity on an annual basis. Species-specific productivity (SSP) of C ovata fluctuated between 14.6 and 81.5 pg C cell(-1) hr(-1) and its seasonal trend was not clear. Volume-specific SSP (SSP/cell volume) of C ovata was significantly higher in summer, which suggests high growth rate potential at higher temperatures (23-27 degreesC). However, the C. ovata population reached its maximam density in spring.																			0270-5060					DEC	2002	17	4					521	529		10.1080/02705060.2002.9663930	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2002.9663930													WOS:000180470900004
J	KOCHANY, J; MAGUIRE, RJ				KOCHANY, J; MAGUIRE, RJ			PHOTODEGRADATION OF QUINOLINE IN WATER	CHEMOSPHERE												The photodegradation kinetics of quinoline have been studied at 313 nm and in sunlight in organic-free water, lake water, and water containing several different solutes. The half-life of sunlight photodegradation is slightly shorter in lake water than in organic-free water (4-8%, depending upon the season). In near-surface lake water at 40-degrees N latitude in summer, quinoline was predicted to degrade readily in sunlight, with a half-life of about 14 calendar days. The calculated half-life in winter was about 123 calendar days. The photodegradation of quinoline was accelerated significantly by NaNO3 and dissolved organic matter, two effective producers of hydroxyl radicals in aquatic environment. The rate was also faster at pH 4.5 than at pH 7.0. Two photoproducts were identified in low yield, 2-hydroxyquinoline and 8-hydroxyquinoline; prolonged irradiation appeared to destroy the aromatic nucleus.																			0045-6535	1879-1298				MAR	1994	28	6					1097	1110		10.1016/0045-6535(94)90328-X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0045-6535(94)90328-X													WOS:A1994NH45100005
J	Reynolds, SK; Ferrington, LC				Reynolds, SK; Ferrington, LC			Temporal and taxonomic patterns of mouthpart deformities in larval midges (Diptera: Chironomidae) in relation to sediment chemistry	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Entire benthic communities of larval chironomids were sampled in the spring and fall of 1987 from the trace metals-impacted Empire Lake reservoir system, Cherokee County, Kansas. The frequency and severity of mouthpart deformities were calculated for each sample date at the subfamily level and analyzed for correlation with zinc, cadmium and lead concentrations in sediments of the lake. None of the trace metals was significantly predictive of mouthpart deformation, nor was location within the watershed. However, significant taxonomic and temporal patterns in deformation were observed independent of individual trace metals and sampling location. Larval mouthparts were approximately five times as likely to be deformed and three times as severely deformed in the subfamily Chironominae relative to larvae of the subfamily Tanypodinae (frequency = 14.9% vs. 3.1%; Mouthpart Deformity Score, MDS = 30.2 vs. 9.9) (p < 0.01). Similarly and regardless of taxon, the mouthparts of midge larvae present in the sediments for the greatest duration (i.e., overwintering generations) were more frequently (10.7% vs 2.4%) and severely (MDS = 22.2 vs. 1.8) deformed than summer populations (p < 0.01). These levels of frequency and severity are far above those found in unimpacted habitats elsewhere indicating that while individual metal concentrations were not predictive of either the frequency or severity of deformities, clearly the Empire Lake watershed is impacted by some toxicant. Furthermore, the differential temporal and taxonomic responses suggest that both the frequency and severity of mouthpart deformities at the subfamily level can be successful bioindictor tools and more work needs to be done to elucidate their value.																			0270-5060					MAR	2001	16	1					15	27		10.1080/02705060.2001.9663783	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2001.9663783													WOS:000166801600002
J	Kadiri, MO				Kadiri, MO			Limnological studies of two contrasting but closely linked springs in Nigeria, West Africa	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												An account is presented of the chemistry and algal flora of two streams in Ekiti Stair, Nigeria. The two streams, one of which is much warmer than the other, are separate upstream bur subsequently merge. A comparison of the springs revealed that while they differed markedly in temperature, colour, turbidity, conductivity, solids, total alkalinity, total hardness, Ca, SiO3, SO4, Mg, Cl- and dissolved oxygen, they showed some similarities in pH, Fe, Na, K, PO4 and NO3. In the cold spring, while total alkalinity, conductivity and silicate increased in the wet season, total hardness decreased slightly and other variables exhibited fluctations with season. For the warm spring, except for increased total alkalinity and total hardness, dissolved oxygen and pH decreased in the wet season. However, most parameters of the warm spring were unaffected by season. Floristically, the springs were rich in species with a total of 84 taxa: 56 in the warm spring, 33 in the cold spring, 44 at the confluence and 40 beyond the confluence. The warm spring was dominated mainly by blue-green algae such as Lyngbya birgei, Synechococcus aequalis and Oscillatoria spp.; the cold spring was dominated by Rhizoclonium hieroglyphicum and Navicula spp. The confluence was dominated by Terpsinoe musica, R. hieroglyphicum and Lyngbya birgei, while the site downstream of the confluence was dominated entirely by R. hieroglyphicum. In most cases, the confluence and downstream area beyond the confluence of the springs exhibited intermediate characteristics between the two springs. This study is a contribution to the dearth of information on streams in West Africa.																			1126-3504						2000	134	2					123	131		10.1080/11263500012331358394	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263500012331358394													WOS:000167096100001

In order to reconstruct the possible monsoonal impact on the hydrology of the lake basin during the last 15 kyr, we studied the geomorphology of the basin and combined the results with multi-proxy records from Tso Kar lake sediments. Major analyses comprise geochemical data (high-resolution X-ray fluorescence, XRF), mineral composition (XRD), aquatic pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP). Although the chronological framework based on 41 C-14 AMS dates remains speculative for the Lateglacial and late Holocene periods, our results indicate major hydrological phases linked to regional climate variations and tectonic activity. The maximum glacier advance falls within the period between the global LGM and ca 15 kyr BP, while the basin remained open and may have drained along the paleo Tso Kar River. Tectonic pulses may have triggered terrace development and the closure of the lake. The estimated mean vertical displacement rate accounts for 7-9 mm/yr. Considerable summer monsoon moisture supply occurred for the periods around 12.5 kyr BP and between ca 11.5 and 8.6 kyr BP, indicated by deposition of more profundal lake facies and the development of aquatic fauna and flora. The lake level rise about 11.8 kyr BP was due to intensified glacier melt and summer monsoon effective moisture supply. The lake reached its maximum level and extent between 8.5 and 7 kyr BP under warm-moist climate conditions. Permafrost was absent from the basin. Summer monsoon influence weakened after 8 kyr BP with a short reverse trend at ca 5-6 kyr BP. The lake shrank gradually after 7 kyr BP towards its lowest stand at about 4.2 kyr BP, with return of permafrost activity. Subsequent terrace formation was probably amplified by tectonic movement. The lake remained at a low level with minor fluctuations. The results indicate that the orbitally driven regional climate variability is well reflected in the Tso Kar basin by hydrological variations. Considerable summer monsoon moisture seems to have influenced the area only during the early Holocene. The late Quaternary evolution of the Tso Kar was controlled by the interplay of climate forces, local morphodynamics and tectonic impact. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Golubev, S				Golubev, Sergey			Status of the Pallas's Gull Ichthyaetus ichthyaetus during Summer/Autumn in the Fairway Volga-Kama Reservoirs (East European Plain) in Russia	BIRDS												Simple Summary: The Pallas's Gull is a large and spectacular bird, a fish-eating predator. It is listed in the category of recovering species of the Red Book of the Russian Federation. This species of gulls is the object of aesthetic enjoyment. The purpose of the research was to study the state of the PallasMODIFIER LETTER PRIMEs Gull in the fairway (navigable zone) of the Volga-Kama reservoirs in Russia and to assess their role in the current distribution of the species. In 2020-2022, in summer and autumn, we conducted counts of the number of gulls and found them on most reservoirs of the largest rivers of the Volga basin. It was also found that, over the past 50 years, PallasMODIFIER LETTER PRIMEs Gulls have spread far north of the places where they earlier lived (steppes, deserts and semideserts of the Northern Caspian and the Lower Volga), reaching the northernmost reservoirs in the southern taiga. Adult birds performed the main role in settling to the north. The results of this study suggested that the total number of Pallas's Gulls in the reservoirs can exceed 1000 individuals. On the territory of the East European Plain, the Volga-Kama reservoirs play an important role in the mastering of new territories and serve as corridors along which they spread. The Pallas's Gull Ichthyaetus ichthyaetus is a fish-eating predator listed in the category of recovering species of the Red Book of the Russian Federation. The purpose of the research was to study the state of the PallasMODIFIER LETTER PRIMEs Gull in the fairway (navigable zone) of the Volga-Kama reservoirs, in Russia and to assess their role in the current distribution of the species. In the summer and autumn of 2020-2022, at 11 reservoirs of the Volga and Kama rivers, counts of PallasMODIFIER LETTER PRIMEs Gulls were carried out from the bow deck of the R/V Akademik Topchiev. The transect length was 4633.5 km; the duration of observations was 364.3 h. A comprehensive bird count was applied in the direction of the vessel's movement on transects with a fixed counting strip width of 200 m (100 m in each direction from the bow of the vessel). Birds were usually fixed on 30-min transects. The Pallas's Gulls were found in 7 of the 11 reservoirs studied, and their status varied between common and very rare. The species was more abundant in the Gorky reservoir than in the Cheboksary, Kuibyshev, Saratov, and Nizhnekamsk reservoirs. The smallest abundance was recorded in the Volgograd and Rybinsk reservoirs. The Pallas's Gull shows a steady annual presence on most reservoirs. The results indicate that in the Volga Basin, the range of Pallas's Gull has expanded further north by more than 1000 km over the past 30 years from the species' original areas of sustainable breeding in the North Caspian. Adult individuals of the PallasMODIFIER LETTER PRIMEs Gull (83.4% of the age composition of the population) play the main role in the dispersal. The most favorable clusters of the stable presence of the species were lake-shaped fragments of the Gorky and Kuibyshev reservoirs. On the territory of the East European Plain, the Volga-Kama reservoirs are important, if not decisive, in expanding the range of Pallas's Gull to the north.

Life cycle of Boeckella poppei mrazek and Branchinecta gaini daday (King george island, south shetlands)	POLAR BIOLOGY												In Lake Wujka, a shallow, polymictic Antarctic lake situated at 15 m from the seashore, several yearly cohorts occur of the copepod Boeckella poppei and one of the fairy shrimp Branchinecta gaini. There is circumstantial evidence that the two species compete for food, and perhaps adult fairy shrimp feed on the nauplii of the copepod. Both species are positively influenced by a measure of salinity. However, when autumn storms massively sweep seawater into the lake, all fairy shrimp are wiped out; no hatching occurs until next spring. In B. poppei, some nauplii and copepodites survive or hatch after the salt flows out of the lake. This is an advantage to the copepod that may balance its coexistence with the shrimp. Its cycle is, however, aborted by the freezing of the lake. In contrast to many other Antarctic lakes, the life cycle of the crustaceans is therefore controlled by salinity rather than freezing.

Over three years of investigation, we found that the toxin content of cyanobacterial bloom in Lake Taihu was always low in June and higher in late summer and autumn. The findings enabled us to compare the effects of diets containing low and high toxic cyanobacterial blooms on the growth and consumption safety of tilapia. There were no negative effects on the growth of tilapia, and the muscle seemed to be safe for human consumption in the treatment of 18.5% low toxic cyanobacterial bloom. Therefore, limitations of the utilization of cyanobacterial biomass can be overcome by selecting low toxic cyanobacterial bloom that can be found and collected in large lakes.

Spain, shows lithological, carbonate, pollen and spores, and ostracode-gastropod evidence of climatic and lake-level change. Upland pollen taxa from the lowermost zones 1, 3 and 5, show that the area was forested and indicate a progressive deterioration of the climate. Zone 2 (steppe vegetation) corresponds to a global glacial stage, with mild temperatures, if the comparison Co modern analogues is valid. Only minor climate fluctuations occurred subsequently. Aquatic vegetation and micritic sediment facies show a pelagic environment during pollen zones 1 and 3 and a littoral one during pollen zone 5. A short-term lowering of the water level (sandy algal micrite and slightly brackish waters) occurred in zone 2, as a result of severe droughts. Subzone 2c records progressive recovery of the forest. The coarse lithology and the high carbonate content, however, continue to indicate shallow waters. The fluctuation marked by zone 4 (extensive marsh vegetation and spring waters) may be due to a lake-level decrease caused by karst activity, or by lower precipitation with only slight cooling, or more probably by a relative lake-level decrease caused by natural infilling. The sediment of pollen zone 4, a sandy algal micrite, indicates the development of a littoral bench at the core site. From pollen zone 4 to pollen zone 5 an evolution from lakeward to landward position occurred. In zone 2, droughts existed at least during the spring growing season, and probably also during the rest of the year. In subzone 2c, a shift to spring precipitation occurred. In contrast, during pollen zone 4, if there was a decrease in precipitation, it did not take place during the summer growing season.

J	Debernardi, P; Patriarca, E				Debernardi, Paolo; Patriarca, Elena			The bats of the Lake Maggiore Piedmont shore (NW Italy)	HYSTRIX-ITALIAN JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												In the period 1999-2005 we carried out a bat survey along the Piedmont shore of Lake Maggiore (provinces of Verbania and Novara, NW Italy), in order to collect data on species distribution, with special reference to wetlands. A total of 155 potential roost sites were checked: natural or artificial underground sites (11%), bridges and boat basins. (25%), churches (36%), cemeteries (12%) and other buildings (16%). Underground sites were visited both in summer and winter, the other sites only in summer. Mist-netting was performed in wetlands at sites located in the southern, central and northern parts of the lake area. Additional data were obtained by acoustic surveys and from the finding of dead or injured bats. We recorded at least 18 species and 79 roosts. Pipistrellus kuhlii and P. pipistrellus were the species most frequently observed roosting in buildings; Myotis daubentonii was the commonest species in bridges and boat basins. Such species were also the most frequently caught in mist-netting sessions. Three winter roosts (each used by 1-10 bats) and a nursery site used by species of major conservation concern (Habitats Directive, Annex 11) were found. Annual counts of the maternity colony varied from 694 to 919 bats aged >= 1 year, mainly M. capaccinii, marginally (about 50) M. blythii and M. myotis. At present, this is the only known site of occurrence for M. capaccinii in Piedmont. Rhinolophus ferrumequinum was recorded only once (a single hibernating individual). Old guano dumps referable to the species were discovered in five buildings, now abandoned, suggesting it was formerly more common. R. hipposideros is probably locally extinct, or very close to extinction. The species, never recorded in the survey, was deemed very common and widespread in Piedmont in the first half of last century.

A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER AND THE TIMING SHIFT OF THE BIRD ARRIVAL IN THE NORTH-EASTERN BAIKAL REGION	NATURE CONSERVATION RESEARCH												The article deals with the main results of a long-term study of birds in the Barguzin State Nature Biosphere Reserve (Russia). Phenological observations of the bird spring arrival have been carried out from 1938 to 2020. Monitoring of bird communities has been carried out from 1984 to 2020 on permanent counting mutes in the valleys of three rivers in the area from the Lake Baikal coast to the highlands of the Barguzin Range (460-1700 m a.s.l.). We detected shifts and cyclical changes in the timing of the bird arrival and revealed a steady decrease in the abundance of the bird population after 1997-1998. The long-term series of observations (taking into account of model bird groups) made it possible to identify some responses of the biota to climatic changes in the Lake Baikal Region. Twenty-six species (40.0%) began to arrive in spring statistically significantly earlier, seven species (10.8%) significantly later, and for 32 species (49.2%) the arrival timing did not change statistically significantly. In contrary to Europe and North America, in the Baikal Region, the proportion of distant migrants in the group of early arriving bird species is higher than in the group of nearby migrants. We suggest that these differences may be associated with different wintering areas of long-distance migrants (species of the Baikal Region winter in South and Southeast Asia in contrast to African wintering areas of European birds). In the Baikal Region, the periods of high and low abundance in background species populations are probably associated with the passage of wet and dry phases of a long climatic cycle. We have identified positive trends in long-term changes in abundance for seven background species (14.0%), and a steady decline in abundance for 17 species (34.0%). In addition, we noted an equal ratio of species with a positive and negative trend in native species abundance. Negative trends of changes in the number of distant and nearby migrants prevailed over positive (increase) trends. So. we found 14 species with negative and four species with positive trends. An increase in the duration of observations makes it possible to give a more reliable assessment of processes in population dynamics, and identify mechanisms of the influence of meteorological and phenological factors on the dynamics of the abundance of bird species. This makes it possible to predict some biota responses to long-term climate changes in the absence of anthropogenic transformations of the natural environment.					; Ananin, Alexander/AAE-6983-2020	Ananin, Aleksandr/0000-0002-9251-0563; 													2500-008X						2022	7	2					1	15		10.24189/ncr.2022.021	http://dx.doi.org/10.24189/ncr.2022.021													WOS:000792445600001

As new feather production is energy demanding, these birds need to choose a safe moulting site with appropriate food supply. Up to 20,000 waterbirds carry out moult at Lake Constance, gathering at sites where they find food close to safe hiding places from predators and human-caused disturbance. In this study, we focused on the food supply at one prominent moulting site, Mettnau Sudbucht, at Lower Lake Constance. We aimed to determine the food items and quantity as well as their utilization by summering and moulting waterbirds. We conducted experiments with exclosure cages which protected macrophytes from bird grazing and compared these sites with unprotected grazed sites. In these experiments, we found that the summering and moulting waterbird community, dominated by Eurasian Coots (Fulica atra Linnaeus), caused a significant decline of the macrophyte biomass at 1.5-m depth (MWL), where they were responsible for a loss of over 40% of the total charophyte biomass. No grazing effect was found at a greater depth (2-m MWL). The available food consisted mostly of Chara spp. with a biomass density of about 350 g m(-2). Animal food items were negligible: Macroinvertebrates, mainly Asellus aquaticus Linnaeus, that were associated with the macrophytes, made up only 2% of total biomass, and were very unevenly distributed.

Survey of lotus root habitat under the lake bottom using a single-beam acoustic technique: in Lake Izunuma	2013 MTS/IEEE OCEANS - BERGEN	OCEANS-IEEE				MTS/IEEE OCEANS Conference	JUN 10-14, 2013	Bergen, NORWAY	Marine Technol Soc, IEEE, IEEE Ocean Engn Soc, SFE Power, Marintek, Norwegian Def Res Estab, Inst Marine Res, Univ Bergen, Geophys Inst, Gersemia, Bekkadal Consultancy & Engn Serv, NERSC				The distributions and population dynamics of plant species are modified by environmental factors. The grazing intensity of herbivores may have major effects on aquatic plants. Lake Izunuma is located in the northeast of Japan and is one of the most famous wintering grounds for swans. The foraging activities of whooper swans (Cygnus cygnus) were observed frequently during the winter of 2011-2012. During the spring, the distribution of lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) differed in various locations and it seemed to be affected by the predation pressure of swans. Understanding the interactions between lotuses and whooper swans is essential for the appropriate control of lake ecosystems. Therefore, a more efficient monitoring system is needed to assess the status of the lake. In this study, we originally integrated a single-beam acoustic measurement system and conducted the in situ investigation of lotus root habitat under the lake bottom. The layer of maddy sand and lotus root were clearly detected by the measurement method. This novel survey method will contribute to sustainable management in the rapidly changing underwater environments found in lakes.

While temporal dynamics of pCO2 and pCH4 have been extensively studied, there is a noticeable gap in the literature concerning their spatial characteristics. In this study, we used boat-mounted sensors to directly measure pCO2 and pCH4 with high spatial resolution across seasons in Xuanwu Lake (XWL), an urban lake in Nanjing, China. Additionally, water chemistries were measured at selected sites for correlation analysis. Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effects of measurement location and density on carbon flux estimates. Results show that continuous on-board measurements innovatively captured the spatial distribution of pCO2 and pCH4. Both gases varied significantly across seasons, exhibiting pronounced spatial heterogeneity. Peak emissions occurred in summer, with the lowest CO2 in spring and CH4 in fall. Both pCO2 and pCH4 increased from the lake center to the shoreline, with the largest fluctuations near the shore. In total, XWL acted as a net source of CO2 and CH4, with mean diffusive fluxes of 11.4 +/- 10.1 and 3.0 +/- 0.3 mmol center dot m- 2 center dot d- 1, respectively. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis showed that lake-wide flux calculations depend on measurement locations and sample size. pCO2 exhibited greater heterogeneity than pCH4, necessitating different sampling thresholds. The optimal threshold for capturing lake-wide CO2 flux was 18-30 samples per km2, while this density was sufficient for CH4 flux estimates. Our study highlights that both CO2 and CH4 exhibit significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity, necessitating high-resolution sampling for accurate flux assessments. The sampling strategy presented could guide future studies, as sampling in the intermediate zone effectively reduces the number of samples needed while maintaining accuracy.

J	KRACHT, V				KRACHT, V			TRANSIENT MEROMIXIS AND RELATED CHANGES OF EUTROPHICATION PARAMETERS IN A SMALL POLYTROPHIC LAKE IN SOUTHWEST GERMANY	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Nutrient cycles and development of phytoplankton in polytrophic Lake Stadtsee was studied from March 1980-March 1982. Related to an extreme blue-green bloom of Oscillatoria redekei during thermal stratification in summer 1980, inorganic N, phosphate and other eutrophication-indicating substances of the epilimnetic layer were largely depleted. A contemporary enrichment of these substances were measured in the anaerobic hypolimnion. In spring 1981 the usually dimictic Lake Stadtsee showed merely a meromixis. The internal loading of the trophogenic zone was suspended. Phytoplankton biomass of the following summer was reduced to < 0.5% of the values from 1980. The amount of blue-green algae decreased completely after springtime. While extraordinary enrichment of nutrients could be measured in the hypolimnion, the epilimnetic content of inorganic N and phosphate was also higher than the year before, resulting from the reduced demand by phytoplankton. The reduced development of algae is interpreted as a result of the suspended internal nutrient cycle. The role of dissolved organic matter as possible growth-limiting factor is discussed.																			0003-9136						1983	98	1					93	114																WOS:A1983RD70000006
J	Rafalowska, M				Rafalowska, Malgorzata			ESTIMATION OF THE NITRATE(V) CONTENT IN THE SURFACE WATERS OF AN AREA PARTICULARLY EXPOSED TO POLLUTION FROM AGRICULTURAL SOURCES	ECOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY AND ENGINEERING A-CHEMIA I INZYNIERIA EKOLOGICZNA A												The aim of the research was to estimate the concentrations and loads of nitrate nitrogen(V) as well as their seasonal changes in the waters flowing from the catchments qualified as areas in particular danger of nitrate pollution from agricultural sources. The tests were conducted in the years 2005-2007 in the catchment of Dobskie Lake. The research covered four parts of the Dobskie Lake catchment, in which the discharges and properties of the waters were established. Water samples for laboratory tests were collected once a month. Nitrate nitrogen(V) content and physicochemical parameters such as temperature, pH reaction, oxygen saturation and electrolytic conductivity were evaluated in the samples. The obtained results indicate that intensified agricultural utilisation of the area causes a marked increase in the concentrations of nitrate nitrogen(V), in surface waters, particularly in drainage waters. The highest concentrations of N-NO3 occur in winter (on average 17.38 mg . dm(-3)) in drainage waters flowing from the intensively utilised area, and the lowest in watercourses, particularly in spring and summer (0.13-0.25 mg . dm(-3)). The load of N-NO3 flowing from the agricultural catchment depends on the meteorological conditions, the type of drainage system and the intensity of the catchment utilisation. A substantial part (about 45%) of the yearly charge of N-NO3 occurs in wintertime. It is a result of an intensive inflow of nitrogen with the thawing snow and precipitation in the period of limited bioaccumulation. The results of research indicate a potential negative influence of the waters flowing from agricultural areas, mostly through drainage systems, on the waters of Dobskie Lake. Considering high concentrations and loads of nitrates in the waters flowing into the lake, we can qualify it as exposed to eutrophication. This confirms the legitimacy of regarding the area as one where the flow of nitrogen from agricultural sources ought to be limited.																			1898-6188	2084-4530					2009	16	1-2					49	60																WOS:000420251600006

In addition this deficit is gradually deepening, when the annual sum of precipitation does not excess 550 mm. Improvement of water reserves in habitats is one of aims of so-called small retention. The object of study is to analyze the size of the components of the water balance in dreinage river valleys micro-catchments of peatland. The study used the results of research and field observations from the years 2010 - 14. Catchment ditch K-2 is located in the Sosnowica - Piwonia river basin. The catchment area of the ditch is 0.46 km2 and is 86% as a one-crop seminatural meadows land use. The soil cover is dominated by degraded soil muck-peat (MtIIbb). In the catchment area 75% of the habitat moorshed and moist with a high groundwater level. Carried out investigations indicate significant impact of meteorological conditions as well as habitats on runoff index and retention changes in analyzed hydrological years. The highest rates occurred in the summer half of the outflow year 2009/10, and have been associated with heavy rainfall in May and in August and September. They amounted to 90 mm and were almost three times higher than in an average year, similar to 2011/12. Water flow is composed equally of surface runoff and underground outflow. This balance is particularly true with regard to the flatness of the terrain and reduced absorbency of hindering drainage. Especially during the spring thaw the soil can not accumulate large amounts of water. Retention observed changes were low, because of the high capillary rise of organic soils. The observed mediocre in the year negative value retention demonstrates the need for irrigation of the land. Studies have confirmed the dominant role of surface evaporation in the water balance. This is evidenced by the lower outflows in the first half year compared to the first half of the winter and fall in the average retention. High evaporation mainly favors the occurrence of shallow water and the air temperature. Potential evapotranspiration of grassland areas sufficiently moisture exceed 500 mm. The resulting work results differ from the calculation for the Leczna-Wlodawa Lakeland. Indicator values for the period 1951-1995 are: rainfall 550 mm, 108 mm outflow, evaporation 442 mm, changing retention assumed 0 mm. While the similar results were achieved with research conducted in the catchment ditch the G-8, where in a normal water outflow amounted to 102 mm, and retention decreased by 33 mm.					; GRZYWNA, ANTONI/T-7179-2018	grzywna, antoni/0000-0002-7105-7173; 													1506-218X						2016	18		1				519	530																WOS:000382802400033

This is particularly true for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), where approximately 50% of the lakes in China are located. Continuous direct measurements of the water flux and surface energy budget were made over the largest high-altitude saline lake in China, Qinghai Lake on the northeastern QTP, using the eddy covariance method from 11 May 2013 to 10 May 2015. Results indicated that annual evaporation of Qinghai Lake was 832.5mm for 2013/2014 and 823.6mm for 2014/2015, respectively. The surface energy budget and evaporation showed a strong seasonal pattern, with peaks in the latent and sensible heat flux observed in autumn and early winter. There was a 2-3 month delay between the maximum net radiation and maximum latent and sensible heat fluxes. Intraseasonal and seasonal variations in latent and sensible heat flux were strongly affected by different air masses. Westerly cold and dry air masses increased evaporation while southeast moist air mass suppressed evaporation, suggesting that the lakes might serve as an air conditioner to modify the temporal heat and water flux in the QTP.					hu, ongxia/GQP-8544-2022; Ma, Yujun/F-8722-2014; Li, Xiaoyan/K-8544-2012; Si-Yi, Zhang/ISS-2652-2023; Zhiyun, Jiang/ABF-3554-2021	zhang, si yi/0000-0003-1928-5766; Li, XiaoYan/0000-0002-7454-7821; WU, Xiuchen/0000-0003-0396-7439; Jiang, Zhi-Yun/0000-0002-6457-0016; wang, pei/0000-0002-8647-253X													2169-897X	2169-8996				SEP 27	2016	121	18					10470	10485		10.1002/2016JD025027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2016JD025027													WOS:000385836000013

Although MDVs foehn events are known to depend upon the synoptic-scale circulation, the physical processes responsible for foehn events are unknown. A polar-optimized version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (Polar WRF) is used for a case study of a representative summer foehn event from 29 December 2006 to 1 January 2007 in order to identify and explain the MDVs foehn mechanism. Pressure differences across an elevated mountain gap upstream of the MDVs provide forcing for southerly flow into the western, upvalley entrance of the MDVs. Complex terrain over the elevated gap and the MDVs leads to mountain wave effects such as leeside acceleration, hydraulic jumps, wave breaking and critical layers. These mountain wave effects depend on the ambient (geostrophic) wind direction. Pressure-driven channelling then brings the warm, dry foehn air downvalley to eastern MDV sites. Brief easterly intrusions of maritime air into the eastern MDVs during foehn events previously have been attributed to either a sea-breeze effect in summer or local cold-pooling effects in winter. In this particular case, the easterly intrusions result from blocking effects of nearby Ross Island and the adjacent Antarctic coast. Temperature variability during the summer foehn event, which is important for meltwater production and biological activity when it exceeds 0 degrees C, primarily depends on the source airmass rather than differences in foehn dynamics.					; Bromwich, David/C-9225-2016	Steinhoff, Daniel/0000-0002-4233-8750; Monaghan, Andrew/0000-0002-8170-2359													0035-9009	1477-870X				JUL	2013	139	675	B				1615	1631		10.1002/qj.2038	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/qj.2038													WOS:000324390000016

In this study, we evaluated the evaporation rates and losses for 678 major reservoirs (representing nearly 90% of total storage capacity) in the Contiguous United States over historical baseline (1980-2019), near-term (2020-2039), and mid-term (2040-2059) future periods. The evaporation rate was estimated using the Lake Evaporation Model (LEM), an advanced lake evaporation model that addresses both heat storage and fetch effects, driven by multi-ensemble downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects 6 (CMIP6) projections under the SSP585 emission scenario. The results project that the evaporation loss may increase by 2.5 x 10(7) m(3)/yr through the research period (1980-2059). Among all regions, the Rio Grande is projected to have the largest increasing rate in the near-term and mid-term future, with values of 7.11% of 10.25%, respectively. At the seasonal scale, the most significant increase in the evaporation rate is projected during the fall. The evaporation is projected to increase faster than the streamflow over many of the regions in the southwestern US during the summer/fall, suggesting that the shortage of water will be further exacerbated. The climate models contribute the most to the variance, as compared to the other components related to the projection of evaporation losses (e.g., hydrological model, downscaling method, and historical meteorological data set). These findings demonstrate the need to consider accelerated water loss through open water evaporation in long-term water resources planning across various spatiotemporal scales.

Importance of CO2 evasion from small boreal streams	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Boreal lakes are known to be supersaturated with CO2 and to be significant sources of CO2 to the atmosphere. In this study it is shown that small boreal streams are relatively more supersaturated with CO2 and also represent an important source of CO2 evasion to the atmosphere from boreal catchments. Small boreal streams account for an annual (ice-free seasons) average of 8.0% and a seasonal high of 34.4% of the total CO2 evaded from streams and lakes. A seasonal pattern is found, with evasion from streams being greatest during the summer and least during the spring. The evasion of CO2 by small boreal streams represents 77% of the total CO2 and 36% of the total organic carbon and total inorganic carbon exported by the streams from the catchments to the lakes. Knowledge of this important transfer and loss mechanism for CO2 will allow for more accurate modeling of boreal catchment C budgets.																			0886-6236	1944-9224				OCT 14	2010	24								GB4003	10.1029/2009GB003723	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009GB003723													WOS:000283080700002

Sampling was stratified by day type (day and night) and habitat type (bass-cove and saugeye-main-lake shoreline and points). CPUE (N fish/hour) was calculated for 4 size classes and compared for each sampling stratum. Precision of the estimates was calculated and sampling recommendations made. Differences in seasonal catch rates were inconsistent among reservoirs and size classes. CPUEs of night samples were higher for size class A (less than or equal to 310 mm; age 0) on all reservoirs. However, no clear diel pattern in catch rates of size classes B (311-400 mm; age 1), C (401-456 mm), or D (greater than or equal to 457 mm) was observed. Habitat type had little effect on CPUE and its associated precision. Precision of most samples was poor. A minimum of 10 hours of electrofishing would be needed to obtain estimates +/-25% of the mean for most sampling strata tested. Sampling recommendations included collecting data on size class A using fall night electrofishing. However, reservoir-specific differences in catch rates and precision of the sampling strata tested would make statewide recommendations for appropriate sampling strategies of the larger size classes of saugeye suspect. It was recommended to change from a catch rate-based evaluation program to one based on size structure indices.																									1997							60	71																WOS:000081833300014

The study was conducted on the 360 km(2) Lake Gariep, South Africa's largest freshwater reservoir. A total of 508 anglers were interviewed between February 2007 and January 2008. Of those interviewed, 67% were subsistence anglers and 33% recreational anglers. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) did not differ significantly between sectors. CPUE fluctuated seasonally, ranging between 0.37 (95% CI= 0.26 to 0.51) kg angler(-1) - h(-1) in winter and 0.88 (0.67 to 1.17) kg angler (1.)h(-1) in summer. The duration of a fishing day ranged from 5.99 (5.24 to 6.74) h in mid-winter to 7.26 (6.88 to 7.63) h in early summer. Expected end-of-day catch (CPUE x fishing-trip duration) ranged from 2.2 to 6.4 kg . angler(-1).d(-1) depending on the season. The number of anglers ranged from 22 (8 to 53) anglers.d(-1) in June/ July to 74 (25 to 176) anglers.d(-1) in April. Total annual catch from the roving creel survey was estimated at 71.4 (57.4 to 91.4) t.yr(-1). Another 7.5 t.yr(-1) were landed during recreational angling competitions. The resultant total catch divided by the lakeshore population equated to a per capita fish supply of 11.1 kg.yr(-1). More than 70% of the catch was the alien invasive carp Cyprinus carpio and there was no evidence of overfishing. The fish resource of Lake Gariep is of significant recreational and subsistence value. As a result of the low fish price (ZAR5.72 +/- 2.60 . kg(-1)) subsistence fishing was considered a low-revenue activity that mainly augmented food security in lakeshore communities. The relatively high CPUE indicated that the fishery may be an important safety-net during periods when alternate sources of livelihoods are limited. Consequently, we recommend that the importance of angling to local communities needs to be taken into account when planning fisheries development and developing an inland fisheries policy.					; Booth, Anthony/C-9932-2012	Weyl, Olaf/0000-0002-8935-3296; Booth, Anthony/0000-0002-5561-9260													0378-4738	1816-7950				JAN	2010	36	1					45	51																WOS:000274194000006

In unenriched lake water, growth was more rapid in Padarn water during autumn-winter-spring. There was no significant difference between growth in water from the 2 lakes during the period of thermal stratification. Mean growth rates in treatments with additions of N and chelated Fe were not significantly different from unenriched water samples, both between treatments and lakes during thermal stratification. Growth in water from both lakes was increased greatly by addition of phosphate. Maximum growth rates occurred on addition of N, phosphate and chelated Fe and there was no significant difference between growth rates in this treatment for the 2 lakes throughout the year. Comparisons of mean growth rates in bioassays by Tukey''s interval estimate showed significant differences between other treatments and the 2 lakes. The potential fertility of water samples from the 2 lakes differs more during mixed water conditions than in the period of thermal stratification. Inhibition of A. formosa growth was recorded 4 times in unenriched filtered water from Peris, once on addition of N and once on addition of Fe. Inhibition was alleviated by the addition of nutrients. The addition of diluted sewage effluent which enters the drainage system between the 2 lakes, resulted in similar rates of growth of A. formosa in water from both lakes. Results of the bioassays are discussed in relation to differences in phytoplankton between the 2 lakes. Although A. formosa will grow in samples of unenriched lake water from Peris, other features, including a shorter retention time of water, lower level of incident radiation and, occasionally, inhibitory substances in the lake water, contribute to the rare occurrence of this diatom in Peris. Padarn is enriched by sewage effluent which aids the growth of A. formosa.																			0046-5070	1365-2427					1981	11	5					473	491		10.1111/j.1365-2427.1981.tb01278.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.1981.tb01278.x													WOS:A1981MJ90100007
J	COMRIE, AC				COMRIE, AC			AN ENHANCED SYNOPTIC CLIMATOLOGY OF OZONE USING A SEQUENCING TECHNIQUE	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												A synoptic classification scheme is derived to examine basic associations between surface ozone pollution and the atmospheric circulation. Nine weather types are related to the daily maximum ozone concentration in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for the years 1978-1987. A sequencing technique is developed to extract the maximum utility from the classification scheme. An analysis of the sequences of synoptic weather types highlights additional spatial and temporal information, such as air mass origins, system speed, and seasonal variations. Low concentrations of ozone are experienced in winter during lake-effect and cyclonic storms, which move in rapidly from the northwest, bringing cold, cloudy, windy conditions with precipitation. High concentrations occur during summer in slow-moving anticyclones, with southwesterly transport and warm, sunny conditions that are favorable for photochemical formation of ozone. The study demonstrates that the use of a sequencing technique in conjunction with a synoptic classification scheme enables a more thorough analysis of the data.																			0272-3646					JAN-MAR	1992	13	1					53	65		10.1080/02723646.1992.10642444	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723646.1992.10642444													WOS:A1992HT37700004
J	Adams, KD				Adams, Kenneth D.			Lake levels and sedimentary environments during deposition of the Trego Hot Springs and Wono tephras in the Lake Lahontan basin, Nevada, USA	QUATERNARY RESEARCH												The Wono and Trego Hot Springs (THS) tephras are widespread in the Lahontan basin and have been identified in a variety of sedimentary environments at different elevations. Davis (1983) reported lake level to be at about 1256 m when the THS tephra was deposited, an interpretation questioned by Benson et al. (1997) who interpreted lake level to be <= 1177 m at that time. This is a significant difference in lake size with important implications for interpreting the climate that prevailed at that time. Based on new interpretations of depositional settings of the THS bed at multiple sites, the larger lake size is correct. Additional sites containing the Wono tephra indicate that it was deposited when lake level was at about 1217 m in the western subbasins and at about 1205 m in the Carson Sink. Sedimentary features associated with progressively deeper paleowater depths follow a predictable pattern that is modulated by proximity to sediment sources and local slope. Fine to coarse sands with wave-formed features are commonly associated with relatively shallow water. Silty clay or clay dominates in paleowater depths > 25 m, with thin laminae of sand and ostracods at sites located adjacent to or downslope from steep mountain fronts.

Hydrology of annual winter water level drawdown regimes in recreational lakes of Massachusetts, United States. Lake Reserv Manage. XX: XXX-XXX. Annual winter water level drawdown (WD) is a common lake management strategy to maintain recreational value by controlling nuisance macrophytes and preventing ice damage to shoreline infrastructure in lakes of the northeastern United States. The state of Massachusetts provides general guidelines for lake managers to implement and practice WDs. However, WD management reporting is not required and as such empirical water level records are scarce, making it difficult to assess guideline adherence and link these management actions to littoral habitat conditions. We monitored water levels bihourly in 18 lakes with ongoing WD regimes and 3 non-drawdown lakes over 3-4 yr. Our results show an interlake drawdown magnitude gradient of 0.07-2.66 m with intralake consistency across years. Corresponding WD magnitudes generated exposure of 1.3-37.6% for entire lakebeds and 9.2-71.1% for littoral zones. WD durations averaged 171 d and ranged widely from 5 to 246 d. Longer recession and refill phase durations and faster recession rates were moderately to strongly correlated with drawdown magnitudes. WDs were predominantly initiated prior to the state of Massachusetts 1 November starting guideline (83.1%) and refilled to summer reference levels after the recommended date of 1 April (70.6%). To minimize ecological impacts while still meeting recreational goals, WD performance guidelines may require a more fine-scale approach that integrates local hydrogeomorphic features and the presence of WD-sensitive littoral biotic assemblages. However, climate change model projections of warmer and wetter winters in the Northeast indicate increasing uncertainty for WD as an effective and worthwhile macrophyte control tool.

Plankton net samples and sedimenting matter in traps from mesotrophic Lake Erken, Sweden, were analysed for carbon (C), nitrogen (N) phosphorus (P), total lipids and fatty acid (FA) content to determine what differences and seasonal changes might exist in the quality of food available to pelagic zooplankters and benthic invertebrates. 2. Matter collected in a plankton net was assumed to correspond to food available to pelagic grazers, while matter collected in sedimentation traps provided a measure of food available to benthic invertebrates. Furthermore, food quality was assumed to be related to polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content. 3. The results suggest that suspended particulate matter, collected with a plankton net, is a much higher-quality food resource than sedimenting matter. Our data also show that only during the spring and autumn do the benthic fauna have access to high-quality food, because of the dominance of diatoms during these periods. During summer pelagic grazer production was probably limited by food quantity, whereas benthic invertebrate production was probably Limited by food quality. 4. Plankton net samples showed consistently higher values than trap samples (% of dry weight, DW, or mg g(-1) DW) for nearly all variables analysed: C, N, P, saturated FA (SAFA), monounsaturated FA (MUFA) PUFA, omega 3 FA and omega 6 FA. If N and P were expressed per C, the differences decreased and both data sets indicated moderate to no N or P limitation. N/P also showed well-balanced ratios throughout most of the season, on average 10 and 7 (by weight), respectively. The largest differences between the two food resources occurred in the PUFA content, including the important FA of the omega 3 type. The only FA with higher levels in the trap samples were some unidentified FA of relatively short chain lengths. Seasonal variation for most variables was also very large in both net and trap samples. 5. PUFA and omega 3 FA showed good relationships with the P content of net samples, but not with that of trap samples. Eicosapentaenoic acid alone did not give a good relationship with P. Thus, P seems to be a good predictor of food quality in Living phytoplankton but not in dead matter or detritus.

J	Poister, D; DeGuelle, C				Poister, D; DeGuelle, C			The influence of particle size distribution and composition on seasonal sedimentation rates in a temperate lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA												To evaluate the effect of particle size and composition on seasonal changes in the sedimentation rate, suspended and sedimenting particles were collected from Trout Lake, Wisconsin, USA during the 2002 ice-free season. Particles were characterized with regard to particulate biogenic silicon (PBSi) concentration and distribution between four size classes. The concentration of particulate chlorophyll and chlorophyll degradation products was also measured in water column particles and sediment trap material collected during the first half of the sampling period. The highest rates of mass sedimentation during the stratified period were measured in spring and early summer. Seasonal increases in sedimentation are related to the presence of large colonial diatoms in the water column as indicated by elevated PBSi concentrations. The majority of particulate matter in the water column was found in the smallest (< 20 mu m) size fraction while most of the mass of sediment trap material was in larger size fractions (> 20 mu m). Smaller cells appear to carry out most of the photosynthesis in Trout Lake but larger cells are responsible for seasonal trends in sedimentation. These results may explain how pelagic photosynthesis and sedimentation rates can be quantitatively decoupled across a range of trophic conditions but appear correlated when based on mid-summer measurements.																			0018-8158					MAR 15	2005	537						35	46		10.1007/s10750-004-1711-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-004-1711-7													WOS:000230589900005

Trophic relations between food web compartments were quantitatively considered to evaluate ecological forces. Monthly data of inflow discharges and take volume were used to calculate residence time values in relation to rainfall and water level. The seasonal fluctuations of the hydrological parameters, nutrients, and plankton inventories represent typical subtropical pattern: high level in winter and low in summer months. It was found that nitrogen inventories in the lake declined. and the biomass of grazable phytoplankton was enhanced since early 1980's. Dissolved phosphorus was decreased mostly in summer months when the lake is nutrient limited, as a result of phytoplankton uptake. Zooplankton was declined until 1993 and increased later. The most abundant zooplanktivorous fish, Lavnun (Bleak, Acanthobrama spp.) densities increased during 1993-95 and subsidized fishery caused zooplankton enhancement and consequently suppression of primary production. Lavnun removal might be efficient to enhance zooplankton grazing capacity and algal suppression if external phosphorus loads from the drainage basin are reduced. The major effect on nutrient inventories in the lake is due to inputs from the drainage basin. Consequently, management implications aimed at lake water quality protection should be mostly directed towards nutrient removal in the drainage basin and loads reduction by pumping water for supply. The water storage capacity in the lake is significant to ensure maximum utilization.																					3-540-20771-6				2004							41	54																WOS:000189496600005

The hydrological regimes, as well as vegetation dynamics, in the wetland have experienced substantial changes due to global climate change and anthropogenic disturbances, such as the construction of hydroelectric dams. However, few studies have investigated how the wetland vegetation has changed over time, particularly during the wintering season, and how this has directly affected habitat suitability for migratory waterfowl. Thus, it is necessary to monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation in the protected wetland and explore the potential factors that alter it. In this study, the data set of time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 2000 to 2018 was used to analyze the seasonal dynamics and interannual trends of vegetation over the wintering period from October to January. The results showed that the average NDVI exhibited an overall increasing trend, with the trend rising slowly in recent years. The largest monthly mean NDVI generally occurred in November, which is pertinent to the quantity of wintering waterfowl in the East Dongting Lake wetland. Meanwhile, the mean NDVI in the wintering season is significantly correlated to temperature and water area, with apparent lagging effects. Long-term stability analysis presented a gradually decreasing pattern from the central body of water to the surrounding area. All analyses will help the government to make appropriate management strategies to protect the habitat of wintering waterfowl in the wetland.																				2071-1050				SEP	2019	11	18							4936	10.3390/su11184936	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11184936													WOS:000489104700122

This project determined the relative contribution of stocked, advanced fingerlings (89-160 mm) reared on either fathead minnows Pimephales promelas, pelleted feed, or pellets followed by minnows to bass year-class strength. Bass were stocked at seven stations in Crab Orchard Lake, Illinois in summer 1993-1996 and 1998. Electrofishing catch of all age-0 bass averaged 39.2 per hour and ranged from 18.7 to 73.9 per hour. Stocked bass contributed 16.0 percent of the age-0 fish collected (n = 1,623) during fall and 13.8 percent of the age-l bass collected during spring (n = 843). Relative survival (RS) at age-0 favored minnow-reared bass by 1.3-16.2 to one over pellet-reared bass and was statistically significant (p < 0.05) in two of three years. Survival at age-0 favored bass sequentially fed the prepared diet and minnows with, RS of 0.4-0.8, but was only statistically significant in one of two years, RS of age-1, minnow-reared bass was 1.5-4.1 times that of pellet-reared fish and statistically significant in all five years. Largemouth bass fed a minnow diet for 14 days prior to stocking will survive at least as well a minnowreared bass through age-0, and both diets resulted in higher bass survival than with pellets alone. By age-1, however, survival favored bass reared on minnows exclusively.																			0892-2284		1-888569-38-7				2002	31						703	714																WOS:000180817600058

Foraging activity and habitat use throughout an annual migration of adult walleye (Sander vitreus) from the Trent River in eastern Lake Ontario	ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY												BackgroundMature walleye (Sander vitreus) that spawn in the Trent River conduct long-distance annual migrations into eastern Lake Ontario that begin and end in the Bay of Quinte. This scale of movement likely reflects seasonal spawning activity in the spring and a combination of temperature and foraging preferences at other times of the year. This study used a combination of acoustic transmitters and pop-off data storage tags to collect high-resolution data on temperature, depth, rate of vertical movement (ROVM), and rate of horizontal movement (ROHM) during these migrations. We tested the theory that post-spawn fish migrating to Lake Ontario experience colder water temperatures than those remaining in the upper Bay of Quinte, and offset this cost with greater foraging, as indicated by ROVM. We also documented the trends in these variables seasonally at the daily and hourly level.ResultsTemperature experienced by walleye in the lake (11.56 degrees C; SE +/- 0.1) was on average 5.33 degrees C colder than in the upper bay (16.89 degrees C; SE +/- 0.3), and there was a 15.5% increase in ROVM for fish in the lake. All the measured variables had significant seasonal trends, while only temperature, depth, and ROVM had significant hour of day trends. Sex based differences were limited to males having greater annual ROVM than females.ConclusionsThere were differences in thermal habitat selection and vertical activity measures between the upper bay and Lake Ontario, which supported the current conceptual model of post-spawn walleye migration from the Bay of Quinte. Vertical activity peaked during crepuscular periods during the summer and fall when water temperatures promoted growth. This study demonstrates the value of combining tagging techniques to collect high-resolution data across multiple aspects of annual fish migrations.

Graham; Huntley, Brian			Holocene climate variability in northernmost Europe	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												The sediments of a small lake on Nordkinnhalv circle divide ya, Finnmark, Norway, were investigated in order to test the hypothesis that this region was sensitive to centennial-millennial climatic fluctuations during the Holocene related to changes in ocean circulation. Sedimentation at the site began during the Younger Dryas, although the site chronology, developed using a series of 14 C age measurements, reveals an early Holocene hiatus in accumulation. Pollen analysis confirmed that the regional vegetation responded to Holocene climatic variability at centennial-millennial time scales and provided data used to make quantitative palaeoclimate reconstructions. The latter indicate that marked changes in seasonality characterised Holocene climatic fluctuations. Intervals with warmer summers, higher temperature sums and higher precipitation, but cooler winters and generally reduced moisture availability, alternated with intervals with cooler summers, lower temperature sums, lower precipitation, warmer winters and greater moisture availability. The former conditions were more prevalent between ca 8950 and 3950 cal BP, whereas the latter were predominant before ca 8950 and since ca 3950 cal BP. Sediment geochemistry indicates minerogenic material deposited in the lake was probably derived from two or more distinct sources or transport pathways that differed in their responses to palaeoclimatic conditions. A series of cryptotephras were located, although the small size of the shards rendered them unsuitable for electron microprobe analyses. Time-series analysis of pollen analytical and sediment geochemical data indicates that each exhibits statistically significant periodic behaviour (at periods of ca 190, 410, 1050, 1650 and 18 10 yr). The periods detected suggest this behaviour may reflect regional expression of climate system responses to solar variability and/or of effects upon tides and ocean circulation of periodic lunar orbital variation. Comparison with records of fluctuations in ocean thermohaline circulation strength indicate some concordance with respect to timing of warmer and cooler intervals, but also some differences. The 8.2 ka event, that is evident in marine records from the Barents Sea, is clearly expressed by both the palaeovegetation and geochernical records. Distinctive temporal behaviour of the palaeovegetation and of different geochernical components indicates complexity in the underlying causes and mechanisms of regional climatic variability; ocean circulation variability alone cannot account for the complex climatic variability observed.

J	STOTTLEMYER, R; TOCZYDLOWSKI, D				STOTTLEMYER, R; TOCZYDLOWSKI, D			PATTERN OF SOLUTE MOVEMENT FROM SNOW INTO AN UPPER MICHIGAN STREAM	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Precipitation, snowpack, snowmelt, and streamwater samples were collected in a small gauged watershed draining into Lake Superior during winter 1987-88 to assess the importance of snowmelt pattern and meltwater pathways in the occurrence of solute pulses in streamwater. The snowpack along the south shore of Lake Superior can contain 50% of annual precipitation inputs and 38% of annual ionic inputs including moderate levels of strong acids. Throughout winter, thawed surface soils and small but steady snowpack moisture relase promoted movement of snowpack solutes to surface mineral soils. Preferential elution of K+, NH4+, and H+ from the snowpack occurred with the initial thaw. Most ions exhibited pulses in snowmelt. Transport of snowpack solutes to the stream during snowmelt was through near-surface soil macropores, and overland flow. For those ions with concentrations higher in the snowpack than in the premelt streamwater, K+, NH4+, and H+, the earliest snowmelt pulses had the greatest influence on streamwater chemistry. Unlike other portions of the region with resistant bedrock, the widespread presence of alkaline glacial till provides excess stream acid neutralization capacity (ANC) to buffer acidic inputs. Peak winter streamwater ANC reduction was caused principally by spring melt dilution of base cations and associated alkalinity, constant high SO42- levels, and an increase in NO3-. The maximum reduction in stream ANC was concurrent with overland flow. Relative to its snowmelt concentration, NO3- was highest in streamwater with some stream input likely the result of nitrification and N mineralization.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				FEB	1990	47	2					290	300		10.1139/f90-031	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f90-031													WOS:A1990CN64400006

Field measurements were conducted using dynamic and static accumulation chambers for cCO2 and cCH4 during multiple seasonal surveys. The study highlights that cCO2 and cCH4 in these volcanic lakes are mainly driven by biogeochemical processes rather than direct volcanic degassing. Total cCO2 at Capitao Lake ranged from 0.10 t d-1 (4 t km-2 d-1) in spring to 0.08 t-1 (3.64 t km-2 d-1) in summer, likely due thermal stratification limiting CO2 release in the latter period. In contrast, Caiado Lake exhibited higher cCO2, increasing from 0.31 t-1 (5.96 t km-2 d-1) to 0.40 t-1 (7.69 t km-2 d-1), possibly influenced by methane oxidation. Methane emissions were significantly lower than CO2 but showed notable seasonal variation. The cCH4 at Capitao Lake increased tenfold from 0.096 kg-1 (4 kg km-2 d-1) in warmer conditions to 0.96 kg-1 (40 kg km-2 d-1) in winter, likely due to water column mixing allowing methane to easily escape from oxidation. At Caiado Lake, cCH4 increased from 1.39 kg-1 (23.96 kg km-2 d-1) to 2.67 kg-1 (46.03 kg km-2 d-1) in the same period. Carbon dioxide largely dominates GHG emissions in the studied lakes, even computing CH4 in terms of CO2-eq, being the cCO2 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than cCH4.

J	Penk, MR; Minchin, D				Penk, Marcin R.; Minchin, Dan			Seasonal migration of a glacial relict mysid (Crustacea) into the littoral zone and its co-occurrence with an introduced competitor in Lough Derg (Ireland)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Temporal migrations by aquatic organisms have important implications for fundamental ecosystem processes and community interactions. Mysid crustaceans, key planktivores and fish prey in aquatic food webs, frequently undertake diurnal vertical migrations, but there are limited reports of horizontal movements. Using seasonal and diurnal field surveys in Lough Derg on the Shannon River (Ireland), we tested the hypotheses that (i) the euryhaline mysid Mysis salemaai expands seasonally its horizontal distribution and that (ii) the diurnal pattern of vertical migration within the shallows overlaps with the introduced mysid Hemimysis anomala. M. salemaai, previously considered an exclusively offshore species, changed its horizontal distribution significantly with seasons, being restricted to a parts per thousand yen8 m in summer and extending to all depths in winter. During winter, the distribution of M. salemaai overlapped with H. anomala in shallows and there was a highly significant overlap in their diurnal emergence in the open water, indicating a strong temporal synchrony of planktonic foraging. The seasonal range expansion of M. salemaai is likely to have important implications for horizontal redistribution of nutrients. Interactions with the sympatric H. anomala are likely, adding to existing physico-chemical pressures on the glacial relict M. salemaai and potentially contributing to its further extirpations.

Source apportionment of the carcinogenic potential of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) associated to airborne PM10 by a PMF model	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												In order to perform a study of the carcinogenic potential of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), benzo(a)pyrene equivalent (BaP-eq) concentration was calculated and modelled by a receptor model based on positive matrix factorization (PMF). Nineteen PAH associated to airborne PM10 of Zaragoza, Spain, were quantified during the sampling period 2001-2009 and used as potential variables by the PMF model. Afterwards, multiple linear regression analysis was used to quantify the potential sources of BaP-eq. Five sources were obtained as the optimal solution and vehicular emission was identified as the main carcinogenic source (35 %) followed by heavy-duty vehicles (28 %), light-oil combustion (18 %), natural gas (10 %) and coal combustion (9 %). Two of the most prevailing directions contributing to this carcinogenic character were the NE and N directions associated with a highway, industrial parks and a paper factory. The lifetime lung cancer risk exceeded the unit risk of 8.7 x 10(-5) per ng/m(3) BaP in both winter and autumn seasons and the most contributing source was the vehicular emission factor becoming an important issue in control strategies.

J	Heaney, SI; Parker, JE; Butterwick, C; Clarke, KJ				Heaney, SI; Parker, JE; Butterwick, C; Clarke, KJ			Interannual variability of algal populations and their influence on lake metabolism	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. An input-output phosphorus budget is given for Windermere and its two basins based on data available for the late 1980s. The annual areal total phosphorus loading for the whole lake was 1.04 g P m(-2) yr(-1) and for the North and South Basins were 1.08 and 1.70 g P m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. For the whole lake and its South Basin the values were similar to the upper range of critical loads calculated according to the equation of Vollenweider (1976) for the transition between oligotrophy and eutrophy while that for the North Basin (1.08 g P m(-2) yr(-1)) was within this range of critical loadings but towards its lower end. 2. Changes in the quality of summer phytoplankton are described for Windermere, particularly its South Basin, between 1978 and 1989 in relation to the utilization of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) in the epilimnion, deoxygenation of the hypolimnion and the ratio of epilimnetic volume to hypolimnetic volume, E(v)/H-v. The two basins of Windermere with values of E(v)/H-v of 0.79 (South Basin) and 0.50 (North Basin) have contrasting conditions of summer deoxygenation. The shallower South Basin shows marked interannual variability in the development of hypolimnetic anoxia. Years with large hypolimnetic anoxia during autumn are correlated with the production during summer of large populations of the poorly grazed blue-green alga Oscillatoria bourrellyi and exhaustion of NO3-N in the upper layers. During years when anoxia does not develop the summer phytoplankton consists of small easily grazed algae or larger ones subject to parasitic epidemics. The deeper North Basin never becomes anoxic even though it can contain similar sized populations of O. bourrellyi to the South Basin. 3. A possible explanation of the between basin and, for the South Basin, between year variation of utilization of NO3-N and level of hypolimnetic deoxygenation is that algal quality can determine lake metabolism dependent upon lake or basin morphology. Poorly grazed large forms such as O. bourrellyi act as sinks for NO3-N. On sedimentation such populations act as a 'short circuit' mechanism descending into deeper layers in sufficient quantities to cause anoxia. Other species subject to crustacean or microbial grazing are mineralized in the epilimnion with little sedimentation to the deeper waters. Subsequent recycling of nitrogen as NH4-N takes place in the upper layers or thermocline which is more readily taken up by subsequent production. The influence of such 'short circuit' mechanisms is reduced in deep lakes and exacerbated in shallow ones. 4. The success of species such as O. bourrellyi is dependent upon a sufficient inoculum, an adequate supply of nutrients and the depth of intermittent mixing. The importance of these factors in regulating presence and timing of summer populations is illustrated and discussed.																			0046-5070					JUN	1996	35	3					561	&																WOS:A1996UY07900007

Almost 1 m of minerogenic basal layers from Lake Flafattjonn, 1110 in a.s.l.., at Tynset, Norway, was deposited in the Lateglacial, possibly as early as 16,000 cal. yr BP. The sediments contain well-preserved remains of plants, diatoms and chironomids and indicate: (1) a mosaic pioneer vegetation of dwarf-shrub tundra, snow bed vegetation and xerophytes on wind-blown ridges, (2) an ice-free lake during summers with clear water at low pH due to little inwash, (3) a continental climate with summers slightly warmer than today (ca 10 degrees C), and most probably with very cold winters, according to indications of permafrost, and (4) a hiatus/reduced sedimentation during at least the first half of the Younger Dryas when the lake was scaled by a more-or-less permanent ice-cover. The existence of Lateglacial nunataks indicates a thin and multi-domed Lateglacial ice-sheet in Scandinavia. Early migration of arctic-alpine plants to nunataks could explain their centric distribution in S Norway. Furthermore, vegetation establishment on the Flafatet Lateglacial nunatak indicates that S Norway could have been vegetated by successions along the retreating ice from alpine nunataks and from coastal and southern areas. The upland and lowland vegetation met at the final deglaciation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Determination of bioavailable Fe in Lake Erie using a luminescent cyanobacterial bioreporter	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Low Fe bioavailability has been suggested as a potential constraint on primary production in the Great Lakes. Here we report on the use of a cyanobacterial bioreporter to assess available Fe in Lake Erie during summer and fall field seasons in 2001-02. Bioreporter luminescence was derived from a luciferase reporter controlled by iron-responsive promoter element isiAB. Filtered (< 0.2 mu m) water sampled from the western basin during summer 2001-02 yielded low bioreporter response indicating Fe sufficient conditions [-log [free Fe3+] (pFe) < 20.8]. Likewise, water collectedfrom the eastern basin following autumnal mixing in November 2001 yielded a Fe sufficient bioreporter response. In contrast, surface water collected at pelagic stations located in central and eastern basins during summer 2002 indicated a seasonal depletion of bioavailable Fe. Whereas water sampled from these locations during July and August was characterized as Fe sufficient (pFe < 20.8), samples collected during September elicited a high luminescent response from the bioreporter (pFe > 21). Contrary to the characterization provided by the filtered samples, assay of bioreporter response in unfiltered water conducted during the September 2002 cruise indicated these samples to be Fe sufficient (pFe < 20.6). Although this suggests that the dominant pool of bioavailable Fe is contained in the particulate fraction, we cannot discount the possibility that the bioreporter was rendered Fe sufficient by Fe regenerated predominantly from bioreporter cells themselves. Thus, while it is clear that regenerative processes contribute to the pool of bioavailable Fe, it is equally clear that future efforts using the bioreporter with unfiltered water samples must account for the potential influence of Fe introduced by the added reporter cells.

Radiocarbon Data Reveal Contrasting Sources for Carbon Fractions in Thermokarst Lakes and Rivers of Eastern Canada (Nunavik, Quebec)	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Greenhouse gas emissions from permafrost organic carbon decomposition in lakes and rivers can accelerate global warming. We used radiocarbon (C-14) measurements to determine the predominant sources of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and methane (CH4) in five thermokarst lakes and three rivers in an area of widespread permafrost degradation in Northern Quebec to assess contributions from thawing permafrost and other old carbon (fixed before CE 1950) reservoirs. We compared emission pathways (dissolved gas and ebullition), seasons (summer and winter), and surface soil type (mineral and peat soils). Modern carbon (fixed after CE 1950) was the dominant source of DOC, DIC, and CH4 of non-peatland aquatic systems, while POC and sediment carbon were predominantly fixed in the last millennia. In the peatland systems, modern and permafrost carbon were important sources of DOC, lake DIC, lake ebullition CO2, and lake dissolved CH4. In contrast, POC, lake ebullition CH4, and river DIC were dominated by millennial-old carbon. In winter, the C-14 age of DOC, DIC, and POC in the peatland lakes increased, but the C-14 age of dissolved CH4 did not change. Our results point to a clearly older overall carbon source for ebullition CH4 relative to dissolved CH4 in the peatland lakes but not the non-peatland lakes. The younger ages of dissolved CH4 and DIC relative to DOC and POC in all lakes suggest that recent primary productivity strongly influences the large total lake CH4 and CO2 emissions in this area, as diffusion fluxes greatly exceed ebullition fluxes.

Stretched between these two systems is a NW-SE-oriented region dominated by descending air masses, resulting in the South American subtropical dry zone (SASDZ), also known as the arid diagonal. We investigated the Cerro Tuzgle cushion peatland (CTP) located on the Argentine Altiplano, north of the present-day SASDZ. Previous work revealed that the CTP was consistently in the SASM regime during the last 2900 cal yr BP. Here, we extend the CTP record to the middle Holocene covering the last 7200 cal yr BP to gain further knowledge of the Holocene development of the SASM and potential modulations of the SASDZ. The prominent feature of the entire record is a distinct and lasting transition centred around 3100 cal yr BP characterized by declining minerogenic content, increasing organic carbon content, rising stable carbon isotope values of organic matter and cellulose, and increasing stable oxygen isotope values of cellulose. We interpret this specific proxy pattern as a hydroclimatic transition towards less arid conditions at the CTP after 3100 cal yr BP. The transition corresponds with the end of the continuous Holocene strengthening of the SASM between 3500 cal yr BP and 3000 cal yr BP indicated by proxy records from north and east of the CTP. The CTP does not reflect this strengthening of the SASM and rather exhibits a threshold response indicating the effective establishment of the SASM summer precipitation regime at 24 degrees S. This suggests that moisture supply during a more arid middle Holocene was provided by isotopically depleted precipitation, while moisture supply after the transition originated from isotopically enriched SASM summer precipitation. Concurrent hydroclimatic changes in the SHW winter precipitation regime south of the SASDZ are documented in a distinct lake level rise of Laguna Aculeo (33 degrees 50 ' S) around 3200 cal yr BP. These coinciding hydrological changes of the SASM and the SHW precipitation regimes indicate larger scale reorganisations of atmospheric circulation components, potentially connected to major modulations of the SASDZ. Thus, our CTP record sheds light on the middle to late Holocene development of the SASM at its southern limit and corroborates connections between the tropical and extratropical hydroclimate of South America.					; Schäbitz, Frank/ABE-5116-2020	Kock, Sebastian T./0000-0001-9566-1562; Lucke, Andreas/0000-0003-4199-0808; 													1932-6203					NOV 10	2022	17	11							e0277027	10.1371/journal.pone.0277027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277027								36355747					WOS:000926098800044

Their relations with selected chemical parameters were also analyzed. The peatlands differed in pH, conductivity, total phosphorus, nitrates, and total organic carbon concentrations. The study showed that the microbial communities are most strongly dependent on concentrations of total organic carbon, nitrates, phosphates, and total phosphorus. It seems that nutrients and total organic carbon have an indirect influence on the abundance of ciliates and rotifers, through the control of food abundance (mainly bacteria). Additionally, ciliates are most abundant in spring and autumn, when rotifers are infrequent. This suggests that rotifers, as competitors, could be the main regulators of ciliate abundance in surface water of peatlands.

J	Regnery, J; Püttmann, W				Regnery, Julia; Puettmann, Wilhelm			Seasonal fluctuations of organophosphate concentrations in precipitation and storm water runoff	CHEMOSPHERE												To investigate seasonal fluctuations and trends of organophosphate (flame retardants, plasticizers) concentrations in rain and snow, precipitation samples were collected in 2007-2009 period at a densely populated urban sampling site and two sparsely populated rural sampling sites in middle Germany. In addition, storm water runoff was sampled from May 2008 to April 2009 at an urban storm water holding tank (SWHT). Samples were analyzed for tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP), tris(2-chloro-1-methylethyl) phosphate (TCPP), tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCP), tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP), tri-iso-butyl phosphate (TiBP), and tri-n-butyl phosphate (TnBP) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after solid phase extraction. Among the six analyzed organophosphates (OPs), TCPP dominated in all precipitation and SWHT water samples with maximum concentrations exceeding 1000 ng L(-1). For all analytes, no seasonal trends were observed at the urban precipitation sampling site, although atmospheric photooxidation was expected to reduce particularly concentrations of non-chlorinated OPs during transport from urban to remote areas in summer months with higher global irradiation. In the SWHT a seasonal trend with decreasing concentrations in summer/autumn is evident for the non-chlorinated OPs due to in-lake degradation but not for the chlorinated OPs. Furthermore, an accumulation of OPs deposited in SWHTs was observed with concentrations often exceeding those observed in wet precipitation. Median concentrations of TCPP (880 ng L(-1)), TDCP (13 ng L(-1)) and TBEP (77 ng L(-1)) at the SWHT were more than twice as high as median concentrations measured at the urban precipitation sampling site (403 ng L(-1), 5 ng L(-1), and 21 ng L(-1) respectively).

Nanwan, a semi-enclosed bay in southern Taiwan, provides an opportunity to demonstrate the feasibility of quantitatively reconstructing past precipitation history. Recurrence of seawater delta O-18 offsets between wet and dry seasons in the early 1990s is well correlated with the precipitation record. Even though the hydrological signal only accounts for 20% of the total annual coral delta O-18 variation of ca. 1 parts per thousand, offsets can be found in the residual delta O-18 of modem corals after removing the thermal effect, which contributes to the other 80%. The observed timing and amplitude of the seasonal seawater delta O-18 offsets in Nanwan and their correlation with precipitation are reproduced by hydrological models. In the mid-Holocene, the seasonal anomaly of residual 5 180 was twice that of the modem value based on the 9-yr Sr/Ca-delta O-18 data recorded in a 6.73-ka Porites coral. Hydrological models suggest an annual rainfall of 1800-3000 mrn/yr at the window during mid-Holocene, 20% higher than that of the average of 30-yr modem instrumental records of 1500-2500 mm, consistent with the qualitative pollen record from lake sediments. The seasonal decrease of residual delta O-18 in 5 of 9 yr was earlier than the increase of the coral Sr/Ca-inferred temperature, which implies that these rainy seasons probably occurred from the early-mid-spring to mid-summer, earlier than that from late spring to late summer today. The driving force may be related to the changes of solar insolation and the East Asian monsoon. It is cautioned that the variability of hydrographic conditions imposes restrictions on a precise calculation of the amount of paleo-precipitation. The dynamic nature of local tectonics, monsoons and water circulation should be further addressed to precisely quantify precipitation over the past 10,000 yr from coral geochemical records.

Lake Sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, movements in rainy lake, Minnesota and Ontario	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												Rainy Lake, Minnesota-Ontario, contains a native population of Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) that has gone largely unstudied. The objective of this descriptive study was to summarize generalized Lake Sturgeon movement patterns through the use of biotelemetry. Telemetry data reinforced the high utilization of the Squirrel Falls geographic location by Lake Sturgeon, with 37% of the re-locations occurring in that area. Other spring aggregations occurred in areas associated with Kettle Falls, the Pipestone River, and the Rat River, which could indicate spawning activity. Movement of Lake Sturgeon between the Seine River and the South Arm of Rainy Lake indicates the likelihood of one integrated population on the east end of the South Arm. The lack of re-locations in the Seine River during the months of September and October may have been due to Lake Sturgeon moving into deeper water areas of the Seine River and out of the range of radio telemetry gear or simply moving back into the South Arm. Due to the movements between Minnesota and Ontario, coordination of management efforts among provincial, state, and federal agencies will be important.

Lake VI ( Baghdara), which receives nutrients from natural sources only, differed considerably from the others in water chemistry and composition of dominant species. Lake II (Swaroop Sagar), eutrophied due to sewage inputs, was species poor. Non-diazotrophs, represented by 27 species, dominated during summer. With few exceptions, N-2-fixing species, both heterocystous and unicellular diazotrophs (represented by 24 species), were dominant during winter. Microcystis aeruginosa, Phormidium sp. and Anabacna flos-ague were the dominant taxa of lakes characterized by sewage eutrophication. The study shows that both species diversity and community composition were affected by water chemistry.																			1001-0742	1878-7320				JAN	2002	14	1					54	62	UNSP 1001-0742(2002)01-0054-09										11887319					WOS:000174834900010
J	Austin, J				Austin, Jay			Observations of near-inertial energy in Lake Superior	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Directly measured velocity data collected in Lake Superior between 2008 and 2011 show that currents in the open waters of the lake are dominated by near-inertial energy. The near-inertial signal is composed almost entirely of clockwise rotation, with vertical structure dominated by the first baroclinic mode, where waters above and below the thermocline are roughly 180 degrees out of phase with each other. The strength of the oscillations is strongly related to the strength of the stratification; in periods of the year when the water column is well-mixed (typically late autumn and late spring) the near-inertial signal is very weak; when stratification exists, near-inertial oscillations can occur. Combining the velocity amplitudes with an estimate of the thermocline displacement allows estimation of the dominant direction and horizontal wavelength of the near-inertial field, showing that horizontal wavelengths are on the order of 50-100 km, and the direction of the waves veers counter-clockwise over the course of the season with a period of similar to 1 month. Observations of backscatter suggest that inertial oscillations may be responsible for re-suspension of bottom sediments, which could have significant ecological consequences.

J	Santer, B; Sommerwerk, N; Grey, J				Santer, Barbara; Sommerwerk, Nike; Grey, Jonathan			Food niches of cyclopoid copepods in eutrophic PluBsee determined by stable isotope analysis	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Feeding studies have suggested interspecific differences in the food sources and trophic position of cyclopoid copepod species. We measured delta C-13 and delta N-15 of five sympatric cyclopoid copepod species and of bulk POM from a eutrophic lake over a one-year period, to determine if stable isotope derived-data from the field supported the hypotheses from feeding studies. Cyclops abyssorum and C. vicinus differed significantly in delta N-15 but not in delta C-13, inferring assimilation from similar carbon sources but differentiation in their trophic position. Cyclops abyssorum delta N-15 typically was 1-2% higher than C. vicinus, suggesting a more predatory feeding mode compared to its congener. The summer species Mesocyclops leuckarti, Thermocyclops oithonoides and Diacyclops bicuspidatus exhibited considerable differences in delta C-13. The lower delta C-13 of the hypolimnetic D. bicuspidatus compared to the two epilimnetic species indicates a food niche differentiation by vertical separation. All copepod delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures showed seasonal fluctuations, with low values in winter and high values in summer. The delta C-13 of seston was generally higher than copepod delta C-13. We regard selective feeding from the bulk POM, spatial separation of feeding and assimilation of C-13 depleted food sources responsible for this phenomenon.					; Grey, Jonathan/B-3346-2012	Grey, Jonathan/0000-0001-9069-2271; 													0003-9136					SEP	2006	167	1-4					301	316		10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0167-0301	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2006/0167-0301													WOS:000241402800019

J	Zheng, XD; Teng, YG; Song, LT				Zheng, Xiaodi; Teng, Yanguo; Song, Liuting			Iron Isotopic Composition of Suspended Particulate Matter in Hongfeng Lake	WATER												The geochemical study of iron isotopes is of great significance to comprehensively understand the surface material circulation process and its environmental effects in surface and subsurface environments. Eutrophic lakes are an important part of the surface and subsurface environment; however, knowledge of the geochemical behaviour and fractionation mechanism of iron isotopes in the biogeochemical cycling of eutrophic lakes is still scarce. In this study, a eutrophic lake with seasonal anaerobic characteristics (Hongfeng Lake) was selected as the study object to systematically analyse the iron isotope composition of suspended particles in lake water and the main tributaries in different seasons. The results show that the value of Fe-56 in Hongfeng Lake is between -0.85 parts per thousand and +0.14 parts per thousand, and the value of Fe-56 has a high linear correlation with Fe/Al, indicating that the continental source material carried by the main inflow tributaries of the lake has an important influence on the source of iron in the lake. And Hongfeng Lake is moderately eutrophic lakes. Algal bloom and the content of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) are high, combined with the high correlation between Chl-a and the value of Fe-56, which indicates that the growth of algae has an important influence on the change in the iron isotope composition of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in lake water and that the adsorption and growth absorption of Fe by algae are the main reason for the change in the value of Fe-56; therefore, Fe isotope can be used to trace the lake's biological action. For the lake and its inflow tributaries, Fe-56 values are higher in summer than in winter. The variation in the Fe-56 value of SPM with lake depth is more distinct in summer than in winter. In addition, there is a distinct thermocline in summer, which leads to hydrochemical stratification. Moreover, according to a linear correlation analysis, the content of dissolved organic matter (DOC) in Hongfeng Lake's upper and lower water bodies, respectively, has a high correlation with the value of Fe-56. Specifically, the correlation is positive in the upper water but negative in the lower water, which indicates that the difference in algae metabolism patterns between the upper and lower water bodies of Hongfeng Lake plays an important role in the iron isotope composition of SPM. The composition of the iron isotope in SPM is altered by organic adsorption and growth absorption of algae in the upper water. With an increase in depth, degradation becomes the main process. In addition, the value of Fe-56 is low and that of Fe/Al is high in the water bottom, which indicates that a ferrous-wheel cycle forms at the bottom of the water.

Through quantity filter technology (QFT) and backscattering meter BB9 (WETlbs Inc), absorption coefficients of CDOM, total suspended minerals and backscattering coefficients of total suspended minerals had been observed in Meiliang Bay of Taihu lake at summer and winter respectively. After analyzing the spectral characteristics of absorption and backscattering coefficients, the differences between two seasons had been illustrated adequately, and the reasons for the phenomena, which are related to the changes of water quality coefficient, had also been explained. So water environment states can be reflected by inherent optical properties. In addition, the relationship models between backscattering coefficients and suspended particle concentrations had been established, which can support coefficients for analytical models.					huang, Changchun/E-6580-2016; Le, Chengfeng/A-2584-2013; huang, changchun/E-6580-2016	huang, changchun/0000-0002-9833-5663; huang, changchun/0000-0002-4704-548X													0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-6764-5				2008	6622								66221E	10.1117/12.790881	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.790881													WOS:000254728700049

Incidence and phenotypic variation in alewife alter the ontogenetic trajectory of young-of-the-year largemouth bass	OIKOS												There is increasing evidence that phenotypic variation can strongly impact community structure and ecosystem functions. Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus is a planktivorous fish species that strongly impact lake ecosystems. It has previously been demonstrated that phenotypic variation related to differences in life history among landlocked and anadromous alewife populations alters the strength of interactions with other species, potentially modifying its role in the community. The migration between freshwater and marine ecosystems by anadromous alewife creates seasonal differences in alewife densities, which causes lake zooplankton communities to alternate between large-body size and higher densities in the spring, and small-body size and low densities in the summer and fall. In lakes with resident (landlocked) alewife, predation from alewife modifies the zooplankton community to having low zooplankton densities and mainly small-bodied zooplankton year-round. The strong effects of phenotypic variation in alewife on zooplankton may be important for coexisting species that rely on zooplankton as a resource. Here we use estimates of growth, and direct diet and stable isotope analyses to ask if the presence- and phenotypic variation of alewife alters the ontogenetic trajectory of young-of-the-year (YOY) largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, which depend on zooplankton in the early life stages. We found that both the presence- and phenotypic variation of alewife affects growth, trophic position, and diet of largemouth bass. YOY largemouth bass from lakes without alewife grew faster, switched to piscivory earlier, and reached higher trophic positions than in alewife lakes. In lakes with landlocked alewife largemouth bass grew slower and obtained a lower trophic position than those in lakes with anadromous alewife. These divergences can be explained by the strong effects of alewife on zooplankton community structure. Our results demonstrate how the strong effects of phenotypic variation can propagate through natural food webs to influence important life history transitions in other species.

Here we test the hypothesis that there is strong diurnal stratification of physicochemical characteristics in a hyper-eutrophic pond, which would lead to a heterogeneous distribution of gas production via biological processes along vertical profile of water column. Accordingly, we focused on quantifying the seasonal and diurnal dynamics of nutrients (NO3-, NH4+, total dissolved nitrogen TDN, PO43-, total dissolved phosphorus TDP), physicochemical environment factors (DO, pH, light intensity, Chlorophyll-a) and gas emission (N-2, N2O, O-2, CH4) in the vertical profile of an ultra-eutrophic pond located at the subtropical climate zone, China. The strong and persistent stratification of several parameters at the resolution of centimeters along vertical profile of water was observed in summer and autumn. Interestingly, the surface water and sediment-water interface produced much more gas than the middle layers of water column. The quantity and composition of gas collected from the surface water were greatly affected by O-2 production, which followed the diurnal cycle of sunlight intensity. Other biological processes, e.g. nitrification and/or denitrification, may also have contributed to the heterogeneous gas production as high N-2 and N2O fluxes were detected in the surface layer and sediment-water interface. CH4 production was mainly from the sediment-water interface, especially in summer when the bottom layer developed very low DO concentrations due to strong stratification. Our results demonstrate that besides the unexpectedly long and strong thermal and physicochemical stratification, the shallow eutrophic pond can undergo significant vertical heterogeneity of gas emission due to the strong diurnal stratification of these physicochemical parameters.

J	Boyer, C; Verhaar, PM; Roy, AG; Biron, PM; Morin, J				Boyer, Claudine; Verhaar, Patrick M.; Roy, Andre G.; Biron, Pascale M.; Morin, Jean			Impacts of environmental changes on the hydrology and sedimentary processes at the confluence of St. Lawrence tributaries: potential effects on fluvial ecosystems	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This study examines the effects of changes in St. Lawrence water levels and in hydrological regimes of two tributaries of the St. Lawrence, the Richelieu and Saint-Fran double dagger ois Rivers, on the sedimentary dynamics of their confluence in an historical context and in response to projected climate changes. Analysis of historical data indicates that alteration to St. Lawrence mean water levels and spring flood characteristics (duration, timing, and magnitude) have already impacted flow and sediment dynamics at tributary confluences. The major progradation of more than 1.5 km of the sedimentary front of the Saint-Fran double dagger ois delta into the shallow water of the fluvial Lake Saint-Pierre between 1859 and 2001 is associated with the combined effect of water level reduction in the lake, as a consequence of dredging of the navigation channel, and discharge regulation. High tributary discharges during periods of low water levels in the St. Lawrence have also contributed to accelerated delta front progression. Increases in temperature and changes in the precipitation regime projected for the current century were used into the HSAMI model to obtain hydrological simulations for the tributaries. Results indicate that the greatest hydrological changes will be observed during the winter and spring seasons, a time that is critical for many ecosystems. The mean spring discharge is projected to decrease by 17% for the Richelieu and 40% for the Saint-Fran double dagger ois by the end of the century. During this season, the frequency of discharge higher than the sediment transport threshold will decrease by 63% for the Saint-Fran double dagger ois and by 17% for Richelieu when compared to the reference period. However, during winter, the frequency of these high discharges will be four times higher for both rivers. These changes are expected to occur simultaneously with a decrease of the St. Lawrence water levels, a situation that will have significant impacts on sedimentary processes. A hydro-sedimentological modeling approach based on SEDROUT was used to investigate the morphological response of the river beds to the projected changes on the hydrology of St. Lawrence tributaries and to three base level scenarios. Results show that the combined hydrology and base level effects will lead to an increase in sediment supply compared to the current state, and to the extension of accumulation zones. While the effects will vary among the tributaries according to their particular characteristics, the projected increase in sediment supply will modify the extent of freshwater wetlands at the mouth of the St. Lawrence tributaries with feedback effects on local flow and sediment distributions.					; Biron, Pascale/W-1097-2018	Morin, Jean-Francois/0000-0002-9259-9051; Biron, Pascale/0000-0001-8270-0550													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2010	647	1					163	183		10.1007/s10750-009-9927-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9927-1													WOS:000277241700013

The IBM was used to develop a general explanation for the wide variability in growth exhibited by YOY walleye. Length of growing season and encounter rate, lambda, between YOY walleye and the prey fish set the potential for growth in a particular aquatic system. Walleye spawning observations and observed YOY prey densities in Oneida Lake versus those for western Lake Erie corroborated these modeling results. Given a specific encounter rate and length of growing season, first-year growth of walleye was further controlled by size of prey fish relative to YOY walleye size, availability of prey fish throughout the summer and early fall months, and water temperature.																			0706-652X					AUG	1991	48	8					1492	1499		10.1139/f91-177	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/f91-177													WOS:A1991GC70700017

This model estimates daily SR using standard hourly meteorological observations (surface atmospheric pressure and dewpoint temperature; cloud height and fractional sky cover by layer) as well as time of day, day of year, latitude/longitude, and the daily presence/absence of snow cover as input. Because of an extensive effort to interpolate for missing input (especially cloud) data, the daily SR dataset generated is 92% complete for all 53 stations for 1948-91, and 99% complete for the 43 stations with continuous hourly meteorological observations that commenced during 1945-50 and extended through 1991. Consistent with previous work, the model validates favorably against sets of daily SR measurements from (three) contrasting parts of the study region, and so its output is used here without adjustment. Analyses of the dataset document the basic Midwestern spatial and temporal SR variability since the mid-to late 1940s. The spatial variation of calendar monthly mean SR is dominated by a near-meridional (northeastward) decrease in fall and winter. This fundamental pattern is substantially perturbed from midspring through Summer by subregional-to-mesoscale variability around and across the Great Lakes. Time series of individual monthly station mean SR values exhibit a pronounced, regionwide 1945-91 downtrend for August November. This decline is strongest (similar to 12%) and most statistically significant (>99% level) for October in a belt extending east-southeastward from west-central Wisconsin across southern Lake Michigan and western Lake Erie to western Pennsylvania. The SR trends for December-July are largely positive but of lesser spatial coherence, temporal consistency, and statistical Significance.

These analyses were combined with autumn and spring temperature anomalies and ice-cover estimated from a diatom and chrysophyte cyst, thermistor-based regional calibration dataset and selected pollen markers published previously. Diatom-inferred pH (Di-pH) and DOC (Di-DOC) completed the multi-proxy approach, which, together with ordination techniques (PCA and RDA), helped (1) to confirm proposed climatic patterns and hypotheses, and (2) to disentangle the complex interactions between climatic and anthropogenic impacts. Shifts in chemical and physical weathering, erosion, production, lake stratification, redox potentials and air pollution were the major processes that have affected Oberer Landschitzsee in relation to climate, lake/catchment interactions, and human impact. Geochemistry supported the finding that the four waves of high-altitude land use (Early to Middle Bronze, ca. 1,800-1,300 B.C.; Late Bronze to Hallstatt, ca. 1,000-500 B.C.; Celtic to Roman, ca. 300 B.C.-400 A.D.; and Medieval, ca. 1,000-1,600 A.D.) were coupled mainly with warm periods. Increased production, onset of lake stratification, and the deterioration of hypolimnetic oxygen conditions were the major changes governing in-lake processes during climate warming. They resulted in specific element assemblages associated with organic matter accumulation (Br), oxygen depletion (As, Ga, Cu, S), and changes in redox (Fe/Mn). The Se/Di-DOC ratio was introduced to track shifts between in-lake production and allochthonous sources. Nutrient loading from pastures, coupled with climate warming, could explain that in-lake production was highest during Roman and Medieval land use. Lithogenic elements mainly originated from chemical weathering of silicate bedrock and they increased when intense land-use was coupled with climate deterioration and/or increased humidity. These perturbations were highest during a High Medieval climate fluctuation around 1,000 A.D. The association of sand with LOI and C/N and the decoupling of sand from quartz and feldspar separates erosion from physical weathering. Di-DOC, S, and C/N showed hybrid characters in relation to climate and human impact. The mineral proportions indicated gradients in relation to weathering, snow-cover and running waters, as well as vegetation. Air pollution by metallurgic industries, starting during the High Medieval and culminating during the Late Medieval, caused lead accumulation and could have contributed to As and S enrichment. Corresponding features in the distribution of selected elements and pollen tracers, as well as changes in mineral proportions, supported the hypotheses of shifts in seasonal climate and an overall trend towards more continental climate conditions since Medieval times.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				JUL	2008	40	1					453	469		10.1007/s10933-007-9174-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-007-9174-2													WOS:000257208600030

In Lake Kahokugata, inorganic arsenic was detected at concentrations ranging from 2.8 to 23 nM in all seasons, while the concentrations of dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) produced by microorganisms such as phytoplankton changed seasonally and showed a peak in winter. The changes in the concentrations of methylarsenic species did not correlate with the changes in phytoplankton abundance (chlorophyll a contents), suggesting that DMA-degradation is related to this inconsistency. DMA (1 mu M) added into the lake water was converted to inorganic arsenic at 20 degrees C only under anaerobic and dark conditions, while DMA degradation was diminished under aerobic or light conditions. Moreover, DMA added to the lake water samples collected through four seasons was degraded at the same rates under anaerobic and dark conditions at 20 degrees C. However, at 30 degrees C, 1 mu M of DMA in the summer lake water samples was rapidly degraded in 7 and 21 d. In contrast, DMA degradation was diminished in the winter lake water samples at 4 degrees C of incubation. Presumably, DMA-biodegradation activities are mainly controlled by changes in the water temperature in Lake Kahokugata, where the arsenic concentrations change seasonally. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Geoffrey; De Palma-Dow, Angela			Internal phosphorus loading alters nutrient limitation and contributes to cyanobacterial blooms in a polymictic lake	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Clear Lake, a medium-sized hypereutrophic, polymictic lake in northern California, has had recurring harmful cyanobacteria blooms (HCBs) for over a century despite reductions in external phosphorus (P) loadings. Internal P loading can alter nutrient availability and limitation supporting HCBs but is rarely quantified or compared with external loads. We have quantified external P loads from 2019 to 2021 for the three main tributaries (accounting for 46% of the flow) and internal loadings using two methods: a P mass balance and modeled release rates of soluble reactive phosphorus from oxic and anoxic sediments. In addition, we combined high-frequency in situ measurements of water temperature and dissolved oxygen, discrete grab sampling for nutrient chemistry, and remote sensing to explore the potential drivers of the observed variability and provide a comprehensive view of the spatiotemporal dynamics of HCBs. By understanding the relative contribution of external and internal nutrient loadings and the relationship between environmental parameters and HCBs, interannual bloom variability can be better predicted. Comparative estimates of external and internal phosphorus loading indicate that internal sources accounted for 70-95% of the total P input into the system during the study period. Contrary to other lakes, the intensity of the summer bloom season was correlated to the timing and duration of anoxia rather than the magnitude of spring runoff. Internally released P shifted the system from phosphorus to nitrogen limitation during the summer, potentially favoring the proliferation of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria.					; Schladow, Geoffrey/W-4370-2017; Sadro, Steven/AGC-7944-2022; Forrest, Alexander/C-3765-2014	Sadro, Steven/0000-0002-6416-3840; Schladow, Geoffrey/0000-0003-4205-1001; Forrest, Alexander/0000-0002-7853-9765; Swann, Micah/0000-0002-7546-637X													1015-1621	1420-9055				APR	2024	86	2							46	10.1007/s00027-024-01045-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-024-01045-2													WOS:001180517000001

In this study, based on the data from the Landsat TM 4-5, Landsat 7 ETM SLC-off, and Landsat 8-9 OLI/TIRS C2 L2 satellites, the surface area of Qinghai Lake is obtained by using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) method. Additionally, leveraging the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) fifth-generation land surface reanalysis dataset (ERA5-Land), we analyzed the interplay between lake area and related climate factors by using the Noise Assisted-Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition (NA-MEMD) and wavelet coherence analysis method. The surface area of Qinghai Lake showed an overall expansion trend from 1986 to 2022, with an expansion rate of 2.89 km2/a. Precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration (ET) also showed an increasing trend, with the largest increasing trend in autumn, summer, and summer, respectively. The area of Qinghai Lake did not demonstrate distinct periodic patterns from 1986 to 2022, in contrast to the marked 8-16 month oscillations observed in precipitation, temperature, and ET. In the phase of lake area expansion between 2008 and 2016, changes in the lake's surface area were observed to trail behind variations in precipitation and temperature by approximately three months. Furthermore, the shift in ET was found to lag behind alterations in the lake area, displaying a delay of 3-6 months.

J	Huo, YL; Peltier, WR; Chandan, D				Huo, Yiling; Peltier, William Richard; Chandan, Deepak			Mid-Holocene monsoons in South and Southeast Asia: dynamically downscaled simulations and the influence of the Green Sahara	CLIMATE OF THE PAST												Proxy records suggest that the Northern Hemisphere during the mid-Holocene (MH), to be assumed herein to correspond to 6000 years ago, was generally warmer than today during summer and colder in the winter due to the enhanced seasonal contrast in the amount of solar radiation reaching the top of the atmosphere. The complex orography of both South and Southeast Asia (SA and SEA), which includes the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in the north and the Western Ghats mountains along the west coast of India in the south, renders the regional climate complex and the simulation of the intensity and spatial variability of the MH summer monsoon technically challenging. In order to more accurately capture important regional features of the monsoon system in these regions, we have completed a series of regional climate simulations using a coupled modeling system to dynamically downscale MH global simulations. This regional coupled modeling system consists of the University of Toronto version of the Community Climate System Model version 4 (UofT-CCSM4), the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model, and the 3D Coastal and Regional Ocean Community model (CROCO). In the global model, we have taken care to incorporate Green Sahara (GS) boundary conditions in order to compare with standard MH simulations and to capture interactions between the GS and the monsoon circulations in India and SEA. Comparison of simulated and reconstructed climates suggest that the dynamically downscaled simulations produce significantly more realistic anomalies in the Asian monsoon than the global climate model, although they both continue to underestimate the inferred changes in precipitation based upon reconstructions using climate proxy information. Monsoon precipitation over SA and SEA is also greatly influenced by the inclusion of a GS, with a large increase particularly being predicted over northern SA and SEA, and a lengthening of the monsoon season. Data-model comparisons with downscaled simulations outperform those with the coarser global model, highlighting the crucial role of downscaling in paleo data-model comparison.					; Peltier, William/A-1102-2008; Huo, Yiling/JVO-7401-2024	Chandan, Deepak/0000-0002-0756-754X; Huo, Yiling/0000-0002-1888-8015; 													1814-9324	1814-9332				AUG 5	2021	17	4					1645	1664		10.5194/cp-17-1645-2021	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1645-2021													WOS:000683681200001

They have hydrological importance associated with summer flows and winter insulation, but little is known about the seasonal dynamics of the unfrozen sediment layer beneath them. This layer may support perennial groundwater flow in regions with otherwise continuous permafrost. For this study, ground penetrating radar (GPR) were collected in September 2016 (maximum thaw) and April 2017 (maximum frozen) at the Kuparuk aufeis field on the North Slope of Alaska. Supporting surface nuclear magnetic resonance data were collected during the maximum frozen campaign. These point-in-time geophysical data sets were augmented by continuous subsurface temperature data and periodic Structure-from-Motion digital elevation models collected seasonally. GPR and difference digital elevation model data showed up to 6 m of ice over the sediment surface. Below the ice, GPR and nuclear magnetic resonance identified regions of permafrost and regions of seasonally frozen sediment (i.e., the active layer) underlain by a substantial lateral talik that reached >13-m thickness. The seasonally frozen cobble layer above the talik was typically 3- to 5-m thick, with freezing apparently enabled by relatively high thermal diffusivity of the overlying ice and rock cobbles. The large talik suggests that year-round groundwater flow and coupled heat transport occurs beneath much of the feature. Highly permeable alluvial material and discrete zones of apparent groundwater upwelling indicated by geophysical and ground temperature data allows direct connection between the aufeis and the talik below.					; Gooseff, Michael/N-6087-2015	Briggs, Martin/0000-0003-3206-4132; Gooseff, Michael/0000-0003-4322-8315; Lane, John/0000-0002-3558-243X													2169-9003	2169-9011				MAR	2020	125	3							e2019JF005345	10.1029/2019JF005345	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JF005345													WOS:000522071000005

Depth, ice thickness, and ice-out timing cause divergent hydrologic responses among Arctic lakes	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												Lakes are prevalent in the Arctic and thus play a key role in regional hydrology. Since many Arctic lakes are shallow and ice grows thick (historically 2 m or greater), seasonal ice commonly freezes to the lake bed (bedfast ice) by winter's end. Bedfast ice fundamentally alters lake energy balance and melt-out processes compared to deeper lakes that exceed the maximum ice thickness (floating ice) and maintain perennial liquid water below floating ice. Our analysis of lakes in northern Alaska indicated that ice-out of bedfast ice lakes occurred on average 17 days earlier (22 June) than ice-out on adjacent floating ice lakes (9 July). Earlier ice-free conditions in bedfast ice lakes caused higher open-water evaporation, 28% on average, relative to floating ice lakes and this divergence increased in lakes closer to the coast and in cooler summers. Water isotopes (O-18 and H-2) indicated similar differences in evaporation between these lake types. Our analysis suggests that ice regimes created by the combination of lake depth relative to ice thickness and associated ice-out timing currently cause a strong hydrologic divergence among Arctic lakes. Thus, understanding the distribution and dynamics of lakes by ice regime is essential for predicting regional hydrology. An observed regime shift in lakes to floating ice conditions due to thinner ice growth may initially offset lake drying because of lower evaporative loss from this lake type. This potential negative feedback caused by winter processes occurs in spite of an overall projected increase in evapotranspiration as the Arctic climate warms.

J	Planas, D; Paquet, S				Planas, Dolores; Paquet, Serge			Importance of climate change-physical forcing on the increase of cyanobacterial blooms in a small, stratified lake	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY					6th National Congress of Limnology	NOV 11-14, 2014	Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ciudad Universitaria, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limno, Mexico City, MEXICO		Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ciudad Universitaria, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limno			The community structure of planktonic cyanobacteria was studied in a dimictic lake in which recurrent summer surface algal blooms have frequently occurred since the beginning of this millennium. In eutrophic-hypereutrophic lakes, epilimnetic cyanobacterial blooms are promoted by increased ambient temperatures and water column thermal stability, which favour the vertical migration of buoyancy-regulating cyanobacteria. Here we propose that intensified external energy (wind) that alters thermocline stability could explain the occurence of heavy blooms in the surface of lakes with low external nutrient loading. Specifically, we hypothesized that: i) in small stratified lakes with low external nutrient sources, cyanobacterial growth primarily occurs near the lake bottom, where phosphorus is more abundant and light is available; ii) we additionally hypothesized that turbulence induced by strong winds increases the amplitude and energy of metalimnetic internal waves and entrains meta-and hypolimnetic water, rich in nutrients and cyanobacteria, into the epilimnion. The study was done in a small lake (45 Ha, maximum and mean depth 7.2 m and 4.3 m, respectively) with mean epilimnetic dissolved phosphorus concentrations approximate to 4 mu g L-1 and chlorophyll a approximate to 8 mu g L-1. Vertical temperature profiles during the open season were continuously registered using thermistors. Weekly vertical profiles of light transmission, phytoplankton distribution and water chemistry were also taken. On one occasion, these variables were measured throughout a continuous 24 h cycle. Results demonstrated that summer cyanobacterial blooms were dominated by Plankthotrix spp., which began their cycle in late spring at the bottom of the lake, and grew to form dense metalimnetic biomass peaks. Time series analysis of isotherms and the Lake number indicated that internal metalimnetic waves (seiches) were present through the summer. During the diel sampling cycle, we found that medium to strong westerly wind gust events (similar to 5 to > 12 m s(-1)) induced large amplitude internal waves (mainly V2H1 mode) that vertically displaced the isotherms by more than 3.5 m. During this event the top of the metalimnetic algal peak was entrained through the epilimnion, bringing metalimnetic Plankthotrix spp. to the lake surface, modified the deep metalimnion and hypolimnion concentrations of dissolved oxygen, and caused an upsurge in phosphorus. We conclude that algal and nutrient upwelling linked to intermittent deep mixing events, play an important role in supporting summer cyanobacterial blooms in lake Bromont.

Phosphorus species, including soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), soluble unreactive phosphorus (SUP), and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), and some diagenetic constituents including dissolved Fe(II), Mn(II), and sulfide in overlying and pore waters, were measured systematically. The seasonal variations and vertical distributions of phosphorus species in overlying and pore waters at both sampling sites were obtained to elucidate some aspects of the transport and transformations of phosphorus. Based on the profiles of pore and overlying waters as well as the TDN/TDP data during an algal bloom in 2007, it was clearly demonstrated that phosphorus was the main factor limiting the phytoplankton growth in the Tuohe River.					chen, yuwei/U-9491-2017; xiaoping, yu/IAN-1982-2023; Belzile, Nelson/J-4607-2019; Deng, Tianlong/AAJ-1587-2020	Deng, Tianlong/0000-0002-1728-2943; Yu, Xiaoping/0000-0002-5897-492X; GUO, Yafei/0000-0003-0698-3565; 													2090-9063	2090-9071				OCT 30	2019	2019								6727239	10.1155/2019/6727239	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/6727239													WOS:000496979500002

The integrated biomass of phytoplankton in the water column varied from 0.01 g C/m(2) in March to 5.83 g C/m(2) during spring bloom in late May (when it was dominated by Chaetoceros invisibilis) and remained at the level of 0.07 to 0.29 g C/m(2) until October; heterotrophic forms replaced autotrophic algae during this period. A regression analysis has shown that the structure of the phytoplankton was influenced by length of daylight, water temperature, dissolved oxygen level, depth, pH, salinity, and illuminance.					; Krasnova, Elena/AAN-2250-2021; Voronov, Dmitry/AAS-4755-2021; Radchenko, Irina/ABF-5584-2021	Ivanova, Daria/0000-0001-6635-4897; 													0001-4370	1531-8508				APR	2022	62	2					207	220		10.1134/S0001437022020084	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0001437022020084													WOS:000795146400008

Sampling techniques for burbot in a western non-wadeable river	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Burbot, Lota lota (L.), populations are declining throughout much of their native distribution. Although numerous aspects of burbot ecology are well understood, less is known about effective sampling techniques for burbot in lotic systems. Occupancy models were used to estimate the probability of detection ((p) over bar) for three gears (6.4- and 19-mm bar mesh hoop nets, night electric fishing), within the context of various habitat characteristics. During the summer, night electric fishing had the highest estimated detection probability for both juvenile ((p) over bar, 95% C.I.; 0.35, 0.26-0.46) and adult (0.30, 0.20-0.41) burbot. However, small-mesh hoop nets (6.4-mm bar mesh) had similar detection probabilities to night electric fishing for both juvenile (0.26, 0.17-0.36) and adult (0.27, 0.18-0.39) burbot during the summer. In autumn, a similar overlap between detection probabilities was observed for juvenile and adult burbot. Small-mesh hoop nets had the highest estimated probability of detection for both juvenile and adult burbot (0.46, 0.33-0.59), whereas night electric fishing had a detection probability of 0.39 (0.28-0.52) for juvenile and adult burbot. By using detection probabilities to compare gears, the most effective sampling technique can be identified, leading to increased species detections and more effective management of burbot.																			0969-997X	1365-2400				JUN	2015	22	3					213	223		10.1111/fme.12118	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.12118													WOS:000354492100003

Nine of the cases experienced attacks 10-40 days after exposure. Twenty-six exhibited latent periods of 217-316 days. The probable source of these infections was traced to a recently returned Korean veteran. The occurrence of this outbreak demonstrated the vulnerability of this country to the introduction of malaria from abroad when favorable circumstances exist, and it provided an unusual opportunity to observe the natural history of the P. vivax strain of malaria in a nonimmune population living in a non-endemic area. The investigation confirmed, extended, and elucidated the knowledge on latency and delayed primary attacks exhibited by certain strains of temperate zone malaria. The documentation of the incubation periods substantiated the observation that many P. vivax infections contracted in autumn may remain clinically latent for 8-9 months.																			0002-9637	1476-1645					1954	3	5					779	788		10.4269/ajtmh.1954.3.779	http://dx.doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.1954.3.779								13197710					WOS:A1954UY66000001

Early piscivory already was observed in age-0 zander of approximately 20 mm total length, but occurred only in the largest (> 40 mm TL) perch specimens during early summer. The onset of piscivory was triggered by high water temperatures in late spring which enhanced the growth rates of the predators relative to their prey, and by the drastic decline in zooplankton abundances during that time. Due to the lack of other prey fish, cannibalism and mutual intraguild predation dominated in piscivorous zander and perch. Early piscivory in both species was additionally favoured by the biomanipulation experiment in Bautzen reservoir due to (1) an abundant Daphnia population in spring which increased the growth rates of the predators, and (2) the coexistence of perch and zander in high densities which is uncommon in naturally-structured waters.

Sanabria Lake, the largest mountain lake in the Iberian Peninsula and with a recent history of increased human impact in its watershed, provides an opportunity to investigate recent trends in an oligotrophic, hydrologically-open mountain lake, and their relationship with climate, hydrological variability and human pressure. We conducted the first systematic and detailed survey of stable isotope compositions of Sanabria Lake and Tera River together with limnological analyses during 2009-2011. delta O-18(lakewater) and delta D-lakewater seasonal fluctuations are strongly linked to river discharges, and follow the monthly mean isotopic composition of precipitation, which is controlled by NAO dynamics. delta C-13(POM) and delta C-13(DIC) revealed higher contribution of allochthonous organic matter in winter and spring due to higher river inflow and lower primary productivity. Increased phytoplankton biomass in late summer correlated significantly with higher pH and Chl-a, and higher nutrient input and lower river inflow. However, the small delta C-13(POM) seasonal amplitude underlines the stability of the oligotrophic conditions and the isotopic variation in POM and DIC reflect small seasonal fluctuations mostly as a consequence of strong throughflow. The stability of hydrology and productivity patterns is consistent with Holocene and last millennium reconstructions of past limnological changes in Sanabria Lake. The results of this study indicate that trophic state in this hydrologically-open mountain lake is strongly controlled by climate variability, but recent changes in human-land uses have increased sediment delivery and nutrients supply to the lake and have to be considered for management policies. Monitoring surveys including isotope techniques provide snapshots of modern isotope variability, and serve as a benchmark for assessing the environmental impacts of future developments and long-term climate changes in mountain lakes.

J	Obrador, B; Pretus, JL				Obrador, Biel; Pretus, Joan Lluis			Light regime and components of turbidity in a Mediterranean coastal lagoon	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												The underwater light regime of a Mediterranean coastal lagoon (Albufera des Gran, Balearic Islands) was studied during four years in order to characterise the spatial and temporal variations in the light attenuation coefficient (K) and to assess the relative contribution of the different water components to total light attenuation. During the studied period K averaged 1.42 m(-1) and ranged from 0.63 m(-1) to 3.80 m(-1). High temporal variability was observed in light attenuation coefficients, but the lagoon was spatially uniform. Percentage bottom irradiance in relation to specific requirements for the dominant macrophyte species (Ruppia cirrhosa) was used as an indicator of benthic light limitation. Macrophyte light limitation was expected to occur in the deepest areas of the lagoon during winter, the most turbid period of the annual cycle. During the macrophyte growing season, higher bottom irradiances were observed but a significant percentage of the lagoon benthos (17% in spring and 7% in summer) was expected to be light limited. In the deepest areas of the lagoon (> 2 m) changes in bottom irradiance were related more to variations in the light attenuation coefficient than to variations in water level. However, water level appeared to play an important role in determining benthic light limitation at intermediate depths (1.5 m) for the range of K from 1.8 m(-1) to 3.3 m(-1). The partitioning of the light attenuation coefficient showed that phytoplankton was the main driver of the temporal dynamics of K, but only accounted for 44% of total light attenuation on average. The mean contributions of the other water components to K were: DOC (47%), tripton (6%), and water (3%). At low values of K, attenuation by DOC was responsible for up to 75% of total attenuation. An equation to predict K from the concentration of water components explained 93% of the variance. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Major geomorphic features consist of a proglacial reach below the terminus of Tschierva Glacier, the outlet stream of a glacial lake at the terminus of Roseg Glacier, and the glacial flood plain. Here we describe the habitat heterogeneity of the glacial flood plain, which is 2.6 ion long and up to 510 m wide. Transects were established every 150-200 m to investigate gradients of turbidity, temperature, nutrients, organic matter, and surface water-groundwater interactions. Six distinct channel types have been identified, based on the correspondence between connectivity and physico-chemical characteristics. Seasonal and diel variations in discharge are marked and play a prominent role in structuring the habitat template. The entire flood plain shifts from dominance by glacial meltwater in summer to a groundwater-controlled system in winter.

Sensitivity of Convective Cell Dynamics and Microphysics to Model Resolution for the OWLeS IOP2b Lake-Effect Snowband	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW												The OWLeS IOP2b lake-effect case is simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model with a horizontal grid spacing of 148 m (WRF-LES mode). The dynamics and microphysics of the simulated high-resolution snowband and a coarser-resolution band from the parent nest (1.33-km horizontal grid spacing) are compared to radar and aircraft observations. The Ice Spheroids Habit Model with Aspectratio Evolution (ISHMAEL) microphysics is used, which predicts the evolution of ice particle properties including shape, maximum diameter, density, and fall speed. The microphysical changes within the band that occur when going from 1.33-km to 148-m grid spacing are explored. Improved representation of the dynamics at higher resolution leads to a better representation of the microphysics of the snowband compared to radar and aircraft observations. Stronger updrafts in the high-resolution grid produce higher ice number concentrations and produce ice particles that are more heavily rimed and thus more spherical, smaller (in terms of mean maximum diameter), and faster falling. These changes to the ice particle properties in the high-resolution grid limit the production of aggregates and improve reflectivity compared to observations. Graupel, observed in the band at the surface, is simulated in the strongest convective updrafts, but only at the higher resolution. Ultimately, the duration of heavy precipitation just onshore from the collapse of convection is better predicted in the high-resolution domain compared to surface and radar observations.					; Geerts, Bart/H-7570-2017	Campbell, Leah/0000-0001-6601-8770; Bergmaier, Philip/0000-0002-9389-9646; Geerts, Bart/0000-0002-1508-6121													0027-0644	1520-0493				AUG	2020	148	8					3305	3328		10.1175/MWR-D-19-0320.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-19-0320.1													WOS:000591350500011

High latitude lakes, wetlands, and rivers are experiencing shorter periods of ice cover, and lower latitudes systems that used to freeze are experiencing open water conditions throughout the winter. A 2019 AGU Chapman conference convened aquatic scientists to examine these changes and address the implications of changing winters to aquatic life, chemistry, and physics. Several studies demonstrate decreased ice cover duration than in the past. The removal of an ice "lid" from lakes and rivers impacts the exchange of gases with the atmosphere and the predominant types of metabolism occurring in the waters below, with the potential for more photosynthesis and an increase in oxic versus anoxic metabolism when the lid is removed. Multiple studies indicated an increase in the interannual variability of winters, especially in terms of ice-cover duration and ice quality. Increased variability may simply be an outcome of a more variable winter climate or small differences in environmental conditions such as temperature that can have strong effects on gas exchange, light transmission, and turbulence when ice forms. A question that merits further consideration is whether and how winters of shorter duration and severity will change the dynamics of freshwater systems. Are there memory or legacy effects that carry over to the next season or year? There is much work to be done to understand how changing winters will impact the biogeochemical behavior of lakes and rivers in the coming decades. Plain Language Summary Winters at mid-high latitudes are changing rapidly with important implications for freshwater ecosystems. An AGU Chapman conference, convened in 2019, brought together scientists to outline what we know about the changes that are occurring and what questions need further study. This special issue is a collection of the papers that developed from that workshop. These studies demonstrate that lakes and rivers at mid-high latitudes are experiencing less ice cover duration and greater variability in year-to-year ice cover. Changing ice and snow cover impacts processes occurring under ice in winter by altering the light regime, mixing, biota present, and the availability of oxygen. There are many important research questions regarding winter dynamics that still need to be addressed but one of the most important ones has to do with how changing winters might influence the biota in other seasons.					; Sadro, Steven/AGC-7944-2022; Cotner, James/D-8799-2013	Sadro, Steven/0000-0002-6416-3840; Cotner, James/0000-0001-9792-467X; MCKNIGHT, DIANE/0000-0002-4171-1533; Powers, Stephen/0000-0001-6267-2644													2169-8953	2169-8961				JUN	2022	127	6							e2021JG006761	10.1029/2021JG006761	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JG006761													WOS:000806239600001

Understanding how to evaluate the unique and sensitive environment of the karst spring is essential for water resource protection. Five karst springs in South China were investigated by analyzing their hydrodynamic conditions, variations in physicochemical parameters, and phytoplankton community structures. Dominated by regional or local groundwater flow, these springs had different catchment area characteristics and hydrogeological conditions. The results showed that, although they had similar water quality, their physicochemical parameters needed to be distinguished and evaluated in different ways in order to determine the cause of the observed degradation in spring water quality. Ca2+, HCO3-, and specific electrical conductivity were the major parameters reflecting the impact of regional flow from the aquifer; pH, dissolved oxygen, and water temperature indicated the local environment in and around the springs; while nitrogen and CODMn both related to the aquifer and local environment, depending on seasonal variation and human activities. The comparison of long-term nitrate data revealed that environmental pressure has increased over time. Water deterioration of Lingshui Spring was attributed to the strong interaction of surface water and groundwater. High nutrient concentrations did not correspond with the highest phytoplankton abundance or the most species. The phytoplankton community structures in the karst springs varied from place to place, depending on the hydrogeological conditions and the surrounding environment. The water environment status, as reflected by the combination of water quality indices and biological indicators, could more comprehensively represent overall water health. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The technique uses a finite length wave record to compute a matrix of coefficient multipliers, which are used to generate arbitrarily long time sequences of simulated wave data, preserving the primary statistical properties of the finite data set. The procedure was developed for simulating time series from the Wave information Study (WIS) data base, a 20-year hindcast of wave height, period, and direction provided at three-hour intervals for locations along United States coasts and the Great Lakes. Application of the methodology is demonstrated in this paper through comparisons of simulated data with hindcast data corresponding to a Gulf of Mexico WIS station near the entrance to Mobile Bay, Alabama. Analysis of the results indicate that the simulated time series does exhibit the primary statistical properties of the WIS data, including winter and summer seasonal patterns and wave sequencing.																			0733-950X					JUL-AUG	1992	118	4					337	351		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-950X(1992)118:4(337)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-950X(1992)118:4(337)													WOS:A1992JA33600001

Allochthonous Carbon-a Major Driver of Bacterioplankton Production in the Subarctic Northern Baltic Sea	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Heterotrophic bacteria are, in many aquatic systems, reliant on autochthonous organic carbon as their energy source. One exception is low-productive humic lakes, where allochthonous dissolved organic matter (ADOM) is the major driver. We hypothesized that bacterial production (BP) is similarly regulated in subarctic estuaries that receive large amounts of riverine material. BP and potential explanatory factors were measured during May-August 2011 in the subarctic RAyenne Estuary, northern Sweden. The highest BP was observed in spring, concomitant with the spring river-flush and the lowest rates occurred during summer when primary production (PP) peaked. PLS correlations showed that similar to 60 % of the BP variation was explained by different ADOM components, measured as humic substances, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). On average, BP was threefold higher than PP. The bioavailability of allochthonous dissolved organic carbon (ADOC) exhibited large spatial and temporal variation; however, the average value was low, similar to 2 %. Bioassay analysis showed that BP in the near-shore area was potentially carbon limited early in the season, while BP at seaward stations was more commonly limited by nitrogen-phosphorus. Nevertheless, the bioassay indicated that ADOC could contribute significantly to the in situ BP, similar to 60 %. We conclude that ADOM is a regulator of BP in the studied estuary. Thus, projected climate-induced increases in river discharge suggest that BP will increase in subarctic coastal areas during the coming century.					; Paczkowska, Joanna/AAK-1391-2021	Rowe, Owen Francis/0009-0007-0687-0794; Legrand, Catherine/0000-0001-7155-3604; Paczkowska, Joanna/0000-0003-3568-7968													0095-3628	1432-184X				MAY	2016	71	4					789	801		10.1007/s00248-015-0714-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-015-0714-4								26677860					WOS:000373683000001

Annuli are formed once a year on the scales and otoliths as growth commences in spring or early summer. Growth rates show large interseasonal variations which can be related to water transparency, but asymptotic length appears to be independent of previous growth history. When compared to other populations of this species the relative body condition is low and declines sharply as water transparency decreases. Year class strength did not show large interannular fluctuations, indicating that feeding areas in this relatively deep reservoir may limit abundance.																			0377-9688						1984	10	1					5	10		10.1080/03779688.1984.9632872	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03779688.1984.9632872													WOS:A1984TV47500002
J	Lemdahl, G; Buckland, PI; Mortensen, MF				Lemdahl, Geoffrey; Buckland, Philip I.; Mortensen, Morten Fischer			Lateglacial insect assemblages from the Palaeolithic site Slotseng: New evidence concerning climate and environment in SW Denmark	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The Slotseng site represents Paleolithic settlements of the Havelte phase of the Hamburgian culture (c. 15 to 14 cal ka BP). The Lateglacial sediment stratigraphy of an adjacent kettle hole was studied in a multidisciplinary project, including the analysis of pollen, macroscopic plant remains, vertebrate bones, and insect remains. In this article the results from the insect analysis are presented. Twelve samples were analysed from a monolith, which chronologically spans from ca. 15,500 to 13,600 cal BP. 108 taxa of Coleoptera and 15 taxa of Trichoptera, Hemiptera, Megaloptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera were recorded. The beetle assemblages indicate an open heath environment with shrub and herb vegetation during this period, with only minor changes during the stadials and interstadials. This is in good agreement with the interpretations based on pollen and plant macrofossil analyses. The presence of dung beetles indicates that reindeer herds grazed in the vicinity of the site. A number of finds of the carrion beetle Thanatophilus dispar suggest that fish may have been a complementary food resource for the hunters at Slotseng. MCR reconstructions indicate arctic/subarctic climate conditions during the periods GS-2a (Pre-Bolling) and GI-1d (Older Dryas) with mean summer temperatures similar to 9-13 degrees C and mean winter temperatures similar to-3 to -20 degrees C. During the interstadials GI-1e (Bolling) and GI-1c (Allerod 1) mean summer temperatures were similar to 14-16 degrees C, but mean winter temperatures remained similar to those during the colder periods. The reconstructed environments and living conditions for the Paleolithic hunters show striking similarities with contemporaneous conditions reconstructed for Magdalenian/Azilian sites at Lake Neuchatel, Switzerland.

J	KLEBER, A				KLEBER, A			ON THE PALEOENVIRONMENT OF THE NORTHERN GREAT-BASIN AND ADJACENT ROCKY-MOUNTAINS	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE												This study presents a statistical approach to some environmental conditions of three cover-bed- and intercalated pedogenic episodes. It further attempts to reconstruct the paleoclimatic causes of the deposits and soils. Cover-beds and soils prove able to close gaps in the paleoecological knowledge. The three cover-beds consist of upslope saprolith and of mostly local, in the deeper two layers clay-rich loess. They may be placed into comparable parts of their respective climatic cycles, i.e., into shifts from cold and moist to warmer and drier conditions. This is well established for the youngest layer, since firm age constraints (14-13 ka) are available. Because of their similar properties and because they are also approximately contemporary with major such shifts, it is also proposed for the older layers. The environment of the cover-bed formation was characterized by abrupt aridization accompanied by falling lake levels (providing loess sources in the basins), retreat of glaciers and of soil ice (probably leading to bare alluvial surfaces, ready for wind carving, due to river incision). The surfaces were highly unstable due to vegetation inertia during adaption to the changing climatic conditions, allowing for dislocation of the surficial material. The soil that is developed in the uppermost cover-bed varies with elevation and regionally. It reflects drier summers than at present. Winters, however, were probably moister and colder. The carbonate precipitated below this layer is mainly of local origin. Both soils in the lower two layers are argillic throughout all altitudinal ranges, suggesting significantly enhanced moisture. The carbonate of their calcic horizons is mainly airborne.

Concentrations of the determined BSOA are higher in the cities than in the background and are also higher in summer than in winter. Moreover, strong positive correlations (R-2] = 0.44-0.90) between BSOA and sulfate were found at the six sites, suggesting that anthropogenic pollution (i.e., sulfate) could enhance SOA formation, because sulfate provides a surface favorable for acid-catalyzed formation of BSOA. Size distribution measurements showed that most of the determined SOA tracers are enriched in the fine mode (< 3.3 mu m) except for cis-pinic and cis-pinonic acids, both presented a comparable mass in the fine and coarse (> 3.3 mu m) modes, respectively. Mass ratio of oxidation products derived from isoprene to those from monoterpene in the five urban regions during summer are much less than those in Qinghai Lake region. In addition, in the five urban regions relative abundances of monoterpene oxidation products to SOA are much higher than those of isoprene. Such phenomena suggest that BSOA derived from monoterpenes are more abundant than those from isoprene in Chinese urban areas.

Plastic and terrestrial organic matter degradation by the humic lake microbiome continues throughout the seasons	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS												Boreal freshwaters go through four seasons, however, studies about the decomposition of terrestrial and plastic compounds often focus only on summer. We compared microbial decomposition of 13C-polyethylene, 13C-polystyrene, and 13C-plant litter (Typha latifolia) by determining the biochemical fate of the substrate carbon and identified the microbial decomposer taxa in humic lake waters in four seasons. For the first time, the annual decomposition rate including separated seasonal variation was calculated for microplastics and plant litter in the freshwater system. Polyethylene decomposition was not detected, whereas polystyrene and plant litter were degraded in all seasons. In winter, decomposition rates of polystyrene and plant litter were fivefold and fourfold slower than in summer, respectively. Carbon from each substrate was mainly respired in all seasons. Plant litter was utilized efficiently by various microbial groups, whereas polystyrene decomposition was limited to Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria. The decomposition was not restricted only to the growth season, highlighting that the decomposition of both labile organic matter and extremely recalcitrant microplastics continues throughout the seasons. We explored the seasonal variation in the microbial degradation of microplastics and plant litter in humic lake waters. Seasonal changes affected decomposition rates, carbon cycling, and microbial communities behind the degradation. Both plant litter and recalcitrant plastic were degraded in all seasons, revealing that the decomposition continues throughout the year. image					; Taipale, Sami/HKE-2611-2023	Laine, Miikka Benjami/0000-0002-0465-9318; Taipale, Sami/0000-0001-7510-7337													1758-2229					JUN	2024	16	3							e13302	10.1111/1758-2229.13302	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.13302								38852938					WOS:001240931200001

However, there are still uncertainties regarding the contribution of imbalanced stoichiometric sedimentation to methane emissions along this continuum. A 2-year field survey and in situ experiments were conducted in China's Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), a river-valley-dammed reservoir. Sediments were trapped and collected to analyze for particulate carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) concentrations of different sizes in the summer flooded and winter dry seasons along the mainstem. Large amounts of sediments were deposited in the middle part of the TGR, particularly in the summer flood season. Hydrodynamic gradients structured imbalanced stoichiometric sedimentation patterns. Averaged particulate C:N:P proportions in the sediment layer along the upper, middle, and lower parts of the TGR in the first 30 years of reservoir operation were estimated to be 68:7:1, 97:8:1, and 151:13:1, respectively. The middle part of the TGR, being the "control point" of methane accumulation based on seasons, exhibited a shift in stoichiometry and stable isotope signatures, indicating that there was likely a shift in sources of POM. P, specifically in smaller size particles (<10 mu m), seemed to be the potential key driver that regulates particulate C:N:P in the sediment of the TGR. Its sedimentation, primarily in the middle part of the TGR, contributed to the significant decreases in particulate C/P ratios and could possibly regulate long-term CH(4)accumulation in the reservoir.

Although much is known about the extent and causes of variation in the timing of the shift to piscivory among species and among cohorts within a species, little is known about the extent and causes of variation in the timing of the switch to piscivory among individuals within a single cohort. Here, I link otolith age and growth analysis to direct diet and stable isotope analyses to examine variation in the timing of the transition to piscivory and its causes among individual members of the 1994 largemouth bass cohort in Paul Lake, Michigan. Stable isotope and direct diet analyses indicate that only a few members of the 1994 cohort were able to shift to and sustain piscivory in their first summer of life (early piscivores), while most cohort members would have to wait until their second summer of life to become piscivorous (late piscivores).. Significant differences in growth rate between early and late piscivores emerged shortly after 18 June, the first date of possible piscivory by early piscivores, after which early piscivores began to grow at rates nearly twice that of late piscivores. Otolith and stable isotope analyses combined indicate that an early hatching date was necessary, but not sufficient, to explain variation in the timing of the transition to piscivory. All early piscivores were hatched early in the summer, but many early-hatched members of the 1994 cohort did not shift to piscivory in their first summer of life. A combination of at least 10 days of variation in hatching dates and higher-than-average growth rates was required for early piscivores to switch to and sustain piscivory in their first summer of life. Individuals that were able to make the early transition to piscivory most likely benefited from both increased survival and fecundity over much of their life, the combination of which would confer a substantial fitness advantage upon individuals able to make the early transition to piscivory.

Natural organic matter (NOM) removal and structural changes in the bacterial community during artificial groundwater recharge with humic lake water	WATER RESEARCH												This study evaluated the removal of natural organic matter (NOM) and structural changes in the microbial community during infiltration of humic lake water at three artificial groundwater recharge (AGR) sites in Finland. The three sites were at waterworks in Hameenlinna, Jyvaskyla and Tuusula, sites A, B and C, respectively Site A used groundwater recharge by both basin and sprinkling infiltration, site B used only sprinkling infiltration, and site C used only basin infiltration. Reductions of total organic carbon at sites A, B and C were 91%, 84% and 74%, respectively, in the winter, and 88%, 77% and 73%, respectively, in the summer. The Finnish national recommended value of 2 mg/l for TOC was achieved at all sites and the TOC of natural groundwater at site C was much lower, at 0.6 mg/l. Large molecular fractions of NOM were removed more efficiently than the smaller ones. Total amount of DAPI-stained cells decreased during infiltration at sites A, B and C in winter by 94%, 94% and 75% and in summer by 96%, 97% and 94%, respectively Bacterial communities in raw waters and extracted groundwaters were diverse with changes occurring during infiltration, which was shown by DNA extraction followed by PCR of 16S rRNA genes and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting. While the natural groundwater microbial community was diverse, it was different from that of the extracted groundwater in the AGR area. Simultaneous organic carbon removal and the decrease of bacterial counts during infiltration indicated biodegradation. in addition, the changing DGGE profiles during the process of infiltration, demonstrated that changing environmental conditions were reflected by changes in bacterial community composition.

J	Yoon, H; Kim, HC; Kim, S				Yoon, Hyojik; Kim, Hyun-Chul; Kim, Sungpyo			Long-term seasonal and temporal changes of hydrogen peroxide from cyanobacterial blooms in fresh waters	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												In water, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is produced through abiotic and biotic reactions with organic matter, including algal cells. The production of H2O2 is influenced by harmful algal cell communities and toxicity. However, only a few studies have been conducted on H2O2 concentrations in natural water. Particularly, the seasonal and temporal patterns of H2O2 concentration suggest that H2O2 generation from aquatic microorganisms could be identified to compare of photochemical production from dissolved organic matter. Study area is a source of raw water and is a large artificial lake located near a metropolitan city. Due to various environmental conditions, harmful algal blooms frequently occur in summer. The purpose of this study was to trace the H2O2 concentration and water quality parameters of study area where algal bloom occurs and what factors directly affect the H2O2 concentration. Experiments were performed on the influencing factors via water samples from study area and lab-scale culture tank. The lake produces an average of 553 nM H2O2, which increases by more than three times (1460 nM) in summer compared the winter. The lake (18.6-23.8 nMh(-1)) produced more H2O2 than streams (7.4-9.0 nMh(-1)) during daylight hours. All water sites presented the lowest production rates in dark conditions (1.1-1.5 nMh(-1)). Daytime environment increased the generation rate more than the nighttime. The trend of H2O2 produced by algal cells was similar to that of the growth of algal cells. The exposure to external substances (heavy metals and antibiotics) increased the incidence by approximately five times; antibiotics were more influential than heavy metals.																			0301-4797	1095-8630				NOV 15	2021	298								113515	10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113515	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.113515		AUG 2021						34403920					WOS:000700579500005
J	Lv, J; Wu, HJ; Chen, MQ				Lv, Jin; Wu, Hongjuan; Chen, Mengqiu			Effects of nitrogen and phosphorus on phytoplankton composition and biomass in 15 subtropical, urban shallow lakes in Wuhan, China	LIMNOLOGICA												This study aims at investigating the composition and biomass of the phytoplankton community in 15 urban shallow eutrophic lakes as well as the effects of main environmental factors, including nutrient concentrations and the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus, temperature, COD, BOD, water depth, etc. on the phytoplankton community structure. Lake water samples were taken and analyzed on a bimonthly basis during the period from March 2004 to March 2006. The redundancy analysis (RDA) and regression analysis (RA) were performed to identify the effects of nutrients on the phytoplankton community and biomass in these typical urban lakes. The results indicate that most of these urban lakes were hypertrophic due to high concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN), with mean levels of 490 and 5380 mg m(-3), respectively. The phytoplankton community was dominated by Microcystis aeruginosa and Euglena caudate in summer and Ctyptomonas ovata and Cyclotella meneghiniana in winter. The mean biomass of the phytoplankton reached 456.87 mg L-1 in summer months and the annual level was 189.24 mg L-1. Temperature and TP content were found to be the principal limiting factors for phytoplankton growth on an annual basis. On the other hand, the results of RDA and RA demonstrate that the dominant phytoplankton species were not nutrient-limited during summer months. Low TN:TP ratios (< 10) were detected accompanied with fewer occurrences of N-fixing cyanobacteria and other filamentous algae in most lakes in summer, which implies that low N:P ratio does not always shifts the dominance of phytoplankton community to the N-fixing cyanobacteria. Moreover, TP always had higher correlation with chlorophyll a (Chl-a) than TN, even when the TN:TP ratios of most samples were lower than 10. Therefore, it is concluded that the TN:TP ratio is not always a suitable index to determine whether nitrogen or phosphorus limits the phytoplankton biomass in urban shallow eutrophic lakes.

The Canadian winter road infrastructure in a warming climate: Toward resiliency assessment and resource prioritization	SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE												Winter roads are seasonal roads that only exist during the winter - they run over frozen land and frozenlakes and rivers. Many northern communities in Canada rely on them for their yearly supplies of bulk goods, including fuel and building supplies, which are too costly to ship by air. Because of awarming climate, a progressive shortening of the operational time windows is observed, and is predicted to continue based on climate model projections. Compared to all-season roads, winter roadsare less well understood; they are also unevenly managed across Canada. This state of affairs represents a liability for Northerners and could be addressed via the systematic characterization of individual roads. This would help the assessment of community vulnerability and costs for remediation measures. It would also guide decision-making and prioritization.					; Barrette, Paul/HJA-2554-2022	Barrette, P./0000-0002-0975-8884; Kim, Amy/0000-0002-5250-2796; Hori, Yukari/0000-0002-6929-9931; 													2378-9689	2378-9697				NOV 2	2022	7	6					842	860		10.1080/23789689.2022.2094124	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23789689.2022.2094124		JUL 2022											WOS:000825481200001

However, studies on micro-environments during the process of colony formation are rare, especially regarding intra-colony light usage. This study analyzed the attenuation of light intensity in Microcystis colonies, where most objects followed Lambert- Beer law (I = I-0 10(-1256x10-3bc)). Intra-colony light limited the maximum thickness of the colony (B-Max = 4.3 x 10(5) c(-1)) and thus affected colony size. Field data showed that the colony size for M. ichthyoblabe was small and limited to approximately 300 mu m, while larger colonies were mainly formed by M. aeruginosa and M. wesenbergii respectively. These results imply that the strategies used by morphospecies to allow colonies to tolerate intra-colony light limitation might be different; M. aeruginosa benefited from a reticular growth pattern, and M. wesenbergii colonies were large (500 mu m), obtaining a large thickness by lowering cell concentration. The results obtained in this work suggest that M. aeruginosa and M. wesenbergii had more advantages regarding intra-colony light usage, colony size level and bloom formation ability in summer and autumn.

This study used a threedimensional model to analyze Baisha Seawater Lake. The baroclinic model showed bottom flow velocities 2-5 times greater than the barotropic model, making it the preferred choice for such complex density-change environments. Further, external drivers (wind and runoff) significantly affected the hydrodynamics and nutrient transport of the seawater lake. Summer winds caused water circulation with flow velocity increases of 1-2 times in each layer. Runoff led to backflow zones in the surface and middle water layers of the lake. Over a one-year period, using phosphorus (P) as a nutrient indicator, we found the water quality fluctuations. Inflow water quality and the release of bed sediments were the two main factors for higher P concentrations in spring and summer. These findings are crucial for managing Baisha Lake and other similar seawater lakes, and should be considered in lake-related planning and construction.																			2352-4855					SEP	2025	86								104161	10.1016/j.rsma.2025.104161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2025.104161		APR 2025											WOS:001469880200001

In the winter, lakes that do not freeze to their bed have a mean annual bed temperature >0 degrees C in an otherwise frozen landscape. Under climate warming scenarios, we expect Arctic lakes to accelerate thawing of underlying permafrost due to warming water temperatures in the summer and winter. Previous studies of Arctic lakes have focused on ice cover and thickness, the ice decay process, catchment hydrology, lake water balance, and eddy covariance measurements, but little work has been done in the Arctic to model lake heat balance. We applied the LAKE 2.0 model to simulate water temperatures in three Arctic lakes in northern Alaska over several years and tested the sensitivity of the model to several perturbations of input meteorological variables (precipitation, shortwave radiation, and air temperature) and several model parameters (water vertical resolution, sediment vertical resolution, depth of soil column, and temporal resolution). The LAKE 2.0 model is a one-dimensional model that explicitly solves vertical profiles of water state variables on a grid. We used a combination of meteorological data from local and remote weather stations, as well as data derived from remote sensing, to drive the model. We validated modeled water temperatures with data of observed lake water temperatures at several depths over several years for each lake. Our validation of the LAKE 2.0 model is a necessary step toward modeling changes in Arctic lake ice regimes, lake heat balance, and thermal interactions with permafrost. The sensitivity analysis shows us that lake water temperature is not highly sensitive to small changes in air temperature or precipitation, while changes in shortwave radiation and large changes in precipitation produced larger effects. Snow depth and lake ice strongly affect water temperatures during the frozen season, which dominates the annual thermal regime of Arctic lakes. These findings suggest that reductions in lake ice thickness and duration could lead to more heat storage by lakes and enhanced permafrost degradation.					; JAFAROV, ELCHIN/G-1616-2016; Jafarov, Elchin/G-1616-2016; Stepanenko, Victor/N-8467-2013	Jones, Benjamin/0000-0002-1517-4711; JAFAROV, ELCHIN/0000-0002-8310-3261; Tape, Ken/0000-0002-1039-6868; Clark, Jason/0000-0002-4810-5261													1991-959X	1991-9603				OCT 6	2022	15	19					7421	7448		10.5194/gmd-15-7421-2022	http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-7421-2022													WOS:000864150300001
J	RYDER, RA				RYDER, RA			A METHOD FOR ESTIMATING POTENTIAL FISH PRODUCTION OF NORTH-TEMPERATE LAKES	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Fish production (yield) is related to mean depth and total dissolved solids for 34 north-temperate lakes. Segregation of these lakes into two groups, depending mainly on fishing intensity, refines the relationship. The "morpho-edaphic" index, an expression combining mean depth and total dissolved solids, provided a method for estimating the potential production of a lake. The usefulness of this method depends on control of area, altitude, and climate for the lakes under consideration. Anomalous environmental conditions of large magnitude could alter the relationship markedly. Most notable of these conditions are: excessive pollution, high flushing rate, extreme turbidity, extreme water-level fluctuations, extensive winter or summer kill, alternate year spawning or extensive epizootic mortality.																			0002-8487	1548-8659					1965	94	3					214	+		10.1577/1548-8659(1965)94[214:AMFETP]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1965)94[214:AMFETP]2.0.CO;2													WOS:A19656983600003

Previous studies have indicated that the bloom-forming cyanobacteria Microcystis spp. overwinters near the sediment surface and does not actively grow below 15 degrees C. However, satellite images and field collections from Lake Taihu, China have shown that Microcystis spp. blooms persisted when water temperatures were below 10 degrees C during winter, although their magnitudes were smaller than during periods of higher temperature. Winter Microcystis cells maintained low activity and were able to grow again when exposed to elevated temperatures (>= 12.5 degrees C). Hence, cyanobacterial blooms may appear year-round in eutrophic lakes. Temperature increases coupled with nutrient enrichment promoted the growth of cyanobacteria, while low temperature decreased the loss rate of Microcystis, allowing winter blooms to persist. High concentrations of overwintering vegetative cells may provide a large inoculum for blooms during warmer seasons. Controlling winter blooms may reduce their magnitude during the warmer seasons.					; Qin, Boqiang/E-5900-2013; Wu, Tingfeng/KDN-9741-2024; Paerl, Hans/ACA-9911-2022; Brookes, Justin/G-4270-2013; yu, yingying/GRR-7851-2022; xu, hai/JEP-5422-2023; Shi, Kun/O-2638-2013	Shi, Kun/0000-0002-6124-7512; Zhou, Yongqiang/0000-0003-1402-345X; Brookes, JUSTIN/0000-0001-8408-9142; Wu, Tingfeng/0000-0002-9985-7746; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2016	61	2					711	722		10.1002/lno.10246	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10246													WOS:000372166500016

Quantitative paleotemperature reconstructions on the TP since the Last Deglaciation provide a prominent opportunity not only for assessing the position, but also for better understanding the mechanism of recent warming. In this study, we first present a well-dated, high-resolution (similar to 70 years), ice-free-season temperature (from March to October, TM-O) record over the past 19 ka from a small alpine lake on the southeastern TP based on brGDGT proxy. Our reconstructed TM-O record displays a long-term similar to 4 degrees C warming trend during the past 19 ka with a deglacial increase of similar to 3 ?degrees C and Holocene increase of similar to 1 ?degrees C. To better understand the pattern and mechanism of post glacial temperature changes on the TP, we review 16 published paleotemperature records since the Last Deglaciation. The results show a general warming pattern during the Last Deglaciation but divergent trends of seasonal temperatures during the Holocene with a gradual cooling pattern in summer temperature, an overall warming pattern in winter temperature, annual temperature, and TM-O as well as a warming-cooling-warming pattern in TMJJAS (temperature from May to September). Data-model comparison indicates that the long-term warming trend in deglacial temperatures are primarily driven by rising atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) on the TP. In contrast, Holocene temperature changes are mainly controlled by local seasonal insolation and additional radiative forcing of GHGs on the TP, thereby resulting in divergent patterns of seasonal temperature changes. Our study highlights the necessity of taking into account the seasonal bias when reconstructing temperatures, especially in high latitudes and high altitudes where the freezing occurs.

The large scale of the plume implied that this process was important in sediment, and associated constituent, cycling and transport, but it had never been sampled due to severe conditions. The onset of the 1996 event coincided with a major March storm. Within a few days the plume was approximately 10 km wide and over 300 km in length, implying that the source of the reflective materials was widely distributed. An estimate of the total mass of resuspended sediment, 12 days after the storm, was similar to the annual external load of (sand-free) particulate material to the southern basin. The high turbidity plume persisted for over a month, progressing northward along the eastern shore with a major offshore transport feature. Sediment traps within this feature recorded a major mass flux event. The plume was sampled on two occasions and was found to contain 5 to 10 times as much suspended matter as open-lake locations outside the visible plume. Total particulate phosphorus was high within the plume making this episodic process important in sediment-water exchange. The diatom community structure within the plume was significantly different from outside the plume and was characteristic of more eutrophic waters. Abundance of non-diatom phytoplankton and microbial food web organisms were highest at the plume edge. The episodic nature of this process makes it difficult to sample, but the scale makes it important in designing monitoring programs and mass-balance modeling efforts.

However, the lack of TP alpine lake observations limits the understanding of the lake-atmosphere interactions. Here, we show the relative importance of parameterizing lake surface and internal thermal processes in describing the lake energy budget and lake-atmosphere interactions. Based on the in situ observations at Lake Nam Co, a large and deep lake in the TP, we employed the coupled Weather Research and Forecasting with lake (WRF-Lake) model to clarify their relative roles. Results show that the original model produces cold biases and too early timing of lake freeze onset. The adjustments of parameterizations of lake internal (temperature of maximum water density, extinction coefficient) and lake surface (roughness length) processes significantly improve the ability of the WRF-Lake in simulating the lake thermal features and the freeze onset timing. The different parameterizations of lake internal thermal processes affect the onset timing of lake freeze mainly by altering the release of turbulent heat fluxes in summer, but the adjustments of lake surface roughness lengths change the turbulent heat fluxes during the unfrozen season from summer through early winter. Accordingly, the simulated lake freeze onset is much more sensitive to the surface roughness length schemes than to the internal thermal processes schemes. As the lake-atmosphere interactions are very sensitive to the lake freeze onset, our results are critical for understanding and simulating the impact of TP lakes on the regional climate.					zhou, xu/GYU-0536-2022; Lu, Hui/H-4349-2011; Ma, Xiaogang/HCH-5311-2022; Yang, Kun/G-8390-2011	zhou, xu/0000-0002-6469-1889; Ma, Xiaogang/0009-0003-2018-2606; Lu, Hui/0000-0003-1640-239X; Ma, Xiaogang/0000-0001-7285-875X; Yang, Kun/0000-0002-0809-2371													2169-897X	2169-8996				SEP 27	2022	127	18							e2022JDO36759	10.1029/2022JD036759	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022JD036759													WOS:000859718400001
J	Simmons, KR; Doyle, K				Simmons, KR; Doyle, K			Limestone treatment of Whetstone Brook, Massachusetts .3. Changes in the invertebrate fauna	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												We monitored the invertebrate fauna in Whetstone Brook for 3 years before and after limestone treatment to mitigate low pH conditions caused by acid precipitation. Sampling was conducted during the spring, summer, and fall by both qualitative and quantitative methods. The fauna in Whetstone Brook in the control and treatment sections was dominated by chironomids (Diptera), simuliids (Diptera), Leuctra (Plecoptera) and Hydropsyche (Trichoptera) in both pretreatment and treatment periods. The acid-sensitive mayfly genera Epeorus increased during liming in the treated section of the stream but also declined during the same period in the control section. Annelida increased during the treatment period in both sections of the stream. The chironomid and black fly populations were not affected by liming. The lack of impact to the black fly population was surprising because larvae are obligate filter-feeders and feed on suspended seston in the same size range as the limestone slurry that was used to treat Whetstone Brook. Treatment did not change species diversity and taxa richness in the treated section of Whetsone Brook, but both indices declined during the treatment period in the control section of Whetstone Brook. This decline was attributed to the poorer water quality of the untreated section of Whetstone Brook during the treatment period, which was due to higher-than-average precipitation. Percent community similarity analysis indicated that the community composition changed more in the treated section of Whetstone Brook than in the control section as a result of treatment. We conclude that the invertebrate fauna in the treated section of Whetstone Brook was not negatively affected by liming, but that population density and diversity did not increase.																			1061-2971					SEP	1996	4	3					284	292		10.1111/j.1526-100X.1996.tb00180.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.1996.tb00180.x													WOS:A1996VJ21600008

CO2 alters community composition of freshwater phytoplankton: A microcosm experiment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The effects of CO2 and related changes in water carbonate chemistry on freshwater phytoplankton were studied in in situ microcosm experiments, performed in East Lake Taihu, in August 2013 and April 2014, respectively. The micro cosm treatments represented low ( 270 ppm), present ( 380 ppm), and high ( 750 ppm) pCO(2) conditions. Elevated CO2 decreased pH and increased aqueous CO2 concentrations, and did not change alkalinity. The maximum reduction of pH was 0.26 when CO2 increased from current level to 750 ppm at the ending of experiment in the spring. The rise of pCO(2) stimulated the growth of phytoplankton, and the net primary production could increase by 35% when CO2 was elevated from current level to 750 ppm in summer. Interestingly, our results indicated that increasing pCO(2) affected phytoplankton community structure in the microcosms. Cyanobacteria tended to be superior under high pCO(2), with two species Anabaena circinalis and Anabaena eucompacta benefitting from the rising pCO(2). The response of chlorophytes and diatoms to the rise of pCO(2) depended on taxa. In contrast, increased CO2 did not change biomass or productivity of phytoplankton in spring, when biomass was relatively low. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Assessing seasonal variation of diffusive nitrous oxide emission from freshwater wetland in Keibul Lamjao National Park, Manipur Northeast India	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT-X												Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important atmospheric trace gas that contributes to the present global warning and is responsible for the destruction of stratospheric ozone. The emission of N2O from the natural freshwater wetland to the atmosphere is poorly understood. We investigated N2O flux using the static chamber method and their controlling factor in the freshwater wetland of Keibul Lamjao National Park (KLNP), Manipur. The overall mean N2O flux from the park was 0.10 & PLUSMN; 0.04 mu gm(-2) d(-1). Nitrous oxide emission showed evident seasonal changes, the highest flux occurring in the summer (with a mean value of 0.14 & PLUSMN; 0.02 mu gm(-2) d(-1)), while the lowest flux appeared in the winter (0.05 & PLUSMN; 0.01 mu gm(-2) d(-1)). There were significant seasonal variations of N2O emission. The NH4+-N and NO3-- N have a significantly positive correlation with N2O flux (p < 0.001). By comparing the slopes of the regression equations obtained between the emission of nitrous oxide and the content of NO3--N and NH4+-N in water, we found that N2O flux were predominantly by NH4+-N. The results imply that nitrification played a crucial role in N2O emissions from the wetland park. Additionally, the decay of submerged macrophytes in the lake contributes to N2O flux, particularly during the summer.

Diet, feeding rate, growth, mortality, and production of juvenile steelhead in a Lake Michigan tributary	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss support valuable sport fisheries in the Great Lakes but are largely sustained by stocking. In many Great Lakes tributaries, steelhead spawning and nursery habitats are limited by hydropower dams, and natural recruitment may be supplemented by habitats in adjacent coldwater creeks. In 1998-2001, we investigated the potential for natural production of steelhead in the Muskegon River, Michigan, a tributary to Lake Michigan, through analysis of parr diet categories, consumption, growth, survival, and production in the main-stem Muskegon River and in Bigelow Creek. We used electrofishing surveys to estimate Parr growth and survival from changes in fish weight and density over time. We estimated diet from gut content analysis and consumption from bioenergetics model analysis. Average fall density of part in Bigelow Creek was 20-fold higher than in the Muskegon River. Average summer daily mortality rate of Parr in the Muskegon River was nearly threefold higher than in Bigelow Creek. Overwinter mortality rates of Parr were low in both habitats. Few yearling and older parr were present in the Muskegon River relative to Bigelow Creek. Age-0 Parr primarily consumed benthic invertebrates. Macroinvertebrate prey densities were sufficient to support high parr growth rates in both rivers. Parr grew at similar rates but consumed 84% more per day in the Muskegon River, which had higher water temperatures than Bigelow Creek. Age-0 production was fivefold higher in Bigelow Creek than in the Muskegon River. High mortalities of parr in the Muskegon River were correlated with summer water temperatures exceeding 21 degrees C. Average summer temperatures in Bigelow Creek (17 degrees C) were optimal for Parr survival. Our results were consistent with data from other Great Lakes tributaries and suggest that small tributary creek habitats contribute disproportionately to steelhead recruitment from large impounded watersheds by providing optimal thermal refugia for Parr during summer.					; Mason, Doran/ABF-1415-2020	Mason, Doran/0000-0002-6017-4243; Rutherford, Edward/0000-0002-7282-6667													0275-5947					MAY	2007	27	2					578	592		10.1577/M06-077.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M06-077.1													WOS:000246970200019
J	FELLEY, JD; FELLEY, SM				FELLEY, JD; FELLEY, SM			HABITAT PARTITIONING OF FISHES IN AN URBAN, ESTUARINE BAYOU	ESTUARIES												The physiochemical variability inherent to estuaries makes it difficult to identify those variables of importance to habitat selection by fishes. We used factor analysis to investigate habitat partitioning of the fishes in Contraband Bayou, an oligohaline creek within the City of Lake Charles, in southwestern Louisiana [USA]. This bayou receives runoff and organic wastes from the City of Lake Charles and adjacent farmland (adding levels of complexity to an analysis of fish habitat preferences). Fishes were sampled from locations within the Contraband drainage in winter and summer of 1983 and 1984. At each location, 14 environmental variables were measured. Distribution of each common species in a season relative to these variables was characterized by calculating means of individuals for each environmental variables. A species'' mean for a variable (the state of the variable where individuals of the species are most likely to be found) was interpreted as the species'' "preference" for the variable. Factor analysis was used to identify trends in habitat partitioning among species, based on their preferences for all environmental variables. In all seasons, habitat partitioning separated typically freshwater forms from estuarine fishes, and separated forms more tolerant of organic pollution from less tolerant species. Some species entered the bayou only in summer, and in this season, additional factors were related to the preference of some of these species for areas with little cover that were normally shunned by resident species.																			0160-8347					SEP	1986	9	3					208	218		10.2307/1352132	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1352132													WOS:A1986E794900006

However, the related rates and contributions remain unclear, prompting the present study. The results show that nitrogen removal in the water column of Taihu Lake contributes 43 % annually, with anammox being the dominant process in the water column, while denitrification dominates in the sediments. Significant spatiotemporal differences in nitrogen removal mechanisms were observed between the water column and sediments. The rate of anammox in the water column is relatively higher in spring and winter, while denitrification in the sediments is highest in spring. Further random forest analysis revealed that chlorophyll a is a significant factor influencing sediment denitrification, while NO3--N and NH4+-N are key contributors to sediment anammox, water column denitrification and anammox. This study enhances our understanding of nitrogen removal mechanisms in both the water column and sediments of large shallow lakes.

J	Hasheminia, SM				Hasheminia, Seyedeh Masoomeh			Determination of Bromopropylate (Folbex-VA) Residue in Honey Produced in Iran (Damavand Region)	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY & CHEMICAL ENGINEERING-INTERNATIONAL ENGLISH EDITION												Varroa mite (Varroa destructor Anderson & Trueman) is considered one of the most important pests of honey bee colonies throughout the world. This mite feeds on honey bee hemolymph, transmits some viruses, and inflicts heavy economic losses on the beekeeping industry worldwide. Beekeepers use various miticides, including Folbex-VA fumigant strips, in bee colonies to control Varroa mite populations. This lipophilic compound dissolves in wax first. It is then released into honey. Pesticides used to control pests and diseases may remain in raw and processed products that are used by humans and livestock. These pesticide residues can cause health hazards because of their chronic or acute toxicity in humans. Consequently, this research measured Folbex-VA residues in six honey production regions in Damavand County (Ayeneh Varzan, Aru, Havir, Mosha, Tar Lake, and Damavand) in two months (the final spring and summer months). The GC-MS was used in the isolation and identification processes of Folbex-VA. A factorial experiment using a completely randomized design was performed to analyze the data, and a comparison of the means was carried out using Duncan's multiple range tests at the significance level of ]%. The results indicated that in the last month of spring, pesticide residues were higher than the Maximum Residue Level (MRL) set by the European Union (EU) in the samples taken from Ayeneh Varzan, Havir, and Masha but at the MRL in the samples taken from Aru, Tar Lake and Damavand. However, in the last month of summer, pesticide residues in the samples taken from all six regions were below the MRL adopted by the EU.																			1021-9986					JUN	2024	43	6					2319	2325																WOS:001381727500001
J	Krempaska, N; Hornák, K; Pernthaler, J				Krempaska, Natalia; Hornak, Karel; Pernthaler, Jakob			Spatiotemporal distribution and microbial assimilation of polyamines in a mesotrophic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												We examined seasonal and spatial variations of dissolved free polyamines (DFPA) in the large mesotrophic prealpine Lake Zurich (Switzerland). An ion-pairing liquid chromatography method with mass spectrometric detection was optimized for the quantification of DFPA without prior concentration or derivatization. Total DFPA concentrations varied between 0.4 nM and 11 nM in winter and spring of 2015, respectively. Polyamine concentrations were highest in the epilimnion during the phytoplankton growth phase, and reflected occurrence patterns of diatoms. Putrescine consistently dominated the DFPA pool throughout the season whereas norspermidine was detected only once in spring. Incubations with C-13-labeled putrescine revealed concentration-dependent uptake rates (3.2-5 nM h(-1)) and short turnover times (2.4-4.4 h). In contrast, incorporation rates into biomass measured with C-14-labeled putrescine were substantially lower (0.9 nM h 21), indicating that this compound was predominantly respired. Uptake kinetics moreover suggested that putrescine in situ uptake rates were limited by low ambient concentrations. Competition assays revealed that putrescine uptake could only be inhibited by excess concentrations of another polyamine (spermidine), but not by amino acids. Bacteria affiliated with Limnohabitans and the acI lineage of Actinobacteria were identified as the taxa with the highest fraction (25-32%) of putrescine-incorporating cells. This compound was also utilized by Alphaproteobacteria, Cyclobacteriaceae, diatoms, and cyanobacteria. Overall, our data point to fast turnover of putrescine by different microorganisms, implying the importance of this substrate as an attractive energy source.					; Pernthaler, Jakob/A-2257-2008	Pernthaler, Jakob/0000-0001-7558-909X; 													0024-3590	1939-5590				MAR	2018	63	2					816	832		10.1002/lno.10672	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lno.10672													WOS:000427104700022

Only the upper portions of the curves reflect the variations of atmospheric temps. In spite of marked differences in the 2 sets of conditions, there is a fundamental similarity in the form of vertical temp, curves for the bottom deposits of Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, to those presented in this paper. The usual ami. of fall in surface elevation of these bog lakes does not alter the fundamental form of the vertical temp, curve. In the deeper regions of the false bottom, temps, may differ at the same level on the same day at points at various distances apart; likewise, differences occur at similar points and levels on successive observations. Differences in the thermal conductivity of the false bottom materials probably have something to do with these temp, differences.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				JAN	1939	20	1					38	46		10.2307/1930802	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1930802													WOS:000200261000004
J	Bradbury, JP				Bradbury, JP			Limnologic history of Lago de Patzcuaro, Michoacan, Mexico for the past 48,000 years: impacts of climate and man	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Lago de Patzcuaro lies at an elevation of 2035 m (19 degrees 36' N 101 degrees 39' W) on the west part of the volcanic Meseta Central of Mexico, about 50 km east-southeast of Morelia. Pollen, diatom, acid geochemical records from a 15 m core taken in 6 m of water continuously track vegetation and limnological changes in the Patzcuaro basin for the past 38 ky (calendar years). Pine, oak, and alder pollen dominate both the Wisconsin and Holocene vegetation record, and indicate that this region did not witness strongly arid climates during that time. Before the Holocene, Juniperus-type and Artemisia pollen document cooler climates of more effective moisture at least seasonally. Isoetes characterizes the full and late glacial interval (25-13 ka) and implies, along with the diatoms Aulacoseira and Stephanodiscus, cool, deep, freshwater conditions at Lago de Patzcuaro. The freshest and deepest lacustrine phase in the lake occurred 38 to 25 ka. During this time, Lago dr Patzcuaro may have drained into the Lerma River system. Between 30 and 10 ka, diatom species that bloom in the winter and early spring imply moisture during those seasons. Evaluation of contemporaneous marine acid terrestrial records west and east of Lago de Patzcuaro suggests that this moisture probably originated from westerly storm tracks shifted south by the Laurentide ice sheet. After 10 ka, Lago de Patzcuaro became shallower and more eutrophic. Rooted aquatic plants prospered under a climate regime of negative hydrologic budgets, increased seasonality, and moisture arriving during the summer as it does today. The lake became alkaline enough by the mid-Holocene to deposit ostracode-rich marls at the core site for the first time in the past 48 ky. Indigenous agriculture in the Patzcuaro drainage and around the lake appears about 4 ka, with the appearance of Zea and Chenopodiineae pollen. Iron and potassium track increased soil erosion, and planktic diatoms (Cyclostephanos) record nutrients flushed into the lake from the drainage basin. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Remote sensing imagery can provide more complete records to evaluate whether consistent changes across a broad geographic region are occurring. We used Landsat surface reflectance data to evaluate spatial patterns of contemporary lake color (2010-2020) in 940 lakes in the U.S. Rocky Mountains, a historically understudied area for lake water quality. Intuitively, we found that most of the lakes in the region are blue (66%) and were found in steep-sided watersheds (>22.5 degrees) or alternatively were relatively deep (>4.5 m) with mean annual air temperature (MAAT) <4.5 degrees C. Most green/brown lakes were found in relatively shallow sloped watersheds with MAAT > 4.5 degrees C. We extended the analysis of contemporary lake color to evaluate changes in color from 1984 to 2020 for a subset of lakes with the most complete time series (n = 527). We found limited evidence of lakes shifting from blue to green states, but rather, 55% of the lakes had no trend in lake color. Surprisingly, where lake color was changing, 32% of lakes were trending toward bluer wavelengths, and only 13% shifted toward greener wavelengths. Lakes and reservoirs with the most substantial shifts toward blue wavelengths tended to be in urbanized, human population centers at relatively lower elevations. In contrast, lakes that shifted to greener wavelengths did not relate clearly to any lake or landscape features that we evaluated, though declining winter precipitation and warming summer and fall temperatures may play a role in some systems. Collectively, these results suggest that the interactions between local landscape factors and broader climatic changes can result in heterogeneous, context-dependent changes in lake color.					; O'Reilly, Catherine/AFZ-5813-2022; Oleksy, Isabella/AAD-2249-2021; Hall, Ed/C-6013-2014; Ross, Matthew/AAH-5785-2020	Ross, Matthew R.V./0000-0001-9105-4255; O'Reilly, Catherine/0000-0001-9685-3697; Topp, Simon/0000-0001-7741-5982; Collins, Sarah/0000-0001-5503-7386													1748-9326					OCT 1	2022	17	10							104041	10.1088/1748-9326/ac939c	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac939c													WOS:000864453200001

The skin temperature is most highly correlated to air temperature (0.93-0.98) in all seasons. The skin temperature is much less correlated to the bulk surface water temperature in the summer (0.80), when the lake is thermally stratified, and uncorrelated in the winter, when the Dead Sea is vertically mixed. Low correlations were found between the skin temperature and the solar radiation and wind speed in all seasons. The skin, with its low thermal inertia, responds immediately to the atmospheric forcing. Heat fluxes across the sea surface are also presented. The high correlation of skin temperature to air temperature with minimal time lag is a result of the nearly immediate response of the thin skin layer to the surface heat fluxes, primarily the sensible heat flux.					; Lensky, Itamar/B-5285-2014; Lensky‬‏, Nadav/AAL-7950-2021	, Nadav/0000-0002-4726-1668; Lensky, Itamar/0000-0001-7594-5277; 													1687-9309	1687-9317					2013	2013								296714	10.1155/2013/296714	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/296714													WOS:000322462700001

The bacterioplankton is the most abundant component of plankton communities and participates in the biogeochemical processes. We determined its abundance, biomass, morphological and size structure. The environmental variables measured simultaneously encompassed temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen, as well as nutrients (N, P and Si) and chlorophyll-a. Spatial and temporal variability of bacterioplankton and its relations to environmental variables were tested using statistical analyses. Bacterioplankton numbers were the highest in the river and higher in the marshes than in the canals. The displayed spring maximum increased towards 2011 during the lower water level of the Danube River and decreased again in 2012 during the new flooding after the total dry up. 111 2011 we recorded phototrophic anaerobic purple sulfur bacteria from the genera Chromatium and Thiopedia in the canals, and filamentous phototrophic green nonsulfur bacteria from the genus Chloreexus, both in the marshes and canal types of wetlands. Turbidity, chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen and the depth were positively related to the morphotypes and size dynamics of bacteria, while ammonium ions and the distance of the wetlands from the Danube River were negatively related.					; Kalcheva, Hristina/AAF-8888-2019	Kalcheva, Hristina/0000-0003-0200-9335; 													0324-0770					JUN	2014				7			83	89																WOS:000338601900013

Geochemical characterization of surface water and spring water in SE Kashmir Valley, western Himalaya: Implications to water-rock interaction	JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE												Water samples from precipitation, glacier melt, snow melt, glacial lake, streams and karst springs were collected across SE of Kashmir Valley, to understand the hydrogeochemical processes governing the evolution of the water in a natural and non-industrial area of western Himalayas. The time series data on solute chemistry suggest that the hydrochemical processes controlling the chemistry of spring waters is more complex than the surface water. This is attributed to more time available for infiltrating water to interact with the diverse host lithology. Total dissolved solids (TDS), in general, increases with decrease in altitude. However, high TDS of some streams at higher altitudes and low TDS of some springs at lower altitudes indicated contribution of high TDS waters from glacial lakes and low TDS waters from streams, respectively. The results show that some karst springs are recharged by surface water; Achabalnag by the Bringi stream and Andernag and Martandnag by the Liddar stream. Calcite dissolution, dedolomitization and silicate weathering were found to be the main processes controlling the chemistry of the spring waters and calcite dissolution as the dominant process in controlling the chemistry of the surface waters. The spring waters were undersaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite in most of the seasons except in November, which is attributed to the replenishment of the CO(2) by recharging waters during most of the seasons.					k, Shivanna/ABH-3223-2021; Jeelani, Gh/KII-0203-2024	Bhat, Nadeem/0000-0001-8684-739X													0253-4126					OCT	2011	120	5					921	932		10.1007/s12040-011-0107-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12040-011-0107-0													WOS:000297078900012

The changes through time of the mean size of fish in each cohort were described by a mathematical model that assumed a size-dependent growth rate and no size-dependent mortality for the fish. The constraint on the model to fit the empirical mean fish sizes through the growing season automatically produced time-varying standard deviations of the size distributions that compared closely to the empirical standard deviations for 5 out of the 6 years. The poor fit to the standard deviations of the sixth year was explicable in terms of unusual data on one sampling date. These results suggest that size dependence of the growth rate was an important mechanism in the spread in the length-frequency distribution and that size-dependent mortality played no significant role in determining the changes in this distribution through the growing season. Because winter mortality of first-year smallmouth bass in northern waters is important in their population dynamics and is size-dependent, the model provides a link in the understanding of smallmouth bass populations and their management.

Saginaw Bay responded quickly to the zebra mussel colonization, as fall 1991 values of chlorophyll were similar to 1992 and 1993 values. In inner Saginaw Bay, where most zebra mussels were found, chlorophyll, kPAR, and total phosphorus values decreased, and Secchi disk depth increased during the study period, regardless of the presence or absence of zebra mussels at a specific station. At outer bay control stations no significant differences were found for chlorophyll, kPAR, and Secchi disk values. in order to examine longer-term trends, water quality data from 1979-1980 (STORET) were combined with our 1990 data (pre-zebra mussel period) and compared to values from the post zebra mussel period (fall 1991, all 1992 and 1993). At stations with high densities of zebra mussels, chlorophyll and total P decreased by 66% and 48%, respectively, and Secchi disk values increased 88%. At outer bay control stations no significant differences were found for chlorophyll or Secchi disk. When parameters were averaged throughout inner Saginaw Bay, zebra mussels caused a 59% and 43% decrease in chlorophyll and in total phosphorus and a 60% increase in Secchi disk transparency. Although zebra mussels significantly altered water quality parameters in the pelagic region of Saginaw Bay, they did not necessarily change system trophic state; rather they altered the spatial partitioning of resources.

LAKE HUNDSJON AND OTHER KETTLE LAKES OF CENTRAL SWEDEN	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Five small kettle lakes, situated in an esker system in the northern part of Sodermanland province, central Sweden, were studied occasionally during 1964-1975. Physical-chemical data and a list of planktonic algae and bacteriophytes are given. Interest focused on lakes Hundsjon and Kattlammen. These lakes have an extremely low conductivity, sparse macrophyte vegetation but large moss carpets covering the bottom. Lake Hundsjon belongs to the type of waters in which green sulfur bacteria (e.g., Chlorochromatium aggregatum) and heterotrophic algae develop in large quantities in winter and, especially, in late summer. In the small bog Lake Kattlammen it was possible to follow some chemical and biological changes due to lime treatment.																			0003-9136						1980	89	1-2					135	159																WOS:A1980KA38500010

In an attempt to relate these die-offs with seasonal availablity of the infective metacercariae to the ducks, two intermediate host (Bithynia tentaculata L.) populations were regularly sampled in 1984 and 1985. Prevalence varied between 5.3 and 57.3% at the South River, and between 9.1 and 49.7% at Lake St Francis over the period of the study. Maximum abundances at the two localities were 1.38 and 1.66 metacercariae per snail, respectively. No close link between availability of metacercariae and periods of duck mortality was found, as the total prevalence and abundance of the cysts decreased through the summer, probably as a consequence of snail recruitment and loe cercarial transmission rates, and increased in the autumn. Prevalence and abundance of metacercariae increased with snail age, estimated by both size and annual growth lines, and the metacercariae were found to be aggregated in the snail population. Comparison of infection levels reached at the end of the two sampling seasons by two year classes of B. tentaculata suggested that transmission of cercariae was higher in 1984 than in 1985. This was supported by the results of exposure of sentinel snails in an infected area during the 2 years of the study: transmission was detected in 1984 but not in 1985. In addition to C. bushiensis metacercariae, the sentinel snails acquired Sphaeridiotrema globulus (Rudolphi, 1814), another potential duck pathogen, in both years. The peak rate of transmission of S. globulus metacercariae occurred in August.

J	Devetter, M				Devetter, M			Influence of environmental factors on the rotifer assemblage in an artificial lake	HYDROBIOLOGIA					VIIIth International Rotifer Symposium	JUN 22, 1997	ST JOHNS UNIV, COLLEGEVILLE, MN		ST JOHNS UNIV			Seasonal changes of the plankton rotifer community in an eutrophic Czech reservoir were evaluated in relation to 46 environmental variables. To do this, data of rotifer abundance from three growing seasons (1993 - 1995) were analyzed. The seasonal dynamics of rotifers in all three years were characterized by two distinctive aspects: (1) the spring peak, with both maximum density and maximum species diversity, was dominated by Keratella cochlearis, K. hiemalis, K. quadrata and Polyarthra dolichoptera; (2) the summer-autumnal peak (or several lower peaks) of about half the intensity of the spring one, was composed mainly of Keratella cochlearis, Trichocerca similis and Polyarthra vulgaris. The separation between these two peaks coincided with the decline of phytoplankton and development of a clear-water phase in this reservoir. In redundancy analysis, species-abundance data for rotifers were related to all measured environmental variables. Date, abundance of Cyclops vicinus, total nitrogen, primary production, surface temperature, and density of heterotrophic nanoflagellates were identified as the most important variables. Partial redundancy analysis was used to assess the significance of pure and date-structured environmental factors influencing rotifers during the season. Date-structured environmental factors (such as physical and chemical variables, food, competition, and predation) significantly affected the rotifer community. This study shows that the rotifers in the reservoir are controlled by both abiotic and biotic factors.

Due partly to domestication, introduced non-native fish may be maladapted under natural conditions. Interbreeding between introduced and wild individuals may therefore impair local adaptation and potentially population viability. Brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) from three headwaters (with stocked fish) and three interconnected lakes (with native fish) on the Hardangervidda mountain plateau, southern Norway, were tested for differences in thermal effects on scale and otolith growth. Otolith and scale annuli widths from immature brown trout showed positive correlation with mean annual summer temperature for all six sampled populations. In mature individuals, a similar positive thermal correlation was evident for the otoliths only. Interannuli width measurements from scales indicate a halt in somatic growth for brown trout in this alpine environment when reaching ages between 7 and 9 winters, coinciding with age at maturity. Our study indicates that otolith growth follows summer temperature even when individuals do not respond with somatic growth in these populations and that introduced brown trout and introgressed populations have similar thermal growth responses. Due to the continued otolith growth after stagnation in somatic growth and the impact of fluctuations in summer temperature, the utilisation of otolith annuli widths for back calculation of length at age should be treated with caution.

The investigated catchment is situated near Poznan in the southern part of the Wielkopolska Lake District, Poland. Results of research carried out in the Hutka catchment, afforested in 89%, show that it has high retention capabilities. The water quality of the investigated river in hydrological years 1997/98 - 1999/2000 was evaluated as good. In summer and autumn very low concentration of dissolved oxygen and very high concentration of phosphates were noted in the water of the Hutka river. This situation decreased water quality in Hutka stream. According to Polish standard of water cleanness, the quality of the groundwater in the afforested catchment of Hutka were in the second and third class of purity.

They are not only the main factors affecting mass balance and sea-level rise but also the key units of surface runoff storage and mass loss. To automatically map the spatiotemporal distribution of supraglacial lakes in Greenland, this paper proposes an attention-based U-Net model with Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. The extraction results show that compared with the traditional network, this method obtains a higher validation coefficient, with an F1 score of 0.971, and it is spatiotemporally transferable, able to realize the extraction of supraglacial lakes in complex areas without ignoring small lakes. In addition, we conducted a case study in the Jakobshavn region and found that the supraglacial lake area peaked in advance between spring and summer due to extreme melting events from 2017 to 2021. Meanwhile, the supraglacial lakes near the 79 degrees N Glacier tended to expand inland during the melting season.

J	Salmaso, N				Salmaso, N			Life strategies, dominance patterns and mechanisms promoting species coexistence in phytoplankton communities along complex environmental gradients	HYDROBIOLOGIA												This paper analyses the life strategies, the dominance patterns and the diversity in phytoplankton communities in large and deep lakes. The study was carried out on the largest Italian Lake (Lake Garda) from 1995 to 2000. Different statistical analyses were applied. For phytoplankton the time variable represents a complex environmental gradient driving annual succession; this gradient was made explicit by the application of PCA analyses to the environmental data. The use of Non Metric Multi Dimensional Scaling applied to Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices revealed an ordered and cyclic development of phytoplankton every year; the Bray-Curtis index, calculated between pairs of chronologically contiguous samples, was also used as a measure of the community change rate (beta(t)) over the temporal succession. A significant relationship between beta(t) and the complex environmental gradient was assessed. Finally, for every phytoplankton species, the optimum conditions for growth and the realised niches were determined. The positioning of the species on the complex environmental gradient, and the contemporaneous application of cluster analysis based on the different specific environmental optima, highlighted primarily the existence of two groups at the extreme of the complex environmental gradient. The first group included the large late winter/spring diatoms, which developed during high water turbulence and strong physical control, high nutrient concentrations, low light conditions and reduced competition. The second group was composed by many heterogeneous summer species characterised by the ability to contrast losses by grazing and sinking in stratified and stable conditions, and the ability of tolerating nutrient deficiency. A third group of species developed during environmental conditions in the middle of the two previous extremes. These included the three master species Mougeotia sp., Fragilaria crotonensis and Planktothrix rubescens/agardhii. The endogenous and exogenous mechanisms promoting species coexistence are discussed, along with the applicability of competitive and equilibrium/non-equilibrium theories to phytoplankton dynamics.

J	Henderson, AK; Shuman, BN				Henderson, Anna K.; Shuman, Bryan Nolan			Hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions of lake water in the western United States	GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN												Lake-water isotopes can be used to track moisture regimes and water sources at present and in the geologic record. However, the effects of seasonal drought and the seasonal distribution of precipitation on lake-water isotopes are not well documented. To improve our understanding of lake-water isotopes, we analyzed the delta D and delta O-18 values of water from a hundred lakes in the western United States across a broad range of seasonal precipitation regimes. Our results show that the isotopic composition of lake-water inputs is correlated with the isotopic composition of annual precipitation. In areas associated with the summer monsoon in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado, lake-water inputs are skewed toward summer precipitation. These results contrast with published western U.S. river-water isotopic data, which are biased toward winter precipitation, and the paradigm that lakes represent the annual moisture surplus. From the lake-water input compositions, on plots of oxygen versus hydrogen isotopes, evaporative enrichment of individual lakes follows regionally coherent evaporation trends (0.96 < r(2) < 0.99). We found that the extent of evaporative enrichment in lakes is controlled by local hydrology and is not directly tied to climate or elevation. Our results suggest that paleoclimate reconstructions based on single isotope records could therefore be confounded by multiple factors (i.e., changes in air mass, seasonality of precipitation, temperature, or evaporation). A spatial network of lake-isotope records, however, could be used to separately assess the influences of these multiple factors.

J	Halliday, E; Ralston, DK; Gast, RJ				Halliday, Elizabeth; Ralston, David K.; Gast, Rebecca J.			Contribution of Sand-Associated Enterococci to Dry Weather Water Quality	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Culturable enterococci and a suite of environmental variables were collected during a predominantly dry summer at a beach impacted by nonpoint source pollution. These data were used to evaluate sands as a source of enterococci to nearshore waters, and to assess the relationship between environmental factors and dry-weather enterococci abundance. Best-fit multiple linear regressions used environmental variables to explain more than half of the observed variation in enterococci in water and dry sands. Notably, during dry weather the abundance of enterococci in dry sands at the mean high-tide line was significantly positively related to sand moisture content (ranging from <1-4%), and the daily mean ENT in water could be predicted by a linear regression with turbidity alone. Temperature was also positively correlated with ENT abundance in this study, which may indicate an important role of seasonal warming in temperate regions. Inundation by spring tides was the primary rewetting mechanism that sustained culturable enterococci populations in high-tide sands. Tidal forcing modulated the abundance of enterococci in the water, as both turbidity and enterococci were elevated during ebb and flood tides. The probability of samples violating the single-sample maximum was significantly greater when collected during periods with increased tidal range: spring ebb and flood tides. Tidal forcing also affected groundwater mixing zones, mobilizing enterococci from sand to water. These data show that routine monitoring programs using discrete enterococci measurements may be biased by tides and other environmental factors, providing a flawed basis for beach closure decisions.

J	BaMasoud, A; Byrne, ML				BaMasoud, Abdullah; Byrne, Mary-Louise			The impact of low ice cover on shoreline recession: A case study from Western Point Pelee, Canada	GEOMORPHOLOGY												The western shore of Point Pelee National Park (PPNP) in Ontario, Canada, exhibited high recession rates in the winter of 2005/2006. During the period 1959-2004, the western side of the park generally exhibited accretion, attributed to longer duration of ice coverage during winter and favorable topography and sedimentary conditions in comparison to the eastern side. Compared to the winter of 2003/2004, changes in Lake Erie water levels, winter wind regime and human-made structures and interferences were negligible during 2004-2006 within the Colchester-to-Southeast Shoal littoral cell in western Lake Erie, where PPNP is located. However, the winter of 2005/2006 exhibited overall low ice cover conditions unlike the typical freeze-up conditions in western Lake Erie. The 2006 high recession rates on the western shore of Point Pelee are attributed to the low ice cover conditions in the winter of 2005/2006. While less-than-average ice cover does not in its own cause erosion, in certain areas it increases the opportunity for sediment removal by waves by removing a significant source of protection during winter. The episode illustrates the potential impacts of ice-free and low ice cover winters on the western shore of Point Pelee and shores under similar conditions. Future climate change patterns are expected to result in shorter ice-durations and more frequent ice-free winters in the western basin of Lake Erie, exposing western PPNP to wave action during the winter season and resulting in increased erosion. The increased opportunity for shore erosion will negatively impact ecologically and economically viable spaces in PPNP. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) serves as a key producer of aquatic products in South China. Monitoring environmental changes in fish ponds serves as an indicator of their health. This study employed the extreme gradient boosting tree (BST) model of machine learning, utilizing Landsat imagery data, to assess Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in GBA fish ponds from 2013 to 2022. The study also examined the corresponding spatiotemporal variations in Chl-a concentration. Key findings include: (1) clear seasonal fluctuations in Chl-a concentration, peaking in summer (56.7 mu g<middle dot>L-1) and reaching lows in winter (43.5 mu g<middle dot>L-1); (2) a slight overall increase in Chl-a concentration over the study period, notably in regions with rapid economic development, posing a heightened risk of eutrophication; (3) influence from both human activities and natural factors such as water cycle and climate, with water temperature notably impacting summer Chl-a levels; (4) elevated Chl-a levels in fish ponds compared to surrounding natural water bodies, primarily attributed to human activities, indicating an urgent need to revise breeding practices and address eutrophication. These findings offer a quantitative assessment of fish pond water quality and contribute to sustainable aquaculture management in the GBA.

J	Farhadzadeh, A; Hashemi, MR; Neill, S				Farhadzadeh, Ali; Hashemi, M. Reza; Neill, Simon			Characterizing the Great Lakes hydrokinetic renewable energy resource: Lake Erie wave, surge and seiche characteristics	ENERGY												Lake Erie is the fourth largest, in surface area, of the Great Lakes. Seiching events in the lake have in the past led to breaches of the flood wall in Buffalo (at the eastern end of the lake), causing loss of life, and significant loss to properties. Here, we analyze the potential of Lake Erie for generating electricity from its storm surge, seiching, and wave energy resources. We find that there is significant potential energy in the lake that may be suitable for generating meaningful levels of electricity from seiches and storm surge; for instance, by developing an artificial 'lagoon'. It is shown that an extreme surge event similar to that of January 30, 2008 which generated a surge of approximately +3 mat the eastern end and a corresponding set-down of nearly -2.7 m at the western end of Lake Erie, could contain a total theoretical potential energy of approximately 5 x 10(7) kWh. If such energy could, practically, be harnessed using a surge lagoon with a surface area of 2 km(2) near Buffalo, the potential energy would be 2.3 x 10(4) kWh, enough energy to power the equivalent of 40 homes for an entire month. The cost of such a lagoon could be partially offset by the potential of such a structure, and the operation of such a lagoon, to help alleviate flooding during extreme events. Furthermore, as an example, the analysis of the lake-wide wave data for 2011 shows that the monthly mean wave power is greater in the central and eastern basins of Lake Erie. Wave power was highest in October and November when the monthly mean wave power reached 10 kW/m. In contrast to most oceanographic environments, the wave power resource is reduced in winter, mostly due to the presence of surface ice in the lake. The surface ice appears to significantly reduce wave height and power during winter months, resulting in a relatively low annual mean wave power. However, the monthly mean wave power was the lowest in late spring and during summer when the monthly mean wave power was around 2.5 kW/m. Although this study represents the first attempt to assess the marine renewable energy of Lake Erie, further research is necessary to examine the feasibility of energy extraction in the lake.

A combination of lithologic description and one cm contiguous sedimentological analyses indicates significant changes in the dominant type of depositional environment over the length of the record at millennial-to-orbital time scales. As a first-order interpretation, the dominant sedimentary environments alternate between permanent and ephemeral lake systems. Orbital-scale forcing includes long-term winter-summer insolation variability and its modulation of winter storm tracks and the North American monsoon, respectively. Millennial-scale variability is attributed to extra-tropical, ocean-atmosphere dynamics akin to historical interdecadal Pacific climate variability. In addition, there is notable correspondence to the independently dated Greenland Ice Core record (GISP 2) at millennial-to-orbital time scales suggesting that Baldwin Lake contains, in addition to its local/regional record, a hemispheric record of climate change - similar to Owens, Pyramid, and Summer Lake of central and northwestern North America. An initial comparison to GISP2 delta O-18((ice)) indicates that North Atlantic interstadials correlate to permanent lake environments in coastal southwestern North America. These results present a notable conflict with the proposed "super-ENSO" phenomenon in the western tropical Pacific. These results also highlight the necessity for acquiring additional high-resolution glacial period records for resolving questions of spatial-temporal phasing of late-Quaternary climates.

J	NELSON, ND; ISEBRANDS, JG				NELSON, ND; ISEBRANDS, JG			LATE-SEASON PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND PHOTOSYNTHATE DISTRIBUTION IN AN INTENSIVELY-CULTURED POPULUS-NIGRA X LAURIFOLIA CLONE	PHOTOSYNTHETICA												NE-1, a P. nigra .times. P. laurifolia clone, retained green leaves in the autumn when grown under short-rotation intensive culture in the Lake States region of the USA. Upper mature leaves on the terminal shoot of 1-yr-old trees had substantial leaf conductances to CO2 and photosynthetic rates during the autumn. Stomatal control of photosynthetic rate was strong during this period. Moderate to high levels of photosynthate were exported from the leaves through several frosts, as determined by 14CO2 labeling. Prolonged green leaf retention in the autumn by exotic hybrid poplars contributes important amounts of photosynthate to the tree. The combined patterns of 14C fixation and export for the labeled source leaves indicated a steady increase in photosynthate retained within the leaves after budset, resulting in a linear increase in specific leaf mass prior to major leaf yellowing. Before budset the upper mature leaves exported 14C bidirectionally, upward to the expanding leaves and elongating internodes and downward to the subtended internodes of the source leaves and the lower stem and other organs below the labeled zone. After budset there was a marked basipetal shift in the export of photosynthate, with little acropetal export occurring afterward. The lower stem, hardwood cutting (propagule), and roots were the beneficaries of the increased basipetal export after budset. Accumulation of 14C peaked shortly after budset in the lower stem, later in the hardwood cutting and in late autumn in the roots. The autumn retention of green leaves is important for radial stem growth and root growth and for reserve storage in the stem and roots of hybrid poplars.																			0300-3604	1573-9058					1983	17	4					537	549																WOS:A1983TN50700008

More juveniles were sampled in OLs than in their parent rivers, especially much more in the Warta River system, where there are wider and deeper connections between the river and OLs. At the end of autumn the majority of species migrate from the channels to OLs, some occupying stagnant and running water in similar proportions, but a riverine species (dace) does the reverse, entering the channel before winter. In 11 cases out of 13, near the end of the growing season (October in Poland) 0+ fish representing different species attained significantly longer body lengths by the same date in the channel than in OLs. This may indicate that recruitment in OLs contributes essentially to the productivity of the channel fisheries, hence separating OLs from their channels by levees requires consideration, because such engineering may diminish fishery yields in a river system.					; Zięba, Grzegorz/ACE-0605-2022	Kruk, Andrzej/0000-0003-1452-7906; Zieba, Grzegorz/0000-0003-4443-6802; 													0003-9136					SEP	2003	158	2					267	281		10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0158-0267	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0158-0267													WOS:000186564300008

Modeling the impact of the 2019 Bonnet Carre Spillway opening and local river flooding on the Mississippi Sound	OCEANS 2021: SAN DIEGO - PORTO					OCEANS Conference	SEP 20-23, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK					The Bonnet Carre Spillway (BCS) is the final flood defense structure on the Mississippi River protecting the levee system of New Orleans from high pressure and overtopping due to elevated river stage. This protection is accomplished by diverting Mississippi River flow into Lake Pontchartrain (LP), which then progresses into the Western Mississippi Sound (MSS). Given typical seasonal wind patterns, spring and summer openings of the BCS are more likely to bring diverted waters into the MSS [1]. A recent increase in the frequency of BCS openings coincides with increasing trends in annual precipitation near the south coastal area of the Lower Mississippi River Alluvial valley and moist subsurface conditions that make the system prone to flooding events [2][3]. This increase includes the first time the BCS opened 3 years consecutively (2018, 2019, & 2020) and the first time the BCS opened twice in one year (2019). The unprecedented 2019 double opening which released flood waters throughout the spring (February 27 - April 11) and summer (May 10 - July 27) resulted in a toxic algal bloom closing of 25 Gulf Coast beaches, a dolphin mortality event, and 100% mortality of MSS shellfisheries at many locations [4][5]. In this study, we use a Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Wave Sediment Transport (COAWST) [6] modeling system application to the Mississippi Sound and Bight (msb-COAWST) with improved river forcing to study the impact of freshwater diversion and local river runoff on the estuarine systems of MSS and LP. River forcing for the model is provided from USGS gauges that measure river discharge flowing into the study area. Hourly atmospheric forcing is provided by NOAA's High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model [7]. BCS computed discharge available from the US Army Corps of Engineers is provided as forcing for the 2019 openings. Implementation of the BCS in the msb-COAWST domain allows us to run a series of scenarios to isolate processes within model simulations and identify the importance of spatial and temporal impacts of spillway and riverine forcing. We conduct a twin experiment on the 2019 double spillway opening, the largest combined Mississippi river water volume diverted through the BCS (hereinafter referred to as BCS freshwater) since its construction. In order to assess the extent of the BCS freshwater influence two scenarios were run with improved river forcing, one with realistically hindcast 2019 BCS openings and a hypothetical scenario with no BCS openings in 2019. During both the first and second opening, spillway waters flow through Chef Menteur Pass and the Rigolets into and around the Southern portion of Lake Borgne, then south of Grand Island, into Biloxi Marsh and into the Western MSS (Fig. 1). Bottom salinity is one of the most important factors considered in oyster habitat suitability and so we use it here as a measure of BCS freshwater influence. The increase in consecutive daily average bottom salinity less than 2 due to the BCS opening is as high as 173 days in the Southeastern part of Lake Borgne, and remains greater than 30 days throughout Western Mississippi Sound, Bay St. Louis and Biloxi Marsh. The difference between the two scenarios' cumulative count of model bottom cells where daily average salinity is below 2 illustrates how the inclusion of BCS freshwater diversion impacts the duration of low salinity for the back to back spillway openings of 2019. The model results demonstrate that local river discharge has a strong influence on salinity in the Rigolets as well as in Northwest portions of Lake Borgne and MSS during the spring opening. Local river discharge has a lesser influence during the summer opening and BCS waters extend as far North as Bay St. Louis and as far East as Mobile Bay.

Data assimilation experiments inform monitoring needs for near-term ecological forecasts in a eutrophic reservoir	ECOSPHERE												Ecosystems around the globe are experiencing changes in both the magnitude and fluctuations of environmental conditions due to land use and climate change. In response, ecologists are increasingly using near-term, iterative ecological forecasts to predict how ecosystems will change in the future. To date, many near-term, iterative forecasting systems have been developed using high temporal frequency (minute to hourly resolution) data streams for assimilation. However, this approach may be cost-prohibitive or impossible for forecasting ecological variables that lack high-frequency sensors or have high data latency (i.e., a delay before data are available for modeling after collection). To explore the effects of data assimilation frequency on forecast skill, we developed water temperature forecasts for a eutrophic drinking water reservoir and conducted data assimilation experiments by selectively withholding observations to examine the effect of data availability on forecast accuracy. We used in situ sensors, manually collected data, and a calibrated water quality ecosystem model driven by forecasted weather data to generate future water temperature forecasts using Forecasting Lake and Reservoir Ecosystems (FLARE), an open source water quality forecasting system. We tested the effect of daily, weekly, fortnightly, and monthly data assimilation on the skill of 1- to 35-day-ahead water temperature forecasts. We found that forecast skill varied depending on the season, forecast horizon, depth, and data assimilation frequency, but overall forecast performance was high, with a mean 1-day-ahead forecast root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.81 degrees C, mean 7-day RMSE of 1.15 degrees C, and mean 35-day RMSE of 1.94 degrees C. Aggregated across the year, daily data assimilation yielded the most skillful forecasts at 1- to 7-day-ahead horizons, but weekly data assimilation resulted in the most skillful forecasts at 8- to 35-day-ahead horizons. Within a year, forecasts with weekly data assimilation consistently outperformed forecasts with daily data assimilation after the 8-day forecast horizon during mixed spring/autumn periods and 5- to 14-day-ahead horizons during the summer-stratified period, depending on depth. Our results suggest that lower frequency data (i.e., weekly) may be adequate for developing accurate forecasts in some applications, further enabling the development of forecasts broadly across ecosystems and ecological variables without high-frequency sensor data.					; Carey, Cayelan/D-4874-2016; Thomas, R./B-1611-2013	Wander, Heather/0000-0002-3762-6045; Thomas, R.

The direct measurement of the CH4-flux at the sediment-water-interface and of the CH4-concentrations in sediment cores as well as the determination of the age of methane bubbles indicate that the hypolimnic O2 depeletion is partly due to the oxidation of fossil methane penetrating the lake from below.																			0036-7842						1981	43	2					219	252		10.1007/BF02502135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02502135													WOS:A1981NZ36600001

During these months there is a thermal gradient between warmer nearshore waters and colder offshore waters which enhances cyclonic coastal currents. Using spaceborne SAR imagery from the European Space Agency's ERS-1 and ERS-2 missions from 1992 to 1998, we observe small eddies, identifying and mapping basic eddy characteristics including diameter, location, and rotational sense. In total, 45 eddies were located, of which 41 were cyclonic and 4 anticyclonic. Average diameter was 9.8 km and average distance to shore was 8.1 km. Based on sea surface temperature data from AVHRR, the eddies are located within the region of sharp thermal gradients of order 3-5 degrees C per 3 km. Spatial and temporal coverage was uneven, however, more eddies were seen in SAR images taken in late summer along the southern and eastern shores as well as areas where the boundary current interacts with topographic features including islands and promontories.

Behavior and Reproductive Ecology of the Sicklefin Redhorse: An Imperiled Southern Appalachian Mountain Fish	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Many nongame fishes are poorly understood but are essential to maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems globally. The undescribed Sicklefin Redhorse Moxostoma sp. is a rare, imperiled, nongame fish endemic to two southern Appalachian Mountain river basins. Little is known of its behavior and ecology, but this information is urgently needed for conservation planning. We assessed the spatial and temporal bounds of spawning migration, quantified seasonal weekly movement patterns, and characterized seasonal and spawning behavior using radiotelemetry and weir sampling in the Hiwassee River basin, North Carolina-Georgia, during 2006 and 2007. Hiwassee River tributaries were occupied predominantly during the fish's spawning season, lower reaches of the tributaries and the Hiwassee River were primarily occupied during the postspawning season (i.e., summer and fall), and lower lotic reaches of Hiwassee River (upstream from Hiwassee Lake) were occupied during winter. Adults occupied Hiwassee Lake only as a movement corridor during spawning migrations. Both sexes conducted upstream spawning migrations simultaneously, but males occupied spawning tributaries longer than females. Sicklefin Redhorse exhibited interannual spawning-area and tributary fidelity. Cold water temperatures associated with hypolimnetic releases from reservoirs and meteorological conditions influenced spawning migration distance and timing. During 2007, decreased discharges during the spawning season were associated with decreases in migration distance and spawning tributary occupancy duration. Foraging was the dominant behavior observed annually, followed by reproductive behaviors (courting and spawning) during the spawning season. No agonistic reproductive behavior was observed, but females exhibited a repetitious postspawning digging behavior that may be unique in the family Catostomidae. Our findings suggest that protection and restoration of river continuity, natural flow regimes, seasonally appropriate water temperatures, and geographic range expansion are critical components to include in Sicklefin Redhorse conservation planning. Fisheries and ecosystem managers can use our findings to justify sensitive management decisions that conserve and restore critical streams and rivers occupied by this imperiled species.

Flux measurements were carried out from two contrasting regions of the shelf: the Wax Lake Delta (WLD, a propagating delta) and Barataria Bay (BB, a degrading delta) during early summer (high river flow) and fall (low river flow) in 2019. On average, surface water pCO(2) for WLD varied between 275-1,487 mu atm in early summer and 381-1,267 mu atm in fall, while BB was mostly CO2 undersaturated, ranging from 212 to 289 mu atm and 336 to 414 mu atm, respectively. The freshwater discharge largely controlled pCO(2) in the near-shore region, whereas community metabolism was the dominant process farther offshore. Wind-based estimates of CO2 fluxes varied between -1-28 and -9-0.2 mmol m(-2) d(-1) whereas radiometric-based estimates varied between -6-6 and -48-5 mmol m(-2) d(-1) for WLD and BB, respectively. The near-shore region was found to be a source of CO2 for the atmosphere. Our results show that gas transfer velocities estimated by the radiometric approach were consistently higher than the wind-based approach at water depths of 20-40 m. This suggests that processes other than wind velocity, such as turbulence, fetch, and chemical enhancement, can play an important role in air-sea exchange of CO2 in the shallow shelf region.

Assessment of spring floods and surface water extent over the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Remote sensing of Arctic water bodies is an essential method for monitoring the dynamics of frozen ground. Thaw lake change provides insight into the state of permafrost. In the vast Arctic and sub-Arctic areas capturing changes in lake extent is assisted by satellite data. In particular, active microwave sensors can be used in a straightforward manner for water body classifications. This study uses the pan-Siberian datasets that are provided under the ESA STSE-ALANIS methane project. Surface water classifications in 10-day intervals have been produced using Envisat ASAR (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar) operating in wide swath mode. The high temporal frequency of these data allows an investigation of surface hydrology on an intra-annual basis. The current study applies a post-processing algorithm to the ALANIS products in order to investigate changes in surface inundation across the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District over the summer period of 2007. Multiple areas are found to exhibit changes in surface inundation. Strong seasonal variations occur in areas where previous investigations determined disappearing lakes. Spring floods associated with the depletion of snow-cover and melt waters as well as floodplain dynamics can be identified. On the Yamal peninsula, these changes occur most dominantly in the west; an area subject to anthropogenic land-use change. Changes in water body extent for each hot spot of seasonal variations are quantified and discussed.

This temperature increase has been significantly greater since the 1950s. Thus, paleolimnological analyses may be utilized to better understand ecological responses to recent changing climate over decadal to centennial timescales, especially in regions with sparse lake monitoring data. Here, we present paleolimnological results from a Pb-210/Cs-137-dated sediment core spanning approximately the last similar to 250 years from a remote, alpine, semi-closed oligotrophic lake (Lugu Lake) on the northwestern Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. Sediment profiles of diatoms, geochemical variables (LOI550, TOC and C/N) and median grain size were analyzed and compared with the climate data (1951 AD-2010 AD) from the Lijiang weather station. Endogenous productivity of Lugu Lake has increased gradually over the last 30 years. The majority of diatom taxa encountered in the core are typical of alkaline oligotrophic lakes. Diatom assemblages were dominated by Cyclostephanos dubius, Cyclotella taxa, and fragilarioid taxa. Diatom species composition has changed significantly with three assemblage shifts at different scales over the similar to 250-year period. Diatom species diversity reveals a distinct increase before similar to 1970 AD, followed by a decline. In addition, a decreasing trend in diatom cell-size was consistent with recent warming trends. Redundancy analysis (RDA) shows that regional air temperature trends (annual, spring, summer, and winter) have played a significant role (p < 0.05) in determining diatom compositional changes over the past six decades. Results of this study suggest that regional warming is the main driving force behind recent changes in diatom composition at Lugu Lake, while nutrients may also have impact on the diatom change in recent 10 years.																			0921-2728	1573-0417				MAR	2014	51	3					357	373		10.1007/s10933-013-9760-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-013-9760-4													WOS:000331105500003

Oxygenic photosynthesis generates hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct, of which some portion can be released to ambient water. However, few studies have examined hydrogen peroxide dynamics in relation to cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs). A year-long investigation of algal succession and hydrogen peroxide dynamics was conducted at the Caloosahatchee River, Florida, USA. We aimed to identify potential biological mechanisms responsible for elevated hydrogen peroxide production during cHAB events through the exploration of the freshwater microbial metatranscriptome. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations were elevated from February to September of 2021 when cyanobacteria were active and abundant. We observed one Microcystis cHAB event in spring and one in winter. Both had distinct nutrient uptake and cyanotoxin gene expression patterns. While meaningful levels of microcystin were only detected during periods of elevated hydrogen peroxide, cyanopeptolin was by far the most expressed cyanotoxin during the spring bloom when hydrogen peroxide was at its yearly maxima. Gene expressions of five microbial enzymes (Rubisco, superoxide dismutase, cytochrome b559, pyruvate oxidase, and NADH dehydrogenase) positively correlated to hydrogen peroxide concentrations. Additionally, there was higher nitrogen-fixing gene (nifDKH) expression by filamentous cyanobacteria after the spring bloom but no secondary bloom formation occurred. Overall, elevated environmental hydrogen peroxide concentrations were linked to cyanobacterial dominance and greater expression of specific enzymes in the photosynthesis of cyanobacteria. This implicates cyanobacterial photosynthesis and growth results in increased hydrogen peroxide generation as reflected in measured environmental concentrations.

Temperature and oxygen gradients can be created that are similar to those in temperate lakes during winter or summer stratification. Vertical stratification is created by moving a layer of cool, dense water across the bottom of a laboratory tank. The stratification is mained due to the temperature-density relation of water. Hypoxia can be created by bubbling nitrogen gas to remove oxygen from the incoming water. Other vertical chemical gradients can be created in addition to those involving temperature and oxyen. Use of the method is illustrated by the reaction of benthic invertebrates to developing hypoxia such as might occur in a winterkill lake.																			0270-5060	2156-6941				DEC	1989	5	2					247	252		10.1080/02705060.1989.9665233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02705060.1989.9665233													WOS:A1989CJ56300014

Communities were constituted of phyto- and zooplankton and macroinvertebrates (molluscs and insects) including benthic detritivores, grazers, omnivorous scrapers, omnivorous piercers, water column predators, benthic predators, and phytophilous predators. We quantified the main and interactive effects of warming and pharmaceuticals on each trophic level in the pelagic community and attributed them to the direct effects of both stressors and the indirect effects arising through biotic interactions. Warming and pharmaceuticals had stronger effects in the summer experiment, altering zooplankton community composition and causing delayed or accelerated emergence of top insect predators (odonates). In the summer experiment, both stressors and top predators reduced the biomass of filter-feeding zooplankton (cladocerans), while warming and pharmaceuticals had opposite effects on phytoplankton. In the winter experiment, the effects were much weaker and were limited to a positive effect of warming on phytoplankton biomass. Overall, we show that pharmaceuticals can exacerbate the effects of climate warming in freshwater ecosystems, especially during the warm season. Our results demonstrate the utility of communitylevel studies across seasons for risk assessment of multiple emerging stressors in freshwater ecosystems.

J	Phillips, KA; Fawley, MW				Phillips, KA; Fawley, MW			Winter phytoplankton community structure in three shallow temperate lakes during ice cover	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The general model of seasonal phytoplankton succession in temperate lakes suggests that winter phytoplankton growth is minimal under ice-cover. However, some studies have found diverse phytoplankton communities during winter. The primary objectives of this study were to determine the species composition and the changes in the winter phytoplankton community structure under the ice. For 2 consecutive winters, phytoplankton samples were collected under ice-cover at 4 sites on 3 lakes in Arrowwood National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), near Pingree, North Dakota. Ninety taxa were identified and enumerated. Densities of several of these taxa frequently exceeded 10(6) cells l(-1). The winter phytoplankton communities in these lakes were dominated by flagellates, principally cryptomonads, a synurophyte (Synura uvella), small chrysophytes (Chrysococcus spp., Kephyrion spp.) and a dinoflagellate ( Peridinium aciculiferum), as well as non-flagellate microchlorophytes ( Monoraphidium spp., Ankistrodesmus spp., and Pseudodictyosphaerium sp.), a cyanobacterium (Gloeocapsa aeruginosa) and centric diatoms ( Stephanodiscus minutulus, S. parvus and Cyclotella meneghiniana).																			0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2002	470	1-3					97	113		10.1023/A:1015667803372	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1015667803372													WOS:000175854800011

Phosphorus limitation was studied along the eutrophic, canyon-type Rimov reservoir (Czech Republic) during a spring phytoplankton bloom. Concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), C:P molar ratio in seston, extracellular alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and P limitation (bioassay) were used as indices for phosphorus deficiency in the phytoplankton. 2. SRP, C:P, APA, and P limitation indicated a moderate P deficiency in the downstream, but not upper, part of the reservoir. 3. Significant correlations between these parameters were found in the downstream part. Chlorophyll a concentration correlated with APA and P limitation in the upper part. 4. APA was significantly enhanced in the phosphorus-deficient phytoplankton. However, APA was apparently not related to total biomass or species composition of the phytoplankton. 5. Generally, APA was closely correlated with pH in the reservoir. However, extracellular alkaline phosphatases, with a pH optimum above 9.0, were induced and active only during the phytoplankton bloom, whereas low background activity of extracellular phosphatases was found at low chlorophyll a concentrations (winter, clear-water phase).

Effects of prescribed fire on germination and plant community of Carex cinerascens and Artemisia selengensis in Poyang Lake, China	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												As an important freshwater lake and wetland area with international significance in biodiversity conservation, Poyang Lake is facing increasing pressure from human activities, including prescribed fire. In the present study, two representative wetland plants from Poyang Lake (Carex cinerascens and Artemisia selengensis) were selected to determine their in situ regeneration success following a prescribed winter fire. Monitoring of plant growth and species composition was carried out monthly for one year following burn treatments. Results showed that significantly higher densities of both C. cinerascens and A. selengensis were observed in the spring. Moreover, the prescribed fire had little influence on the aboveground and belowground biomasses of C. cinerascens, whereas a significant effect on A. selengensis was observed. A smaller difference in dominance values of constructive species was detected between burned and unburned plots. However, a significant increase in biodiversity was found within the burned A. selengensis community in spring. In addition, there was little difference in plant traits and community characters found between burned and unburned plots after the flooding season. Our findings suggest that the water regime is the main driving factor in regulating the ecological process of Poyang Lake, and a single prescribed fire was not sufficient to change the plant community structure, although it did have a significant influence on biomass and species composition in the season following the fire.

Annual mean sinking velocities ranged from 2.6 m d-1 in the euphotic zone to 7.5 m d-1 in the aphotic zone. Summer maxima of 36.6 m d-1 were caused by settling calcite crystals, while minima of 0.4 m d-1 during the clear water phase resulted from particulate matter consisting mostly of phytoplankton and organic debris. Winter settling velocities averaged 1,2 m d-1. The mean residence time for the bulk of particles calculated on an annual basis was 27.8 days. The net settling velocities in this study were higher than those calculated for phytoplankton in other investigations but agreed with estimates for particles from Lake Zurich obtained by an approach similar to this study.																			0036-7842					DEC	1987	49	3					284	293		10.1007/BF02538289	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02538289													WOS:A1987L695700002

The intensity exhibits stronger inter-annual and inter-decadal variability. Analysis is performed of the difference in the circulation, geopotential height and OLR fields between years of strong, weak and normal EASM in MLYV, with preliminary study on the mechanism for key-region SST impacting the monsoon intensity, discovering the intensity in higher positive (negative) correlation with previous winter SST anomalies (SSTA) over the tropical Indian Ocean, waters off East China, and equatorial eastern Pacific (SSTA over waters east of the Philippines), that is, warmer-than-normal SST in the tropical Indian Ocean, and equatorial eastern Pacific and colder-than-normal SST in the east of the Philippines make the western-Pacific subtropical high's ridge southward of mean, its west stretching point westward of normal and intensity higher in comparison to mean, and meanwhile a blocking high is prone to appear around Lake Balkhash, allowing the cold air to move south frequently, therefore, the cold and warm air flows meet in MLYV, converging and rising, leading to the monsoon intensity stronger and the serious floods occur there and vice versa. The findings can serve as an important criterion for the forecasting of the EASM's intensity in MLYY.																			0277-786X	1996-756X	978-0-8194-6827-7				2007	6679								66790V	10.1117/12.730690	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.730690													WOS:000251479600028

The study areas were located in the outer archipelago at depths of 21-25 and 26-30 m and in the sea zone at 46 m. In P. affinis abundance declined from 12 000-17 000 ind. m-2 in May to 800-3000 ind. m-2 in November, but the maximum biomass of 5-8 g AFDM m-2 was attained in August. In the archipelago the daily production values were highest in June-July and biomass losses in July-August. In the sea zone production peaked in June but was considerable until autumn, and biomass losses increased toward autumn. Annual production to biomass ratios (P/B) declined from 2.9 to 1.3 with increasing depth. This decrease was most probably due to the lower temperature and food competition in the denser population of Pontoporeia at greater depths. The 0+ age group had the highest P/B ratio (4.8-3.4) and in the two archipelago areas about as high an annual production as the 1+ age group. In the sea zone production of the 1+ and 2+ age groups by far exceeded that of the 0+ age group. In P. femorata, present only in the sea zone, total abundance remained at a steady level of about 2500 ind. m-2 throughout the study period. The maximum biomass, 3 g AFDM m-2, was attained in September and was mainly composed of the 1+ and 2+ age groups. In all age groups maximum daily production values were attained in October-November. Daily biomass losses also peaked in the autumn. The annual P/B ratio for the entire population was 2.1, but the highest P/B ratio (3.4) was obtained for those young released in the spring.

J	STOTTLEMYER, R; TOCZYDLOWSKI, D				STOTTLEMYER, R; TOCZYDLOWSKI, D			STREAM CHEMISTRY AND HYDROLOGIC PATHWAYS DURING SNOWMELT IN A SMALL WATERSHED ADJACENT LAKE-SUPERIOR	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												In regions with airborne contaminants and large snowpacks. there is concern over the impact that snowmelt chemical "pulses" - periods of sharp increase in meltwater solute concentration - could have on aquatic resources during spring runoff. A major variable in determining such an effect is the flow path of snowmelt solutes to the stream or lake. From December 1988, to late April 1989, the quality and quantity of precipitation, snowmelt, soil solution and streamwater were measured in a 176-ha gauged watershed on the south shore of Lake Superior. The main objectives were to (1) examine the change in flow path meltwaters take to the stream during, distinct winter and spring hydrologic periods, (2) quantify ecosystem-level ion budgets prior to, during, and following snowmelt, and (3) examine if streamwater chemistry might be a sensitive indicator of change in ecosystem flow paths. Prior to peak snowmelt, groundwater made up 80% of stream discharge. During peak snowmelt, the groundwater level rose to the soil surface resulting in lateral water movement through near-surface macropores and as overland flow. Near the end of snowmelt, meltwaters exerted a piston action on deeper soil solution again increasing its relative contribution to streamwater discharge. Net groundwater drawdown during the study resulted in streamwater discharge about equal to precipitation inputs. Unfrozen soils and brief mid-winter thaws resulted in steady snowmelt throughout early and mid-winter. The snowpack lost > 50% of most ions prior to the period of major snowmelt and high stream discharge in late March and early April. Snowmelt and streamwater NO3- and NH4+ pulses occurred before the period of overland flow and peak streamwater discharge (April 4-24). During overland flow, stream discharge of total N, P, DOC, and Al peaked. Nutrient budgets computed for distinct hydrologic periods were much more helpful in explaining ecosystem pathways and processes than were changes in solute concentration. For the study period, watershed base cation (C(B)) discharge was 23 times input and SO4(2-) discharge exceeded input by 42% H+ was the most strongly conserved ion with output < 0.2% of input. Also conserved were NH4+ with only 1.4% of input leaving the ecosystem and NO3- with output equal to 9.4% of input.																			0168-2563						1991	13	3					177	197																WOS:A1991GM82100001

M. edax, the numerically dominant crustacean, exhibited a stationary age distribution for most of the year (July-March). Per capita growth rates (r) of M. edax approximated zero throughout most of the study, indicating a close correspondence between birth and death rates. High death rates in the spring and summer probably were due to intense predation, since physiological mortality was low and predators were abundant. Multiple regression analyses indicated that much of the variation in M. edax birth rates could be explained by abundance of their animal prey. Other plankton in this lake exhibited considerable seasonality, but not to the marked degree characteristic of temperate populations. The number of zooplankton species was low and cladocerans were scarce, as is characteristic of many eutrophic Florida [USA] Lakes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1982	89	1					39	48		10.1007/BF00017536	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00017536													WOS:A1982NK56700005

Assessing the contribution of combustion-derived contaminants to a remote subarctic environment from traffic on the Tibbitt to Contwoyto winter road (Northwest Territories, Canada)	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Remote mining operations in Canada's Northwest Territories and Nunavut are supported by a 600 km winter road, which spans the transition from subarctic boreal forest in Yellowknife to low Arctic tundra. Each year, thousands of truckloads of fuel, large equipment, and other heavy loads are hauled up the winter road. We investigated whether diesel emissions from commercial truck traffic is a major source of metals and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) to aquatic ecosystems along the winter road. In March 2014, at the end of the hauling season, we collected integrated snow samples, water, and sediment from nine lakes located along the winter road, as well as from six lakes located within the city of Yellowknife. Examination of PAC composition and diagnostic ratios in snow samples showed that wildfires are an important source of PACs to lakes along the winter road, while anthropogenic sources are more prevalent in snow from Yellowknife lakes. Concentrations of PACs, including those associated with diesel emissions, were variable in snow, water, and sediment across all sites. The highest concentrations of PACs in snow were reported in winter road lakes located in the subarctic boreal forest, where forest fires are common. No compositional differences were observed for PACs in sediment and water samples between Yellowknife and winter road lakes. We did not observe any evidence of metal contamination in snow collected along the winter road, and metal concentrations in snow from winter road sites were consistently lower than Yellowknife sites. Our results show that a high contribution of PACs from natural sources can obscure potential contributions from diesel traffic emissions along the winter road. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These data were used in combination with wind velocity and temperature-adjusted Henry's law constants to estimate the direction and magnitude of chemical exchange across the air-water interface of these lakes. Bow Lake (1,975 in above sea level [masl]) was studied during the Summers of 1998 through 2000; Donald (770 masl) was studied during the summer of 1999; Dixon Dam Lake (946 masl]) and Kananaskis Lake (1,667 masl) were studied during the summer of 2000. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and dieldrin volatilized from Bow Lake in spring and summer of 1998 to 2000 at a rate of 0.92 +/- 1.1 and 0.55 +/- 0.37 ng m(-2) d(-1), respectively. The alpha-endosulfan deposited to Bow Lake at a rate of 3.4 +/- 2.2 ng m(-2) d(-1). Direction of gas exchange for gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (-gamma-HCH) changed from net deposition in 1998 to net volatilization in 1999, partly because of a surge in -gamma-HCH concentrations in the water at Bow Lake in 1999. Average -gamma-HCH concentrations in air declined steadily over the three-year period, from 0.021 ng m(-3) in 1998, to 0.0023 ng m(-3) in 2000, and to volatilization in 1999 and 2000. Neither the concentrations of organochlorine compounds (OCs) in air and water, nor the direction and rate of air-water gas exchange correlate with temperature or elevation. In general, losses of pesticides by outflow were greater than the amount exchanged across the air-water interface in these lakes.

Complex temperature mosaics across space and time in estuaries: implications for current and future nursery function for Pacific salmon	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												Water temperature is a key dimension of estuaries that can influence important biological processes including organismal growth, survival, and habitat use. For example, juvenile Pacific salmon rely on temperature-mediated growth opportunities in estuaries during seaward migration in the spring and summer. However, oncoming climate change is warming estuary temperatures and transforming growth potential. Yet, it is likely that estuary water temperatures are complex and dynamic across space and time. Here we investigated spatial and temporal patterns of water temperature across two contrasting estuaries on Vancouver Island, BC, and used these data to simulate juvenile Chinook salmon growth potential under both present conditions and a simplified scenario of climate warming. Summer temperatures were warmer and more spatially homogeneous across the Englishman River estuary relative to the Salmon River estuary. Within each system, temperature was variable across habitats and sites, appearing to be driven by a combination of local climate, river and ocean temperatures, tidal fluctuations, and habitat features. This shifting mosaic of temperatures generated a complex portfolio of growth opportunities for juvenile Chinook salmon. There were broad patterns of increasing growth potential across both systems as temperatures warmed in early summer. However, excessively hot late summer temperatures drove steep declines in growth potential across the Englishman River estuary, while positive trends continued through August in the Salmon River estuary. A simple climate change scenario revealed that estuaries and habitats may have differing vulnerabilities to increasing temperatures-with climate warming, favorable growth opportunities were even more constricted to early summer in the Englishman River estuary, but expanded across most habitats and times in the Salmon River estuary given lower baseline temperatures and higher habitat complexity. Collectively, this work underscores the importance of habitat complexity and local climate for maintaining diverse growth opportunities across estuaries, which may confer resilience to the nursery function of estuaries as temperature mosaics warm.																				2296-7745				NOV 27	2023	10								1278810	10.3389/fmars.2023.1278810	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2023.1278810													WOS:001119178100001

The Salton Sea: Critical Migratory Stopover Habitat for Caspian Terns (Hydroprogne caspia) in the North American Pacific Flyway	WATERBIRDS												For migratory waterbirds, the availability and quality of suitable stopover habitat can affect body condition and demographic parameters throughout the annual cycle. This study investigates the importance of the Salton Sea, a large saline lake located in the southwestern United States near the USA-Mexico border, for migrating Caspian Terns (Hydroprogne caspia) fitted with long-duration satellite telemetry tags in the northwest contiguous USA. During fall migration, 100% (n = 25) in 2014 and 98% (n = 63) in 2015 of all tagged individuals were tracked to the Salton Sea, with median durations of stay lasting 36 and 25 days, respectively. Use of the Salton Sea during subsequent spring migrations was less consistent than in fall, but still substantial, with 91% (n = 23) and 68% (n = 53) of all birds conducting brief stops there during 2015 and 2016, respectively. The future of the Salton Sea as suitable habitat for fish and piscivorous birds is uncertain due to rising salinity levels caused by reduced input flows. It is also uncertain if other wetlands in the region can serve as replacement habitat for Caspian Terns and other migratory piscivorous species should the Salton Sea cease to provide fish prey.					; Patterson, Allison/AAW-5259-2021	Patterson, Allison/0000-0001-9931-2693; 													1524-4695	1938-5390				JUN	2018	41	2					154	165		10.1675/063.041.0206	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.041.0206													WOS:000435712000005

The Menyuan Basin is a sensitive region for the interaction between the monsoons and Westerlies in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where loess is extensively distributed, rendering it an ideal area for investigating climatic processes. In this study, climate changes in the Menyuan Basin since 40 ka are reconstructed using proxy records and luminescence dating obtained from the Yahecun profile. Our results show that the Menyuan Basin experienced a dry and cold climate from 40 to 16 ka, a continuous increase in moisture and temperature from 16 to 4.4 ka, and a relatively mild climate since 4.4 ka. The temperature variations in the Menyuan Basin are primarily driven by solar insolation; after 6 ka, the increase in the greenhouse gas concentrations contributed to higher temperatures. Precipitation in the region is governed by changes in the Westerlies and monsoons. During the glacial period, the summer monsoon weakened, and the transport of westerly water vapor decreased, resulting in reduced precipitation in the Menyuan Basin. Following the glacial period, an intensified summer monsoon and increased westerly water vapor transport collectively led to heightened precipitation. After 5 ka, the strengthening of the Westerlies likely sustained high precipitation in the Menyuan Basin. The intensity of winter monsoons in the Menyuan Basin is influenced by high-latitude insolation, with reduced high-latitude insolation after 6 ka leading to enhanced winter monsoons.

Palla in urban lakeshore restorations	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Despite their central role in lakeshore restoration, most littoral wetland plantings fail. The reasons for these failures are poorly understood, in part due to limited information on the effects of planting time, water depth, and propagation on the survival of emergent macrophyte plantings. We planted pots and prevegetated mats of softstem bulrush (Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani (C.C. Gmel.) Palla) at two different water depths (0-30 and 31-60 cm) in five lakes each month between May and September 2006 to evaluate the effects of planting month, water depth, and transplant type on the survival of planted S. tabernaemontani. Overall survival decreased from 73% at 30 days after planting to 40% pre-winter to 15% post-winter. The timing of planting was the most important factor influencing bulrush survival. Survival of bulrush planted later in the growing season is poor, regardless of the transplant type used, and should be avoided. During the optimal planting season of early-to-mid summer, transplants from pots are more likely to outperform mats, despite lower pre-planting biomass. Water depth is only important immediately after planting, after which time, its influence on successful establishment diminishes. Overall, our research indicated that key choices made by the practitioner can improve the likelihood that transplants establish in littoral wetland restorations.																			0923-4861	1572-9834				FEB	2011	19	1					35	45		10.1007/s11273-010-9198-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11273-010-9198-7													WOS:000287327700003

An exploratory assessment of burbot (Lota lota L.) by-catches in four northern Canadian lakes with respect to the viability of liver oil processing	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY					3rd International Burbot Symposium	JUL 06, 2010	Barcelona, SPAIN					Burbot (Lota lota L.) liver oil with its high content of omega-3 fatty acids, Vitamin D and Vitamin K is a potentially-valuable nutritional therapeutic product. There is no commercial burbot fishery in Canada presently. Burbot by-catch was monitored during 2006 in four northern Canadian lakes to determine if a by-catch strategy might provide sufficient burbot for the establishment of a viable burbot liver oil processing facility. In the winter months, the burbot by-catch fishery was found to be about 15% of the lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) catch. In contrast, summer by-catch test fishery showed the burbot by-catch yield to be 3-7% of lake whitefish catch. Application of the highest by-catch value (i.e., from winter fishing) to the allowable quota catches of whitefish in these four lakes would result in a yield of only about 700 kg of burbot liver oil annually. This quantity would eliminate by-catch as a feedstock strategy for the prospective burbot liver oil processing business.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				SEP	2011	27			1	SI		27	35		10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01840.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2011.01840.x													WOS:000294596000006

Phytoplankton and zooplankton succession during the dry-refilling cycle: A case study in large, fluctuating soda lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												Aquatic ecosystems in arid regions are important habitats for aquatic wildlife and also support species biodiversity. Soda lakes in endorheic drainage basins, so-called amplifier lakes, are sentinels of climate change and are of scientific significance. Here we present the results of a long-term study (20 years) of the Torey lakes, Transbaikalia, Russia, including the period from the maximum capacity of the Torey lakes through to aridification, and then to the initial phase of refilling. Our aim was to determine the response of planktonic communities in the lakes to environmental change over this period. We conducted our studies during various parts of the hydrological cycle, including three phases for Lake Zun-Torey (high [1999, 2003], intermediate [2007, 2011] and low [2014, 2016] water levels) and two phases for Lake Barun-Torey (high level [1999, 2003] and the initial refilling phase [2014, 2016, 2018, 2020]). Lake Barun-Torey dried up completely in summer 2009, and since 2013 has been undergoing initial refilling. Lake Zun-Torey dried up in the autumn of 2017. Temporal variation in planktonic communities differs for each lake. We identified four stages of changes in the planktonic associations during the aridification of Lake Zun-Torey (the phytoplankton experienced a decrease in abundance and biomass, and was dominated by green algae and diatoms; the zooplankton underwent a decrease in species diversity and an increase in total abundance and biomass, which were caused by an increase in the abundance of some crustacean species) and three stages of changes as the lake level fell and during the initial refilling of Lake Barun-Torey (the plankton communities increased in species richness and abundance in the transient pools). These results show the complexity of long-term community dynamics in arid-zone soda lakes. They have revealed how phytoplankton and zooplankton community diversity and structure can vary with changing environmental conditions and may pass between distinct states related to the stages of the hydroperiod.

Samples were taken in different seasons of 2001. The conditions for microbial growth in the lakes are determined by elevated content of salts (from 0.5 to 2.0 g/l), dominated by SO42- and Ca2+ ions (up to 1.4 and 0.6 g/l, respectively). The elevated sulfate concentration is favorable for sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRBs). Summer and winter stratification gives rise to anaerobic water layers enriched in products of anaerobic degradation: H2S and CH4. The lakes under study contain abundant SRBs not only in bottom sediments (from 10(3) to 10(7) cds/dm(3)) but also in the water column (from cells/ml). The characteristic spatial and temporal variations in the rate of sulfate reduction were noted. The highest rates of this process were recorded in summer: 0.95-2.60 mg S2-/dm(3) per day in bottom sediments and up to 0.49 mg S2-/l per day in the water column. The maximum values (up to 11.36 mg S2-/dm(3)) were noted in areas where bottom sediments were enriched in plankton debris. Molecular analysis of conservative sequences of the gene for 16S rRNA in sulfate-reducing microorganisms grown on lactate allowed them to be identified as Desulfovibrio desulfuricans.

Trapped in desert springs: phylogeography of Australian desert spring snails	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim We investigate the phylogeographical history and determine the time-scale of population divergence of hydrobiid freshwater snails (genus Trochidrobia) inhabiting groundwater springs in the Australian desert. We test the hypothesis that divergence between geographically distinct snail populations occurred simultaneously due to their isolation in hydrologically discrete spring systems, i.e. trapped in desert springs. Location Groundwater springs of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) in central Australia. Methods DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene and the nuclear 28S and internal transcribed spacer rRNA genes were used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships within and among three species of Trochidrobia (Hydrobiidae): T. punicea (13 spring groups, n = 90), T. smithi (12 spring groups, n = 62) and T. minuta (2 spring groups, n = 4). Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analyses and approximate Bayesian computation were used to date lineage divergence and distinguish between alternative biogeographical scenarios. Results The diversification of the three Trochidrobia species probably occurred between 2.54 and 9.3 Ma, prior to the formation of the springs c. 1 Ma. Intraspecific divergences within the two widespread species occurred after the formation and colonization of the springs. Coalescent modelling and molecular clock analyses supported a simultaneous radiation of five allopatric intraspecific snail lineages within T. punicea (two lineages) and T. smithi (three lineages) across the GAB springs examined. Main conclusions The analyses support the trapped in desert springs hypothesis for the diversification of intraspecific lineages within the species T. punicea and T. smithi. This hypothesis suggests that the formation of deserts around Lake Eyre in the early Pleistocene led to the hydrological isolation of spring complexes in the GAB, resulting in significant molecular divergence, but no morphological divergence, of Trochidrobia snail populations.

The chemistry of spring waters and fumarolic gases encircling Santa Maria volcano, Guatemala: Insights into regional hydrothermal activity and implications for volcano monitoring	VOLCANIC HAZARDS IN CENTRAL AMERICA	Geological Society of America Special Papers											Springs encircling Santa Maria volcano in Guatemala generally contain bicarbonate waters. Bicarbonate waters southwest of the persistently active Santiaguito lava dome are characterized by high Mg/Ca. Other springs contain acid sulfate or chloride waters. Most acid sulfate and chloride waters are spatially confined to springs, wells, and streams of the Zunil and Zunil-II (Sulfur Mountain) geothermal fields on the flanks of the Cerro Quemado dome complex, 5 km to the east-northeast of Santa Maria. Some acid sulfate waters have unusually high S/Cl ratios (20-70). Chloride waters are dilute versions of typical geothermal brines. The delta C-13 ratios of all waters fall in a very narrow range (-11.5 parts per thousand to -8.5 parts per thousand). The nonreactive gas compositions from fumaroles encircling Santa Maria are typical of those sampled at other subduction zone volcanoes. Most fumarolic gases from Santa Maria have notably lighter delta C-13 ratios compared to gases sampled from elsewhere on the Central American volcanic front. The He and C isotopic values of fumarolic gas samples from the Santa Maria region indicate significant mantle input. Estimated magmatic delta C-13 ratios for Zunil and Zunil-II, however, are lighter than accepted mantle values (-11 parts per thousand to -14 parts per thousand). This is most likely caused by shallow crustal contamination. All of the spring waters from the Santa Maria region represent variable interactions between magmatic/hydrothermal fluids and meteoric waters. There is, however, only limited mixing between bicarbonate, acid sulfate, and chloride waters. Surface discharges of chloride waters are inhibited by high precipitation rates. The high S/Cl ratios of some of the acid sulfate waters from Zunil/Zunil-II reflect extensive scrubbing by the underlying hydrothermal system. High Mg/Ca bicarbonate waters from springs south-southwest of the Santiaguito dome complex have experienced enhanced water-rock interaction, and their slightly heavier delta C-13 ratios (-9.5 parts per thousand to -8 parts per thousand) hint at a small distinction between magmatic delta C-13 at Zunil/Zunil-II and Santa Mar a. This supports previous suggestions that the hydrothermal system beneath the Zunil area is independent of Santa Maria. Gas samples from Zunil/Zunil-II and Cerro Quemado, on the other hand, do share similar delta C-13 ratios, strengthening the notion that magmatism at the latter is propelling the hydrothermal system northeast of Santa Mar a. Hence, monitoring of the springs and fumaroles at Zunil/Zunil-II could prove useful in forecasting of future activity at Cerro Quemado.																			0072-1077		978-0-8137-2412-6				2006	412						59	83		10.1130/2006.2412(04)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/2006.2412(04)													WOS:000272286100005

The location has frequent blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa, which have been recorded occurring throughout the year, including winter temperatures as low as 13 degreesC. Nutrient enrichment tests were performed in-situ on the natural phytoplankton population in 1997 and 1998 while Microcystis aeruginosa dominated (covering both summer and winter periods). These experiments compared population changes under the ambient nutrient regime with those after additions of ortho-phosphate, nitrate, ammonia and various combinations of these nutrients. Under ambient conditions, the Microcystis population was able to grow significantly (P < 0.05) while most non-cyanobacterial phytoplankton did not. Nutrient additions induced a variety of nutrient limitation responses that often varied between genera of major groups i.e. in the Chlorophyceae (Actinastrum sp. responded to phosphorus while Psephonema sp. responded to nitrogen). The possibility that shifts in population dominance from Chlorophyceae to the Cyanobacteria (M. aeruginosa) at Sackville are in response to competition for limiting nutrients is discussed.					; Mitrovic, Simon/A-7225-2012	Mitrovic, Simon/0000-0002-5528-2215; 													1434-2944						2001	86	3					285	298																WOS:000169383800002

Sam; Peterson, Thomas C.; Means, Tiffany N.; Zhang, Xuebin			Annual floods in New England (USA) and Atlantic Canada: synoptic climatology and generating mechanisms	PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY												New England and Atlantic Canada are characterized by mixed flood regimes that reflect different storm types, antecedent land surface conditions, and flood seasonality. Mixed flood regimes are known to complicate flood risk analyses, yet the synoptic climatology and precipitation mechanisms that generate annual floods in this region have not been described in detail. We analyzed a set of long-term annual flood records at climate-sensitive stream gauges across the region and classified the synoptic climatology of each annual flood, quantitatively describing the precipitation mechanisms, and characterize flood seasonality. We find that annual floods here are dominantly generated by Great Lakes-sourced storms and Coastal lows, known locally as 'nor'easters.' Great Lakes storms tend to be associated with lower magnitude annual floods (<75th percentile) and Coastal lows are more clearly associated with higher magnitude events (>75th percentile). Tropical cyclones account for few of all annual floods, including extreme events, despite causing some of the region's largest and most destructive floods. Late winter/early spring is when the greatest number of annual floods occur region wide, and rainfall is the dominant flood-producing mechanism. Rainfall in combination with snowmelt is also important. Both mechanisms are expected to be impacted by projected regional climate change. We find little evidence for associations between flood-producing synoptic storm types or precipitation mechanisms and large-scale atmospheric circulation indices or time periods, despite upward trends in New England annual flood magnitudes. To more completely investigate such associations, partial duration flood series that include more floods than just the largest of each year, and their associated synoptic climatologies and precipitation mechanisms, should be analyzed.

The importance of different seasons and sources to the total loading were compared for past and present conditions. The seasonal budget revealed that while spring contributes the greatest loading in both scenarios, summer exhibits the greatest change in loadings from past to present. As for sources this seepage lake receives most of its water and N from groundwater; however, most P comes from surface runoff. The greatest impact on the watershed since settlement was probably the large increase in runoff matched by a decrease in evapotranspiration and subsurface flow. This shift in hydrology is responsible for the substantial increase in P loading and the decrease in the N:P ratio of total loading. The significance of the lake''s modified morphometry to areal and volumetric loading is explored.																			0018-8158	1573-5117					1981	77	1					87	96		10.1007/BF00006393	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00006393													WOS:A1981LC08500014

Four experiments compared survivorship of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and unionid mussels (Unionidae). Under mild spring conditions (March), survivorship of zebra mussels was similar to that of unionid mussels, but during summer (July) survivorship of zebra mussels was lower than that of unionid mussels. Survivorship of zebra mussels was greatest when attached to native unionids, compared with detached zebra mussels and zebra mussels attached rocks. A fifth experiment compared survivorship of 10 species of unionid mussels after 24 hours of aerial exposure. In general, survivorship of thick-shelled species, such as Amblema plicata, was greater than survivorship of thin-shelled species, such as Potamilus ohiensis. The experiments conducted suggest that drawdowns during warm summer conditions could have a profound, negative influence on zebra mussel demography and distribution. In contrast, unionid mussel survival was unaffected by aerial exposure of up to 24 hours during a midsummer drawdown.

The analysis shows that the simulated fields of 2-m air temperature, precipitation, and snow water equivalent by the RCMs closely match the observations with similar multiyear means and a high correlation of the monthly anomalies. The climatic conditions responsible for the 2011 flood are generally well simulated by the RCMs. The use of multidecadal RCM simulations facilitates the identification of anomalies that contributed to the flood. The flood was linked to a combination of factors: the 2010/11 winter was cold and snowy, the snowmelt in spring was fast, and there was a record amount of precipitation in April and May. Driven by outputs from the RCMs, HSAMI was able to reproduce the mean hydrograph of the Richelieu River, but it underestimated the peak of the 2011 flood. HSAMI adequately computes the water transport from the mountains to the river mouth and the storage effect of Lake Champlain, which dampens the flood over a long period. Overall, the results suggest that RCM simulations can be useful for reconstructing high-resolution climate information and providing new variables that can help better understand the causes of extreme climatic events.					; Somot, Samuel/A-7585-2008	Philippe, Riboust/0000-0001-9244-524X; Lucas-Picher, Philippe/0000-0001-8707-7745; Somot, Samuel/0000-0002-5066-2921													1525-755X	1525-7541				FEB	2015	16	1					36	54		10.1175/JHM-D-14-0116.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-14-0116.1													WOS:000349367500004

However, due to the lack of well-dated, high- resolution paleoclimate records, the trends of temperature and ISM precipitation on the southern QTP since the mid-Holocene are poorly understood. We present a high-resolution pollen record from Dirgo Co, on the southern QTP, spanning the past 4400 years. The decrease in the pollen ratio of Artemisia to Cyperaceae (A/Cy) indicates a downward shift of altitudinal vegetation belts in the Drigo Co area over the past 4400 years, suggesting falling temperatures; and decreases in tree pollen percentages indicate the gradual weakening of the ISM. Our pollen record also indicates five cold phases with the near-simultaneous weakening of the monsoon, during: 4300-4100 cal yr BP, 3600-3400 cal yr BP, 2800-2600 cal yr BP, 1600-1400 cal yr BP, and 700-100 cal yr BP, and these climate anomalies were also recorded elsewhere on the QTP. We suggest that the changes in temperature and ISM intensity on the southern QTP over the past 4400 years were modulated by changes in summer insolation and solar activity. These changes affected the sea surface temperature (SST) over the tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean regions, and they were linked to a positive phase of the El Nino/Southern o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which weakened the ISM intensity in the Drigo Co area. Additionally, due to increased evaporation related to high temperatures, combined with intensified grazing activities over the past similar to 200 years, the lake level has fallen, and the vegetation cover has decreased. As global temperatures continue to rise, the alpine steppe in the Drigo Co area may increase and the vegetation density may gradually decrease, and at the same time the regional ecological environment may gradually deteriorate.

In this study, we analyzed the composition and spatiotemporal variation of ARGs in the sediments of eutrophic Chaohu Lake, China, using a metagenomic method. A total of 22 ARGs and 199 ARGs subtypes were detected, with the most prevalent subtypes being multidrug (57.720 %) and rifamycin (21.781 %). A higher abundance of ARGs in Chaohu Lake was observed (p < 0.05) during winter and spring owing to multiple factors, including variations in seasonal inputs and hydraulic conditions, occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms, and changes in ARGs host bacterial communities. Spatially, a higher abundance of multidrug was observed in sediments near the Nanfei River outlet, which flows through urban areas; whereas higher levels of bacitracin were observed in sediments near the Zhao River outlet, which flows through agricultural areas. Cyanobacterial blooms and declines change the sediment physicochemical properties, endogenous phosphorus contents, microbial communities, and seasonal ARGs distribution. Correlation and collinearity analyses indicated that ARGs were transferred horizontally via mobile genetic elements (MGEs). High-risk ARGs in Chaohu Lake were observed at a very low proportion, although certain ARGs presented health risks in the western lake during spring. In this study, we highlight the interactions between cyanobacterial blooms and variations in ARGs in Chaohu Lake and provide novel insights into ARGs dynamics in eutrophic freshwater ecosystems.

Sturgeon and other species aggregate below the dam in late winter/early spring and are subjected to a variety of stressors stemming from crowding, poor habitat quality, and injuries that appear to be caused by boat propeller or turbine strikes. Spawning has been documented in the tailrace, but reproductive success has not been verified as no juveniles have been captured. Fish within the dam tailrace were captured by gill net during winter, 2005 and 2007-2011, and physiological condition was assessed using a panel of hematologic and biochemical indices. Plasma phosphorus and calcium were significantly higher in females, while PCV and aspartate aminotransferase were significantly higher in males, indicating sex-specific physiological changes triggered during maturity. A marked leucopenia, accompanied by lymphopenia and neutrophilia, was evident in both sexes and was consistent across years, indicating that these fish were under chronic stress.

To understand the climate controls on paleohydrologic change, well-dated records are needed across the region. The Plains of San Agustin (New Mexico, USA) is a closed-basin watershed of the American Southwest influenced by both winter westerly and summer North American Monsoon pre-cipitation. The flat valley floors of the Plains contain lake and groundwater discharge deposits that record multiple periods of past wet climate. We present a record of hydroclimate for the past 26,000 years based on radiocarbon, U-Th series, and OSL dating of these deposits and stratigraphic correlation across the three sub-basins of the lake system. We find that two major lake oscillations occurred, coincident with the global Last Glacial Maximum (-23-18 ka) and with Heinrich Stadial 1 (-17-14 ka). The LGM lake cycle created a deep lake in the lowermost sub-basin, fed by marsh/lake overflow in the upper sub -basins. The Heinrich Stadial 1 wet interval attained the highest recorded lake level between-17.0 and 15.3 ka, merging the lower two sub-basins into one lake. Both lake cycles agree well in timing and magnitude with other lake-based records from the southwestern U.S., supporting previous in-terpretations that a south-shifted cool season storm track brought a dipole-like pattern of enhanced moisture to the southwest at the expense of drier conditions in the northwest during the LGM and deglaciation. A transition from lake to groundwater discharge conditions followed during the Bolling-Allerod (14.7-12.9 ka) across the study area. Wet meadows prevailed in the lower sub-basin during the Younger Dryas (12.9-11.7 ka), with marsh and open lake conditions in the upper and middle sub-basins, respectively. During the early Holocene, discrete wet intervals are recorded by ages for wet meadow deposits in all sub-basins with centennial-millennial frequency at 9.9, 8.8, 8.2 ka. These events agree well with other Intermountain West records showing wetter-than-present conditions prior to 8 ka. Two additional wet periods, centered at 6.8 and 5.4 ka, occurred during the driest known interval of the middle Holocene, and likely were partly supported in the Plains of San Agustin by summer moisture associated with the peak strength of the North American Monsoon. Our record highlights that both winter and summer moisture support water resources in New Mexico watersheds.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
