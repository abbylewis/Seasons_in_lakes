Insights from high frequency measurement	GLOBAL COLLOQUIUM ON GEOSCIENCES AND ENGINEERING 2017	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				1st Global Colloquium on GeoSciences and Engineering (GCGE)	OCT 18-19, 2017	Bandung, INDONESIA					When measuring ecological variables in lakes, sampling frequency is critical in capturing an environmental pattern. Discrete sampling of traditional monitoring programs is likely to result in vital knowledge gaps in understanding any processes particularly those with fine temporal scale characteristics. The development of high frequency measurements offer a sophisticated range of information in recording any events in lakes at a finer time scale. We present physical indices of a tropical deep Lake Maninjau arrayed from OnLine Monitoring System (OLM). It is revealed that Lake Maninjau mostly has a diurnal thermal stratification pattern. The calculated lake stability (Schmidt stability), however, follows a seasonal pattern; low in December- January and around August, and high in May and September. Using a 3D numerical model simulation (ELCOM), we infer how wind and solar radiation intensity control lake's temperature profiles. In this review, we highlight the needs of high frequency measurement establishment in Indonesian tropical lakes to better understand the unique processes and to support the authorities' decision making in maximizing the provision of ecosystem services supplied by lakes and reservoirs.					; Santoso, Arianto/AAB-6636-2019	Fakhrudin, Muh./0000-0003-0751-9983; Santoso, Arianto/0000-0001-5437-8306													1755-1307						2018	118								012024	10.1088/1755-1315/118/1/012024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/118/1/012024													WOS:000445923300024

Recent water policy reforms offer limited guidance on managing for aquatic macrophytes. In addition, dune lake histories are poorly known as regular monitoring dates to 2005 AD. Here, ca. 4000 years of lake functional behaviour is reconstructed from sedimentary archives in two Northland dune lakes (Humuhumu and Rotokawau). Results demonstrated that macrophyte dominance is sensitive to catchment erosion and hydrological drawdown. Degradation of macrophyte communities occurred in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, earlier at Lake Humuhumu than Lake Rotokawau (post-1880 AD and post-1930 AD, respectively). In both lakes, increased erosional influx reduced macrophyte productivity, before later increases to wider trophic state (post-1970 AD). Lakelevel decline is linked to increased nutrient loading at Lake Rotokawau but less so, Lake Humuhumu which is more strongly groundwater-fed. In Northland dune lakes, water-level reduction and erosional influx from land use have driven macrophyte degradation.					; Augustinus, Paul/B-5125-2011	Augustinus, Paul/0000-0002-1391-2151; Stephens, Thomas/0000-0002-0003-9269; Gadd, Patricia/0000-0001-6725-1603													0028-8330	1175-8805					2018	52	3					409	429		10.1080/00288330.2018.1430593	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288330.2018.1430593													WOS:000442757700007

Mining contribute a lot of benefits such as employment and monetary profit but there are many associated environmental hazards as well. The purpose of this study is to conduct a preliminary assessment on water quality and heavy metals contents at Puteri Lake and Puchong Lake in Malaysia for better perspective of the emerging issues. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted to analyze the seasonal variation of water quality and heavy metal contents. Based on the PCA results, most of the significant values of variation Varimax Factor (VF) are evidence that several parameters were affected by the temporal variation especially Ammonia Nitrogen (AN) and Total Phosphorus (TP). Dissolved Oxygen (0.8385, 0.9674) and Conductivity (0.9583, 0.8894) also showed significant variation in both lakes, Puteri and Puchong. Heavy metals content analysis at Puteri and Puchong Lake indicates that both lakes had different significant metal elements such as Fe, Zn, Na, Ni and Cu for Puteri Lake with percentage variation of 55.6 percent and As, Pb and Cd for Puchong Lake at 36.1 percent due to the different land use characteristic and history of mining. Water quality and heavy metal variations are due to anthropogenic (mining, construction and domestic waste) and natural processes (erosion, runoff and geological area) of the study areas. This environmental tool provided a more objective interpretation of water pollution status and sources. Therefore a lot of research needs to be carried out to assess the pollution impact of the area on the environment and for rehabilitation and tourism development of the study areas.

In lacustrine environments, contaminated sediments are a source of Ag for the food web. Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) are the most abundant, diverse, and representative insect groups in aquatic ecosystems. Chironomid larvae are closely associated to benthic substrates and link primary producers and secondary consumers. Given their trophic position and their life habits, these larvae can be considered the entry point for the transference of Ag, from the benthic deposit to the higher trophic levels of the food web. Previous studies in lakes from Nahuel Huapi National Park (Northern Patagonia) showed Ag enrichment over background levels (0.04-0.1 mu g g(-1) dry weight) both in biota (bi-valves and fish liver) and sediments from sites near human settlements. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of chironomids in the transference of Ag from the benthic reservoir of Lake Moreno Oeste to the food web. The concentration of Ag in chironomid larvae tissue ranged from 0.1 to 1.5 mu g g(-1) dry weight, reaching a bioaccumulation factor up to 17 over substrates and depending on the associated substrate type, feeding habitats, larval stage, and season. The main Ag transfer to higher trophic levels by chironomids occurs in the littoral zone, mostly from larvae inhabiting submerged vegetation (Myriophyllum quitense) and sediment from vegetated zones. This study presents novel evidence of the doorway role played by chironomid larvae in Ag pathways from the sediments into food webs of freshwater ecosystems.					; Guevara, Sergio/I-9241-2019; Rizzo, Andrea/AAB-6325-2020; Williams, Naty/JED-3935-2023	Ribeiro Guevara, Sergio/0000-0001-7203-7687; 													0944-1344	1614-7499				JAN	2018	25	2					1921	1932		10.1007/s11356-017-0656-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0656-0								29103123					WOS:000419944100084

The metal species have similar spatial variations during different seasons. In the upstream reaches of the Baoxiang River, heavy metals reside primarily in the non-extractable residual fraction (72-90%). In the midstream, the residual fraction (35-89%) remains dominant, but the extractable fraction increases, featuring especially notable increases in the reducible fraction (5-40%). Downstream, the Cu, Ni, Pb, and Cr residual fractions remain high (46-80%) and the extractable fractions increase rapidly; the Zn extractable fraction is quite high (65.5%). Anthropogenic sources drive changes in heavy metal speciation. Changes in the river environment, such as pH and oxidation-reduction potential, also affect speciation. The reducible fraction of heavy metals in Baoxiang River sediments is most sensitive to pH. Potential ecological risk assessments for these five elements indicate that risks from Zn and Pb are mild to moderate in the middle and lower reaches of the river.					xiao, dongdong/LSK-4880-2024; Wu, Feng/B-3282-2013; Su, Bin/D-5635-2015														1080-7039	1549-7860					2018	24	7					1916	1929		10.1080/10807039.2018.1431044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10807039.2018.1431044													WOS:000436097400010

Surface water quality monitoring in a large dam reservoir, Poland	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												The paper presents a research monitoring platform implemented for the Sulejow dam reservoir located in Central Poland; the goal was to assess the quality status of the reservoir's waters during the vegetation season of 2015. Article presents the results of mobile field measurements together with laboratory analyses of biogenic parameters, in order to provide a broad picture of changes in water quality during the analysed period. Changes in water quality were evaluated based on the following parameters: chlorophyll a, ammonium ions, pH, water temperature, blue-green algae concentration, conductivity and dissolved oxygen. Analysis was complemented by laboratory measurements of the chemical parameters: nitrates, phosphates, 5-d biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand and total organic carbon. Extensive mobile experiments enabled the mapping of the distribution of contaminants in the lake (ArcGIS). Chlorophyll a exceeded allowable values during the entire vegetation season; furthermore, the high water temperatures, high concentrations of dissolved oxygen and low concentrations of biogenic compounds illustrate the advanced eutrophication of the reservoir. Present conditions prevent any recreational use of the reservoir and generates not only environmental but also economic losses.					; Zbicinski, Ireneusz/R-2160-2019; Jaskulski, Marcin/M-6299-2016	Imbierowicz, Miroslaw/0000-0002-7607-014X; Adamiec, Janusz/0000-0001-6458-0348; Zbicinski, Ireneusz/0000-0002-4285-8350; 													1944-3994	1944-3986				JAN	2018	101						130	142		10.5004/dwt.2018.21696	http://dx.doi.org/10.5004/dwt.2018.21696													WOS:000428734100018

A climatology of cold-season nonconvective wind events in the Great Lakes region	JOURNAL OF CLIMATE												A 44-yr climatology of nonconvective wind events (NCWEs) for the Great Lakes region has been created using hourly wind data for 38 first-order weather stations during the months of November through April. The data were analyzed in terms of the two National Weather Service (NWS) criteria for a high-wind watch or warning: sustained winds of at least 18 m s(-1) for at least I It or a wind gust of at least 26 m s(-1) for any duration. The results indicate a pronounced southwest quadrant directional preference for nonconvective high winds in this region. Between 70% and 76% of all occurrences that satisfied the NWS criteria for NCWEs were associated with wind directions from 180 degrees through 270 degrees. Within the southwest quadrant, the west-southwest direction is preferred, with 14%-35% of all NCWEs coming from this particular compass heading. This directional preference is borne out in five out of six stations with high occurrences of cold-season NCWEs (Buffalo, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Lansing, Michigan; Moline, Illinois; Springfield, Illinois). Given the geographic spread of these stations, a nontopographic cause for the directional preference of cold-season NCWEs is indicated. The connection between NCWEs and low pressure systems found in this climatology and in case studies suggests that midlatitude cyclone dynamics may be a possible cause of the directional preference.					; Knox, John/AAJ-7197-2020	Fuhrmann, Chris/0000-0003-2757-1674; 													0894-8755					DEC 15	2007	20	24					6012	6022		10.1175/2007JCLI1750.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2007JCLI1750.1													WOS:000252000800009

The sampling was conducted in the two main hydroclimatic seasons for this ecosystem, i.e. in the dry season (March-April) and in the wet season (August- September). The results obtained showed a fish assemblage organized around a consistently occurring group of twenty species. When analysed in terms of ecological categories, the seasonal influence led to a cycle in the assemblages from freshwater to marine around this permanent species pool, with a seasonal renewal of the assemblage. At the scale of the lagoon, there were variations in the composition of the assemblages that clearly distinguished the western part from the eastern one. The limit was situated at the Vridi canal, a wide artificial channel permanently connecting the lagoon to the sea. To the west, the assemblage was characterised by a strong spatial uniformity and low seasonal variability. To the east, the assemblage formed two different entities; one assemblage with pronounced freshwater affinities occurring in a side arm and the other assemblage with great seasonal variability under the alternating influence of seawater in the dry season and freshwater in the wet season. This part of the lagoon functioned somewhat like a typical estuary. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	van der Jeugd, HP; Prins, HHT				van der Jeugd, HP; Prins, HHT			Movements and group structure of giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) in Lake Manyara National Park, Tanzania	JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Movements and group structure of giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis were studied in Lake Manyara National Park, northern Tanzania. The giraffe population in Manyara had increased from 60 to 85 individuals between the early 1980s and 1991. This increase may have been the result of an increase in browse availability as a result of a dramatic decline in elephant numbers, and bush encroachment following a series of anthrax epidemics that killed impala. Giraffe densities in Manyara are high compared to other areas within the Masai ecosystem, and Manyara probably serves as a dry season refuge. Females were found in small, yet unstable groups, while males associated randomly with each other. Neither males nor females were confined to single localities, although home ranges were small compared with studies in areas with low giraffe densities. In one area within the park a more stable group was found, and resident males who were probably defending a temporary harem, engaged in necking contests with immigrant males. A comparison with other studies showed that giraffe density, home-range size, mobility and group stability differ across different habitats. The tendency that more stable groups are found in high density areas might be taken as evidence for the occurrence of resource defence polygyny in such areas.					van der Jeugd, Henk/S-3159-2019; van der Jeugd, Henk/F-4891-2010	van der Jeugd, Henk/0000-0002-5332-9526; Prins, Herbert/0000-0003-1131-5107													0952-8369	1469-7998				MAY	2000	251		1				15	21		10.1017/S0952836900005033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0952836900005033													WOS:000087532600003

However, the success of such measures has been questioned, and often lacks a scientific basis. This is especially true in Ethiopia where gullying has been reported to worsen because of the implementation of soil and water conservation programmes targeting sheet and rill erosion from cropland only. The current research therefore focuses on identifying the sources of sediment based on the dominant erosion processes at play.MethodsThis study was conducted in the Fota-Gumara catchment (211 km(2)), situated in the Lake Tana Basin. The investigation was based on the analysis of fallout radionuclides (137Cs and 210Pb-ex) tracers, which are able to discriminate between topsoil and subsoil. Target material consisted of sediment deposits collected during eight rainfall-runoff events, which occurred in the early and late rainy season of 2023. The activity of 137Cs and 210Pb was measured using gamma spectrometry, while the source apportionment was based on the implementation of Bayesian Models BMM and MixSIAR.ResultsOur findings confirmed that subsoil was the major source of sediment. Both models showed consistent results, indicating that approximately three-quarters of the sediment originates from subsoils, contributing a median average of 73% and 81% according to MixSIAR and BMM, respectively. Both the inter-event and seasonal variability of sediment source contributions were relatively low.ConclusionsWe conclude that gullies should be a land management priority. Additionally, we demonstrated the validity of using fallout radionuclides for tracing sediment sources in this region of tropical Africa.

This study presents the development of the GIS-based Topographic Solar Photosynthetically Active Radiation (T-sPAR) toolbox for Taylor Valley. It maps surface photosynthetically active radiation using four meteorological stations with similar to 20 years of data. T-sPAR estimates were validated with ground-truth data collected at Taylor Valley's major lakes during the 2014-15 and 2015-16 field seasons. The average daily error ranges from 0.13 mol photons m(-2) day(-1) (0.6%) at Lake Fryxell to 3.8 mol photons m(-2) day(-1) (5.8%) at Lake Hoare. We attribute error to variability in terrain and sun position. Finally, a user interface was developed in order to estimate total daily surface photosynthetically active radiation for any location and date within the basin. T-sPAR improves upon existing toolboxes and models by allowing for the inclusion of a statistical treatment of light attenuation due to cloud cover. The T-sPAR toolbox could be used to inform biological sampling sites based on radiation distribution, which could collectively improve estimates of net primary productivity, in some cases by up to 25%.

Sunday			Mass Harvesting, Ichthyofaunal Assemblages, and Ancestral Paiute Fishing in the North American Great Basin	AMERICAN ANTIQUITY												Documenting variability in the archaeological record is critical to our understanding human fishing adaptations in the North American Great Basin over time. Unfortunately, in the absence of robust middle range techniques for interpreting fishbone assemblages, many studies have been limited in their capacity to engage in theoretical discussions of the role of fishing in forager subsistence regimes. The Northern Paiute in Oregon and Nevada exploited seasonally aggregated tui chub (Siphateles bicolor) through mass-harvesting techniques using nets and baskets. This article integrates experimental studies with ethnographic and archaeological data to infer the types of fishing gear that were used from the reconstructed sizes of tui chub remains. The mean size of fish assemblages is compared to the coefficient of variation to identify fishing techniques based on the size parameters of gear types, and a technology investment model is used to assess regional variations in commitments to fishing in open lake and marshland settings. Results are compared to tui chub assemblages from two protohistoric archaeological sites in eastern Oregon, revealing two distinctive fishing strategies with general implications for the organization of labor by hunter-gatherer fisherfolk.					; Eiselt, Berniece/J-9474-2019	Eiselt, Berniece/0000-0003-2545-8512; 													0002-7316	2325-5064				OCT	2020	85	4					715	736	PII S0002731620000372	10.1017/aaq.2020.37	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/aaq.2020.37													WOS:000577624600007

Species comprising seven fishes (Malapterurus electricus, Clarias gariepinus, Tilapia zillii, Gnathonemus tamandua, Citharinus citharus, Oreochromis niloticus and Auchenoglanis occidentalis) and two edible snails (Bulinus globosus and Bulinus africanus) were analysed for ten heavy metals with known varying degrees of toxicities: arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn). Results showed that concentrations of As (4.76 mg kg(-1)), Cr (1.54 - 6.60 mg kg(-1)) and Hg (1.07 - 2.66 mg kg(-1)) were higher than the FAO/WHO safe limits. The calculated target hazard quotient and hazard index values, representing quantitative estimates of noncarcinogenic risk of dietary exposure from freshwater species consumption, were below 1 for all metals, which indicate that freshwater species pose no noncancer risk from oral exposure under the environmental conditions of the study. Further studies across spatiotemporal scale are recommended to understand impact of season-location variables on metal concentrations in those freshwater species examined.					; Okoye, Charles/AAZ-4484-2021	Okoye, Charles/0000-0002-6205-4886; 													2523-3963	2523-3971				OCT 1	2020	2	10							1754	10.1007/s42452-020-03576-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-03576-3													WOS:000575592000005

In this study, we conducted a water quantity and quality analysis for 11 months in 2018 and 2019 to evaluate the temporal contribution of groundwater to surface water at Osongji, a small lake located in Jeonju-si, Jeollabuk-do, Korea. Groundwater fluxes and groundwater and surface water levels were measured using seepage meters and a piezometer, respectively. On-site water quality parameters, cations, and anions for groundwater and surface water were analyzed. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes for groundwater, surface water, and rainwater were also analyzed. Groundwater influx did not correlate directly to precipitation, suggesting that it may be delayed after rainwater infiltration. Aqueous chemistry indicated that the hydrogeochemical characteristics of surface water were substantially affected by groundwater. The isotopic composition of surface water changed over time, indicating a different contribution of groundwater in different seasons. This study shows that water quantity and quality data can be used in combination to evaluate temporal changes in the groundwater contribution to surface water.					; Lee, Jeonghoon/E-8116-2010; Koh, Dong-Chan/N-4188-2015	Jeen, Sung-Wook/0000-0003-4686-9046; Lee, Jeonghoon/0000-0002-1256-4431; Koh, Dong-Chan/0000-0003-1731-0681														2073-4441				OCT	2020	12	10							2879	10.3390/w12102879	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w12102879													WOS:000585502400001

Habitat selection by adult walleye during spawning season in irrigation reservoirs: a patch occupancy modeling approach	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Recruitment of walleye (Sander vitreus Mitchill) is limited in irrigation reservoirs of the Republican River basin in southwestern Nebraska. The causal mechanism for this limited recruitment is unknown, but may be related to a lack of suitable spawning habitat. Patch occupancy models were developed to describe variation in detection probability and habitat selection during spawning season using shoreline electrofishing data. Detection of adult walleye was negatively affected by water temperature, silt substrate, and woody cover. Adult walleye selected sites with cooler water temperatures and greater fetch at Enders Reservoir, and large rock substrate and no cover at Hugh Butler Lake; these characteristics are limited to areas on or near the riprap dams in both reservoirs. Walleye eggs were also only found in these areas. We conclude that patch occupancy modeling provided valuable information when considering habitat improvement projects and propose a management approach for the addition of walleye spawning habitat in irrigation reservoirs.

The methodology of tactical models is a very useful tool comparison to those complex models requiring relatively large set of input parameters. In this study, a theoretical strategic model (TEGM) was adapted to the field data on the basis of a 24-year long monitoring database of phytoplankton in the Danube River at the station of God, Hungary (at 1669 river kilometer - hereafter referred to as "rkm"). The Danubian Phytoplankton Growth Model (DPGM) is able to describe the seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton biomass (mg L-1) based on daily temperature, but takes the availability of light into consideration as well. In order to improve fitting, the 24-year long database was split in two parts in accordance with environmental sustainability. The period of 1979-1990 has a higher level of nutrient excess compared with that of the 1991-2002. The authors assume that, in the above-mentioned periods, phytoplankton responded to temperature in two different ways, thus two submodels were developed, DPGM-sA and DPGM-sB. Observed and simulated data correlated quite well. Findings suggest that linear temperature rise brings drastic change to phytoplankton only in case of high nutrient load and it is mostly realized through the increase of yearly total biomass.

C. ossiani was the predominant form in western Lake Ontario in mid-June 1999 but was then replaced by C. pengoi-like animals otter the rest of the season. Mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed that these forms were genetically identical at the ND5 gene and that they are morphologically distinctive forms of C. pengoi. In 1999, Cercopagis reached a maximum abundance of 1,759 individuals/m(3) (average abundance = 281 individuals/m(3), average biomass = 5.2 mg/m(3)). In August, Cercopagis biomass was lowest at nearshore and embayment sites and highest at offshore sites. Body length of parthenogenetic females was lower at nearshore (1.16 mm) and embayment (1.19 mm) sites relative to offshore (1.32 mm) ones. Maximal clutch size of parthenogenetic females was 24 embryos per individual. Cercopagis has already spread to Lake Michigan and five Finger Lakes. Although waterfowl may disperse Cercopagis, these invasions likely resulted from human activities.

This study investigates the occurrence, transport, partitioning, and ecological risks of pesticides in the lake's dissolved phase (DP), suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sediment (SD) samples collected from 22 sites across different seasons. The results showed significant temporal variations across different media, with spatial variations driven by crop- related patterns. Atrazine, etridiazole, and cis-permethrin were identified as the most abundant pesticides in DP, SPM, and SD, respectively. Notably, the source-sink dynamics were not only driven by deposition and resuspension but influenced by multiple sources and hydrodynamic processes such as precipitation, phytoplankton biomass, organic carbon, and winds. Ecotoxicological assessments indicated that permethrin, endrin, and endosulfan sulfate posed significant ecological risks to aquatic organisms. Although human health risks from pesticides were low, ongoing monitoring of atrazine is recommended due to its extensive use around Dali City.

J	Mcewan, E; Stahl, T; Langridge, R; Davies, T; Howell, A; Wilson, M				Mcewan, Erin; Stahl, Timothy; Langridge, Rob; Davies, Tim; Howell, Andrew; Wilson, Matthew			Seismic hazard and shifting channels: Exploring coseismic river response	EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS												Large earthquakes can trigger cascading flood hazards that can influence societal risk and loss; however, the mechanisms driving coseismic river response (CRR) in seismogenic regions have not been fully characterized. This review synthesizes data from fifty-two global cases of CRR where surface deformation affected rivers and identifies the key physical and environmental parameters that control riverine flood hazard in earthquakes. We identify four primary CRR classes, ranging from channel-confined ponding to overbank flooding and avulsion, wherein a river shifts into an enduring new course within the floodplain. CRR susceptibility governs the likelihood, spatial extent, and longevity of CRR, and links back to the characteristics of the surface deformation, river planform, and host environmental setting. Dip-slip fault ruptures, with a large vertical separation at the surface capable of damming river channels, are the primary driver of CRR. Multi-meter dip-slip offsets are also linked to fault-block tilting, which reduce or reverse the gradients of overlying channels. These tilted fault blocks can induce coseismic flooding or avulsion away from the principal fault, with cases documented up c. 10 km upstream from the fault-river intersection. Lateral offsets can amplify or modulate CRR but are generally less effective than vertical offsets at causing them. Two-thirds of CRR cases occurred in single-thread rivers, the majority of which are meandering systems occupying intermontane or lowland basins. Liquefaction-prone substrates in these floodplains exacerbate CRR impacts through ground deformation that disrupts river channel profiles and the local water table. Overbank flooding, lake formation, and prolonged surface flooding are common outcomes near meandering channels and may occur away from the principal fault. Confined braided rivers with high width-to-depth ratios are more resistant to overbank flow and avulsion. In unconfined settings, erodible substrates, and low lateral bank stability amplify the potential for channel scour and rapid avulsion. Braided floodplains often host dense networks of paleochannels within their floodplain, and in any environment, paleochannels enhance the potential for, and geographic extent of flooding and avulsion. High discharge conditions elevate the potential for overbank flow and avulsion, and the hazard posed by CRR may be higher in regions where the climate is perennially or seasonally wet. The risk posed by CRR during earthquakes is heightened in areas where population expansion and land reclamation in flood and liquefaction-prone zones is commonplace. A method to assess CRR risk in advance is required, and a probabilistic framework incorporating uncertainties in fault behaviour, recurrence intervals, and flood-rating curves may offer a way to evaluate absolute hazard in areas where faults and rivers intersect. Site-specific hydrodynamic modelling can further quantify potential changes in flood patterns in high-hazard, high-exposure areas, paving the way for assessing societal and economic risks. We suggest the need is urgent in places such as India and Bangladesh's GangesBrahmaputra-Meghna delta. This densely populated region, home to similar to 150 million people, is underlain by a locked plate boundary and active faults. Historic earthquakes in the region suggest that future large seismic events could trigger widespread changes in flood hazard, exacerbating the existing risk posed by flooding.

Today LTCK is a glacial-fed lake that is relatively insensitive to changes in P-E because it is largely buffered from dry season draw-down through the year-round supply of glacial meltwater. This was not the case during the middle to late Holocene when glaciers were absent from the watershed. Lake-water delta O-18 values inferred from delta O-18 analysis of sediment cellulose range from - 12.9 to - 5.3 parts per thousand and average - 8.7 parts per thousand between 6.2 and 2.3 ka B.P. Modern lake-water delta O-18 from LTCK averages - 14.8 parts per thousand which is compatible with the delta O-18(lw) value of - 14.3 parts per thousand for the surface sediment cellulose. Analyses of delta O-18 from modern surface waters in 23 lakes that span the range from glacial-fed to closed basin vary from - 16.6 to - 2.5 parts per thousand. This approximates the magnitude of the down-core shift in delta O-18(lw) values in LTCK during the middle to late Holocene from - 12.9 to - 5.3 parts per thousand. Strong paleohydrologic change during the middle Holocene is also evident in diatom assemblages that consist of shallow-water, non-glacial periphytic taxa and bulk organic delta C-13 and delta N-15 that show increases likely resulting from degradation of lacustrine organic matter periodically exposed to subaerial conditions. Neoglaciation began after 2.3 ka B.P. as indicated by changes in the composition of the sediments, lower delta O-18 values, and a return to diatom assemblages characteristic of the glacial sediments that formed during the Late Pleistocene. Collectively, these data indicate that the past 2.3 ka B.P. have been the wettest interval during the Holocene. Millennial-scale shifts in the paleohydrologic record of LTCK during the early to middle Holocene conform to other regional paleoclimatic time-series, including Lake Titicaca and Nevado Sajama, and may be driven by insolation and resultant changes in atmospheric circulation and moisture supply. In contrast, an apparent 1200-year lag in the onset of wetter conditions at LTCK (2.3 ka B.P.) compared to Lake Titicaca (3.5 ka B.P.) provides evidence for variable sub-regional hydrologic response to climate change during the middle to late Holocene.

Genetic structure of introduced European fallow deer (Dama dama dama) in Tasmania, Australia	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH												European fallow deer are an introduced species classified as partly protected wildlife in Tasmania, Australia. Current management practices are primarily governed under the Quality Deer Management regime, in which animals are harvested during designated hunting seasons. Among populations, prominent morphological differences have been reported; however, the genetic relationship of these populations has until now been poorly understood. Representative animals were sampled from three key areas across their range and genotyped at ten polymorphic microsatellite loci to investigate genetic diversity, population structure, and genetic bottlenecks. Allelic richness was low in all three populations and ranged between 2.20 and 2.49 alleles/locus. A genetic bottleneck was detected in two of the three populations (P < 0.001). Population differentiation was evident between Lake Echo and Benham (q = 0.122; P < 0.001) and Benham and Connorville (q = 0.110; P < 0.001), but not between Lake Echo and Connorville (q = 0.0235), with individuals being identified as belonging to two genetic clusters. The pattern of population differentiation from the three study populations suggests that deer from the western region of their range are genetically distinct to those from the eastern region. This correlates with morphological variation within Tasmanian fallow deer, in which differences between the regions maybe attributable to geographical barriers.

Methods and Study Design: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration was measured in 209 Maori (aged 80-90 years) and 357 non-Maori (85 years), along with demographic, lifestyle, supplement use and other health data. Results: Mean [95% CI] 25(OH)D concentration was 69 [67 to 72] nmol/L, with 15% >100 nmol/L and 6 individuals >150 nmol/L. Concentrations in Maori (59 [55 to 62] 4 nmol/L) were lower than in non-Maori (75 [72 to 78] nmol/L; p<0.001), a difference maintained when adjusted for day-of-year measured. Vitamin D supplementation was reported by 98 participants (18%): including a greater proportion of women (24%) than men (11%; p<0.001) and of non-Maori (24%) than Maori (7%; p<0.001). Of those taking vitamin D, 49% took high oral doses (>= 25 mu g/day or equivalent) and five individuals took >50 mu g/day. Vitamin D supplement use strongly and independently predicted seasonally-adjusted 25(OH)D concentration and was associated with 28 nmol/L higher levels than non-use. Other predictors included Maori ethnicity (10 nmol/L lower concentration than for non-Maori), and female gender (11 nmol/L lower). Conclusions: Vitamin D status in New Zealand octogenarians appears higher than previously reported, particularly in non-Maori compared to Maori. Prescribed and non-prescribed oral vitamin D supplementation is prevalent in this group and a strong indicator of vitamin D status.

J	Cirhuza, DM; Plisnier, PD				Cirhuza, Deo Mushagalusa; Plisnier, Pierre-Denis			Composition and seasonal variations in abundance of Copepod (Crustacea) populations from the northern part of Lake Tanganyika	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Copepod has an important ecological role as a main food of several fishes on which commercial fisheries are based in Lake Tanganyika. However, very little multi-annual monitoring programs have been conducted for this group of crustacean zooplankton. This study was conducted in the northern part of Lake Tanganyika by weekly sampling at both pelagic and littoral sites over three consecutive years (2012-2014). The analyzed samples showed that Lake Tanganyika copepod was essentially composed of three suborders including Calanoida (30% by number) with a single endemic species, Cyclopoida (69%) with four dominant species and Harpacticoida (1%). These taxa showed variations in their abundance respectively at pelagic and littoral sampling sites. The average densities of copepods did slightly vary during the sampling period in both areas although higher peaks were observed in 2013. For the post-nauplii stage, Tropocyclops tenellus predominated while the nauplii of T. simplex predominated at both sampling sites. Seasonal fluctuations of copepod densities showed higher peaks in September/October and April/May, respectively, for the three most common species. T. simplex and M. aequatorialis ovigerous females showed higher peaks in the rainy season in 2013. These results can benefit pelagic fisheries research and lake environmental management efforts as the copepod abundance seems to be closely correlated to that of sardines in Lake Tanganyika.

Variation of physico-chemical parameters along a river transect through the Okavango Delta, Botswana	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The Okavango Delta depends on water quantity and quality to sustain its ecosystem services. Whereas many studies have been carried out on its hydrology, few have been done on water quality in the delta. Water pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were monitored at 10 sites along the Okavango-Boro-Thamalakane-Lake Ngami system almost fortnightly from June 2008 to June 2010. Water quality in the delta was generally good, despite high evapotranspiration rates which would normally produce very saline waters. Electrical conductivity and water temperature increased with distance from Mohembo to Lake Ngami, the former most likely due to evapoconcentration. In contrast, pH, DO, turbidity and TSS decreased with distance from Mohembo to Boro at the lower end of the seasonal floodplain, before increasing again to Lake Ngami. Dissolved oxygen and TSS most likely declined due to biological uptake and particle sedimentation, respectively. Strong and significant relationships were observed between TSS and turbidity and between DOC and EC, indicating that turbidity and EC could be useful proxies for routine estimations of TSS and DOC, respectively, in the delta.

Multivariate statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis (CA) and discriminant analysis (DA), as well as Water Pollution Index (WPI) and Daniel Trend Test method were applied to evaluate the temporal and spatial variations of water quality data sets for Qiandao Lake reservoir, obtained between 2002 and 2013 from 12 monitoring sites. The results of Daniel Trend Test showed that most of the parameters were increased (Rs>0), among which ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen and chlorophyll-a presented significant upward trends (Rs>Wp). The WPI of total nitrogen was highest among all the parameters, followed by total phosphorus, and ammonia nitrogen was the lowest. Seasonal DA identified four parameters (pH, permanganate index, dissolved oxygen and total nitrogen) as the most significant parameters accounting for the temporal variations in water quality. Hierarchical CA grouped the 12 monitoring sites into four clusters based on the similarities in water quality characteristics. Spatial DA identified four parameters (secchi disc depth, chlorophyll-a, total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen) as the significant discriminating parameters in space. These results could assist planners and managers to develop optimal strategies for reservoir water resources protection and management.

We also investigated the potential to predict optimal sampling in advance based on air temperature. The larval data used in the study were collected in the northernmost part of the Baltic Sea during 1979-2011. The analyses of the optimum time for sampling showed a sharp peak associated with a huge variation in density for larvae sizes similar to 15 mm length. Larvae sizes in the range 20-30 mm had intermediate densities with relatively low variance, while the densities of larger larvae declined with an increase in the relative precision. The 20-30 mm range was identified as a reliable size window for sampling, and the best predictor of larvae size was the temperature sum, using offshore air temperatures starting at 26 April. The between-year variance of the larvae mean sizes in the size range 20-30 mm was on the average 64% higher for fixed date sampling compared with fixed temperature sum sampling. The optimum sampling time was identified to the date when reaching 270 degrees C d for the southern, and 335 degrees C d for the northern locations. These temperature sums were generally reached in the first 2 weeks of June, but some years as late as the last week in June. Confidence intervals from a negative binomial distribution should be used rather than intervals based on the normal distribution due to the skewed sampling distributions. Bootstrap analyses showed that 10-30 replicates may give sufficient precision to detect significant changes in sea-spawning whitefish larval densities. Revisiting the same areas during the larval growth season (time window) did not improve the precision significantly.																			1054-3139	1095-9289				JAN-FEB	2016	73	2					374	383		10.1093/icesjms/fsv178	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsv178													WOS:000371141600019
B	Melack, JM; MacIntyre, S		Schagerl, M		Melack, John M.; MacIntyre, Sally			Morphometry and Physical Processes of East African Soda Lakes	SODA LAKES OF EAST AFRICA												The altitudes of the saline lakes in the East African Rift System (EARS) vary from below sea level in the Danakil Depression (-155 m) to 2000 m in the Ethiopian highlands; most lakes are located above 1000 m. These lakes are among the largest (Turkana) and deepest (Shala) saline lakes in the world, though many formed by volcanism or lahars are small. High concentrations of phytoplankton or suspended sediments lead to high light attenuation, with Secchi visibilities usually less than 1 m. In the shallow, saline lake strong stratification usually develops during the day with mixing to the bottom at night. Seasonal variations in stratification and mixing have been observed in the deep lakes. Topography alters winds and mixing in lakes within volcanic craters. Chemically stratified, saline lakes occur throughout the EARS, and meromixis was documented in Lake Sonachi. Seasonal variations in thermal stratification and horizontal and vertical gradients in salinity occur in Lake Turkana. Only brief visits, occasional year-round studies and long lapses in the study of soda lakes of the EARS leave large gaps in our understanding of temporal variations in their limnology and their responses to climatic and human-caused changes in their hydrology.																					978-3-319-28622-8; 978-3-319-28620-4				2016							61	76		10.1007/978-3-319-28622-8_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-28622-8_3	10.1007/978-3-319-28622-8												WOS:000399606500004

In this study, temporal and vertical fluctuations of underwater light climate, thermal and chemical characteristics of the soda lake Lake Shala were studied using data collected on 11 occasions over an annual cycle. Measured parameters of underwater light climate depicted light-limited conditions with slight temporal variations, which are attributable to non-biological turbidity and high water column mixing depth. Its water column exhibited superficial thermal stratification with turbulently mixing and well-oxygenated conditions. Alkalinity, pH and conductivity were high but exhibited small temporal and vertical variations. These parameters increased slightly during the rainy season, possibly due to saline inflows associated with precipitation. Most of the major algal nutrients showed small temporal and vertical variations. NO3 (-) and NH3 in the euphotic zone were often very low or undetectable, while soluble reactive phosphate and total phosphorus were very high throughout the study period. The concentration of SiO2 was remarkably low, which was probably associated with biological uptake and some chemical processes within the lake. In general, physicochemical parameters of Lake Shala exhibited small temporal and vertical variations despite the current threat of environmental degradation, possibly because of the high resilience of the lake associated with its low productivity and voluminous nature.

P. anatolicus is also endangered and endemic species from Turkey. In this study, concentrations of Cd, Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were determined in muscle tissue of these fish by using atomic absorption spectrometer. Levels of metals in the muscle tissue of all the fish specimens were compared with results of previous studies, the tolerance levels of national and international guidelines and the levels of Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake (PTWI) limits set by FAO/WHO. Concentrations of Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb in the muscle tissue of all the fish specimens from Sugla and Beysehir Lakes exceeded the tolerance levels of national and international guidelines. However, concentrations of Cd, Fe, Pb and Zn were below PTWI limits. Therefore, in terms of these metal levels, consumption of fresh fillet of examined seven fish species (weekly up to about 0.3 kg/person) doesn't seem to be objectionable for human health.

Understanding dynamics change in wetlands may benefit from a joint variation analysis in changes of size, shape, position and extent of water bodies. In this study, we used Cosmo-Skymed ScanSAR mode (HH) data for one-year monitoring of seasonal changes in the water surface areas of Poyang Lake from January 2014 to December 2014. To delinate water surface area, a histogram analysis with a global threshold classification was performed, and the results were validated using Landsat8 OLI data. The results showed: Poyang Lake water body area showed a significant seasonal variation, minimum value was about 690 km2 and maximum value reached 3500 km2. A unique spatial pattern occurred during those months that a dramatic flooding or recession happened. The Cosmo-Skymed time series could capture temporal changes in the water body spatial distribution. Comparison of the resultant classification of Cosmo-Skymed and Landsat8 OLI yielded 95% of mapping accuracy and 87% of puduct accuracy. This demonstrates the X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar is applicable to detect the wetland inundation area and there is a great potential of Cosmo-Skymed constellation for water bodies monitoring, regarding relative great revisit frequency and high resolution.

We present comparative biogeochemistry (water chemistry, stable isotopes, and picoplankton) for a coastal lake (Lake Madre de Dios), a volcanic lake (Lake Barva), and a glacial lake (Lake Ditkevi). Sampling was conducted between February and November 2022, including dry and rainy seasonal conditions. Hydrological and chemical conditions were evaluated using water and carbon stable isotopes, dissolved organic matter, major ions, and microbiota analysis. Isotopic data on water (delta 2H and delta 18O) and dissolved inorganic carbon (delta 13CDIC) confirmed lower evaporative losses for the maar and tarn lakes and productivity response to precipitation inputs. Excitation/emission matrices confirmed the prevalence of fulvic and humic acids in the coastal and glacial lakes, mainly aromatic proteins and soluble microbial byproducts in the volcanic lake. Picophytoplankton (PPP, similar to 0.2-10 mu m) was mainly represented by phycocyanin-rich picocyanobacteria in the 3 lakes, but maar and tarn lakes had greater representation of phycoerythrin-rich picocyanobacteria. We confirmed fluctuations in PPP cell abundance in the lakes was lower than in comparable temperate lakes. For other eutrophic lakes, abundance of picocyanobacteria dominated over picoeukaryotic algae. This work aimed to promote an ecosystem approach to study the biogeochemical functioning of tropical lakes using a combination of chemical, hydrological, and biological data and to provide baseline information for future studies (e.g., climate change and pollution impacts) on tropical lakes of Costa Rica.

Sulfate-Reducing and Sulfur-Oxidizing Bacterial Activity in the Coastal Waters of Arabian Sea During Post Upwelling Season	GEOMICROBIOLOGY JOURNAL												The synergistic existence of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and colorless sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (CSOB) involved in nutrient turnover is sparsely documented in coastal waters. To understand the processes mediated by these physiological groups we proposed to analyze their abundance and activities and the extent of interaction with various environmental parameters. Therefore, water samples were collected during post upwelling phase off Calicut and Kochi in August 2008. Stations at 30 m, 50 m, 100 m water depths were considered as nearshore, and those at 300 m and 500 m were considered as offshore. Maximum sulfate-reducing activity (SRA) of 86 nM d(-1)was in the nearshore surface waters of Kochi and 30 nM d(-1)in offshore bottom waters of Calicut. In these waters, SRA was dictated by total suspended load and phaeophytin, respectively. Maximum number of CSOB of 1.76 x 10(6)cells l(-1)was detected in the surface waters of both the stations. At both nearshore and offshore waters of Kochi and Calicut, CSOB related to the sulfur-oxidizing activity (SOA) which ranged from 3 to 577 mu M d(-1)and 3 to 223 mu M d(-1), respectively. This paper elucidates the coupling between SRB and CSOB and their contribution towards nutrient regeneration and restoration of homeostasis during the waning phase of upwelling in these coastal waters.																			0149-0451	1521-0529				FEB 1	2021	38	2					150	163		10.1080/01490451.2020.1818894	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2020.1818894		SEP 2020											WOS:000572201900001

Ambient air samples were, collected once every 12 days at a single sampling site in Concord, CA, from June to November 2000, using a modified high-volume air-sampling device equipped with glass fiber filters and polyurethane foam. Concentrations of total PAHs and PCBs ranged from 5.7 to 56 and 0.17 to 0.32 ng/m(3), respectively. PAHs and PCBs in the ambient air were predominantly in the vapor phase (83-99%). Gaseous fluxes of PAHs in the estuary showed high seasonal variation, ranging from 110 ng(.)m(-2.)day(-1) efflux in August to 1050 ng(.)m(-2.)day(-1): influx in November. Gaseous PCBs showed consistent net, volatilization (2.2-24 ng(.)m(-2.)day(-1)) for this period. Particle settling contributed estimated net deposition fluxes of 45-960 ng(.)m(-2.)day(-1) for PAHs and 0.39-2.1 ng(.)m(-2.)day(-1) for PCBs. Combining these fluxes, PAHs were either deposited to or lost from the Estuary via the atmosphere, depending on the month. In contrast, there consistently was net emission of PCBs from the estuary to the atmosphere.																			0013-936X	1520-5851				NOV 15	2002	36	22					4741	4747		10.1021/es011470b	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es011470b								12487294					WOS:000179348500006

Six different types of habitats, four from natural forest (ground water forest, riverine forest, deciduous bushland, Lake Abaya shore) and two from farmlands (maize plantation and cotton plantation) were randomly selected. Sixteen species of small mammals (fourteen rodent and two shrew species) were recorded from the study area. The trapped small mammals with the per cent composition were Mastomys natalensis (32.9%), Arvicanthis dembeensis (30.6%), Acomys cahirinus (10.3%), Lemniscomys striatus (8.3%), Mastomys erythroleucus (5.7%), Tatera robusta (3.4%), Arvicanthis niloticus (2.9%), Stenocephalemys albipes (2.1%), Grammomys dolichurus (1.3%), Mus musculus (1.3%), Mus tenellus (0.3%), Crocidura flavescens (0.6%) and Crocidura fumosa (0.3%). The distribution of species varied from habitat to habitat and the population from season to season. Eleven and seven rodent species were trapped from natural habitats and farmlands respectively.

J	Madenjian, CP; Cochran, PA; Bergstedt, RA				Madenjian, CP; Cochran, PA; Bergstedt, RA			Seasonal patterns in growth, blood consumption, and effects on hosts by parasitic-phase sea lampreys in the Great Lakes: An individual-based model approach	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												An individual-based model (IBM) was developed for sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) populations in the Laurentian Great Lakes. The IBM was then calibrated to observed growth, by season, for sea lampreys in northern Lake Huron under two different water temperature regimes: a regime experienced by Seneca-strain lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and a regime experienced by Marquette-strain lake trout. Modeling results indicated that seasonal blood consumption under the Seneca regime was very similar to that under the Marquette regime. Simulated mortality of lake trout directly due to blood removal by sea lampreys occurred at nearly twice the rate during August and September under the Marquette regime than under the Seneca regime. However, cumulative sea lamprey-induced mortality on lake trout over the entire duration of the sea lamprey's parasitic phase was only 7% higher for the Marquette regime compared with the Seneca regime. Thus, these modeling results indicated that the strain composition of the host (lake trout) population was not important in determining total number of lake trout deaths or total blood consumption attributable to the sea lamprey population, given the sea lamprey growth pattern. Regardless of water temperature regime, both blood consumption rate by sea lampreys and rate of sea lamprey-induced mortality on lake trout peaked in late October. Elevated blood consumption in late October appeared to be unrelated to changes in water temperature. The IBM approach should prove useful in optimizing control of sea lampreys in the Laurentian Great Lakes.																			0380-1330						2003	29			1			332	346		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70498-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70498-5													WOS:000221321300025

The results show a notable hydrological rhythm of water level alternation between dry and flood seasons in Huayang Lakes, with an average water level of 12.82 m and a monthly range of 11.21-17.24 m. Since 2017, the water level of Huayang Rivers has shown a decreasing trend of -0.02 m/a. Total phosphorus (TP) has become the primary pollutant. The TP concentrations in Longgan Lake (the largest lake) during the dry, rising, flood, and retreating seasons from 2015 to 2023 were 0.083, 0.061, 0.050, and 0.059 mg/L, respectively. The effect of water level on TP was mainly observed during the low-water period. When the water level in the dry season rose to 12.25 and 13.00 m, the percentage of TP exceeding 0.1 mg/L in Longgan Lake decreased to 55.8% and 33.3%, respectively. During the dry season, wind and wave disturbances caused the release of endogenous phosphorus in Huayang Lakes. This led to drastic fluctuations in TP concentration, reducing the correlation between water level and TP. When external control is limited, the water level during the dry season should be maintained between 12.25 and 13.0 m. Additionally, it is necessary to accelerate the restoration of submerged macrophyte species (such as Hydrilla verticillata and Vallisneria natans) in the Huayang Rivers.																			1009-637X	1861-9568				JAN	2025	35	1			SI		173	188		10.1007/s11442-025-2317-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11442-025-2317-4													WOS:001396235300009

Thad			Nitrogen fixation may not alleviate stoichiometric imbalances that limit primary production in eutrophic lake ecosystems	ECOLOGY												Ecosystem-scale primary production may be proximately limited by nitrogen (N) but ultimately limited by phosphorus (P) because N2 fixation contributes new N that accumulates relative to P at ecosystem scales. However, the duration needed to transition between proximate N limitation and ultimate P limitation remains unknown for most ecosystems, including lakes. Here we present the results of a fully replicated, multi-annual lake mesocosm experiment that permitted full air-water-sediment interactions that mimicked lake ecosystem ecology. We manipulated N supply relative to P to achieve a gradient of N:P stoichiometry. Despite N2 fixation contributing as much as 80% of reactive N in the low N treatments, phytoplankton biomass in these treatments was not different from the unfertilized controls. This suggests that primary production remained N limited in the lowest N treatments, even when N2 fixation was substantial. Although fixed N inputs reduced the N imbalance relative to P in the low N treatments seasonally, fixed N did not accumulate over multiple years. Additionally, reactive N did not readily accumulate in the high N treatments. Instead, water column stoichiometry was proportional to the experimental N and P additions, suggesting a strong influence from external nutrient loading. Thus, we found no evidence that N accumulation from N2 fixation was sufficient to trigger a transition to ultimate P limitation seasonally or across our 3-year experiment. Rather, our results indicate that proximate N limitation perpetuates in eutrophic lakes, likely due to N export being proportional to its inputs. These findings offer new insight regarding the biogeochemical controls on ecosystem stoichiometry and their influence on the timeframe for proximate N limitation and ultimate P limitation in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems.

Canada has diverse and vast landscapes and stressors that impact various waterbodies differentially, with influencing factors including contaminant and nutrient loads from human activity (mining effluent, wastewater, agricultural runoff, plastics), landscape change (wetland drainage, urbanization), and climate change (warming water temperatures, longer open water seasons, extreme hydrological events, intensifying wildfires). Canadian rivers are especially important to the overall biogeochemistry, hydrology, biodiversity, and ultimate health of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. While each of Canada's provinces and territories has extensive river water quality (physical, chemical, biotic) data and monitoring programs; Environment and Climate Change Canada coordinates various national programs that contribute to the collection and consolidation of these data and conducts extensive research into the study and modeling of key river water quality processes. Despite program-specific efforts, there remains poor capacity to predict current and future conditions in monitored and unmonitored Canadian rivers, particularly remote or northern rivers, due to a myriad of factors including lack of coordination among groups and examination of areas in which modeling efforts might be integrated. Herein, we review and analyze the current state of data availability, process studies, and modeling systems for Canadian river water quality. Our synthesis reveals that specific physical processes (water temperature, ice formation, permafrost thaw, sediment dynamics), biogeochemical processes (dissolved oxygen, dissolved organic matter, nutrient cycling, metals/contaminants), and ecological/biological features (biota mass, functional indicators) are well understood, though complex, and are amenable to empirical or mechanistic modeling. Review of this information assists us in identifying opportunities and challenges for developing a national water quality modeling system, that would eventually include similar modeling activities for parallel processes in lakes and integrated watersheds. We identify needs for stronger coordination of monitoring programs in remote areas, recommend use of novel remote sensing technologies, and development of a flexible, iterative "process" for integrated modeling to which stakeholders beyond government can contribute. Such a platform would support short- and long-term predictive models of Canadian water quality and ecosystem health, inform effluent concentration limits, and be an early warning system for source waters.

Seasonal Shifts in Trophic Interaction Strength Drive Stability of Natural Food Webs	ECOLOGY LETTERS												It remains challenging to understand why natural food webs are remarkably stable despite highly variable environmental factors and population densities. We investigated the dynamics in the structure and stability of Lake Constance's pelagic food web using 7 years of high-frequency observations of biomasses and production, leading to 59 seasonally resolved quantitative food web descriptions. We assessed the dynamics in asymptotic food web stability through maximum loop weight, which revealed underlying stability mechanisms. Maximum loop weight showed a recurrent seasonal pattern with a consistently high stability despite pronounced dynamics in biomasses, fluxes and productivity. This stability resulted from seasonal rewiring of the food web, driven by energetic constraints within loops and their embedding into food web structure. The stabilising restructuring emerged from counter-acting effects of metabolic activity and competitiveness/susceptibility to predation within a diverse grazer community on loop weight. This underscores the role of functional diversity in promoting food web stability.

Integrating acoustic telemetry research into management: successes and challenges in the Laurentian Great Lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												In the Laurentian Great Lakes, the application of acoustic telemetry to track fish movements has evolved into an important part of multijurisdictional management. Nevertheless, barriers remain in translating telemetry research into management or conservation actions. Here, we synthesize acoustic telemetry literature within the Great Lakes basin to explore factors that have contributed to successes and failures of integrating research with the needs of decision-making processes. Collaboration between researchers and managers, facilitated by consistent opportunities for stakeholder engagement, stood out as one of the most effective means of integration. For example, 79% (95 of 127) of articles published (up to 2023) included co-authorship by both government and academic organizations. Case studies on lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), walleye (Sander vitreus), and sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) further highlight how telemetry has informed management through collaborative engagement among researchers, stakeholders, and managers, as well as ongoing challenges. By exploring facets of acoustic telemetry research and connections to conservation and fisheries concerns, we identify pathways to reduce knowledge-action gaps widely applicable within and outside of the Great Lakes.

This study aimed to elucidate the physiological, metabolic and molecular mechanisms at different overwintering temperatures (4 degrees C, 6 degrees C, 4 degrees C -> 6 degrees C -> 8 degrees C, 6 degrees C -> 8 degrees C) by cellular growth, photosynthetic effect, metabolic products, enzyme activities and transcriptomic analysis. Elevated overwinter temperatures (4 degrees C -> 6 degrees C -> 8 degrees C, 6 degrees C -> 8 degrees C) significantly promoted the growth of M. aeruginosa. Photosynthetic activity responded rapidly, reaching its peak at the 9 degrees C-16 degrees C temperature range. Elevated overwinter temperatures also enhanced the secretion of microcystins and extracellular polymeric substances. These temperatures favoured the expression of rbcL and mcyB genes associated with photosynthetic and microcystin production, with significant activation of RuBisCO and FBA enzymes during recruitment. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed 321 genes with significant differential expression under elevated overwinter temperatures, including 156 up-regulated and 165 down-regulated genes. The interaction network highlighted proteins with the highest connectivity, comprising ribosomal proteins and RNA polymerase proteins, triggering processes related to oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis. This study sheds light on the intricate interplay of temperatures with the physiological and molecular dynamics of M. aeruginosa during overwintering, offering valuable insights into the effects of global warming on algae growth in the future.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2025	70	1							e14370	10.1111/fwb.14370	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14370													WOS:001384514900001

The Kisielina River is a right-site tributary of the Vistula River, with a length of 42.34 km. During two-season studies conducted in 2023, the waters of Kisielina were characterized by neutral or slightly acidic pH and low to medium values of conductivity. A total of 600 diatom taxa were identified at 7 sites along the river's course, 44 of which were classified as dominant species. At most sites, the water was characterized by moderate ecological status (Class III) based on the SPI and GDI indices. In September, the index values slightly deteriorated (poor ecological status, Class IV), especially in the upper and near-mouth sections. The trophic index at most sites indicated eutrophic conditions. In Kisielina, alkaliphilous and pH-neutral diatoms dominated, as well as beta- and alpha-mesosaprobous species (Class II and III) and eutrophic or wide-spectrum trophic species (oligo- to eutraphentic).																			2299-8993						2025	26	1					308	321		10.12911/22998993/195358	http://dx.doi.org/10.12911/22998993/195358													WOS:001364537200006

This study examined the spatiotemporal variations in phytoplankton diversity, community structure, and abundance in response to changing environmental conditions from February to September 2020. Key physicochemical parameters, including water transparency, pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, chlorophyll a, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), silicate, and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), were measured. The phytoplankton community was dominated by eight phyla, with Cyanobacteria (50%), Chlorophyta (28.05%), and Bacillariophyta (14.63%) being the most prevalent. The most common cyanobacteria species identified were Microcystis aeruginosa and Dolichospermum flosaquae. Phytoplankton abundance ranged from 45 to 4900 individuals/mL, peaking in July. Shannon-Weaver diversity indices varied from 1.1 to 4.2, with an average of 1.9, indicating moderate pollution levels in the Winam Gulf. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that significant shifts in the phytoplankton community were statistically correlated with water quality variables, notably NH4+-N, temperature, transparency, and DO. NH4+-N was identified as the key limiting factor for cyanobacterial abundance in the gulf. The dominance of Cyanobacteria, along with their seasonal fluctuations influenced by major environmental factors, underscores the complexity of this lake ecosystem. These findings emphasize the urgent need for continued efforts to mitigate adverse impacts and improve the overall health of this aquatic environment.					; Li, Yuelin/GSM-7921-2022	Suba, Vincent Ochieng/0009-0009-1058-8120; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2025	87	1							4	10.1007/s00027-024-01130-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-024-01130-6													WOS:001338492600001

This study investigated how seasonal water level fluctuations influence EMF and their relationships with soil bacterial communities through a two-year field survey. We found that soil bacterial diversity was significantly positively correlated with EMF. Rising water levels decreased soil bacterial diversity and EMF; neutral model analysis showed that the contribution of stochastic processes in bacterial community assembly decreased during the flood period. Structural equation modeling revealed that soil moisture and pH were the primary factors influencing EMF during the dry period, while soil pH, bacterial diversity, and water depth were the main factors affecting EMF during the flood period. Our study highlights that the dry-wet transitions caused by water level fluctuations lead to distinct seasonal driving patterns of EMF. This study provides a data reference for studying the ecological effects of water level fluctuations and wetland management.

Characterizing spatial patterns among freshwater fishes and shrimps of the Poso River (Sulawesi, Indonesia) using DNA barcoding	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Fish biodiversity assessments are vital for understanding threats and aquatic ecosystem health. In the Poso River, Central Sulawesi, changes in biodiversity are influenced by habitat alteration, non-native species, and overfishing. This study evaluates fish and crustacean biodiversity in the Poso River system to address these challenges for improving fisheries management, conservation, and fish passage integration into hydropower development. The present biodiversity study utilized a comprehensive methodology that encompassed both traditional taxonomic approaches and DNA barcoding, specifically targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit-1 (COI) gene for accurate species identification and spatial boundary validation. The survey was conducted in the upstream, hydropower area and downstream areas of the river. We found 27 species of fish in the Poso River, including both native (e.g., Anguilla celebesensis, Oryzias nebulosus, Rhyacichthys aspro) and non-native species (e.g., Melanochromis auratus, Amphilophus trimaculatus, Oreochromis niloticus). Two International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red listed endangered species were also observed (e.g., Adrianichthys poptae and Mugilogobius sarasinorum). DNA barcoding was performed to examine species spatial boundaries. The fish population in the Poso River was dominated by non-native species, accounting for 85.70% of the total population. The upstream reaches had the highest fish abundance and diversity, while the downstream reaches had the lowest. There was, however, no significant difference in species richness and diversity across different locations and seasons. The dominance of non-native species in the Poso River necessitates the improvement of existing fishways within the hydropower dams potentially through the development of selective technology that can block the distribution of these non-native species. This research highlights the critical issue of non-native species proliferation and the potential threat they pose to native fish populations, providing valuable insights for conservation and management efforts in Indonesia and similar ecosystems worldwide.					; Kurniawan, Kurniawan/JMR-1691-2023; Ginanjar, Rendy/JCO-3806-2023; Prakoso, Vitas Atmadi/OJT-9560-2025; Robinson, Wayne/MVW-2156-2025; Baumgartner, Lee/P-2035-2015	ROBINSON, WAYNE/0000-0002-8793-7466; Prakoso, Vitas Atmadi/0000-0003-0690-2542; Kurniawan, Kurniawan/0000-0001-9365-0165; Baumgartner, Lee/0000-0002-1237-5163													1015-1621	1420-9055				JAN	2025	87	1							2	10.1007/s00027-024-01128-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-024-01128-0													WOS:001332097000002

Although known to inhabit prairie landscapes, few studies have examined habitat selection of raccoons within these environs and relationships between landscape structure and habitat selection are poorly understood in prairie systems. We monitored 64 radio-marked raccoons on a prairie landscape in Mississippi during 1997-2001. We subsequently used space use estimates to generate predictive models of habitat use. Probability of use by raccoons increased with increasing patch size of rowerops and forested areas and proximity to available water sources (lakes, streams). Space use also was positively related to increasing amounts of edge associated with rowcrop fields and forested habitat patches. Our findings suggest that in prairie landscapes, rowcrop fields providing quality forages, water sources and riparian forests and woodlots greatly influence space use, attributable to life history and ecological strategies satisfied by these landscape features.					; Burger, L./AAR-6767-2020	Burger, Jr., L.

Diatom assemblages and their relationships to lakewater nitrogen levels and other limnological variables from 36 lakes and ponds on Banks Island, NWT, Canadian Arctic	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Banks Island, in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, has been identified as an important reference site for studies of environmental change, especially as it relates to climatic warming. The island is logistically manageable (i.e. researchers can survey the entire island in one field season) and, most importantly, spans three major ecoclimatic regions supporting a diverse and large bird and mammal population. Developing upon earlier work by the authors describing the limnology of Banks Island, this current study: (1) examines which physical and chemical limnological variables influence diatom assemblages in this relatively lush island; and (2) explores variations in the diatom assemblages by ecoclimatic zones. The relationship between diatom taxa from a 36 lake/pond surface sediment calibration set and a suite of limnological variables was explored using multivariate statistics. Dominant diatom species varied based on changing limnological characteristics, particularly between the colder, ultra-oligotrophic lakes in the more northern High Arctic regions compared to the warmer, more nitrogen-rich sites in the Low Arctic regions of Banks Island. Exploration of diatom ecoclimatic and environmental preferences revealed interesting relationships, including the development of a diatom-based transfer function that could be used to track overall trends on lakewater nitrogen concentrations, which may enable future paleolimnological studies to track shifts in nutrient levels and climatic, and other environmental changes.					; Smol, John/A-8838-2015	Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				JUL	2007	586						191	211		10.1007/s10750-007-0623-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-0623-8													WOS:000246612800016

Results showed uneven distribution of the 99.7th percentile hourly extreme precipitation threshold, with lower thresholds along the Yangtze River valley and higher thresholds in the Daba Mountains and Wuling Mountains. Both hourly extreme precipitation amount (HEPA) and intensity (HEPI) exhibited higher values in surrounding areas and lower values in the center, with the western, northeast, and southeastern regions experiencing the highest values. Spatial distribution of hourly extreme precipitation frequency varied, with higher frequencies in the northwestern and southern parts of Chongqing. Interannually, hourly extreme precipitation amount slightly increased, while intensity fluctuated. Monthly peak values for amount, frequency, and intensity occurred in July or August, and on a daily scale, the periods from 03:00 to 07:00 and 17:00 to 21: 00 exhibited higher values for amount and frequency, while the period from 11 :00 to 16:00 showed lower values. In summary, the study provided insights into the spatial and temporal patterns of hourly extreme precipitation events in Chongqing and its sub-regions during the warm season, highlighting variations in thresholds, distribution, and trends over the studied period.																			1947-5705	1947-5713				DEC 31	2024	15	1							2278893	10.1080/19475705.2023.2278893	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19475705.2023.2278893													WOS:001196056500001

However, the effects of nutrient emission reduction and hydrological conditions on the levels and spatiotemporal distribution patterns of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in lake bays remained insufficiently understood. In this study, a dynamic model was developed to track nutrient transport processes from source areas to rivers and lake bays, and applied it to Zhushan Bay and its upstream region in the Taihu Basin, China. Hydro-chemical analysis results indicated that during the wet season, the total nitrogen (TN) concentration (1.64 mg center dot L-1) in the river inflow section was higher than that in the lake bay (1.48 mg center dot L-1), while total phosphorus (TP) (0.24 mg center dot L-1) was lower than in the lake bay (0.30 mg center dot L-1). The model results showed that in 2020, domestic sewage sources (38.24 %) and surface sources from cultivated land (33.14 %) were the primary contributors of fluvial TN, while livestock and poultry breeding sources (59.37 %) were the main sources of fluvial TP. Scenario simulations indicated that a 30 % reduction in nutrient emissions led to a corresponding decrease in TN and TP loads in the lake bays, with more significant reductions observed during the dry season (TN: 3.05 %; TP: 9.51 %). A 12 % reduction in river discharge during the dry season resulted in a corresponding decrease in TN and TP loads in the lake bays, with the reduction in TP (1.81 %) greater than that of TN (1.39 %). This study offered insights into nutrient transport and guidance for managing nutrients in lake basins.

These glaciers, which are highly sensitive to climatic variations, serve as vital indicators of climate change. Understanding glacier-fed hydrological systems is essential for predicting water availability and formulating climate adaptation strategies. This study investigated the dynamic fluctuations in the water level of the Blue Moon Lake Valley (BMLV), supplied by meltwater from Baishui River Glacier No. 1 on Yulong Snow Mountain. We focused on the lake pulse phenomenon-subtle yet significant water level fluctuations that have often been overlooked in prior research. By employing fast Fourier transform (FFT), multivariate regression (MVR), and random forest (RF) models, we examined the interactions among glacier melt dynamics, climatic variables, and hydrological responses. Our analysis indicates that the rate of change (ROC) in the water level fluctuates between - 0.006 and 0.01 m/min, with a median ROC of - 7.24E-06 m/min, highlighting the significant variability influenced by glacier melt and precipitation. The maximum cumulative sum (CS) value of 0.09 m suggests a net increase in the water level, predominantly due to increased precipitation, decreased evaporation, and increased glacier melting. We demonstrate that temperature critically influences glacier melt rates and water level variations, alongside solar radiation, rainfall, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed. The ROC of Baishui River Glacier No. 1 melt ranges from - 0.0016 to 0.0015 m/min, reflecting substantial variation with significant downstream implications for water availability during dry seasons. The mean interval between consecutive glacier melt peaks is approximately 2.87 h, with a strong positive linear trend R2 = 0.99, indicating frequent melt events. Conversely, water level peaks occur approximately every 6.5 h, with a strong positive trend R2 = 0.99, indicating a slower recurrence rate. The transit time for meltwater from Baishui River Glacier No. 1 to BMLV is estimated at approximately 4.16 h. Additionally, we quantify the water flux from BMLV across various timescales, highlighting the substantial contribution of glacial meltwater. This novel study systematically examines the hydrological dynamics of BMLV. This study has the potential to reveal broader implications for water resource management, ecosystem dynamics, and climate change adaptation in regions dependent on glacier-fed lakes.					; An, Jiachun/ABG-4275-2020; SHAH, SHOUKAT ALI/ADB-8219-2022; Ai, Songtao/AAA-7338-2019	Ai, Songtao/0000-0001-6677-3899; , SHOUKAT ALI SHAH/0000-0002-6723-9898; 													2045-2322					DEC 30	2024	14	1							31623	10.1038/s41598-024-78660-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-78660-4								39738180					WOS:001389342800001

This study aimed to reveal the response of the brackish cladoceran, Daphniopsis australis exposed to three temperatures (16, 20 and 25 degrees C) cross-classified with three salinities (17, 22 and 27). Our results show a significant interactive effect of temperature and salinity on most life history variables. The individual parameters including longevity, total egg clutch, egg development time, offspring production and total moulting were negatively related to the elevations of temperature and salinity. High salinity dampened the positive relationship between age at first reproduction and increasing temperatures. Population parameters including age-specific survivorship, age-specific fecundity, net reproductive rate and generation time were negatively affected by the increasing temperature and salinity. The intrinsic growth rate showed a unimodal distribution with peak population growth occurred at 20 degrees C and 22 salinity, indicating the optimal condition for population growth. The poor performance of growth, reproduction and development occurred at 25 degrees C and 27 salinity. Considering the dual effects of thermal and saline fluctuation, the life history of D. australis is more greatly impacted by temperature rather than salinity, which can contribute to the explanation of seasonal dynamics of brackish water cladocera in salt lakes.					; Ismail, Hasnun/ABF-8346-2021	Qin, Jianguang/0000-0003-2448-8058; Seuront, Laurent/0000-0002-0051-5202; Ismail, Hasnun Nita/0000-0003-2277-2397													0142-7873	1464-3774				MAY	2011	33	5					763	777		10.1093/plankt/fbq145	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbq145													WOS:000289198500008
J	Krieger, KA				Krieger, KA			Effectiveness of a coastal wetland in reducing pollution of a Laurentian Great Lake: Hydrology, sediment, and nutrients	WETLANDS												The ability of coastal wetlands of the Laurentian Great Lakes to reduce pollution from tributaries has not been documented in detail or over multiple seasons. This study developed a surface-water budget for a coastal wetland along Lake Erie and estimated monthly, annual, and storm-related exports of total suspended solids and selected nutrients from the wetland. Water-budget measurements included precipitation, evaporation, surface discharge into the wetland, and net surface discharge into Lake Erie. Water samples collected upstream and downstream and composite dryfall-precipitation samples were analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite nitrogen (NO2+3) ammonia nitrogen (NH3), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), soluble reactive silica, chloride, and specific conductance. Seasonal and storm-related concentration patterns and a wide variation in monthly, seasonal, and annual loads from the tributary into the wetland were typical of streams draining the western Lake Erie basin. All substances reached higher maximum concentrations upstream than downstream; however, median monthly time-weighted mean concentrations of TP, TSS, NH3, and TKN were higher downstream. Concentrations without discharge data were inadequate to estimate removal rates. Annual loads of TSS, NH3, and TKN increased during passage through the wetland, whereas those of TP, SRP, NO2+3, and soluble reactive silica decreased. During storm runoff events, various proportions of TP, SRP, TSS, NO2+3, and soluble reactive silica were removed, despite brief hydraulic residence times, whereas more NH3 exited than entered. Wetlands occupying the flooded lower reaches of Great Lakes tributaries collectively are probably important in maintaining and enhancing the water and sediment quality of the lakes. Water levels throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes have decreased in recent years; consequently, wetland areas with standing water and hydraulic residence times have decreased, probably reducing the effectiveness of the wetlands in mitigating pollution.

J	Josens, ML; Haydee, EA; Favero, M				Laura Josens, Maria; Alicia Haydee, Escalante; Favero, Marco			Seasonal Variability of Waterbird Assemblages in Relationship to Habitat Characteristics in a Pampas Wetland	WATERBIRDS												The Argentinean Pampas is an ecologically disturbed region where patchy wetlands form complex habitats with surrounding agricultural areas. Numerous bird species concentrate in these sites at breeding colonies and communal roosts. For two consecutive five years, point censuses Were made of birds in the vicinity of a roosting and breeding area at Los Padres Lake in the south-cast Pampas's plain. In parallel with these censuses, limnological analyses (e.g. nutrient concentration, conductivity, water transparency and temperature) were conducted to correlate changes in the structure of waterbird assemblages With environmental variability. Seasonal variability in the structure of waterbird assemblages could be clue to changes in the birds' habitat Use and reproductive phenology through the year (e.g. colonies, foraging and roosting sites) and land use in neighboring areas (e.g. for agricultural practices). Waterbird abundance in July and August correlated with phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations, which were linked to changes of waterbird assemblages and their feeding behavior. The present study shows the potential importance of waterbird communities in contributing biotic nutrients to Pampas wetlands. Received 18 September 2008, accepted 22 April 2009.

J	Schwab, DJ; Leshkevich, GA; Muhr, GC				Schwab, DJ; Leshkevich, GA; Muhr, GC			Automated mapping of surface water temperature in the Great Lakes	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												A procedure for producing daily cloud-free maps of surface water temperature in the Great Lakes has been developed. It is based on satellite-derived AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) imagery from NOAA's Coast Watch program. The maps have a nominal resolution of 2.6 km and provide as complete as possible coverage of the Great Lakes on a daily basis by using previous imagery to estimate temperatures in cloud covered areas. Surface water temperature estimates derived from this procedure compare well with water temperatures measured at the eight NOAA weather buoys in the lakes. The mean difference between the buoy temperature and the satellite-derived temperature estimates is less than 0.5 degrees C for all buoys. The root mean square differences range from 1.10 to 1.76 degrees C. As one example of the possible applications of this product, the daily surface water temperature maps for 1992 to 1997 were analyzed to produce daily estimates of average surface water temperature for each lake. Results are compared to the long-term (28 year) mean annual cycle of average surface water temperatures. The average surface water temperatures vary from as much as 4 degrees C below climatology in 1993 to 2 to 3 degrees C above climatology in 1995. The new analysis procedure also provides a more realistic depiction of the spatial distribution of temperature in the springtime than the climatological maps.

Historical trends in daily reservoir evaporation events have eluded the scientific and operational communities, largely due to a lack of long-term, consistent data record. This study quantifies trends in extreme daily reservoir evaporation events at 165 major reservoirs located in the western U.S. We use the place-based energy balance and aerodynamic Daily Lake Evaporation Model (DLEM) driven by multiple meteorological data products (RTMA, gridMET, Daymet) to estimate daily evaporation rates at these reservoirs from 1981 to 2022. The results-while are based on different meteorological forcing datasets-consistently indicate that the California, Lower Colorado, and Rio Grande hydrologic regions are more prone to higher daily evaporation extremes. Compared to the rest of western U.S, these three regions also experience a more pronounced increasing trend in the annual maximum daily evaporation rate, at about 0.3 mm day-1 decade-1 during 1981-2022. The results show that heat and dryness are the main drivers to the increasing trend of extreme evaporation, while extreme wind speed is the primary contributor to exceptionally high daily evaporation events across all regions. This phenomenon is particularly prominent in the arid Lower Colorado region, but less significant in the cold and humid Pacific Northwest region. We also find that the correlation between extreme wind speed and extreme evaporation degrades as the time scale increases from daily, to monthly and seasonal. Our findings have strong implications for the pattern and distribution of extreme evaporation events at the western U.S. reservoirs, and illustrate how various drivers influence extreme evaporation across different time scales.					; KAO, SHIH-CHIEH/B-9428-2012; Allen, George/AAG-9397-2019; Kao, Shih-Chieh/B-9428-2012; Zhao, Bin/I-3651-2013	Allen, George/0000-0001-8301-5301; Yadav, Anshul/0000-0002-5189-330X; Zhao, Bingjie/0000-0003-0195-2030; Kao, Shih-Chieh/0000-0002-3207-5328; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				APR	2025	651								132589	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132589	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132589		DEC 2024											WOS:001412461900001

Any source of contamination that could be infectious must be monitored to reduce the risk of exposure to brucellosis, so the purpose of this work was to determine the presence ofBrucellaspp. on surface water and tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) skin from a volcanic lake in Mexico. A seasonal sampling during 2016-2017 was carried out at fifteen specific sites for water sampling and five sites for the collection of tilapia fish. From all water and fish samples tested, we found only three isolates ofBrucellaspecies. We isolated and identifiedB. abortusfrom surface water through bacteriological and molecular techniques, andB. abortusandB. suisfrom the same tilapia skin sample. The isolated strains likely came from breeding animals that are common to the region, such as infected pigs or cattle withBrucella abortusorB. suis, respectively. A similar finding has not been reported in a water from volcanic lake or tilapia fish in Mexico. We concluded thatB. abortusandB. suisare present on the surface water of the volcanic lake and tilapia skin as possible contaminants derived from biological material from cows and pigs carrying this bacterium.					; Saldana, Zeus/ISV-0070-2023	Saldana Ahuactzi, Zeus/0000-0002-2710-2846; Ramos-Ramirez, Lesset del Consuelo/0000-0002-9234-6177; 													0343-8651	1432-0991				NOV	2020	77	11					3565	3572		10.1007/s00284-020-02184-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-020-02184-z		SEP 2020						32897398					WOS:000567415900001
J	Yun, HJ; Yi, SM; Kim, YP				Yun, HJ; Yi, SM; Kim, YP			Dry deposition fluxes of ambient particulate heavy metals in a small city, Korea	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT					12th World Clean Air and Environment Congress and Exhiition	AUG 26-31, 2001	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA					Daytime and nighttime dry deposition fluxes of particulate heavy metals were measured in Kunpo, a small city in the Seoul metropolitan area in Korea. Samples were collected by dry deposition plates during four measurement periods in 2000. The average fluxes of total mass and elements measured during daytime were higher than the nighttime fluxes due to higher wind speeds and higher ambient concentrations. The average fluxes of Al and Ca, typical crustal species, were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than Mn and anthropogenic elements such as As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn. Possible anthropogenic source of Ca is suggested. Particle size distributions were measured by a cascade impactor and a coarse particle rotary impactor to estimate the importance of the particle size on the deposition fluxes. The Sehmel-Hodgson model was used to estimate dry deposition velocities as a function of particle size for the multi-step deposition model calculation. The calculated fluxes agreed fairly well with the measured fluxes and it was shown that large particles (D-P > 9 mum) are more important than small particles (D-P > 9 mum) in particulate dry deposition of heavy metals.

Local conditions drive interpopulation variation in field-based critical thermal maximum of brook trout	CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY												Individual- and population-level responses to thermal change will be pivotal for species' resilience and adaptive responses to climate change. Thermal tolerance of ectotherms has been extensively studied under laboratory conditions, but comparatively few studies have assessed intra- and interpopulation variation under natural conditions or in situ. We measured field critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) populations at twenty sites across Ontario, Canada, to assess their thermal tolerance in situ and examine potential factors underlying intraspecific variation in thermal performance. We modelled CTmax as a function of acclimation using short-term stream temperature data to assess interpopulation variation, and used full-season stream temperatures to calculate thermal safety margins (TSM) for each population. CTmax ranged between 27.41 and 30.46 degrees C and acclimation periods between 4 and 40 days were strong predictors of site CTmax, aligning closely with lab-based studies. Seasonal temperature profiles varied substantially among sites, with mean 30-day stream temperature accounting for 66% of the among-site variation in CTmax. TSMs ranged between 0.51 and 15.51 degrees C and reflected differences among site thermal regimes. Streams in watersheds with more urban or agricultural development had the lowest TSMs in addition to those that were fed by lake surface water. This work emphasizes the importance of locally based conservation and management practices that act at or below the population level, as local factors beyond acclimation temperature were partly responsible for variation in thermal tolerance and thus dictate the resiliency of brook trout under climate change.

Influence of variable water depth and turbidity on microalgae production in a shallow estuarine lake system - A modelling study	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Strongly varying water levels and turbidities are typical characteristics of the large shallow estuarine lake system of St. Lucia, one of the largest on the African continent. This theoretical study investigated the combined effects of variable water depth and turbidity on seasonal pelagic and benthic microalgae production using a mathematical model, in order to ascertain productivity levels during variable and extreme conditions. Simulated pelagic and benthic net production varied between 0.3 and 180 g C m(-2) year(-1) and 0 and 220 g C m(-2) year(-1), respectively, dependent on depth, turbidity, and variability in turbidity. Although not surprising production and biomass decreased with increasing turbidity and depth. A high variability in turbidity, i.e. an alteration of calm and windy days, could reduce or enhance the seasonal pelagic and benthic production by more than 30% compared to a low variability. The day-to-day variability in wind-induced turbidity therefore influences production in the long term. On the other hand, varying water depth within a year did not significantly influence the seasonal production for turbidities representative of Lake St. Lucia. Reduced lake area and volume as observed during dry periods in Lake St. Lucia did not reduce primary production of the entire system since desiccation resulted in lower water depth and thus increased light availability. This agrees with field observations suggesting little light limitation and high areal microalgal biomass during a period with below average rainfall (2005-2011). Thus, microalgae potentially fulfil their function in the lake food-web even under extreme drought conditions. We believe that these results are of general interest to shallow aquatic ecosystems that are sensitive to drought periods due to either human or natural causes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sabuni, RA; Kustatscher, E				Sabuni, Rachel A.; Kustatscher, Evelyn			The Middle Triassic Flora of the Tanga Basin, Tanzania	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												The Bamba, Pangarawe and Kakindu outcrops of the Tanga Basin (Tanzania) yielded a diverse plant fossil assemblages, including Pagiophyllum, Voltziopsis, Heidiphyllum, and possibly Sphenobaiera. This composition of the plant fossil assemblage suggests a Middle Triassic age for the fossiliferous beds extending the fossil record in the Tanga Basin. The plant remains are preserved in fine-grained shales and silts, suggesting deposition in low- energy environments, such as lakes, with reduced transport from surrounding growing areas. The plants likely thrived in a dynamic ecosystem composed of coniferous forests interspersed with open vegetation, reflecting adaptation to varying environmental conditions driven by a seasonal, monsoonal climate. This study highlights the significance of the Tanga Basin in elucidating the floristic composition of Gondwana's mid-latitudes. The mid-latitudes of Gondwana, generally devoid of plant fossil findings, where previously assigned to the desert biome, whereas the finding support a seasonal climate of the temperate biome during the Triassic.

In concert with termites, large herbivores are important determinants of savanna woody vegetation cover. The relative cover of woody species has considerable effects on savanna function. Despite the potentially important ecological relationships between termite mounds, woody plants, large herbivores, and birds, these associations have previously received surprisingly little attention. We experimentally studied the effects of termites and large herbivores on the avian community in Lake Mburo National Park, Uganda, where woody vegetation is essentially limited to termite mounds. Our experiment comprised of four treatments in nine replicates; unfenced termite mounds, fenced mounds (excluding large mammals), unfenced adjacent savanna, and fenced savanna. We recorded species identity, abundance, and behavior of all birds observed on these plots over a two-month period, from late dry until wet season. Birds used termite mounds almost exclusively, with only 3.5% of observations occurring in the treeless intermound savanna matrix. Mean abundance and species richness of birds doubled on fenced (large herbivores excluded) compared to unfenced mounds. Feeding behavior increased when large mammals were excluded from mounds, both in absolute number of observed individuals, and relative to other behaviors. This study documents the fundamental positive impact of Macrotermes termites on bird abundance and diversity in an African savanna. Birds play crucial functional roles in savanna ecosystems, for example, by dispersing fruits or regulating herbivorous insect populations. Thus, the role of birds in savanna dynamics depends on the distribution and abundance of termite mounds.					; Moe, Stein/G-1507-2011; Støen, Ole-Gunnar/AAY-6457-2020	Okullo, Paul/0000-0001-5462-0844; Eldegard, Katrine/0000-0002-3276-8087; Moe, Stein R./0000-0003-1005-3192; Stoen, Ole-Gunnar/0000-0002-7469-4792; 													2045-7758					DEC	2017	7	23					10079	10088		10.1002/ece3.3513	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.3513								29238538					WOS:000417754100019

Ephippia represent the dormant community in sediments and allow tracing population dynamics and community succession with environmental change in water bodies in time. As reservoirs are created by damming rivers, the species composition and structure of a dormant cladoceran community are expected to depend on trophic state as well as on hydrological conditions. We collected ephippia from sediments in the transition and lacustrine zones of Liuxihe reservoir, a warm-water impoundment in southern China. High species richness with low abundance was found in the transitional zone, while high abundance was found at the lacustrine zone. Ephippia identified Daphnia galeata as the first Cladocera colonizer of the newly created water body, but littoral or small sized species-Scapholeberis sp. and Bosmina sp. fast increased and became dominated from damming till the end of 1970s. Medium-sized pelagic species-Moina micrura and D. galeata-increased from 1975 onwards, corresponding to an increase in diatom abundance with slight eutrophication and hydrological shift due to the construction of two small dams in the upstream zone of the feeding rivers. A two-way stepwise linear regression analysis showed that spatial variables explained 33% of ephippial total abundance while diatom abundance explained 5.2%. Hydrological conditions in the dry season (October to next March) were unrelated to total ephippial abundance but explained 37.5% in the wet season (April to September). We conclude the distinct longitudinal gradient and vertical variation of the dormant community provide useful information for understanding of long-term dynamics of site-specific hydrological processes, primary productivity and hydrologic events.

Application of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) for Culture Conditions and Biomass Production of Psychrophilic Microalgae Isolated from High Mountains Lake During the ice-free Season	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Many studies on cold environments have been developed over the past two decades. High mountain freshwater presents high variability of nutrients and chemico-physical parameters, showing variations of pH, oxygen concentration, metals and temperature throughout the year. National Park of Sierra Nevada (Granada, Spain) (37 degrees 032 N 03 degrees 182 W), has almost 40 lakes that are reported to be both endemic and oligotrophic. However, very little information about their microbial diversity can be found in literature. In this work, a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to find best nutritional conditions for the isolation of psychrophilic microalgae from La Caldera Lake. The results showed that best culture medium, was the Rodriguez-Lopez medium. (RL); data were adjusted to a quadratic prediction model reporting a biomass concentration over 600 mg/L at 10 and 20 degrees C. In this paper, the diversity of culturable freshwater microalgae in the La Caldera Lake was observed by PCR using specific primers for eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes. Samples were taken in early July and late Agust, 2011. In July presence of strains belonging to the Eustigmatophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Scenedesmaceae families were found. In August, only microalgae from the Eustigmatophyceae, Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyceae and Scenedesmaceae families were found. An individual culture of each isolated strain was carried out. Microalgae S21 had phylogenetic similitude with Chlorophyceae, and showed best growth being biomass concentration in RL 393.73 mg/L and 128.52 mg/L at 20 degrees C and 10 degrees C, respectively. Moreover, specific growth rates (mu(max)), 0.25/h and 0.13/h at 20 degrees C and 10 degrees C, respectively, were detected for strain S21.					; Juarez-Jimenez, MJ Belen/L-4241-2014; Fenice, Massimiliano/L-9195-2014; Gonzalez, Jose/AAA-8130-2019; Pesciaroli, Chiara/L-9121-2014	MAZA MARQUEZ, PAULA/0000-0003-1893-404X; Juarez-Jimenez, MJ Belen/0000-0001-8495-7093; Fenice, Massimiliano/0000-0001-8504-0885; Pesciaroli, Chiara/0000-0002-5497-5036													1735-6865	2008-2304				SUM	2014	8	3					799	812																WOS:000339932500029

Four different stations situated around the course of the river at considerable distances have been selected from the outfall of sewage canals at Kulti-Ghushighata (S1), where metropolitan sewages discharged and mixed up into water of Bidyadhari river, which ultimately carried through this river via stations Malancha (S2), Kanmari (S3) to Dhamakhali (S4), just before the river confluences with the larger Raimangal river at northern Sundarban delta. This study was conducted to estimate total mercury (Hg) concentration in waters (during high tides and ebb tides) and sediments of Bidyadhari river in pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons during the period from March, 2012 to February, 2013 at those stations. It is revealed from the estimated data that agricultural runoff, sewage, effluents from various industries and Kolkata metropolitan, Salt Lake City and adjacent areas of North 24 Parganas district carried and discharged in Bidyadhari river through sewage canals are not so high in mercury content for sediment contamination but alarming in respect of water quality, which crosses the permissible limit of Hg for consumption (0.001 ppm) in wide range of areas at Kanmari and Dhamakhali around the estuary. Enhancement of Hg level in this river water and transportation of the metal through tidal effects to and fro mangrove land of Sundarban may be dangerous for aquatic lives and supposed to be grave concern for the ecology of the Sundarban delta including humans.					; Kumar, Sourabh/AAL-2645-2020	Dubey, Sourabh Kumar/0000-0002-3526-1353; 													2277-470X	2319-247X				JUN	2014	4	1					19	32																WOS:000215367900003

However, since zebra mussels are uncommon in pelagic zones, their potential as reference species in pelagic water columns has not been fully explored. By investigating mussels growing suspended on a single vertical cable in Lake Constance, we were able to document seasonal (April, May, and August) and depth-dependent (0-22 m) variation in mussel delta (15)Ie and delta C-13. We found a strong correlation between temperature and mussel delta N-15 from differing depths(;) and a strong relationship between temperature and Delta(15)Ie (estimated as delta (15)Ie(mussel) - delta (15)Ie(POM)) and Delta C-13 (delta C-13(mussel) - delta C-13(POM)). In a pattern that remained consistent over all months, Delta(15)Ie decreased with temperature, to the extent that negative values were recorded at temperatures > 13A degrees C. Utilizing cable-dwelling pelagic mussels as indicators of variation in isotope and temperature for pelagic water could be used as a novel field approach, comparable to in situ experimentation. We suggest that the pelagic mussel approach can be employed in tandem with benthic or littoral mussel isotope values, to develop mussel-based lake isoscapes. Such isoscapes may be pertinent to the study of seasonal trophic limnoecology and in tracking the movements of animals.

To understand how the virus survives solar UV-B damage, we examined the decay of cyanophage PP induced by solar UV-B radiation and the photoreactivation repair by host cyanobacteria, on 1 d in each of the 4 different seasons throughout a year. The UV-B transparent or non-transparent bag containing the cyanophage PP was exposed to sunlight at different water depths and was collected at varying time points. The collected sample was treated with or without radiation of a photoreactivating wavelength (300 to 500 nm). The decay ratio (here designated as the percentage of infectivity lost) for cyanophage PP from all samples caused by UV-B radiation ranged from 29.8 to 92.1 %. Season and water depth were the main factors influencing the decay ratio, while long exposure time had less effect. The repair ratio (here designated as the percentage of revived infectivity by photoreactivation) for cyanophage PP reached a maximum during the first 1 to 3 h of exposure, at all depths. The maximum repair ratios of photoreactivation for each of the decayed samples, ranging from 7 to 59 %, were negatively correlated with the decay ratio. In most cases, the repair ratio of photoreactivation reached a maximum in the first 4 h. Our results indicate that solar UV-B radiation may decrease the infectivity of cyanophage PP in shallow freshwater bodies in an extraordinarily fast and effective manner, whereas rapid photoreactivation may contribute to balancing the rapid phototoxicity.

Chemistry of snow and ice cores along the ice flow lines at Lake Vostok (Antarctica)	GEOCHEMISTRY												The authors present the results of high resolution chemical studies of snow cover from pits and cores along the ice flow lines from Ridge B to Lake Vostok across its southern (profile VFL) and northern (profile NVFL) parts. The sampling was performed between 2006-2013 during the seasonal 52nd-57th Russian Antarctic expeditions (RAE). Chemical signals of non-sea-salt sulphates and an analysis of the morphology, size and composition of microparticles allowed for the identification of the products of large volcanic eruptions during the 19th and 20th centuries, including the eruptions of Tambora (1815), Krakatoa (1883), Agung (1963) and Pinatubo (1991). In the layers with high non-sea-salt sulphate concentrations, we found small aluminosilicate particles with K, Fe and Mg inclusions, which could be of volcanic origin. Using volcanic markers, we calculated snow accumulation rates for the past 200 years along the two ice flow lines. The maximal snow accumulation rates (33mm in water equivalent yr(-1)) were found in the northern ice flow line, and the minimal rates (25mm in water equivalent yr(-1)) were found in the southern ice flow line.

Based on hydrological data of Dongting Lake, the second largest freshwater lake in China, during 1980-2014, a set of water safety assessment methods suitable for seasonal lakes was constructed. Results demonstrated the following. (1) The year 2003 was a major time point for changes in water regime in Dongting Lake between 1980 and 2014. (2) The water regime changes in different parts of Dongting Lake exhibited certain similarities in periodicity and overall change trends. Among them, South Dongting Lake presented the best water security status, followed by East Dongting Lake and West Dongting Lake. (3) Compared with 1980-2002, the complexity of the water safety level change in East Dongting Lake increased in 2003-2014, as manifested in the tendency of the distribution of water safety levels to change sharply. (4) The influence of dry years on the water safety of Dongting Lake was greater than that of rainy years. The multi-time, multi-scale and multi-target lake water safety assessment method based on water regimes provides new ideas and methods for global research on seasonal lake water safety.					dai, xue/KFB-3128-2024; Pengjie, Wang/J-5250-2014														2040-2244					SEP	2020	11	3					877	890		10.2166/wcc.2019.269	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2019.269													WOS:000555970900017

The synergistic effect of high temperatures and rainfall during the wet season promotes the release of endogenous nitrogen (N) and eutrophication within lake ecosystems. However, the seasonal variations in sediments N speciation and bioavailability, and their intrinsic connection to release potential, remain unclear. This study employed sequential extraction method and Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FTICR MS) to characterize extractable N (Ex-N) in Erhai Lake sediments during dry and wet seasons. The results indicated that ion-exchangeable organic form N (IEF-ON) serves as a substrate for microbial mineralization, with the highest proportion of protein-like substances (26.2%). The influx of N-containing polysaccharides and poly-N glycoproteins during the wet season further increased its bioavailability. Algal-derived N exists as the weak acidextractable organic form N (WAEF-ON), which has the highest lipid proportion (11.7%) and the lowest double bond equivalent (DBE) values. Overall, elevated water temperatures and N input during the wet season accelerate both the mineralization rate of organic N (ON) and the content of labile N components. This potentially triggers a "priming effect" that could further activate the refractory N components in the sediments. Additionally, the wet season reduces sediment pH and redox potential, making WAEF-ON and strong alkali-extractable form N (SAEF-N) more labile and susceptible to release. This study reveals the adverse effects of seasonal variations on N sequestration in lake sediments, complicating the control of endogenous pollution release under the backdrop of climate change.

Fish production in the Delta is dependent on how well temporary floodplains are maintained. A study was conducted to understand how floodplains function so as to put measures in place that will sustain temporary floodplains in a high productive state. During high floods, distinct microhabitats (open water, sedges and inundated terrestrial grasses) develop in which microinvertebrate community structure was assessed across such habitats during the 20092010 flooding season. Depth was highest (ANOVA, P < 0.05) in the open-water microhabitat and lowest within inundated grasses. Conductivity, total phosphorus and chlorophyll a were all highest (ANOVA, P < 0.05) within inundated grasses than in other microhabitats. A total of 46 microinvertebrate taxa were identified, and they were most diverse within the sedges. The abundance of microinvertebrates was highest (ANOVA, P < 0.05) within the inundated grasses and lowest within the open-water zone. Given that microinvertebrates are an important food source for juvenile fish, their presence in high densities within inundated terrestrial grasses is a key determinant of fish production. This suggests the need for serious consideration of the importance of temporary floodplains when formulating conservation strategies for the Okavango Delta.

J	Sudha, V; Ambujam, NK				Sudha, Velu; Ambujam, Neelakantapillai Kanniperumal			Longitudinal heterogeneity of sediment characteristics during southwest monsoon season in hyper-eutrophic Krishnagiri reservoir, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Krishnagiri reservoir is a hyper-eutrophicated reservoir located in Krishnagiri district which is one of the drought-prone districts in Tamil Nadu, India. The reservoir water is being used for various purposes such as irrigation, drinking, fish rearing, livestock rearing, and recreation. Since there is no an evidence of investigation on bottom sediments in Krishnagiri reservoir, the present study was carried out during southwest monsoon season in 2008. This study examined the physical and chemical characteristics of the bottom sediments such as composition, redox potential, moisture content, organic carbon, organic matter, total phosphorus, and total iron at 15 locations in the reservoir. Phosphorus fractionation study was carried out to find out different fractions such as loosely adsorbed phosphorous, iron and aluminium-bound phosphorus, calcium-bound phosphorous, and organic phosphorous. Results indicated that there was spatial variation in the composition of sediments and low values of redox potential. The significant positive correlation exists between the organic carbon and organic phosphorus concentration. The lacustrine zone of the reservoir showed high accumulation of total phosphorus and total iron when compared to riverine and transition zones. This study concludes an allogenic origin of majority of inorganic phosphorus in the reservoir during the study period and this might have been derived from the catchment during the erosion process. The high concentration of surface sediment phosphorus clearly indicates a greater threat of eutrophication in Krishnagiri reservoir.

J	Jasprica, N; Hafner, D				Jasprica, N; Hafner, D			Taxonomic composition and seasonality of diatoms in three Dinaric karstic lakes in Croatia	LIMNOLOGICA												The composition and temporal distribution of planktonic diatoms were studied in three small shallow karstic lakes Modro Oko, Desne, and Kuti - throughout the seasons in 1994, 1995, 1997, and 1998. Physico-chemical parameters did not differ among the three lakes, except for NO3 concentrations. Altogether, 137 diatom taxa within 41 genera were found in all three lakes combined. The highest number of taxa belonged to the genera Surirella (13), Navicula (12), and Cymbella (9). Most taxa were tychoplanktonic, with true panktonic taxa contributing only 14% of the total. Despite their physical-chemical similarity, the lakes showed differences in the structure and dynamics of their diatom communities. Blooms occurred at different times in each of the lakes, and community similarity (Jaccard index) among all three was low (17.6-29.1%). The highest mean values of surface diatom abundance in Modro Oko (2199 cells L-1), Desne (7900 cells L-1), and Kuti (20690 cells L-1) were not significantly different. Margalef's species richness index did not differ either among the lakes or seasonally. Only five diatom taxa in quantitative samples, and 22 taxa in netsamples, were common to all lakes. The most frequent diatoms were Cyclotella striata (56-93%), Fragilaria ulna (50-67%), and Asterionella formosa (27-83%). The most abundant taxa in Modro Oko, Desne, and Kuti were, respectively, Cymbella sp. 1 (402cells L-1), Cyclotella striata (3000 cells L-1) and Asterionella formosa (20690 cells L-1). Eighteen taxa were recorded for the first time in Croatia: Amphora commutata, Caloneis amphisbaena var. subsalina, C silicula var. peisonis, Campylodiscus echeneis, Coscinodiscus lacustris, Denticula elegans.. Gyrosigma acuminatum var. lacustre, G. distortum var. parkeri, G. fasciola, Navicula menisculus var. menisculus, N. pusilla, N. helensis, Stauroneis parvula var. prominula, Staurosira construens f. subsalina, Stephanodiscus sp. 1, Surirella gracilis, S. ovalis, and S. striatula. The genus Stephanodiscus was recorded for the first time in Croatia. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

Comprehending the surface melt characteristics, calving processes, and seasonal ice velocity of Dålk glacier in Larsemann Hills, East Antarctica	POLAR SCIENCE												Surface melting induces hydro-fracturing and deformational changes on the ice surface, which have a substantial impact on its dynamics and stability and therefore, comprehending these processes is crucial for ice sheet mass balance and stability. The present study is an attempt to understand the surface melt characteristics, seasonal ice movement, and calving processes of the D & aring;lk glacier located in the Larsemann Hills of East Antarctica using multi-sensor remote sensing observations from 2017 to 2023. We identified and examined several melt features across the glacier and analysed their evolution during the study period. Frontal changes, calving events, and seasonal surface ice velocities of the glacier were also investigated during the study period. We found that the evolution and drainage of the melt features over the D & aring;lk glacier is highly dynamic in nature with a significant inter-annual variability. We report substantial morphological changes in the ice doline structure that may be driven by the surface melt patterns, ice movement, and ice deformation in the region which also, affect the drainage of the nearby connected melt ponds and features. Several minor to very major calving events observed during the period due to immense disintegration processes during the preceding melting season that also affected the ice movement. We also highlight the need of monitoring and studying such melt features over the outlet glaciers that concerns the imminent catastrophic fragmentation and deformational changes over the glacier.

The importance of dynamic mercury water column concentrations on body burdens in a planktivorous fish: A bioenergetic and mercury mass balance perspective	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Bioenergetic algorithms and mercury (Hg) mass balance approaches are combined into a single modeling framework (BioHg) to investigate sensitivity of methylmercury (MeHg) levels in Sacramento blackfish (Orthodon microlepidotus), a planktivorous cyprinid, as a function of dissolved water column concentrations of methylmercury (DMeHg). Boundary condition DMeHg are defined using observed Carson River contributions to Lahontan Reservoir, Nevada (USA). Influxes of DMeHg have a seasonal mean of 0.65 +/- 0.21 ng/L (January) to 2.48 +/- 1.53 ng/L (August) and blackfish concentrations in Lahontan Reservoir exceed health criterion for human consumption of MeHg by nearly three-fold. Model parameterization relies on laboratory and field data specific to the blackfish to calibrate allometric coefficients related to consumption, respiration, specific dynamic action, egestion, excretion, and spawning. Actual consumption is reliant on feeding strategies, prey selectivity, filtering efficiency, and prey availability. BioHg is able to capture trends in observed growth and wet weight MeHg concentrations in blackfish. MeHg concentrations are obtained in the first year and maintained throughout the lifespan of the fish, with growth dilution an important processes limiting continued increases in MeHg concentrations through time. Model results indicate that coupling dynamic DMeHg influxes with periods of maximum plankton growth and maximum fish consumption rates increases fish concentrations by 50% and is a better predictor of observed concentrations in comparison to a constant DMeHg condition. Additionally, peak MeHg concentration in fish is directly correlated to maximum DMeHg. Simulated phase shifts in DMeHg decouples modeled processes and MeHg fish concentration estimates decrease by 50%. BioHg highlights that both the magnitude and timing of DMeHg are important predictors of MeHg accumulation in a planktivourous fish. (C) 2017 The Authors.

J	Marcus, NH				Marcus, NH			Ecological and evolutionary significance of resting eggs in marine copepods: Past, present, and future studies	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Symposium on Diaupause in the Crustacea	SEP 12-17, 1994	ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA	Russian Fdn Fundamental Investigat				The occurrence of a resting egg phase in the life cycle of marine and freshwater planktonic copepods is well documented and receiving increasing attention by investigators. The species generally occur in coastal marine waters, freshwater ponds and lakes in areas that undergo strong seasonal fluctuations, though examples have been reported for tropical and sub-tropical areas not subject to such extreme fluctuations. Typically such species disappear from the water column for portions of the year, but remain in the region as benthic resting eggs. Studies to date have focused on the conditions that promote the occurrence of resting eggs, the factors that affect their survival and hatching from sediments, the existence of egg banks in sediments, and the impact of resting eggs on plankton community structure. Benthic resting eggs of copepods include diapause eggs as well as subitaneous (non-diapause) eggs that are quiescent due to conditions in the sediments. As with other groups of organisms the resting egg phase is viewed as being critical for the perpetuation of species year after year, especially those that disappear from the water column for portions of the year. Some data indicate that eggs can survive for many years in sediments which would expand their influence to evolutionary time scales. This paper summarizes our understanding of embryonic dormancy in marine copepods.																			0018-8158					MAR 1	1996	320	1-3					141	152		10.1007/BF00016815	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00016815													WOS:A1996UE14900017

RECENT DECLINES IN APPARENT SURVIVAL AND SURVEY COUNTS OF SNOWY PLOVERS BREEDING IN THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS OF TEXAS	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												We quantified changes in long-term Snowy Plover (Charadrius nivosus) survey counts and return rates, estimated current sex and age-specific apparent survival and encounter rates, and calculated recruitment thresholds needed to maintain a stable population in the Southern High Plains of Texas. Mean survey counts of adult Snowy Plovers decreased by 78% at one saline lake (from 80 adults/survey to 18 adults/survey) from 1999-2000 to 2008-2010 but remained consistent at an alternate lake (from 45 adults/survey to 41 adults/survey). Adult and juvenile return rates have similarly declined within this time frame by 25 and 62%, respectively. Long-term declines in return rates may be the result of increased mortality from declining habitat conditions either within or outside the breeding season. Current estimates of adult (65%) and juvenile (12%) apparent survival are lower than most other estimates for Snowy Plovers throughout their range. Current estimates of adult and juvenile apparent survival and return rates indicate 5.8-10.0 hatchlings per adult per year are needed to maintain the current population without immigration, a 3-5 fold increase in the past 10 years.

J	Wolff, IW; Glasser, NF; Hubbard, A				Wolff, Ingo W.; Glasser, Neil F.; Hubbard, Alun			The reconstruction and climatic implication of an independent palaeo ice cap within the Andean rain shadow east of the former Patagonian ice sheet, Santa Cruz Province, Argentina	GEOMORPHOLOGY												This paper describes the reconstruction of the previously undocumented Meseta Cuadrada palaeo ice cap on south-west Meseta del Lago Buenos Aires, Santa Cruz Province, Patagonia. Based on theoretical surface profiles the reconstruction of the Meseta Cuadrada Palaeo Ice Cap indicates an ice mass covering at least 78 km(2) with a total ice volume around 9.2 km(3). The inferred equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of the palaeo ice cap (2031 m asl) represents a drop of 286 m compared to the ELA of the current Meseta Cuadrada glacier (similar to 2317 m asl). We explain this small change in ELA with reference to the flat hypsometry of the palaeo ice cap and an enhanced aridity to the west of the Patagonian Andes caused by the existence of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) Patagonian ice sheet. Calculated annual accumulation values of ca. 402 to 957 mm/a at the ELA of the Meseta Cuadrada palaeo ice cap derived by a degree day model (DDM) during the last local glacial maximum extent are low compared with estimations of the current accumulation at the ELA of the remaining glacierized area of around 3789 mm/a. This strongly supports the existence of increased aridity and seasonality east of the Patagonian Andes during the Last Glacial Maximum, provided both maximum extents were synchronous.

Seasonal dynamics of chrysophyte stomatocyst formation in the plankton of Southern Baikal	BIOLOGY BULLETIN												The results of studies on the phytoplankton of Southern Baikal in 2004 show that siliceous stomatocysts (cysts) of chrysophyte algae make a significant contribution to this community. Their abundance reaches a peak of 46 800 cysts/L between August and October, when the concentration of biogenic elements is minimum. The D/C coefficient (the ratio of diatom cells to stomatocysts) varies during the year, reflecting the seasonal succession of phytoplankton and changes in the concentration of biogenic elements in the photic layer. Fifty morphotypes of the stomatocysts have been distinguished and divided into 25 groups by morphological characters. These groups differ in seasonal dynamics. The stomatocysts of group 5 (with spines of different lengths in the equatorial and posterior parts) dominate over other morphotypes and reach the highest concentration (13 600 cysts/L) in August. The data obtained in this study may provide an additional criterion for assessing the present-day state of Lake Baikal and for paleolimnological reconstructions.					; Likhoshway, Yelena/J-4496-2018; Tomberg, Irina/K-6819-2018	Likhoshway, Yelena/0000-0001-5745-6891; Likhoshway, Yelena/0000-0002-2432-9260; 													1062-3590					OCT	2008	35	5					507	514		10.1134/S1062359008050129	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1062359008050129													WOS:000259771900012

A geochemical and palynological study of lake sediments at Mboandong, Cameroon: Chemical weathering and vegetation linked to Holocene palaeoclimate	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												Geochemical and palynological analyses of core samples from Mboandong, a crater lake in western Cameroon, provide a record of response to climate and vegetation change in West Africa over the last 7000 years. Three palaeoclimatic phases were identified: a humid phase (6800-5700 cal. BP), characterized by a humid and warm palaeoclimate; a drying phase (5700-2000 cal. BP) with a less humid palaeoclimate; finally, a seasonal phase (2000 cal. BP to present), characterized by a seasonally varied, mainly humid and warm palaeoclimate. Pollen components show swamp and humid rainforest taxa being gradually replaced by semi-deciduous, regrowth and non-tree taxa such as grasses (Poaceae). There is a suggestion of increasing aridity over the last 200 years. The sediments are primarily weathered deposits mixed with volcanic eruptive material, rather than detritus derived from the UCC (upper continental crust). Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA) values are mostly high (mean 90.65%) and indicate a variable but mostly humid palaeoclimate. CIA values are most likely influenced by climate, as well as by runoff and physical erosion. Bands of volcanic ash are associated with frequent freshwater sponge spicules and diatoms, probably due to increased availability of silica. Ca and Na depletion is probably linked with soil leaching, while K depletion and Mg enrichment were probably caused by chemical alteration. Humid intervals may have higher organic carbon content, whereas increased amounts of iron occur in potentially drier intervals. A greatly increased presence of oil palm pollen (Elaeis guineensis) is interpreted as evidence of cultivation after 1700 cal.

Analysis of the effect of the quantity of inflow into Ebinur Lake on its ecological security	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The ecological security of lakes in arid areas is crucial for the sustainable development of regional society and the economy. The threat of dry lake-bottom dust and degradation of vegetation around lakes has become increasingly significant. This study proposes the maintenance of an optimal water surface area to ensure the ecological safety goals of Ebinur Lake. The study also conducts a scenario analysis of the amount of water entering the lake. Utilizing a Systeme Hydrologique Europeen (MIKE SHE) watershed model with four different inflow scenarios, the study simulated the Ebinur Lake's area changes under various water replenishment scenarios. Replenishment scenarios that meet the ecological security goals were selected for this study. The results indicate that maintaining a lake surface area of 710 km2 or more during warm season can prevent wind and sand fixation, while a lake surface area of no less than 500 km2 during dry season may help maintain ecological security.

Given that these ecosystems are vulnerable to extreme temperature events, it is crucial to assess the potential effects of climate change on the structure and functioning of lake ecosystems. Thus, this study applied the concept of heatwaves to assess its impacts in Lake Mangueira, a subtropical coastal shallow lake located in the Extreme South of Brazil. The Air2Water model was calibrated and used to estimate daily time-series water temperatures using daily time-series air temperatures as the input. The occurrence of lake heatwaves in Lake Mangueira was assessed over a historical period (1995-2014) and under three future (2081-2100) scenarios (SSP1- 2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5) based on data from 26 global climate models. The results were expressed in terms of five heatwave indexes, and most of the projections obtained indicated positive anomalies for all lake heatwave indexes, especially for the average duration and cumulative intensity and in the SSP5-8.5 scenario. Analysis of average duration, average intensity, and total duration reveled an increase in the annual mean values for the three future scenarios compared to the historical period, with SSP5-8.5 once again standing out. In addition, lake heatwaves lasting more than one season were observed for Lake Mangueira, with some projections indicating a permanent state of occurrence of these extreme events. Properly studying lake heatwaves is of paramount importance in the management of these ecosystems and their associated environmental services.					; Ribeiro Rodrigues, Lucia Helena/F-3136-2013; Rodrigues, Lucia/JAX-3956-2023; Tavares, Matheus/P-1701-2019	da Motta Marques, David/0000-0002-3809-8053; Ribeiro Rodrigues, Lucia Helena/0000-0003-2915-3185; Saldanha-Ferrari, Carlos Henrique/0009-0003-4214-1231; Tavares, Matheus/0000-0001-9341-5245													2509-9426	2509-9434				2024 DEC 6	2024										10.1007/s41748-024-00538-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41748-024-00538-2		DEC 2024											WOS:001371151200001
J	Smith, CD; Morgan, ER; Jones, RA				Smith, Christopher David; Morgan, Eric Rene; Jones, Rhys Aled			Environmental influences on the distribution and ecology of the fluke intermediate host Galba truncatula: a systematic review	PARASITOLOGY												Galba truncatula is one of the most distributed intermediate hosts of Fasciola hepatica across Europe, North Africa and South America. Therefore, understanding the environmental preferences of this species is vital for developing control strategies for fascioliasis and other trematodes such as Calicophoron daubneyi. This systematic literature review evaluates the current understanding of the snail's environmental preferences to identify factors which might aid control and areas where further research is needed. Searches were conducted using Google Scholar and PubMed and included papers published up to August 2023. After filtration, 198 papers with data from 64 countries were evaluated, and data regarding habitat type and habitat pH were noted, along with any other information pertaining to the snail's environmental preferences. The results show that G. truncatula can survive in a diverse range of climates and habitats, generally favours shallow slow-moving water or moist bare mud surfaces, temperatures between 10 and 25 degrees C and was found in habitats with a water pH ranging from 5.0 to 9.4. However, there is limited understanding of the impact of several factors, such as the true optimum pH and temperature preferences within the respective tolerance limits or the reason for the snail's apparent aversion to peatland. Further research is needed to clarify the impact of biotic and abiotic factors on the snail to create robust risk assessments of fluke infection and assess opportunities for environmental control strategies, and for predicting how the snail and fluke transmission may be impacted by climate change.

Reproductive advantages for common loons using rafts	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Artificial nesting islands, or rafts, are often deployed in common loon (Gavia immer) breeding territories to decrease negative impacts of mammalian predation and water-level fluctuations on nesting success. The management value of rafts has been demonstrated in other studies; however, no published studies have quantified the use or associated reproductive benefits of rafts on lakes exhibiting water-level fluctuations. These lakes constitute a major portion of loon nesting habitat in New England and the Midwest. We used long-term data sets from loon survey and raft management efforts on lakes with stable (SWL) and fluctuating water levels (FWL) in New Hampshire and Maine, USA, to compare raft-use patterns on both types of lakes. We then modeled the influence of percentage of nesting attempts on rafts, lake fluctuation type, and human development index on nesting success as a function of the number of nesting attempts. Loons used 76% of all rafts for nesting, and initial use patterns were similar between SWL and FWL lakes. Half (51%) of rafts used for nesting were first used during the initial year of deployment and 90% of those used were used by the third year. Based on our model, we would expect to see an 8.6% increase in nesting success associated with each successive categorical increase in raft use (0-33%, 33-60%, 60-100%). Nesting success varied with lake fluctuation type, increasing by 21.4% from FWL to SWL types. Our model estimated a 12.8% decrease in nesting success associated with an increasing human development index. Naturally nesting loons on FWL lakes are likely to display mean nesting success levels lower than those needed to sustain populations. We suggest that natural nesting habitat on lakes with fluctuating water levels during the loon nesting season may constitute an ecological trap warranting consideration of raft management. Findings in this study are germane for managing breeding loon populations, particularly those on reservoirs requiring permits from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

J	Riccardi, N; Giussani, G				Riccardi, Nicoletta; Giussani, Gianluigi			The relevance of life-history traits in the establishment of the invader Eudiaptomus gracilis and the extinction of Eudiaptomus padanus in Lake Candia (Northern Italy):: evidence for competitive exclusion?	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												The niches invaded by exotic species are generally not entirely vacant, and one possible factor affecting the success of the invader to establish a permanent large population may be the ability of the former to outcompete native species. Eudiaptomus gracilis, which was not present in Italy before the 1980s, is becoming established in an increasing number of Northern Italian lakes, ultimately replacing the endemic E. padanus. Coexistence of the two species in Lake Candia lasted only 7 months, suggesting that species replacement was determined either by environmental changes or by strong competition. To assess whether the potential for interspecific competition existed and to identify species' traits which could explain the competitive superiority of E. gracilis, we examined field seasonal patterns, reproductive parameters and body size of the two species. E. padanus abundance was probably reduced by predation and parasitism, which favoured the displacement of the species shortly after invasion by E. gracilis. The temporarily underexploited niche provided an opportunity for the successful establishment of the invader. The reproductive patterns of the two species were found to be similar in most of their features, with the exception of a markedly larger clutch size and a smaller egg volume in the resident species. By contrast, the invader showed a higher adult:egg ratio and a lower death rate. Thus, despite the greater fecundity of E. padanus, the competitive success of the invader might be attributable to interspecific differences in developmental rates and/or juvenile mortality.

Simulation of the short rains of 1988	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Regional Climate Model (RegCM2) is employed to investigate the physical mechanisms that govern the October-December rains over eastern Africa. The model employs the Mercator conformal projection, with a domain of 5580 km x 5040 km centered at 31 degrees E, 4 degrees S, and a horizontal grid point spacing of 60 km. The simulation period is October-December 1988, and the model initial and lateral boundary conditions are taken from ECMWF reanalysis. A number of month-long simulations have been conducted to optimize various parameterizations of the model which include the following factors: cumulus convection, moisture parameterization, radiative transfer formulation, surface processes, boundary layer physics, and the lateral boundary conditions. The model was successfully customized over eastern Africa. The model simulates the large-scale circulation characteristics over the region as well as local features such as the dominant precipitation maxims, the Turkana low-level jet, and the diurnal reversal in the lake/land breeze circulation over Lake Victoria. Several model deficiencies are also identified. They include a negative rainfall bias over the western portions of the domain and the Kenya Highlands and a temperature bias over the tropical forest regions. Systematic analysis of surface water budget reveals that evapotranspiration is a major sink in the water budget over the regions where precipitation is moderate or small, while the role of runoff and drainage becomes important over the regions where precipitation is abundant. The model simulations also suggest that during the short-rains season, the large-scale circulation anomalies play the most important role in shaping the precipitation anomalies.

Simulation of interannual variability of short rains	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES												We have applied the NCAR RegCM2 to the simulation of the interannual variability of precipitation over eastern Africa for the short-rains season by performing a set of experiments for the pears 1982 to 1993. The model reproduced the observed interannual variability of precipitation in most of the years. The results show that remote factors play a dominant role in determining the precipitation anomalies. Interannual variability of precipitation over Tanzania is closley related to El Nino events in their mature phase and sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. The southward shift of the Arabian High results in a southward shift of the zonal component of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which is responsible for early onset of the rainy season (e.g,, 1982 and 1986). The enhanced St. Helena High and weaker Mascarene High lead to the eastward shift of the meridional branch of the ITCZ for the wet pears. Model simulations confirmed a strong positive correlation between precipitation anomalies over Lake Victoria and the warm El Nino-Southern Oscillation events, by which enhanced moist westerly flow from the Atlantic Ocean and the mainly easterly flow from the Indian Ocean converge over Lake Victoria during wet years. The interannual variability of precipitation over Lake Victoria and the western Kenya Highlands (WKH) are strongly coupled. Positive precipitation anomalies over the WKH region are usually associated with weaker Arabian High and Mascarene High, which weaken the large-scale divergence over the WKH region and favor the development of convection. The interannual variability of precipitation over eastern Kenya Highlands (EKH) is not directly related to the El Nino events, but the association with a warm SST anomaly pattern over the western Indian Ocean is evident during wet years. An El Nino signal is, however, evident for wet years over the Turkana Channel, warm SST anomalies over the northern Indian Ocean contribute enhanced water vapor transport over the region.

For example, present-day montane vegetation of East Africa is characterized by different plant species that grow in and are restricted to certain elevations due to environmental tolerances. As climate changes and temperature/rainfall zones move on mountains, these species must rapidly adjust their ranges or risk extinction. Paleoenvironmental records offer valuable insights into past climate and ecosystem dynamics, aiding predictions for ongoing climate change impacts. In particular, warming and wetting in tropical East Africa during the mid-Holocene resulted in both lowland and highland forest expansion. However, the relative impacts of rainfall and temperature change on montane ecosystems along with the influence of lowland forest expansion on montane communities is not completely understood. We use fossil pollen to study the vegetation changes in two lakes at different altitudes in the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda: Lake Mahoma (Montane Forest belt) and Upper Kachope Lake (Afroalpine belt). Further, using the newly relaunched African Pollen Database and recent temperature reconstructions, we provide a regional synthesis of vegetation changes in the Rwenzori and then compare this with changes observed from other equatorial East African montane sites (particularly Mt Kenya). In the early to mid-Holocene in the Rwenzori Mountains, trees common today in lowland forests dominated, driven largely by warmer temperatures. After 4000 years ago (4ka), Afromontane forest trees along with grasses progressively replaced lowland trees. Not all sites experienced identical transitions. For instance, at Lake Rutundu on Mt Kenya at the same elevation as Lake Mahoma, bamboo expansion preceded Afromontane forest growth, likely influenced by variations in fire. Variance partitioning indicates that each site responded differently to changes in temperature and rainfall. Therefore, these site-specific ecological responses underscore the importance of considering biogeographic legacies as management strategies are developed, despite similarities in modern ecology.

Global Semantic Classification of Fluvial Landscapes with Attention-Based Deep Learning	REMOTE SENSING												Rivers occupy less than 1% of the earth's surface and yet they perform ecosystem service functions that are crucial to civilisation. Global monitoring of this asset is within reach thanks to the development of big data portals such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) but several challenges relating to output quality and processing efficiency remain. In this technical note, we present a new deep learning pipeline that uses attention-based deep learning to perform state-of-the-art semantic classification of fluvial landscapes with Sentinel-2 imagery accessed via GEE. We train, validate and test the network on a multi-seasonal and multi-annual dataset drawn from a study site that covers 89% of the Earth's surface. F1-scores for independent test data not used in model training reach 92% for rivers and 96% for lakes. This is achieved without post-processing and significantly reduced computation times, thus making automated global monitoring of rivers achievable.																				2072-4292				DEC	2024	16	24							4747	10.3390/rs16244747	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16244747													WOS:001384586400001

Additionally, we calculated the drought propagation characteristics in different periods using the run theory. Furthermore, based on copula function and conditional probability analysis, the transmission threshold of MD triggering HD was determined. New hydrological insights for the region: (i) Compared with the baseline period, the severity of HD in the Li River (LR) and Yuan River (YR) increased by 0.5 % and 1.3 % during the impacted period, respectively, while that in the Zi River (ZR) and Xiang River (XR) decreased by -25.9 % and -31.6 %, respectively; (ii) Human activities have weakened the correlation between HD and MD, resulting in various patterns of propagation time in different sub-basins and seasons; (iii) As a whole, propagation threshold from MD to HD became larger during the impacted period, with an average change rate from 0.9 % to 195.5 %.

Mapping Paleolacustrine Deposits with a UAV-borne Multispectral Camera: Implications for Future Drone Mapping on Mars	PLANETARY SCIENCE JOURNAL												NASA's Ingenuity Mars Helicopter has marked a new era in planetary exploration by employing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enhance our understanding of planetary surfaces. This study evaluates the potential of UAVs for mapping Martian environments, with Lake Natron, Tanzania, serving as an analog for Martian paleolakes. During two field seasons (2023 January and July), we used a Phantom 4 Pro drone equipped with a MicaSense RedEdge-M multispectral camera, supplemented by in situ analysis using a TerraSpec Halo VNIR-SWIR spectrometer, to capture high-resolution imagery and spectral data. Almost all image processing and analysis, except for image mosaic and digital elevation model (DEM) generation, was performed using Python scripting. We benchmarked the onboard image processing capabilities using a Raspberry Pi 5 single-board computer. Processing steps include digital number (DN)-to-radiance conversion, assessment of the best radiance-to-reflectance conversion method, image mosaic creation, DEM generation, calculation of optimal band indices, and selection of the best classification technique. The research underscores Lake Natron's diverse lithologies as a suitable analog site and demonstrates significant improvements in classification when normalized elevation data are incorporated with spectral index maps through unsupervised classification methods. The study also addresses challenges related to high-resolution image transmission and processing, advocating for advanced techniques such as image compression and low-power computational models. Additionally, it highlights computational and power limitations as key obstacles, suggesting that emerging technologies such as photonic computing and hybrid controllers could provide viable solutions. These findings emphasize the transformative potential of UAVs in planetary exploration while outlining key areas for future research and technological development.

Love Raman; Woolway, R. Iestyn			Increasing warm-season evaporation rates across European lakes under climate change	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Lakes represent a vital source of freshwater, accounting for 87% of the Earth's accessible surface freshwater resources and providing a range of ecosystem services, including water for human consumption. As climate change continues to unfold, understanding the potential evaporative water losses from lakes becomes crucial for effective water management strategies. Here we investigate the impacts of climate change on the evaporation rates of 23 European lakes and reservoirs of varying size during the warm season (July-September). To assess the evaporation trends, we employ a 12-member ensemble of model projections, utilizing three one-dimensional process-based lake models. These lake models were driven by bias-corrected climate simulations from four General Circulation Models (GCMs), considering both a historical (1970-2005) and future (2006-2099) period. Our findings reveal a consistent projection of increased warm-season evaporation across all lakes this century, though the magnitude varies depending on specific factors. By the end of this century (2070-2099), we estimate a 21%, 30% and 42% average increase in evaporation rates in the studied European lakes under RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 2.6, 6.0 and 8.5, respectively. Moreover, future projections of the relationship between precipitation (P) and evaporation (E) in the studied lakes, suggest that P-E will decrease this century, likely leading to a deficit in the availability of surface water. The projected increases in evaporation rates underscore the significance of adapting strategic management approaches for European lakes to cope with the far-reaching consequences of climate change.					; Shatwell, Tom/K-2937-2013; Couture, Raoul/AGR-6683-2022; Jennings, Eleanor/ISU-1018-2023; Shatwell, Tom/ABF-1308-2020; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010	verburg, piet/0000-0001-7574-9161; Shatwell, Tom/0000-0002-4520-7916; La Fuente Pillco, Ruth Sofia/0000-0002-9665-672X; Couture, Raoul/0000-0003-4940-3372; Kirillin, Georgiy/0000-0001-7337-3586													0165-0009	1573-1480				DEC	2024	177	12							173	10.1007/s10584-024-03830-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-024-03830-2													WOS:001365861900001

To investigate the endogenous phosphorus morphological features and migration patterns in lakes under the influence of agricultural irrigation areas, we analyzed the changes of polymorphic phosphorus content in lake sediments under irrigation withdrawal conditions based on field sampling tests and sediment phosphorus release dynamics simulation experiments and used the diffusive flux method to determine the flux of phosphorus release from the sediment-water interface (SWI). The results showed that: (1) Data from encrypted sampling during the receding period revealed total phosphorus (TP) of lake water decreased from 0.11 mg/L to 0.05 mg/L, and TP of sediment increased from 723.53 mg/kg to 955.89 mg/kg. (2) The order of polymorphic phosphorus content of sediments at the lake inlet before the irrigation period was Fe-Al bound phosphorus (NaOH-nrP) > insoluble phosphorus > Fe-Al oxide bound phosphorus (NaOH-rP) > Calcium bound phosphorus (Ca-P) > Fe-Mn chelated phosphorus (BD-P) > active phosphorus. Interconversion between sedimentary polymorphic phosphorus is more drastic after the irrigation period. (3) The phosphorus forms extracted from sediments were ranked as insoluble phosphorus > NaOH-nrP > NaOH-rP > active phosphorus > Ca-P > BD-P. Insoluble phosphorus is the predominant form of phosphorus in sediments. (4) The TP exchange fluxes between the SWI by the diffusive flux method were 0.30 mg/(m2<middle dot>h) and -0.33 mg/(m2<middle dot>h) respectively. Receding water conditions promote sediment adsorption of TP from overlying water. The research findings establish a theoretical foundation for endogenous phosphorus from lake sediments in agricultural irrigation areas.																			0269-4042	1573-2983				DEC	2024	46	12							528	10.1007/s10653-024-02315-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-024-02315-6								39589585					WOS:001364461200001

All the physicochemical parameters exhibited statistically significant differences based on both site and season (p < 0.01). The interaction term (Site x Season) was also kept in the model since it was statistically significant (p < 0.01). A parasitological survey of 360 schizothoracine fish revealed a 30.3% prevalence (109/360) of endohelminth infection. The study identified four predominant parasitic taxa across two distinct classes: Cestoda, including Adenoscolex oreini and Schyzocotyle acheilognathi, and Acanthocephala, comprising Pomphorhynchus kashmirensis and Neoechinorhynchus manasbalensis. For the assessment of parasitic load, we calculated the prevalence, mean intensity, mean abundance, and index of infection for each sampling period. Correspondence analysis identified associations between parasite occurrence and specific water quality parameters. Regression analysis, including R-2 and p values, demonstrated a positive correlation between the number of parasites and both the proportion of infected fish and the ratio of infected to examined fish. Given that parasitic load is significantly influenced by a range of water quality parameters, fish parasites can serve as a robust indicator of declining water quality. Fish parasites are highly sensitive to water quality changes such as pollutants, toxins, and fluctuations in pH, temperature, and oxygen levels. Deteriorating water quality can stress fish, compromising their immune systems and increasing their susceptibility to parasitic infections. Additionally, complex life cycles of parasites can be disrupted by poor water conditions, making them indicators of water quality issues.					; Ahmad, Fayaz/KGM-9039-2024	Shah, Ishteyaq Majeed/0000-0003-4805-334X; 													0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2024	196	12							1156	10.1007/s10661-024-13306-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-024-13306-6								39496975					WOS:001347912600007

Abundance, food habits, and breeding season of exotic Tilapia zillii and native Oreochromis niloticus L. fish species in Lake Zwai, Ethiopia	MAEJO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Relative abundance, diet and breeding season overlap in the reproduction of exotic Tilapia zillii and native Oreochromis niloticus in Lake Zwai were studied from samples collected over 12 months. Younger fish of both species collected were also evaluated for food composition. Food items from stomachs of both species were collected and analysed using the frequency of occurrence method. In terms of number, T. zillii dominated O. niloticus at the sampling sites. In both species, macrophytes, detritus, blue green algae, diatoms, green algae, Ceratium, Euglena, and Phacus constituted foods of plant origin, whereas chironomid larvae, Copepoda, Cladocera, Rotifera, Nematoda, fish eggs, and fish scales constituted foods of animal origin. Foods of the latter type such as Ephemeroptera and mollusks were also noted in the diet of adult T. zillii. Despite the extensive overlap in food habits of the two species, however, the food items were found in the diet of the species with different average percentage frequencies of occurrence. The level of gonad maturation and gonadosomatic index (GSI) values showed that in Lake Zwai breeding was year-round for both T. zillii and O. niloticus, with a peak during April-September and February-August respectively, indicating extended breeding season overlap in reproduction. The two species were always found together in the catches from the sampling sites, which indicated some niche overlap between them.																			1905-7873					APR-JUL	2008	2	2					345	359																WOS:000264644700010

It is situated between latitudes 16 degrees 32' and 16 degrees 47'N and longitudes 81 degrees 05' and 81 degrees 27'E. The use of pesticides for agricultural purposes is widespread in the Kolleru Lake region. The biological indicators like fish help in the studies of aquatic pollution by pesticides. Fish species Channa striata and Catla catla and water samples were collected from Kolleru Lake in each of three seasons over a period of three years. Fish samples were analyzed according to a modified method which is proposed for the gas chromatographic determination for the pesticides viz., alpha -BHC, gamma -BHC, malathion, chloirpyrifos, isodrin, endosulfan, dieldrin, and p,p-DDT. Water samples were analyzed for selected physico-chemical parameters. The extraction efficiency for the selected pesticides is between 82.8% and 91.2%. The maximum concentrations of pesticide residues in Kolleru Lake fish on wet weight basis are 123.8 mug/g for alpha -BHC, 98.7 mug/g for gamma -BHC, 2.5 mug/g for malathion, 88.6 mug/g for chlorpyrifos, 0.91 mug/g for isodrin, 76.5 mug/g for endosulfan, 1.98 mug/g for dieldrin, and 157.4 mug/g for p,p-DDT These analyses were used to evaluate the baseline data and the pesticide pollution in the lake's ecosystem.

J	Hamer, JMM; Sheldon, ND				Hamer, Jessica M. M.; Sheldon, Nathan D.			Neoichnology at lake margins: Implications for paleo-lake systems	SEDIMENTARY GEOLOGY												Neoichnological studies provide significant information that can aid in the interpretation of ancient ichnological assemblages. Here we examine, for the first time, the pattern in both vertebrate and invertebrate trace distribution and abundance that can be seen in two geographically separate, but broadly analogous, contemporary semi-arid climate lake margin settings in an effort to describe taphonomic processes relevant to paleo-lake systems. Lake margin to supralittoral zone transects were made at Ruby Reservoir, Montana (USA) and La Sotonera, Spain and vegetation cover, trace cover %, trace diversity, and substrate characteristics were recorded. Similar patterns in trace distribution were seen through the eulittoral to supralittoral zones, with the majority of traces identified within a single transect present at both sites. However, a few traces attributed to larger organisms were found to be unique to each and in some instances, could to be assigned to a specific trace maker. The eulittoral zone was considered to have characteristics attributable to the Scoyenia ichnofacies, however, analysis of the supralittoral zone shows some characteristics of both the Coprinisphaera and the Mermia ichnofacies. In addition, a transitional zone between a Scoyenia-like ichnofacies and a fully terrestrial assemblage was found, which may enable continental ichnofacies to be further refined for application to paleo-lake systems. Study of the distribution of traces with distance along the transects also suggests taphonomic biases against the preservation of certain types of traces (e.g., avian) due to seasonal fluctuations of the lake level and the subsequent reduced preservation potential for lake-proximal traces.

J	Castillo, MM; Kling, GW; Allan, JD				Castillo, MM; Kling, GW; Allan, JD			Bottom-up controls on bacterial production in tropical lowland rivers	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												The importance of organic carbon and inorganic nutrients in controlling bacterial production was investigated in two tropical lowland rivers draining undisturbed forested catchments. Glucose (C), ammonium (N), phosphate (P), leaf leachate, and algal leachate were added alone or combined to water collected from one clear-water (Cataniapo) and one black-water (Autana) river of the Middle Orinoco basin, and bacterial production (BP)was measured at 0, 8, 24, and 36 h of incubation. The rivers have low pH (3.8-5.9) and conductivity (6.3-9.1 muS cm(-1)) and abundant nitrogen (total N, 273-314 mug L-1) compared to phosphorus (total P, 3.6-5.5 mug L-1). BP was significantly stimulated by additions of P, CP NP, and CNP in both river waters. N or C alone or combined did not stimulate BP, suggesting that P rather than carbon is the primary limiting nutrient in these rivers.. Higher responses to CNP and CP amendments (3-7 times over controls), compared to P and NP (1.3-4 times over controls), indicate that carbon is an important secondary constraint to bacterial production. Responses to NP and P were more frequent in the Autana than in the Cataniapo, suggesting that bacteria in the clear-water river were less resource limited than those in the black-water river. Responses to added leaf leachate, which had high concentrations of P and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), were generally greater than responses to added algal leachate. Seasonal patterns in response to nutrient addition suggest that the size of the labile fraction of DOC may increase during periods of low and rising water.					; Kling, George/C-7867-2015; Allan, James/B-1160-2010; Castillo, Maria/D-1759-2013	Castillo Uzcanga, Maria Mercedes/0000-0002-6623-6513; Kling, George/0000-0002-6349-8227; 													0024-3590					JUL	2003	48	4					1466	1475		10.4319/lo.2003.48.4.1466	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2003.48.4.1466													WOS:000184247900011
J	Diamond, SA; Peterson, GS; Tietge, JE; Ankley, GT				Diamond, SA; Peterson, GS; Tietge, JE; Ankley, GT			Assessment of the risk of solar ultraviolet radiation to amphibians. III. Predictions of impacts in selected northern midwestern wetlands	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Solar ultraviolet radiation, especially UVB (280-320 nm), has been hypothesized to be at least partially responsible for adverse effects (e.g., declines and malformations) in amphibian species throughout the world. Evaluation of this hypothesis has been limited by the paucity of high-quality UV dose-response data and reliable estimates of typical UV doses that occur in amphibian habitats. In this preliminary risk assessment for effects of UV radiation on amphibians, dose-response relationships quantified in outdoor experiments were compared with UV exposure estimates for 26 wetlands in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin. A comparison of wetland doses, derived from model prediction, historical data, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) characterization, with experimental effects levels for green (R. clamitans), northern leopard (R. pipiens), and mink (R. septentrionalis) frogs indicated that the risk of mortality and malformations due to UV exposure is low for the majority of wetlands evaluated. Wetland UV dose, averaged over the entire breeding season, exceeded effects doses for mortality for all three species in two of the 26 wetlands examined and for one species in an additional wetland. On the basis of evidence that shorter term doses caused mortality in amphibian larvae, 3-day doses were also evaluated. In three of the wetlands examined, 3-day doses in excess of 85% of full sunlight(the level that appeared to trigger effects in controlled experimentation) occurred at frequencies ranging 22-100% for all three species and at frequencies ranging from 15% to 58% for R. pipiens and R. septentrionalis in three additional wetlands. Risk of malformation in R. pipiens was apparent in five of the 26 wetlands evaluated. Overall, estimated UVB doses in 21 of the wetlands never exceeded experimental effects doses for mortality or malformations. These results suggest that most amphibians are not currently at significant risk for UVB effects in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin wetlands. However, continued reduction of ozone and other global climate change effects may increase UV doses in wetlands, suggesting that the risk of UV to amphibians should continue to be monitored and studied.																			0013-936X					JUL 1	2002	36	13					2866	2874		10.1021/es011197d	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es011197d								12144260					WOS:000176591600029

This study, through case studies of seasonal ice lakes and glacier-originated rivers, complemented by global data, offers novel insights into radium (Ra) isotopes' characteristic in the cryosphere. It elucidates the quantification of the "Ra quartet" as tracers in frozen hydrological processes across various timescales. (1) Theoretical case studies. Significant differences in water chemistry and Ra activities were observed, highlighting distinct Ra supply and depletion mechanisms. The improved Ra mass model was utilized to estimate the freezing duration of the lakes and the groundwater discharge beneath the ice, while also elucidating the recharge dynamics of groundwater along glacial rivers. (2) Global scale theoretical discoveries. The low 224Ra/228Ra ratio, including the case studies presented, may be a significant characteristic of the non-subterranean cryosphere. This phenomenon can be attributed to various processes, including decay, particulate scavenging, groundwater discharge, upwelling, and glacial meltwater. In contrast, the ratio observed in permafrost is more complex, potentially influenced by diverse hydrogeological conditions and intricate sampling protocols. While Ra isotopes are well-traced in the ocean cryosphere-covering groundwater discharge, water exchange, and composition-particle interactions-their application in terrestrial and atmospheric cryospheric studies remains underexplored. Our study provides novel perspectives on Ra isotopes in the cryosphere, offering crucial theoretical and practical implications for addressing ongoing climate warming.																			0921-8181	1872-6364				JAN	2025	244								104654	10.1016/j.gloplacha.2024.104654	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2024.104654		NOV 2024											WOS:001369974300001

Fish were collected with electrofishing equipment in 15 sites covering different regions, substrate types and riparian vegetation, distributed throughout the Caguacu River, Caxambu, Pirai and Guapeva River micro-basins, during the rainy (January/February) and dry season (June) of 2007. The 589 specimens analyzed from 22 species, were assigned to different trophic groups, discriminated through a matrix of similarity, based on the food index (IA(i)). The results show the formation of seven groups with a predominance of insectivorous and omnivorous species, followed by detritivores, piscivores, omnivore-carnivores and herbivores, which consumed mostly items of autochthonous origin, where algae and young insects were dominant. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), correlating the biomass of trophic groups to environmental variables, showed that omnivores, insectivores and omnivore-carnivores displayed a wide distribution, while detritivores, herbivores and piscivores were restricted to specific locations, related to different physical and chemical variables as total nitrogen, conductivity and temperature. Despite the increase in total biomass at the most urbanized sites, the results indicate that the streams maintain a diverse community, suggesting that most of them are in preserved conditions.

Despite recent policy decisions, few published studies exist on the concentrations, sources, and fate of MTBE in surface waters. The purpose of this study was to determine(1) the relative contribution of motorized watercraft as a source of MTBE, (2) its seasonal distribution, (3) loss from the water column, (4) the extent of Vertical transport, and (5) its persistence between yea rs; this work was done in Donner Lake, California, a multiple-use lake in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. MTBE measurements were made at 9 individual depths from surface to bottom on 16 dates. Recreational boating was the most important source of MTBE. Statistically, 86% of the change in MTBE was explained by variation in motorized watercraft use. Neither highway runoff nor precipitation contributed significantly. MTBE concentration ranged from <0.1 mu g.L-1 to a high of 12 mu g.L-1 Between July 1 and 7, 1997, MTBE content rose dramatically from 115 to 365 kg. By January, levels had declined to a minimum of 15 kg, suggesting little interannual persistence. The major loss of MTBE appeared to be volatilization at the air-water interface characterized by two distinct peri ods. During the boating season, MTBE decline was 1.2 kg.day(-1) (193 day half-life). At the end of the boating season, MTBE loss increased to 8.1 kg.day(-1) (14 day half-life). Thermal stratification acted to retard MTBE transport to deeper depths.																			0013-936X					DEC 1	1998	32	23					3666	3672		10.1021/es9805223	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es9805223													WOS:000077282500023
J	Xia, FY; Lv, GH				Xia, Feiying; Lv, Guanghui			Evaluation of machine learning algorithm capability for Bosten Lake Wetland classification based on multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												As crucial carbon sinks within terrestrial ecosystems, wetlands have been extensively studied in terms of spatio-temporal distributions. However, existing methods for classifying wetlands are of limited accuracy, and it is difficult to acquire consistent samples over time. Therefore, precise classification methods are required to facilitate wetland conservation and ecological restoration. In this study, multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms in combination with feature sets based on Sentinel-2 data were used to accurately classify the land-use types (LUTs) of the Bosten Lake Wetland (BLW) in Xinjiang, China. The enhanced water index (EWI), modified normalised difference water index (MNDWI), and normalised difference water index (NDWI) were selected to extract water information and distinguish water bodies from land surfaces in the BLW. Three classification plans based on vegetation indices, water indices, and textural features were developed using artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) algorithms. Plan 9 combined vegetation water and texture with the highest overall accuracy (OA) 91.02 % and kappa coefficient (KC) 0.89. This plan obtained a producer accuracy of over 90 % for lake wetlands, river wetlands, grassland wetlands, mud flats, and farmland and > 83 % for construction land and bareland. According to Plan 9, the wetland area during 2018-2023 showed noticeable seasonal fluctuations but stable interannual changes. Conversely, non-wetland areas demonstrated significant interannual fluctuations, particularly in bareland and farmland, which might have been influenced by urbanisation and ecological policies. This study provides insights into the data sources, feature selection, and methodological approaches for wetland information extraction in arid regions.																			1574-9541	1878-0512				DEC	2024	84								102839	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102839	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102839		NOV 2024											WOS:001397838000001

Gut contents were compared between different larval instars and cohorts, and to the surface sediment. The composition of the gut contents of all instars was different from that of the sediment surface. The first instar selected small diatoms of the genus Fragilaria, as single and paired cells, and the fourth instar selected detritus items of more variable size and origin. Apart from the third instar larvae, there were similar trends in food selectivity between the same instar of different cohorts.

J	Behling, H; Hooghiemstra, H				Behling, H; Hooghiemstra, H			Late Quaternary palaeoecology and palaeoclimatology from pollen records of the savannas of the Llanos Orientales in Colombia	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Pollen analysis of sediment cores from Laguna Angel (4 degrees 28'N, 70 degrees 34'W, 200 m elevation) and Laguna Sardinas (4 degrees 58'N, 69 degrees 28'W, 80 m a.s.l.) in the savannas of the Llanos Orientales of Colombia are presented. The pollen record of Laguna Angel includes 7 radiocarbon dates and shows the Holocene vegetation and climatic history since 10,030 yr B.P. The record of Laguna Sardinas includes 7 radiocarbon dates and shows the late Glacial and Holocene history since 11,570 yr B.P. Both pollen records show that the present-day savanna vegetation, dominated by grassland (Poaceae) with only few woody savanna taxa (e.g. Curatella, Bryrsonima), was present since the late Glacial, indicating dry climatic conditions with a marked dry season. Shrubs and trees of forest and/or gallery forest, e.g. Mauritia, Mauritiella; Moraceae/Urticaceae, Melastomataceae, Alchornea, and Myrtaceae are well represented during the recorded period. The proportions between forest and savanna were subject to change in the past: but also the composition of the forest and savanna ecosystems changed. Laguna Sardinas shows a greater abundance during the late Glacial/Holocene transition than today for Alchornea, especially from 10,680 to 10,070 yr B.P. For this interval, synchronous to the El Abra stadial (Younger Dryas equivalent) in Colombia, more humid climatic conditions have been inferred, which are primarily the result of higher moisture levels under colder conditions. During the early and middle Holocene, from 9730 to 5260 yr B.P. in Laguna Angel, and from 9390 to 6390 yr B.P. in Laguna Sardinas, the maximum expansion of grassland occurred, indicating very dry climatic conditions. The following period: from 5260 to 3890 yr B.P. in Laguna Angel, and from 6390 to 3680 yr B.P. in Laguna Sardinas, shows a decrease of savanna herbs and an increase of forest and gallery forests, reflecting a wetter period, probably with a shorter annual dry season. In both lake records, the period after ca. 3500 yr B.P. is incomplete, but is characterized by a high representation of the palm genera Mauritiella in Laguna Angel, and Mauritia in Laguna Sardinas. This marked change has been interpreted as evidence of strong a anthropogenic influence on the vegetation, but also wetter climatic conditions than during the late Glacial and early and middle Holocene periods.

This study aimed to characterize the variations in the seasonal freeze-thaw fronts of diverse alpine grasslands and their effects on hydrothermal processes in the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB). Field experiments were carried out on alpine meadow and steppe transition (AMS), alpine steppe (ASP) and Achnatherum splendens steppe (AST) ecosystems in the QLB, with 2 years of continuous high-frequency year-round observations. The results revealed that the seasonal freeze-thaw front was characterized by three distinct stages, in which the durations of slow freezing period (SF) and thawing period (T) were much shorter than that of rapid freezing period (RF). The maximum seasonal freezing depth in 2018-2020 were ranged from AMS (322.65 cm), AST (271.98 cm) and ASP (200.00 cm). The liquid soil volumetric water content (SVWC) decreased in all three ecosystems during the RF period, but increased during the SF and T periods. During the RF period, the SVWC of the AMS, ASP and AST decreased the most by -13.28 %, -9.52 % and - 15.29 %, respectively. In the SF period, the SVWC of the AMS, ASP and AST increased the most, by 3.97 %, 9.52 % and 6.33 %, respectively, and by 13.37 %, 12.73 % and 12.44 % in the T period. During the freeze-thaw process, the SVWC and soil temperature mainly exhibit logarithmic and quadratic functions. The changes in the freeze-thaw front and SVWC in AMS were largely consistent, while those in ASP and AST experienced time lags. The freeze-thaw depth and net radiation of the RF, SF and T periods were fitted via the quadratic polynomial method. The freeze-thaw depth and soil heat flux were linearly fitted in the RF and SF periods, and the quadratic polynomial method was used in the T period. The effect of net radiation and soil heat flux accumulation on thawing front were more obvious in AMS than in ASP and AST. These findings are important for improving our understanding of water and heat transfer processes during the freeze-thaw period.

Hydrochemistry of alluvial aquifer in the Cobra River sub-basin	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL												The regional characteristics of waters from alluvial aquifers are different, since they depend on geology and climate. Also, there may be local variation in the quality of the available water when the water source is superficial (rivers and lakes) or is underground due to geology. In order to investigate the groundwater quality of the alluvial aquifer in the Sub-Basin of the Cobra River (RN) for construction of underground dams, five wells, four in the main river and one in the tributary, were monitored in dry and rainy seasons, during two hydrological years. Fifteen water samples from 'Amazonas' wells were collected for hydrochemical assessment. Multivariate analysis were performed to evaluate the origin of aquifer recharge and water hydrochemical characteristics. Hydrochemical assessment results indicated that Na+ and Cl- ions have greater influence on the salinization of the studied area. There are risks of worsening salinization and toxicity problems in the middle and lower courses of the Cobra River Sub-Basin.

Recent research has focused on ecological factors associated with influenza incidence and has also studied influenza with respect to its geographic spread at different scales. This research explores the temporal and spatial parameters of influenza and identifies factors influencing its transmission. A spatial autocorrelation analysis, a spatial-temporal cluster analysis and a spatial regression analysis of influenza rates, carried out in Jiangsu province from 2004 to 2011, found that influenza rates to be spatially dependent in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2008. South-western districts consistently revealed hotspots of high-incidence influenza. The regression analysis indicates that railways, rivers and lakes are important predictive environmental variables for influenza risk. A better understanding of the epidemic pattern and ecological factors associated with pandemic influenza should benefit public health officials with respect to prevention and controlling measures during future epidemics.

J	Dang, L; Ma, C; Wang, HX				Dang, Li; Ma, Chao; Wang, Haixia			Effects of vanishing power-law tails of river flows caused by damming on downstream hydrological connectivity	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												High-intensity dam operations have severely disturbed the power-law behaviors of natural river flows, which have important implications for the entire ecosystem's integrity, diversity, and sustainability. This study investigated the effects of vanishing power-law tails of river flows caused by damming on downstream hydrological connectivity in the Wanquan river-floodplain (China) and determined the consequent ecological responses. A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model was established to estimate inundation regimes under different hydrological scenarios, and a statistics-based method was used to generate vanishing power-law tails. Connectivity assessments quantified the duration, magnitude, accumulation, and efficiency of connection events in the river-floodplain system for historical hydrological processes, current dam operating schemes, and simulated flow series with compressed power-law tails. The results showed significant reductions in downstream connection duration, magnitude, accumulation, and efficiency with compression of the natural power-law tail, especially for small (P < 20 %) and large (P > 90 %) connection events. Under a fully modified scenario, the cumulative large connection events were reduced by as much as 50 %. Damming also diminished the seasonal fluctuations of lateral exchanges and weakened the synergetic relationships among inflows, inundation extents and connectivity in the river-floodplain system. Furthermore, increasing damming led to an exponential and accelerated loss of downstream connectivity, with noticeable inflection points. Reduced or insulated hydrological exchanges would weaken material cycling, energy flow, and information transmission in the river-floodplain system, ultimately impacting the entire aquatic ecosystem. Our study emphasizes the importance of the power-law tail in the estimation of natural flows, which, although accounting for only a small part of the whole flow series (approximately 6 % in this case), is of great significance for maintaining the downstream connectivity necessary for healthy aquatic ecosystems.																			0022-1694	1879-2707				JAN	2025	646								132317	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132317	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.132317		NOV 2024											WOS:001363072700001
J	Pinski, RA; Mattson, WJ; Raffa, KF				Pinski, RA; Mattson, WJ; Raffa, KF			Composition and seasonal phenology of a nonindigenous root-feeding weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) complex in northern hardwood forests in the Great Lakes region	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												Phyllobius oblongus (L.), Polydrusus sericeus (Schaller), and Sciaphilus asperatus (Bonsdorff) comprise a complex of nonindigenous root-feeding weevils in northern hardwood forests of the Great Lakes region. Little is known about their detailed biology, seasonality, relative abundance, and distribution patterns. We studied 10 sites over a 2-yr period. Two sites were in northeastern Wisconsin, and eight were in the neighboring southern upper peninsula of Michigan. Larval abundance was estimated by soil sampling, and adult abundance was estimated by sweep netting, emergence trapping, and beating samples. Sweep netting collected the most weevils overall (71.0%), whereas beating and emergence traps collected 22.1 and 6.9%, respectively. P. sericeus were the predominant larvae, representing 34.3% of total Curculionidae, whereas P. oblongus were the predominant adults, representing 66.4% of Curculionidae. Few S. asperatus and Trachyphloeus aristatus (Gyllenhal) larvae and adults were collected, with the latter being a new record for Wisconsin. Two additional species, Barypeithes pellucidus (Boheman) and an undetermined Polydrusus sp., were collected only as larvae. Six species of curculionids were collected overall, with at least five being confirmed as nonindigenous species. P. oblongus and P. sericeus adults were the most abundant. These did not coincide temporally. Over 63% of P. oblongus and F. sericeus were collected during single 4-wk intervals in mid-June and mid-July, respectively. Conversely, S. asperatus adults overlapped with both other species, occurring sparingly from 4 June through 28 August. One species was predominant at each site and generally accounted for >= 80% of the total weevil population. P. oblongus larvae and adults predominated in five and eight sites, respectively, whereas P. sericeus and S. asperatus larvae and adults predominated in one site each. Adult and larval populations were generally clustered. We evaluated vertical stratification of P. sericeus larvae in the soil, and most were located within the top 10 cm.																			0046-225X					APR	2005	34	2					298	307		10.1603/0046-225X-34.2.298	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-34.2.298													WOS:000228262000009
J	Barth, JAC; Veizer, J; Mayer, B				Barth, JAC; Veizer, J; Mayer, B			Origin of particulate organic carbon in the upper St. Lawrence: isotopic constraints	EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS												Seven sampling locations in the upper St. Lawrence River near the city of Cornwall (Ontario, Canada), including the main river and six near-shore ecosystems (a creek, embayments and a wetland) were studied in order to determine the origin of particulate organic carbon. Parameters studied included chlorophyll-a (chl-a), particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), as well as the isotopic compositions of the latter two (delta(13)C(POC), delta(13)C(DIC)). The results show that in situ photosynthesis and detrital inputs are both significant contributors to the POC pool in the isolated embayments. The former dominates during warm seasons, with POC concentrations up to 2663 mu g/l and chi-a concentrations up to 26.1 mu g/l. Near-shore ecosystems have a wide range of delta(13)C(POC) values (-31.5 to -16.3 parts per thousand), but this variability is not reflected in the 'Main Channel'. There, the delta(13)C(POC) Signal is uniformly close to -27 parts per thousand, in accord with estimates from earlier studies on the river's estuary This suggests that the POC contribution from near-shore ecosystems is minor. Although the 'Main Channel' has low chl-a concentrations, model calculations suggest that most of its POC originates from photosynthetic activity, probably within the Great Lakes.

Initial measurements of benthic photosynthesis and respiration in Lake Erie	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												The first reported in situ measurements of benthic primary production in Lake Erie were made on rocky substrata using oxygen and dissolved inorganic carbon change in 1997 and 1998. The productivity quotient for net benthic algal growth was determined to be 1.1 based on contemporaneous measurement of oxygen production and carbon uptake. Highest rates of gross photosynthesis were > 300 mg O-2/m(2)/h on rocky substrata with mixed stands of Cladophora and dreissenid mussels. These stands also exhibited the greatest rates of oxygen consumption in the dark. Bare rock substrata had lower rates of gross photosynthesis than rock occupied by mussels or Cladophora, but even these habitats had rates that would place them among the highest rates measured in fresh water. Areal benthic photosynthetic rates would greatly exceed areal pelagic photosynthesis in depths shallower than 5 m depth in the eastern basin; and, at greater depths, the importance of declining benthic areal photosynthesis relative to generally increasing integral pelagic production with depth would depend on substratum type and water clarity. Dreissenid mussels had a positive effect on benthic photosynthesis that was especially evident in stimulating Cladophora growth over the course of the 1998 season.

There was little evidence of size differences between sexes. Opaque zones on otoliths corresponded to the period of peak of reproductive activity and low fish body condition (K). When aggregated across sites, linear estimates for growth of fish >age I were 57.5, 27.6, and 19.6 mm year(-1) for C. temensis, C. orinocensis, and C. intermedia, respectively. Fish from the Cinaruco River appeared to spawn at age I, and prior to first maturation had grown 25, 21, and 23 mm month(-1), respectively, for C. temensis, C. orinocensis, and C. intermedia. There was little intersite variation in growth rates, and differences in sizes of conspecifics from different sizes were due to age differences. Cichla in captivity spawn several times per year. The present results indicate that the annual cycle or tropical wet/dry seasonality promotes reproductive seasonality in Cichla. The energetic cost of reproduction and brood defence probably constrains most individuals to one spawn per year. Conversely, populations living in relatively aseasonal reservoir environments may have several spawns per year, in which case growth zones on hard structures are difficult to interpret.

Adult lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescensRafinesque, 1817) occurrence in the Muskegon River system, a Lake Michigan drowned river mouth, USA	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY												Recent advancements in telemetry have allowed managers and researchers to conduct comprehensive studies on the movement ecology of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), a species of conservation concern in most of the Laurentian Great Lakes basin. In Michigan waters of Lake Michigan, drowned river mouth systems (a protected lake-like habitat that connects a river to lake) support 4 of 11 remaining lake sturgeon populations. One of those remnant populations is supported by the Muskegon River, a drowned river mouth system consisting of both Muskegon Lake and the Muskegon River. The objectives of this 6-year telemetry study were to determine whether adult lake sturgeon occupied the Muskegon River system outside of the spawning season (defined as March to July), to quantify their use of the system annually, and to identify and characterize patterns in occurrence. A total of 21 adult lake sturgeon implanted with acoustic transmitters were passively monitored throughout the year during 2012-2017. Eighty-two percent of tagged fish at large were detected >= 1 day in the Muskegon River system annually, and tagged lake sturgeon were frequently detected during both spawning and non-spawning time periods. Residency index (i.e., no. detection days/365 days) values indicated that adult lake sturgeon were not only detected throughout the year but that they occupied the Muskegon River system for an average of 130 days each year (residency index = 0.36 +/- 0.05 SE) during our most spatially intensive acoustic monitoring in 2016-2017. Additionally, 24% of tagged lake sturgeon were primary residents (i.e., residency index >0.5) of the Muskegon River system in both years. Adult lake sturgeon followed 1 of 3 patterns of occurrence based on individual detection histories, and those patterns varied temporally and by the relative amount of use (i.e., high, medium, and low). Our findings build on previous research that found drowned river mouth systems in Lake Michigan can be important nursery habitats for juvenile lake sturgeon by showing that these habitats also can be used extensively by adult lake sturgeon throughout the year.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				OCT	2020	36	5					547	558		10.1111/jai.14076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.14076		JUL 2020											WOS:000553381400001

The Badenian evaporite basin of the northern Carpathian Foredeep as a model of a meromictic selenite basin	EVAPORITES THROUGH SPACE AND TIME	Geological Society Special Publication											The hydrography and brine flow patterns in the Middle Miocene (Badenian) evaporite basin of the northern Carpathian Foredeep (in Ukraine, Poland and the Czech Republic) are reconstructed based on studies of the peculiar, conformably oriented, bottom-grown gypsum crystals present in the selenite deposits along the basin margin. The crystal apices are turned in a similar horizontal direction that is interpreted as the product of consistent flow of the bottom brines during crystal formation. Similarly the regular millimetre-scale growth zoning in these crystals presumably reflects the annual stratification-mixing pattern in the brine column typical of monomictic basins. In the central, deeper parts of the basin deposition was dominated by Na-chloride, and the selenitic facies are lacking. These central areas are interpreted as being meromictic during the oriented selenite deposition. The permanent pycnocline separated a mixolimnion, at the surface, from an anoxic (euxinic) monimolimnion, at the bottom, where direct evaporative crystallization of gypsum was not possible. The mixolimnion, which extended far onto the shallow margin of the basin, showed only a seasonal (annual) pycnocline and monomictic hydrography. Oriented selenites grew just in this mixolimnetic marginal zone, under predominantly counterclockwise (cyclonic) flow.

J	Rustomji, P				Rustomji, Paul			Flood and drought impacts on the opening regime of a wave-dominated estuary	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Wave-dominated estuaries are affected by floods generated in their hinterland catchments as well as marine tide and wave processes. The interaction of these terrestrial and marine influences controls the opening regime of the estuary. Despite the well documented environmental pressures on estuaries including elevated nutrient loadings and abstraction of river flows, little research concerning the variability and controls on estuary mouth opening regimes exists. From water level observations of Tuross Lake estuary in south-eastern Australia, the estuary's recent opening regime is reconstructed and shown to vary significantly over time. Floodwaters fill the estuary and scour the estuary mouth, enhancing the exchange of marine water between the estuary and the ocean, which manifests as an increased tidal range within the estuary. Between floods, tide and wave activity caused aggradation of the estuary mouth such that the tidal range within the estuary declined by -0.5 to -0.7mm per day as the mouth became more constricted. Under conditions of low river flow, high evaporative losses and seasonal reductions in ocean wave height, the estuary mouth can close completely. Using twentieth century streamflow estimates, it is shown that hydrologic variability is likely to have resulted in large variations in the estuary's opening regime. Since 2000, there have been relatively few flood-driven scour events and this explains the relatively congested state of the current estuary mouth. Predicted hydrologic changes under enhanced atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are also likely to enhance the variability in the estuary's opening regime.

Most antibiotics are water-soluble and cannot be fully absorbed by humans or animals. If feces or wastewater containing antibiotics are improperly treated or discharged directly into surface water or groundwater, it will undoubtedly have an impact on aquatic organisms. The Ganjiang River is the largest river in Jiangxi Province and the largest tributary of Poyang Lake Basin. Jinjiang River, a tributary of Ganjiang River, is a typical livestock and poultry breeding area in the Poyang Lake Basin, along which many townships and counties are distributed. Gao'an and Shanggao counties are important agricultural and animal husbandry production areas in Jiangxi Province. In this paper, automatic solid phase extraction-ultra high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPE-UPLC-MS/MS) technology was used to simultaneously detect 27 antibiotics in 5 categories of macrolides, tetracyclines, quinolones, nitroimidazoles and sulfonamides in water. Based on this method, the concentrations and distributions of these antibiotics were analyzed. Ecological risk assessment of the Jinjiang River Basin was conducted using the ecological risk quotient method, aiming to supplement antibiotic data in the Jinjiang River Basin and provide scientific basis for local ecological environment management. The research results indicate that from 2019 to 2021, two years later, there was an increase in the use of Sulfadiazine and Roxithromycin in the Jinjiang River Basin, while the usage of Ciprofloxacin and Oxytetracycline was relatively low. In 2021, out of the 27 antibiotics, 24 were detected in surface water, 20 in groundwater, and all in wastewater. Among them, Sulfamethoxazole was the most widely used antibiotic, primarily in livestock and poultry farming. Gao'an City, a key breeding area in the Jinjiang River Basin, exhibited the highest concentration of Sulfamethoxazole at 409.96 ng<middle dot>L-1, which far exceeds other antibiotics and warrants significant attention. A comparison of surface water concentrations between the Jinjiang River and 12 other regions revealed higher overall pollution levels of Roxithromycin and Sulfamethoxazole. Furthermore, according to the ecological risk assessment results, only Sulfamethoxazole poses a moderate risk to aquatic organisms.

The investigation was based on the analysis of lakes sediment composition, organic matter content, algae predominance, levels of heavy metals and assessment of environmental risks. Sediment composition analysis revealed angular form as a primary particle, increase in the concentration of gravel particles, and decrease of the concentration of silt and sand particles. The dry season and central areas of the lakes showed the highest concentration of organic carbon (<12%). In addition, Lake El Sol showed the largest alterations in algae predominance, resulting from eutrophication changes. The concentration of Pb, Cd and Ni in sediments and algae was variable. The largest contribution was observed in algae from Lake La Luna; however, sediments from Lake El Sol showed the highest concentration of Pb with the maximum affectation in dry and wet seasons. The ecological risks posed by heavy metals indicated intermittent effects of Pb and Cd on organisms, and minor impacts of Ni. The data will be important in assessing the changes observed in Lakes El Sol and La Luna, in establishing future monitoring practices, and in implementing conservation strategies for ecosystems.

In 1994, 1995, and 1996, beaches and roadways in Kejimkujik National Park were surveyed for nesting turtles; all nests observed were covered with wire-screen cages to prevent predation and facilitate the collection of data on incubation and nest success. Nesting lasted from mid-June until early July. In each year, 80% of nesting occurred during a 10-day period in the third and fourth weeks of June. Turtles nested in the evening and predominantly on lakeshore cobble beaches. Site fidelity is high in this population: 73.3% of multiparous females returned to nest on the same beach in all years. No female produced more than one clutch per season, and most females (67.9%) nested less than annually. Mean clutch size was 10.6 eggs. Hatchlings emerge in September and October. Incubation times ranged from 80 to 128 days (mean = 94 days, SD = 11.7 days; n = 26 nests). In 1994 and 1995, most protected nests were productive; that is, 76.4 and 93.3% of protected nests produced at least one live hatchling in 1994 and 1995, respectively. In 1996, only 18.1% of protected nests were productive. Between 50 and 75% of productive clutches contained unhatched eggs and, on average, between 1.0 and 1.2 eggs failed per productive clutch. Total annual egg failure ranged from 26.5 to 94%. In the absence of nest predation, lower temperatures during incubation and nest flooding appear to be major cause of egg failure in this population. More effective means of reducing nest failure and bolstering recruitment must be implemented if efforts to aid the recovery of this threatened population of Blanding's turtle are to be successful.																			0008-4301					OCT	1999	77	10					1609	1614		10.1139/cjz-77-10-1609	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-77-10-1609													WOS:000084266500014
J	Fox, MG; Crivelli, AJ				Fox, MG; Crivelli, AJ			Life history traits of pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) populations introduced into warm thermal environments	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Life history theory predicts that ectotherms living in warm thermal environments should mature early because of fast juvenile growth, but it is unclear whether such early maturity will occur in the absence of conditions that promote fast juvenile growth. To assess this possibility and to determine the effect of warm thermal regimes on body size at maturity, we compared the growth and life history patterns of three populations of pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) introduced into warm, Mediterranean waterbodies in southern France with native populations living in cool thermal regimes in Ontario, Canada. Growth and life history traits of the French populations were determined from monthly samples collected from May to September. Mean age at maturity in the French populations ranged from 1.3-2.3 years, and was significantly earlier than that of populations inhabiting Ontario lakes. Length at age 2, an indicator of the juvenile growth rate, was not significantly different between the French and Ontario populations, and the French populations matured significantly earlier than Ontario lake populations even when juvenile growth was taken into account. Length at maturity in the French populations was also significantly smaller. and although there was no significant difference between the French and Ontario populations in mean GSI, the results of a previous reproductive allocation experiment suggest that French populations have a longer breeding season, and greater reproductive effort than Ontario pumpkinseeds. The earlier maturity of French pumpkinseeds could be a direct physiological effect of the warm thermal environment, but factors other than thermal regime may be contributing to the difference in life history traits between the French and Ontario populations.																			0003-9136					MAR	2001	150	4					561	580																WOS:000168102900003

In this study, a novel stable isotope analysis method, combined with Bayesian mixing models, is applied to investigate hydrological connections and water source contributions in a specific area on the southwest shore of Dianchi Lake, China, at a monthly scale. The study reveals a significant "memory effect," where 56.76% of the lake water volume in the current month is associated with the lake water volume in the prior month, with notable seasonal variations. The relative contributions of precipitation, surface water, soil water for different agricultural land uses, and groundwater to the lake water balance are assessed. The hydrological processes in Dianchi Lake are significantly influenced by agricultural land use, with greenhouse soils contributing less water than open field soils. Water outflow, rather than evaporation, is the primary factor reducing the nearshore lake volume, highlighting the impact of human activities. The dependency of water source contributions on meteorological factors is also examined, with seasonal and weather effects on lake water dynamics and agricultural water availability observed. By integrating isotope data with meteorological records and advanced modeling techniques, a quantitative framework for evaluating hydrological changes in lake catchments is developed. The developed approach enhances our understanding of lake water system dynamics and can enhance agricultural water management strategies, water resource allocation, irrigation planning, and climate change adaptation in agricultural watersheds.

J	Lindeman, PV				Lindeman, PV			Resource use of five sympatric turtle species: effects of competition, phylogeny, and morphology	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE												I quantified resource use with respect to habitat, diet, and diel and seasonal use of basking time for five sympatric turtle species in a cove on Kentucky Lake, an impoundment of the lower Tennessee River in western Kentucky, U.S.A. I used pseudocommunity analyses to test for significant structure in resource use, compared resource-use matrices with matrices representing phylogenetic similarity, and measured morphological characteristics related to resource use. Three strictly riverine species (Graptemys pseudogeographica, Graptemys ouachitensis, and Apalone mutica) with relatively long limbs and digits used outer portions of the cove near deeper waters to a greater extent than did two shorter-limbed species (Trachemys scripta and Pseudemys concinna), which inhabit both lotic and lentic waters. Only the difference in habitat between A. mutica and the other four species was shown to be significant in pseudocommunity analysis, a result that can be better explained by differences in basking substrates than by competition. Dietary studies indicated two guilds, omnivore and algivore, in spite of the low pairwise overlap values that resulted from overall prey diversity. Analysis of use of diel and seasonal basking time revealed significant structure (partitioning) at only the rank of second-nearest neighbor for seasonal time. Clustering phenograms for resource similarity among the five species were overall highly similar to two phylogenetic hypotheses. Phylogeny was thus shown to be of greater importance in structuring resource use in Kentucky Lake than interspecific competition. In addition, the similarity in clustering phenograms was not consistent with the hypothesis of niche complementarity, suggesting that interspecific competition was of little importance.																			0008-4301					JUN	2000	78	6					992	1008		10.1139/cjz-78-6-992	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-78-6-992													WOS:000087790700012

Fish species composition and relative abundance values were similar for both lakes, despite their difference in connection time to the river and the abundance of macrophytes. The fish communities were predominantly composed by small sized species typical of lentic environments (Characidae), juveniles of large non-migratory species (Erythrinidae and Gymnotidae) and a few juveniles of migratory species (Anostomidae and Curimatidae). These lakes are not characterized as nurseries for the young of migratory species and the zooplankton does not have an important role as food in the ontogenetic development of migratory species of fish.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				JUN	2000	58	2					133	143		10.1023/A:1007637631663	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1007637631663													WOS:000086961200002
J	Boros, E; Vörös, L				Boros, Emil; Voros, Lajos			How Can Unique Alkaline Soda Waters Be Managed and Restored? Lake Neusiedl as the Largest Threatened European Example	ECOHYDROLOGY												Inland alkaline soda waters (ASW), such as Lake Neusiedl (LN), represent some of the most stable alkaline natural environments and unique ecosystems on Earth. Their European hotspot is located in Central Europe, where LN stands as the largest threatened representative, giving it practical importance. This study aims to compare fundamental hydro-ecological variables of LN, including a habitat restoration site (LNres), with intermittent alkaline soda waters (IASW) in the adjacent subregion (Seewinkel). IASW serves as a characteristic close-to-nature reference status for natural ASW in order to restoration suggestions for LN. Variables investigated include depth, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, algae-free suspended solids, chromophoric dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll a. Significant differences were found among most variables between the three sites (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and Dunn's test), except for water depth, DO, conductivity, TSS-Algfree and CHL between IASW and LNres, and CDOM between LNres and LN. Principal component analyses revealed that LNres is situated between LN (semi-static) and reference IASW (astatic), supporting the hypothesis that LNres is closer to the reference IASW than the non-restored part of LN. The hydro-ecological properties of IASW and LNres are similar to the shallow shoreline of LN, suggesting that management strategies of intermittent waters can be applied to shoreline restoration of semi-static waters. This can be achieved by restoring seasonal water dynamics and groundwater function through extensive wetland rehabilitation in the above-ground and below-ground watershed recharge area of LN. Additionally, extensive vegetation control (reed) should be implemented to prevent ASW from impacting the habitat and freshwater exchange.																			1936-0584	1936-0592				MAR	2025	18	2								10.1002/eco.2738	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2738		NOV 2024											WOS:001357621900001

Modelling suspended sediment discharge in a glaciated Arctic catchment-Lake Peters, Northeast Brooks Range, Alaska	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												Seasonal suspended sediment transfer in glaciated catchments is responsive to meteorological, geomorphological, and glacio-fluvial conditions, and thus is a useful indicator of environmental system dynamics. Knowledge of multifaceted fluvial sediment-transfer processes is limited in the Alaskan Arctic - a region sensitive to contemporary environmental change. For two glaciated sub-catchments at Lake Peters, northeast Brooks Range, Alaska, we conducted a two-year endeavour to monitor the hydrology and meteorology, and used the data to derive multiple-regression models of suspended sediment load. Statistical selection of the best models shows that incorporating meteorological or temporal explanatory variables improves performances of turbidity- and discharge-based sediment models. The resulting modelled specific suspended sediment yields to Lake Peters are: 33 (20-60) t km(-2)yr(-1)in 2015, and 79 (50-140) t km(-2)yr(-1)in 2016 (95% confidence band estimates). In contrast to previous studies in Arctic Alaska, fluvial suspended sediment transfer to Lake Peters was primarily influenced by rainfall, and secondarily influenced by temperature-driven melt processes associated with clockwise diurnal hysteresis. Despite different sub-catchment glacier coverage, specific yields were the same order of magnitude from the two primary inflows to Lake Peters, which are Carnivore Creek (128 km(2); 10% glacier coverage) and Chamberlin Creek (8 km(2); 23% glacier coverage). Seasonal to longer-term sediment exhaustion and/or contrasting glacier dynamics may explain the lower than expected relative specific sediment yield from the more heavily glacierized Chamberlin Creek catchment. Absolute suspended sediment yield (t yr(-1)) from Carnivore Creek to Lake Peters was 27 times greater than from Chamberlin Creek, which we attribute to catchment size and sediment supply differences. Our results provide a foundational understanding of the current sediment transfer regime and are useful for predicting changes in fluvial sediment transport in glaciated Alaskan Arctic catchments.

The TSL's ecosystems have been affected by climate change and an increasing amount of human activity in recent years. Considering that the TSL area is often covered by clouds, particularly in the rainy season, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are suitable for assessing the ecosystems in this great lake, as SAR enables weather- and cloud-independent observations. In this study, we investigated the capability of the RADARSAT-2 Wide Fine (WF) mode dual-polarization SAR data with a scene size of 170x150km (azimuthxrange) and a resolution of 7.6x5.2m to study TSL's ecosystem, by analysing the usefulness of backscattering coefficients and scattering mechanism-related parameters in identifying artificial targets and different land-cover types. The results of this study demonstrate the applicability of RADARSAT-2 WF-mode SAR data in the study of TSL's ecosystems.

J	Balayla, DJ; Moss, B				Balayla, DJ; Moss, B			Relative importance of grazing on algae by plant-associated and open-water microcrustacea (Cladocera)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Little Mere is a small and shallow fertile lake, in which floating and submerged macrophytes are abundant. Phytoplankton biomass and water transparency are often regulated by planktonic herbivores, mainly Daphnia hyalina. On occasion during the growing season, however, low chlorophyll-a coincides with few or no Daphnia, when inorganic nutrients are not likely to be limiting. Grazing rates (% lake volume filtered per day) of both Daphnia and plant-associated grazers (Sida crystallina and Simocephalus vetulus) were estimated during two growing seasons. Densities [ind. (g DW plant)(-1) or ind. L-1] were determined at five sites in the lake, three of them within lily beds (Nymphaea alba and Nuphar lutea), the other two over submerged plant beds of mixed composition. Total populations were estimated by extrapolation, using values of areal plant biomass. Clearance rates (mL ind.(-l) d(-1)) from in situ dual-isotope experiments were used, in conjunction with estimated animal population sizes, to calculate total grazing by the main filterers in the lake (% lakevolume d(-1)). A comparison between Daphnia hyalina and the main plant-associated filterers (Simocephalus vetulus and Sida crystallina) showed that the former was the main phytoplankton grazer during most of the growing season, with grazing rates often above 50 % lake volume d(-1). Grazing rates were higher in lily beds than in open waters. Sida crystallina was a significant filter-feeder both at the beginning and end of the growing season, however, and was sometimes the main grazer in the lake, with a grazing rate occasionally exceeding 100 % d(-l). These impacts were short-lived, although the duration of peaks was much larger in 1999 than in 1998, and localized in space. Very low chlorophyll-a concentrations (< 10 mug L-1) and high water transparency were found during these episodes, when nutrients (N and P) were not limiting (234 mug L-1 NH4+-N and 93 mug L-1 SRP). Simocephalus vetulus had a maximum grazing rate of 8-10 % d(-1) in both years.																			0003-9136					OCT	2004	161	2					199	224		10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0161-0199	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0161-0199													WOS:000225221000004
J	Linacre, ET				Linacre, ET			Evaporation trends	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Lake-evaporation rates Eo around the world have been deduced in three ways, using land-based data. The estimates indicate generally decreasing rates of 0.08, 0.13 and 0.05 mm/day per decade respectively, i.e. of the order of 0.1 mm/d.dec. One method of estimation involves a simplified version of the Penman evaporation formula, which shows that the reduction of Eo is due chiefly to the general lessening of solar radiation at the surface. In consequence of the decline of Eo, a two-regime model of the evaporation from land surfaces shows that there has been a decrease in the rate of actual evaporation from land surfaces Ea also, at places where rainfall exceeds Ep, the rate of water loss from a US Class-A pan evaporimeter. This implies increased runoff there. On the other hand, there is a slight increase of Ea in drier seasons and places, which are more common, implying a little more soil moisture.																			0177-798X	1434-4483				OCT	2004	79	1-2					11	21		10.1007/s00704-004-0059-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-004-0059-2													WOS:000224615100002
J	Reinhart, KO; Menges, ES				Reinhart, KO; Menges, ES			Effects of re-introducing fire to a central Florida sandhill community	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												A southern ridge sandhill site in central Florida, USA, was burned in 1989, 1991, and 1995 after 63 years of fire-suppression to simulate a pre-settlement fire regime. Fire changed species abundance and vegetation structure but caused only minimal changes in species turnover and diversity. There was a general trend for an increase in the cover of herbs following fire but this was a statistically significant effect for only one species, Liatris tenuifolia var. tenuifolia. Aristida beyrichiana increased, litter cover and litter depth were significantly reduced, and ground lichens were eliminated in response to burning. Scrub oaks and palmettos in the ground cover and small shrub layers (height less than or equal to 1 m) either increased or did not respond to burning, reflecting strong post-fire resprouting. Diversity in the ground cover and small shrub layers were not affected by fire. Scrub oaks and palmettos in the large shrub and overstorey layers (height > 1 in) were reduced in density, basal area, and longest canopy measurements in response to fire. Species diversity also decreased within these layers following fire. Some Pinus elliottii var. densa survived fire, but their density was reduced. All Pinus clausa were eliminated by fire. Periodic burning can suppress the dominance of shrubs (Quercus spp.) while increasing the cover of grasses and herbs in southern ridge sandhill vegetation.

J	Milly, PCD; Wetherald, RT				Milly, PCD; Wetherald, RT			Macroscale water fluxes - 3. Effects of land processes on variability of monthly river discharge - art. no. 1235	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH												A salient characteristic of river discharge is its temporal variability. The time series of flow at a point on a river can be viewed as the superposition of a smooth seasonal cycle and an irregular, random variation. Viewing the random component in the spectral domain facilitates both its characterization and an interpretation of its major physical controls from a global perspective. The power spectral density functions of monthly flow anomalies of many large rivers worldwide are typified by a "red noise'' process: the density is higher at low frequencies (e.g., <1 y(-1)) than at high frequencies, indicating disproportionate (relative to uncorrelated "white noise'') contribution of low frequencies to variability of monthly flow. For many high-latitude and arid-region rivers, however, the power is relatively evenly distributed across the frequency spectrum. The power spectrum of monthly flow can be interpreted as the product of the power spectrum of monthly basin total precipitation (which is typically white or slightly red) and several filters that have physical significance. The filters are associated with (1) the conversion of total precipitation (sum of rainfall and snowfall) to effective rainfall (liquid flux to the ground surface from above), (2) the conversion of effective rainfall to soil water excess (runoff), and (3) the conversion of soil water excess to river discharge. Inferences about the roles of each filter can be made through an analysis of observations, complemented by information from a global model of the ocean-atmosphere-land system. The first filter causes a snowmelt-related amplification of high-frequency variability in those basins that receive substantial snowfall. The second filter causes a relatively constant reduction in variability across all frequencies and can be predicted well by means of a semiempirical water balance relation. The third filter, associated with groundwater and surface water storage in the river basin, causes a strong reduction in high-frequency variability of many basins. The strength of this reduction can be quantified by an average residence time of water in storage, which is typically on the order of 20-50 days. The residence time is demonstrably influenced by freezing conditions in the basin, fractional cover of the basin by lakes, and runoff ratio (ratio of mean runoff to mean precipitation). Large lake areas enhance storage and can greatly increase total residence times (100 to several hundred days). Freezing conditions appear to cause bypassing of subsurface storage, thus reducing residence times (0-30 days). Small runoff ratios tend to be associated with arid regions, where the water table is deep, and consequently, most of the runoff is produced by processes that bypass the saturated zone, leading to relatively small residence times for such basins (0-40 days).

Using multivariate regression, we analyzed how functional richness, evenness, divergence, and dispersion indices respond to fluctuations in Cichla spp. abundance and seasonal water levels. Preliminary cross-correlations helped clarify the temporal influence of Cichla spp. on these indices. Results revealed a significant correlation between water levels and all functional indices. After controlling for water level variations, increases in Cichla spp. abundance significantly and negatively affected functional richness and dispersion. Specifically, higher Cichla spp. abundance correlated with reduced functional richness and dispersion after lags of 9 and 21 months, respectively. Additionally, at a 9-month lag, functional divergence was negatively associated with Cichla spp. abundance, whereas an 18-month lag showed a positive influence of functional richness on Cichla spp. abundance, suggesting a cyclical interaction. The study indicates that high Cichla spp. abundance can destabilize crucial community segments, particularly smaller fish species, through a feedback loop of impact. Future studies should explore the factors influencing Cichla spp. abundance, focusing on environmental dynamics. Understanding the interactions between these elements will help clarifying Cichla spp. population trends. Interventions are necessary to mitigate propagule pressure and manage Cichla spp. populations effectively within these ecosystems.					; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/D-5888-2013; Corrêa Alves, Diego/OGR-2483-2025; Dias, Rosa/G-5783-2017; Lopes, Taise/HMV-1749-2023; Agostinho, Angelo/S-1538-2019; Gomes, Luiz/D-5886-2013	Oliveira, Anielly/0000-0002-6185-1728; Correa Alves, Diego/0000-0002-2109-9738; Miranda Lopes, Taise/0000-0001-9401-2341; Agostinho, Angelo Antonio/0000-0002-4707-9444; gomes, Luiz/0000-0001-7295-723X; Rauber, Rafaela/0000-0002-2270-0716; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2025	852	8-9			SI		2441	2454		10.1007/s10750-024-05725-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-024-05725-w		NOV 2024											WOS:001348673900001

Microorganisms dominated pelagic food webs of the lakes and crustacean zooplankton were important only in PR, with the lowest Al concentrations (193 mu g L(-1)) due to 3-4 times lower terrestrial input. The lakes differed substantially in Al speciation, i.e., in the proportion of ionic and particulate forms, with the highest proportion of ionic Al in the most acid CT (pH = 4.5). The P concentration in the inlet of PL (mean: 22.9 mu g L(-1)) was about five times higher than in CT and PR (3.9 and 5.1 mu g L(-1), respectively). Average total biomass of planktonic microorganisms in PL (593 mu g C L(-1)) was, however, only similar to 2-times higher than in CT and PR (235 and 272 mu g C L(-1), respectively). Enormous AcPA (means: 2.17-6.82 mu mol L(-1) h(-1)) and high planktonic C : P ratios suggested severe P limitation of the plankton in all lakes. Comparing 1998 and 2003 seasons, we observed changes in water composition (pH and Al speciation) leading to a significant increase in phytoplankton biomass in the lakes. The increase in the seston C : P ratio during the same time, however, indicates a progressive P deficiency of the lakes. The terrestrial Al inputs, together with in-lake processes controlling the formation of particulate Al, reduced P availability for planktonic microorganisms and were responsible for the differences in AcPA. At pH < 5, moreover, ionic Al forms caused inhibition of extracellular phosphatases. We postulate that both particulate and ionic Al forms affect P availability (i.e., inhibition of extracellular phosphatases and inactivation of P), specifically shape the plankton composition in the lakes and affect plankton recovery from the acid stress.

This article presents research findings on radioactively contaminated Lake Kishkensor located at the Semipalatinsk Test Site territory. As a result of this research, a new locally contaminated spot was discovered in the vicinity of the "Balapan" test site. Lake Kishkensor was found to be contaminated with man-made 3H and 90Sr. The 3H activity concentration in surface waters reached 430 kBq/L, and the concentration of 90Sr reached 100 Bq/L. In the sediments, the 3H activity concentration reached 700 kBq/kg, while that of 90Sr and 239+240Pu reached 310 Bq/kg and 250 Bq/kg, respectively.

Faecal contamination determines bacterial assemblages over natural environmental parameters within intermittently opened and closed lagoons (ICOLLs) during high rainfall	WATER RESEARCH												Intermittently closed and opened lakes and lagoons (ICOLLs) provide important ecosystem services, including food provision and nutrient cycling. These ecosystems generally experience low watershed outflow, resulting in substantial fluctuations in physicochemical parameters that are often compounded by anthropogenic contamination, however, how this impacts the patterns in microbiology within these environments remains uncharacterised. Therefore, we aimed to determine how seasonal heterogeneity in the physicochemical parameters, in comparison to faecal contamination, alter the dynamics of bacterial communities inhabiting ICOLLs on the eastern Australian coast. To address these aims, we sampled four ICOLLs on a monthly basis for one year, using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to monitor patterns in bacterial diversity and qPCR-based methods to measure faecal contamination from humans (sewage), dogs, and birds. Additionally, we used qPCR to monitor patterns of a suite of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) including sult, tetA, qnrS, dfrA1, and vanB. Differences in bacterial community composition were often associated with temporal shifts in salinity, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and dissolved organic matter, but following periods of high rainfall, bacterial assemblages in two of four ICOLLs changed in direct response to sewage inputs. Within these ICOLLs, indicator taxa for stormwater identified using the 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data, as well as markers for sewage and dog faeces, and levels of the antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) sult, tetA, and dfrA1 were significantly more abundant after rainfall. Notably many of the stormwater indicator taxa were potential human pathogens including Arcobacter and Aeromonas hydrophilia, which also displayed significant correlations, albeit weak to moderate, with levels of the ARGs sult, tetA, and dfrA1. This broad-scale shift in the nature of the bacterial community following rainfall will likely lead to a substantial, and perhaps detrimental, divergence in the ecosystem services provided by the bacterial assemblages within these ICOLLs. We conclude that following rainfall events, sewage was a principal driver of shifts in the microbiology of ICOLLs exposed to stormwater, while natural seasonal shifts in the physicochemical parameters controlled bacterial communities at other times. Increased occurrence of intense precipitation events is predicted as a ramification of climate change, which will lead to increased impacts of stormwater and sewage contamination on important ICOLL ecosystems in the future.					; King, William/AAG-6349-2019; Williams, Nathan/LZI-3337-2025; Siboni, Nachshon/K-4202-2012	King, William L/0000-0001-7272-8242; Siboni, Nachshon/0000-0001-6082-0949; Williams, Nathan/0000-0003-2496-9441; 													0043-1354	1879-2448				JAN 1	2025	268		A						122670	10.1016/j.watres.2024.122670	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2024.122670		OCT 2024						39486150					WOS:001349180700001

The lake showed thermal stratification between June and October. Six zooplankton taxa were determined, Hexarthra fennica, Brachionus plicatilis from Rotifera and Arctodiaptomus burduricus from Copepoda were the dominant species. Average zooplankton density was 399,074 ind.m(-3) and they were 51% H. fennica, 9% B. plicatilis and 40% A. burduricus. In addition, vertical zooplankton distributions have been investigated in this study. Generally, zooplankton groups were concentrated between 5-20 m. However, rotifers and A. burdaricus were determined to have the highest density at 5 and 15 m, respectively.

Influence of the pseudophyllidean cestode Schistocephalus solidus on oocyte development in the threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus	PARASITOLOGY												The objective of this study was to investigate the means by which Schistocephalus solidus might reduce annual fecundity in female threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) through processes of oocyte development. Histological examinations of specimens from one lake in Alaska in 2000 and 2001 were used to analyse the effects of S. solidus on recruitment of primary growth oocytes into vitellogenesis, atresia of vitellogenic oocytes, and the interspawning interval. The ratio of primary growth to late secondary growth (late vitellogenic) oocytes was significantly greater (P<0.01) among infected fish than uninfected ones in early-season samples from 2000 and 2001, revealing a decrease in recruitment of oocytes from primary growth into vitellogenic oocytes among infected females. The difference was marginally non-significant (P=0.087) in a mid-season sample from 2001 due to reductions in the entire pool of vitellogenic (early and late secondary growth) oocytes recruited prior to the spawning season in this determinate-fecundity species. Atresia among all vitellogenic oocytes was low and did not differ between infected and uninfected females. Histological estimations of the interspawning interval using post-ovulatory follicles showed no significant differences between infected and uninfected fish, suggesting that the number of spawnings in stickleback females each spawning season is unaffected by S. solidus infection. Thus, annual fecundity appears to be reduced only through recruitment of oocytes into vitellogenesis.																			0031-1820	1469-8161				JUN	2010	137	7					1151	1158		10.1017/S0031182009992046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0031182009992046								20128945					WOS:000279156600011

Investigating Interactions between Channel Catfish and Other Sport Fishes in Small Impoundments	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus is a popular sport fish commonly maintained by annual stocking in small impoundments. We sought to determine whether channel catfish negatively affect two other sport fishes (bluegill Lepomis macrochirus and largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides) in Alabama's state public fishing lakes (ASPF lakes) through competition or predation. Using a variety of gears, we sampled channel catfish, largemouth bass, and bluegills in 12 ASPF lakes with variable channel catfish stocking and harvest rates. Four of these lakes were sampled more intensively to quantify the diets of these three species. Bioenergetics simulations were used to predict the annual consumption of channel catfish and largemouth bass populations of average density, size structure, and growth from these impoundments. Metrics of growth, condition, abundance, and population structure were not related between species. Latitude was negatively related to channel catfish growth. The diets of channel catfish and bluegills were moderately similar across all seasons in all lakes, while those of channel catfish and largemouth bass were highly dissimilar. Within species, diet similarity was high among lakes. Bioenergetics simulations suggest that the channel catfish populations in these lakes consume relatively little fish, particularly when compared with a typical largemouth bass population. We found little evidence of negative effects of channel catfish on the bluegill and largemouth bass populations in ASPF lakes, although largemouth bass growth and condition were poorest in the lake with the highest channel catfish stocking rate. However, current stocking and exploitation rates in most lakes appear to maintain channel catfish abundance below the level at which negative effects may occur.																			0275-5947					JUN	2010	30	3					732	741		10.1577/M09-141.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M09-141.1													WOS:000279885000012

In the shallow (< 5 m) and the most turbid (up to 75 NTU) part of the lake, the community of invertebrate predators consisted of cyclopoid copepods (max biomass > 500 mu g dw l(-1)) and Leptodora kindtiii (Focke) (17 mu g dw l(-1)), while in the less turbid (10-40 NTU) stratifying area Chaoborus flavicans (Meigen) dominated (max 146 mu g dw l(-1)). In the temporarily stratifying and moderately turbid basin Chaoborus and small-bodied invertebrate predators co-existed. Mysis relicta (Loven) occurred only in the stratifying area (max 15 mu g dw l(-1)). The results suggested that both water depth and turbidity contributed to the community structure of Chaoborus flavicans. Depth great enough for stratification was of special importance and its effect was amplified by elevated turbidity, while high turbidity alone could not maintain chaoborid populations. Mysis relicta also requires a hypolimnetic refuge but is more sensitive to low oxygen concentrations and may therefore be forced to the epilimnion where it is vulnerable to fish predation. Cyclopoids as rapid swimmers can take advantage at elevated turbidity levels and coexist in high biomass with fish even in shallow water. Leptodora kindtii can form high biomass despite planktivorous fish providing that turbidity exceeds 20 NTU. The results demonstrated that depth and water turbidity can strongly regulate the abundance and species composition of invertebrate predators. These factors must thus be taken into account when applying food web management, which aims to reduce phytoplankton biomass by depressing planktivorous fish.					; Uusitalo, Laura/MEO-5735-2025	Niemisto, Juha/0000-0003-3516-5596; Uusitalo, Laura/0000-0002-5143-5253													1386-2588					MAR	2008	42	1					25	33		10.1007/s10452-006-9070-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-006-9070-2													WOS:000253197700004

TRIN. ex STEM were studied in the littoral zones of two man-made lakes located in the Trebon Basin (South Bohemia, the Czech Republic): (1) Opatovicky fishpond, a shallow artificial lake constructed in 1510-1514 by damming a shallow valley and used since for carp production, and (2) Halamky sand pit, a new lake formed by sand extraction in 1970-1994. Phenotypic variability was assessed on the basis of shoot morphological and growth characteristics, measured at the time of seasonal maximum aboveground biomass. Genotypic variability was detected using RAPDs, which demonstrated a high clonal diversity in both habitats. The clonal diversity would be strongly underestimated if it were based only on morphological differences. Higher genotypic variability was found in the fishpond reed, not corresponding with low variability in its phenotype performance. Based on analysis of 160 samples, four patterns of genotypic variation were detected: (1) Some stands were genetically uniform and were therefore considered to be monoclonal in both populations studied. (2) Some stands consisted of several clones at the Halamky sand pit. However, these clones showed more similarity within the particular stands than with clones of adjacent stands. (3) In the Opatovicky fishpond population, multiclonal stands consisted of clones with a low degree of similarity. (4) Identical clones were detected in several neighbouring stands separated by gaps in the Opatovicky fishpond population. The findings support a model of colonization postulating that populations initiated by seeds are initially genetically diverse and over time become dominated by a few clones as a result of competition and selection. These processes then decrease both genetic and morphological variability. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Sediment-based landforms generated beneath Late Pleistocene ice sheets, together with detailed digital elevation models, offer a valuable means of testing basal hydrology models, which describe the flow and dynamics of water in the subglacial system. However, to date no work has evaluated how well process-based subglacial hydrology models represent the hypothesized conditions associated with glaciofluvial landform formation in the palaeo setting. Previous work comparing model output to geomorphological evidence has typically done so using models that do not resolve subglacial processes and instead express likely subglacial water pathways. Here, we explore the ability of the Glacier Drainage System model (GlaDS), a process-based subglacial hydrology model, to represent the genesis conditions associated with a specific glaciofluvial landform termed "murtoos". Distinctive triangular landforms found throughout Finland and Sweden, murtoos are hypothesized to form 40-60 km from the former Fennoscandian Ice Sheet margin within a "semi-distributed" system at the onset of channelized drainage in small cavities where water pressure is equal to or exceeds ice overburden pressure. Concentrating within a specific ice lobe of the former Fennoscandian Ice Sheet and using digital elevation models with a simulated former ice surface geometry, we forced GlaDS with transient surface melt and explored the sensitivity of our model outcomes to parameter decisions such as the system conductivity and bed topography. Our model outputs closely match the general spacing, direction, and complexity of eskers and mapped assemblages of features related to subglacial drainage in "meltwater routes". Many of the predictions for murtoo formation are produced by the model, including the location of water pressure equal to ice overburden, the onset of channelized drainage, the transition in drainage modes, and importantly the seasonal sequence of drainage conditions inferred from murtoo sedimentology. These conclusions are largely robust to a range of parameter decisions, and we explore seasonal and inter-annual drainage behaviour associated with murtoo zones and meltwater pathways. Our results demonstrate that examining palaeo basal topography alongside subglacial hydrology model outputs holds promise for the mutually beneficial analyses of palaeo and contemporary ice sheets to assess the controls of hydrology on ice dynamics and subglacial landform evolution.

Sedimentation took place in an elongate paleogulf of the Say'un-al Masila basin, with open-marine carbonates to the east. The Qishn Clastics Member unconformably overlies mixed carbonates and clastics of the Sa'af Member. Lower Qishn onlap resulted in deposition of brackish and tidal (likely macrotidal) estuarine to open-bay or gulf deposits. The middle portion of the lower Qishn Clastics Member shows evidence of and nonmarine sedimentation, including debris-flow deposits, red beds, and shale-clast conglomerates, in turn, overlain by interfingering coastal and nonmarine deposits. The lower Qishn Clastics Member is truncated by a sequence boundary overlain by an extensive sandstone deposited in a low-accommodation braid plain close to the shoreline. A flooding surface is present at the top of the sandstone, over which progradational, tide-influenced deltaic strata were deposited. Delta progradation culminated in shallow-water clastic dolomitic deposits on the coastal plain. With subsequent transgression, a rising water table caused a nonmarine flooding surface with lakes and lacustrine deltas, overlain by tidal-flat deposits. Ongoing transgression resulted in wave ravinement overlain by shallow-shelf clastics and then deposition of slightly deeper shelf carbonates. The uppermost unit comprises bioturbated, clastic-shelf deposits related to a drop in relative sea level. Throughout much of the Qishn Clastics interval, accommodation was moderate, except for low accommodation associated with regional sheet sandstone at the base of the upper Qishn Clastics Member.

A critical assumption of the IDD model is that individuals using the lower-quality habitats must have attempted to settle first in the better habitats, but this has seldom been demonstrated. We tested key assumptions of the IDD model by using long-term data on choice of breeding sites by greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber) in southern Spain, where these birds breed at Fuente de Piedra lake (FP) and the Guadalquivir marshes (GM). Based on the accessibility of terrestrial predators to breeding sites, the FP colony was of better quality than the GM colony. As expected From an IDD model, the flamingos settled first at FP than at GM. The order of settlement was probably not affected by differences in food availability between sites, since in most years, the flamingos breeding in FP obtained food in GM during the chick-rearing period, once the FP lake dried up. Furthermore, breeding success was much higher at FP than at GM. Another assumption of the model is that individuals are omniscient and that they should try to settle first in the best site. We recorded 18 individually marked flamingos prospecting for nest sites in FP in a season, when many birds had already settled in this colony. The same individuals were subsequently recorded breeding in the same season in GM, indicating that they had previous information on the availability of sites on which to breed. A third assumption of the IDD model is that as the density increases in a given habitat, the fitness of individuals should decrease. In accordance with this, we found a strong effect of bird density on egg losses. The individuals that were recorded prospecting for sites in FP and that later bred in GM were younger than flamingos that were breeding in FP. We suggest that age-related behavioral dominance may be a mechanism responsible for this despotic distribution.

Particulate organic and dissolved inorganic carbon stable isotopic compositions in Taylor Valley lakes, Antarctica: the effect of legacy	HYDROBIOLOGIA												In perennially ice-covered lakes of Taylor Valley, Antarctica, "legacy'', a carryover of past ecosystem events, has primarily been discussed in terms of nutrient and salinity concentrations and its effect on the current ecology of the lakes. In this study, we determine how residual pools of ancient carbon affect the modern carbon abundance and character in the water columns of Lakes Fryxell, Hoare, and Bonney. We measure the stable carbon isotopic compositions and concentrations of particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the water column of these lakes over four seasons (1999-2002). These data are presented and compared with all the previously published Taylor Valley lacustrine carbon stable isotopic data. Our results show that the carbon concentrations and isotopic compositions of the upper water columns of those lakes are controlled by modern processes, while the lower water columns are controlled to varying degrees by inherited carbon pools. The water column of the west lobe of Lake Bonney is dominated by exceptionally high concentrations of DIC (55,000-75,000 mu mol l(-1)) reflecting the long period of ice-cover on this lake. The east lobe of Lake Bonney has highly enriched delta C-13(DIC) values resulting from paleobrine evaporation effects in its bottom waters, while its high DIC concentrations provide geochemical evidence that its middle depth waters are derived from West Lake Bonney during a hydrologically connected past. Although ancient carbon is present in both Lake Hoare and Lake Fryxell, the delta C-13(DIC) values in bottom waters suggest dominance by modern primary productivity-related processes. Anaerobic methanogenesis and methanotrophy are also taking place in the lower water column of Lake Fryxell with enough methane, oxidized anaerobically, to contribute to the DIC pool. We also show how stream proximity and high flood years are only a minor influence on the carbon isotopic values of both POC and DIC. The Taylor Valley lake system is remarkably stable in both inter-lake and intra-lake carbon dynamics.

Both lateral transport and in situ oxic methane production (OMP) have been suggested as potential sources. While the latter has been recently supported by increasing evidence, quantifying the exact contribution of OMP to atmospheric emissions remains challenging. Based on a large high-resolution field data set collected during 2019-2020 in the deep stratified Lake Stechlin and on three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling, we improved existing CH4 budgets by resolving each component of the mass balance model at a seasonal scale and therefore better constrained the residual OMP. All terms in our model showed a large temporal variability at scales from intraday to seasonal, and the modeled OMP was most sensitive to the surface CH4 flux estimates. Future efforts are needed to reduce the uncertainties in estimating OMP rates using the mass balance approach by increasing the frequency of atmospheric CH4 flux measurements.					; Doda, Tomy/AGR-1940-2022; Kirillin, Georgiy/B-5410-2010; Grossart, Hans-Peter/E-6705-2017	Liu, Liu/0000-0002-8056-2550; Doda, Tomy/0000-0002-7110-8540; Kang, Manchun/0000-0002-4319-8657; Shi, Xiaotao/0000-0001-9779-844X; 													0013-936X	1520-5851				OCT 24	2024	58	44					19690	19701		10.1021/acs.est.4c07413	http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c07413		OCT 2024						39445507					WOS:001340733300001

Changes in hydrographic properties were influenced by deepening and broadening the channel between Veliko Jezero and the sea in the early 1960s, which was in particular reflected by increasing salinity. Calanoid abundance displayed high intra- and inter-annual fluctuations but lacked any regular and recurrent pattern. Calanoids in the lake comprised 22 coastal and estuarine species, with five of them present over the entire study period (Calanus helgolandicus (Claus, 1863), Paracalanus parvus (Claus, 1863), Centropages kroyeri Giesbrecht, 1893, Isias clavipes Boeck, Acartia (Acartiura) clausi Giesbrecht, 1889). Four sample groups were identified by cluster analysis, with the highest degree of dissimilarity between samples from the 1950s and those from the 1990s and onwards. Observed changes - low densities in early 1980s; a shift in the dominant species; reduction and, finally, disappearance of Pseudocalanus elongatus (Boeck); increases in Paracalanus parvus and Diaixis pygmaea (Scott T., 1894) - can be associated with synchronous changes across trophic levels that have occurred in other European seas. The results presented here underline the importance of long-term studies of semi-closed marine lakes and lagoons, as these are particularly sensitive to global climatic changes.

J	Boatright, C; Quinn, T; Hilborn, R				Boatright, C; Quinn, T; Hilborn, R			Timing of adult migration and stock structure for sockeye salmon in Bear Lake, Alaska	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka returning to the Bear Lake system on the Alaska Peninsula exhibit a bimodal pattern of adult spawning migration timing produced by early and late migrants. We examined, by field observation of tagged adults, the relationship between adult migration date, breeding site, and breeding date for sockeye salmon returning to Bear Lake to assess stock structure within the system and determine whether distinct populations were segregated as they passed through the commercial fishery. Observed tag recoveries documented that (1) early and late migrants breed in different locations, (2) early migrants breed earlier in the reproductive season than late migrants (i.e., the chronological order of spawning followed the adult migration order), and (3) the adult migration has three major temporal components rather than two. Bear Lake's sockeye salmon population complex is composed of at least seven distinct spawning populations that display substantial temporal separation as they enter freshwater. The low level of abundance at the middle of the season is misleading; it is predominated by a single, discrete population rather than being merely a low point between two peaks. Given the brief (14-km), low-gradient migration from the Bering Sea to Bear Lake, the populations are probably segregated as they pass through the commercial fishery and thus the temporal distribution of fishery openings has the potential for disproportionate exploitation and reduction of representation by some genotypes.

Benthic and surface-emerging prey animals were trapped to obtain annual indices of food abundance. Mallard and teal were equally abundant over the years, being roughly twice as numerous as wigeon. Pair density, brood:pair ratio and duckling:pair ratio were used to test the hypothesis that per capita breeding success decreases in a density-dependent fashion as either pair density or the number of nesting pairs per available food unit increases. In mallard we found no density-dependent patterns at all. In teal per capita brood production decreased as prey animals became relatively scarcer, but this interpretation may not be robust. In wigeon, however, there were two independent significant patterns of direct density-dependence in a temporal succession, i.e. between pair density and per capita brood production in the early part of the breeding season, and then between per capita abundance of surface-emerging insect prey and the number of ducklings per pair. Despite wide dietary overlap and frequent co-occurrence on single lakes among species in the guild, we found no evidence for interspecific density-dependent effects. We hypothesize that there is no or infrequent food limitation for breeding dabblers in this system, and that behavior may be the process behind the pattern of density-dependence in wigeon.

Lake sedimentological and ecological response to hyperthermals: Boltysh impact crater, Ukraine	SEDIMENTOLOGY												The Boltysh meteorite impact crater, Ukraine, formed at the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary at ca 652Ma. A borehole drilled in the central part of the crater cored a>400m thick high-resolution lacustrine succession that covers the Dan-C2 hyperthermal event associated with a negative carbon isotope excursion. Continuous terrestrial records of past hyperthermals are of limited availability, which makes this record a unique case study of the continental impact of rapid climate warming. This study uses high-resolution sedimentological core log data together with thin-section, X-ray diffraction, microprobe and palynological analyses to: (i) reconstruct lake sedimentological and ecological development across the carbon isotope excursion; and (ii) assess the environmental effect of hyperthermals on terrestrial ecosystems. Based on detailed facies analysis, five gradual stages of lake formation are identified, which show a strong relationship to carbon isotope shifts and associated climatic trends. Initially, sediment supply into the Boltysh lake was controlled by crater morphology. During later lake stages, sediment supply was increasingly controlled by changes in inflow-evaporation ratios which affected seasonal stratification patterns and longer term lake levels. An inferred increase in atmospheric pCO(2) related to the carbon isotope excursion, together with increasing mean annual temperatures, was probably responsible for periodic increases in biological activity of photosynthesising organisms and biomass production. These fluctuations in facies and lake settings largely correspond to orbital-paced moisture availability oscillations. The gradual reduction in sediment supply commencing during early lake formation prior to carbon isotope excursion inception suggest that the Dan-C2 event did not initiate sedimentary changes, but intensified sedimentary response to orbital controlled climate change.					; Kemp, David/D-7288-2012	Jolley, David/0000-0003-0909-2952; Kemp, David/0000-0002-5116-5046; Andrews, Steven/0000-0002-0418-0809													0037-0746	1365-3091				OCT	2017	64	6					1465	1487		10.1111/sed.12360	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sed.12360													WOS:000408921900001

Morphological correlates with diet of fish assemblages in brush park fisheries of tropical estuaries	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Brush park fishery in Negombo estuary, Sri Lanka is a traditional fishing practice which relies on fishes attracted to artificial woody fish aggregation devices. This study investigates whether constituent species in these brush parks exhibit morphological variations in relation to their dietary habits. Fishes caught in brush parks were sampled from April 2014 to April 2016 covering rainy, intermediate and dry seasons. There were 817 specimens of 46 species belonging to 24 families. From each specimen, 17 morphological attributes were determined and diet composition of each species was analyzed in terms of relative biovolume. Trophic index of each species estimated from the proportions of dietary items and their possible trophic level in the community was significantly related to two body proportions (Maximum body height/Maximum body width and Total length/ Maximum body height) which described shape of fish. Principal component analysis of morphometric attributes and dietary habits indicated that the species in the higher trophic levels are characterized by slender, long-body shapes and those occupy lower trophic levels are predominantly laterally compressed with deep body shapes. As such, structure of coexisting species in brush parks of Negombo estuary is predominantly along the trophic dimension and is related to morphological traits of constituent species. The predictive power of ecomorphological correlates with diets of fish species other than mugilids which are attracted to brush parks, can therefore be considered as a useful tool for conducting rapid ecological assessment.					; Amarasinghe, Upali/AAI-7435-2021	Amarasinghe, Upali S./0000-0002-0465-6950; 													0378-1909	1573-5133				OCT	2017	100	10					1285	1299		10.1007/s10641-017-0642-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-017-0642-x													WOS:000412840700010
J	Harris, WC; Duncan, DC; Franken, RJ; McKinnon, DT; Dundas, HA				Harris, WC; Duncan, DC; Franken, RJ; McKinnon, DT; Dundas, HA			Reproductive success of Piping Plovers at Big Quill Lake, Saskatchewan	WILSON BULLETIN												Big Quill Lake, Saskatchewan, is an important breeding area for Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus); the area hosts up to 8% of the continental breeding population, yet little is known about how the site contributes to the overall survival of this species. We studied the reproductive success of Piping Plovers at Big Quill Lake from 1993 to 1995. We located 208 nests and captured and banded 456 young. Nest initiation occurred from mid-May to mid-July, and median nest-initiation dates were 14, 13, and 13 May in 1993, 1994, and 1995, respectively. Mean clutch size for presumed first nests was 3.92 eggs. Nesting success was consistently high from 1993 to 1995, with Mayfield estimates of nest success ranging from 75 to 88%; nests initiated later in the season were less successful than earlier nests. The wide beach (200-1,000 m) at Big Quill Lake may have contributed to high nesting success by reducing efficiency of predators. Use of Big Quill Lake beaches by humans and cattle was also minimal. Fledging success varied dramatically, with 0.02, 1.35, and 1.78 young fledged per breeding pair in 1993, 1994, and 1995, respectively. Low productivity of Piping Plovers in 1993 was a result of low chick survival during a week of rain, cold temperatures, and high winds, rather than low nesting success. Fledging success in 1994 and 1995 was higher than the 1.24 chicks per pair required for population stability on alkaline lakes in the Northern Great Plains. This high productivity suggests that Big Quill Lake is an important Piping Plover breeding site and measures should be taken to ensure its continued protection.

All major OC groups (polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane and metabolites [DDT], chlordane [CHL]-related compounds, and hexachlorocyclohexane [HCH] isomers) were detectable at sub-ng liter(-1) concentrations in lake water and at low ng g(-1) levels (dry wt) in surface sediments. Estimates of air-water exchange using a two-film model suggested that lake waters were close to equilibrium with the atmosphere for alpha HCH, trans-nonachlor and p,p'-DDE but that PCB congeners 52 and 153 were undergoing volatilization. Despite the relatively short open water season, gas absorption was found to be a major input pathway into the lake, when compared to estimated inputs from precipitation. Mean concentrations of Sigma HCH, Sigma DDT, Sigma CHL and Sigma PCB ranged from 1 to 10 ng g-(1) wet wt in arctic char and from 2 to 82 ng g(-1) in lake trout and were comparable to results from other lakes in the Canadian Arctic. Exceptionally high concentrations (six- to 10-fold higher than mean values) of these OCs were observed in a few lake trout and were explained by the larger size, longer lifespans and higher lipid contents of these individuals. Trophic interrelationships of food-web organisms were characterized using their tissue stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios. Through the food web, lipid-adjusted concentrations of aHCH, trans-nonachlor, p,p'-DDE, and PCB congeners 52 and 153 in biota were significantly related to their trophic position as determined by measurements of tissue stable nitrogen isotope ratios. In addition, the slopes and coefficients of determination for these relations increased with the lipophilicity and recalcitrance of the OCs, demonstrating that the more lipophilic OCs bioaccumulated to a greater degree through this food web even after accounting for the effects of lipid.

Heavy metal concentrations in surface water, sediments and fish and their potential toxicity in highly degraded multipurpose peri-urban Eleyele Lake, Ibadan City, Oyo State, south-western Nigeria	COGENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												(Metal concentrations in water, sediments and gills and edible stomach muscle tissues of two fish species, African Sharptooth mud catfish (Clarias gariepinus) and the Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in Eleyele Lake, Nigeria, were assessed in the rainy season (April), mid-dry spell time (July) and dry period (November) in 2017 to evaluate the potential ecological risks they pose to aquatic organisms. The concentrations of Fe, Co, Pb, Ni and Zn were significantly (p < 0.05) high in water and sediments and in some cases exceeded Nigerian Standards for Drinking Water Quality and World Health Organization guideline values. Study results highlight no significant spatial variation of all metals in the water and sediment phases and tissues for both fish species in the lake. Significant temporal variation in metals noted in the water and sediment phases most likely relate to the seasonal heterogeneity of catchment anthropogenic sources such as domestic sewer and fertilisers and pesticides from farming and backyard aquacultural enterprises. High Co, Cd and Zn concentrations recorded in tissues of the ecologically dichotomous two fish species corroborate with high metal levels in water and sediments. All pollution indices detected metal contamination in sediments whereas Ni posed a serious ecological risk to the fis)h (and possibly the fish consumers) in the lake indicating that nutrient retention especially within sediments is central to the pollution dynamics of Eleyele Lake and must inform management of the system.																			2331-1843					JUL 1	2020	6	1							1785137	10.1080/23311843.2020.1785137	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23311843.2020.1785137													WOS:000548814600001

In this review, the changes in meteorology, plant communities, birds and fishes surrounding initial impoundment of Miharu Dam, constructed in an Asian Monsoon region, are summarised based on previous papers and subsequent field research. Although wind and temperature changes were investigated, land and lake wind occur due to the different thermal properties between the land and lake, and this type of wind often occurs at large lakes such as Glen Canyon Dam Reservoir or Lake Biwa. The size of Miharu Dam Reservoir (ponding area 2.9 km(2)) was insufficient to cause land-lake air differentials. Therefore, wind direction and air temperature were unaffected. Mountain winds weakened at the lake centre and near the dam body. Changes in vegetation were especially diverse at the drawdown zone (the slopes above and below the normal water level). On slopes above this zone, trees died and species composition changed due to submergence. Within the drawdown zone, the pre-existing plant community disappeared, and flood-resistant plants such as Salix subfragilis increased. The natatorial bird population continued to grow for 4 years after dam reservoir emergence and stabilised thereafter. Every year, the majority of natatorial birds utilising the dam reservoir as a resting area were ducks, but populations of diving ducks fluctuated depending on water level and iced area. After impoundment, the fish populations increased. As in most dam reservoirs in Japan, populations of invasive fish species such as Micropterus salmoides and Lepomis macrochirus increased. However, spawning grounds dried up during low-water-level seasons, suggesting that regulating water levels may help reduce invasive species.																			1860-1871					JAN	2012	8	1					81	105		10.1007/s11355-011-0170-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11355-011-0170-3													WOS:000298610300008

The revision of Prolebias stenoura Sauvage, 1874, the type species of the genus Prolebias Sauvage, 1874, a cyprinodontid fish from the Upper Stampian (= Rupelian) (Oligocene) of the surroundings of Corent (Limagne, central France), has made possible the preparation of a detailed anatomical study and of an emended diagnosis. The occurrence of coccolithophorids and of dinoflagellates has determined several authors to suggest an incursion of marine waters into this basin during the Stampian. However, the fact that all the species of the genus Prolebias hitherto known by articulated skeletons have been living in fresh and brackish waters is, on the contrary, more in agreement with the hypothesis of a shallow meromictic lake, the superficial part of which was filled by seasonal rains, suitable for the life of this species.																			1280-9659	1638-9395					2012	34	2					409	423		10.5252/g2012n2a9	http://dx.doi.org/10.5252/g2012n2a9													WOS:000306574400009

Therefore, we apply the concept of functional groups to classify the phytoplankton assemblages in Guangdong reservoirs, and use such groups to understand the ecological status of these water bodies. Phytoplankton associations were studied in 20 subtropical reservoirs in Guangdong Province in the wet and dry seasons. Eleven of the thirty one described phytoplankton functional groups were found in these oligotrophic to eutrophic waters. It is necessary to define a new group (Lr) for reservoirs dominated by Microcystis sp., Aulacoseira granulata and/or Staurastum sp., along with Ceratium spp. in some associations. The new group reflects the unique habitat of reservoirs compared to lakes: strong and persistent disturbance caused by a deep outlet and a relatively stagnant, eutrophic surface layer.																			0077-0639		978-94-007-2006-0				2012	91						59	70		10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7_4	10.1007/978-94-007-2007-7												WOS:000301802900004

According to vertical changes in natural water content, fabric and varve thickness, four clay units were distinguished, reflecting a change in the sedimentary environment from ice-proximal to distal conditions. The varved clay complex is locally interrupted by a massive silty-clay unit, interpreted as an ice-drift material during the stagnation of the glacier margin at the Pandivere-Neva line. Varve correlation gave a 294-year-long floating varve chronology. According to total varve thickness and the relation between thicknesses of seasonal layers, an about 130-year period of ice-proximal conditions in the study area was followed by a rapid (within ca 20 years) change to more distal conditions. The presented varve chronology does not cover the entire period of proglacial conditions in the area, as all studied clay sections displayed an erosional discontinuity at the upper contact. In total, ca 4 m of selective post-sedimentary erosion of clay is attributed to wave erosion due to a water-level drop after the final drainage of the Baltic Ice Lake. It is concluded that the Yoldia Sea minimum level in the Parnu area was 0 to -2 m a.s.l.

Experimental evaluation of the spawning periods of whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus complex) in Lake Mondsee, Austria	BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT OF COREGONID FISHES - 2008	Advances in Limnology				10th Symposium on the Biology and Management of Coregonid Fishes	AUG, 2008	Winnipeg, CANADA					The integrity of a native Alpine whitefish population (Coregonus lavaretus species complex) in Lake Mondsee may have been impaired through potential hybridisation and introgression by stocking of Baltic origin whitefish for many decades. However, ecological niche differentiation with regard to different spawning times (November to early December for the introduced population, mid-December to mid-January for the native population) might facilitate reproductive isolation preserving the independence of the native population. We experimentally studied spawning activity of the two populations in an aquaculture setting to complement genetic and morphometric analysis. Despite identical culturing conditions with regard to water chemistry and temperature, day length, tank size etc., complete temporal segregation in spawning activity of the two whitefish populations was maintained in each of two spawning seasons, whereas some overlap was apparent when the two seasons were combined. Spawning time of first-time spawners was not significantly different from repeat spawners in the introduced population, however, it was retarded in native fish by almost one month when the first-time spawners (all native fish in the first season) were compared to repeat spawners in the second season (the same individuals). Our results generally confirm the reported differences in spawning time of the two groups and suggest a potential mechanism contributing to reproductive isolation. Differences in the onset of spawning of at least one month indicate distinct reactions to triggering factors and genetic rather than environmental control of spawning activity.

Genetic divergence among northern pike from spawning locations in the upper St. Lawrence River	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												To assess the ecological consequences associated with the degradation of riparian wetlands that historically provided spawning and rearing habitat for northern pike Esox lucius, annual spawning migrations and genetic structure were used to examine this species' dependence on four specific spawning areas in the Thousand Islands region of the Saint Lawrence River. Tagging and recapture over three consecutive spawning seasons resulted in low return rates (ranging from 1.2% in bays to 8.3% in tributaries), and some exchange was observed between locations. Angler recaptures indicated that northern pike did not disperse widely; 72% were recaptured less than 2.5 km from their tagging location, though the remainder moved distances ranging from 2.5 to 18 km. Six microsatellite loci showed significant allele frequency differences and small but significant genetic differentiation (F-ST) values among spawning sites in close proximity (< 5 km). However, two sites that were geographically distant (> 20 km) were not statistically different. A spawning site sampled in two consecutive years showed no discernable divergence, providing evidence for temporal stability in allelic frequencies. A plausible explanation for these mixed results is the existence of intraspecific contingents adapted to heterogeneous types of spawning and nursery conditions that promote multiple reproductive strategies.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2006	26	3					676	684		10.1577/M05-060.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M05-060.1													WOS:000240753900022

Despite their widespread usage, more knowledge is needed concerning their accumulation and transfer mechanisms within the aquatic food webs of urban fringe lakes, especially across rural-urban and seasonal scales. This study investigated the tissue distribution, bioaccumulation, biomagnification, associated human health risks, and potential risk mitigation strategies of 15 PFAAs within the food web of Luoma Lake, a prototypical urban fringe lake. All targeted PFAAs were detected in samples, with & sum;PFAA concentrations ranging from 116.97 to 564.26 ng/g dw in muscles and 26.96-1850.95 ng/g dw in viscera. Spatial variations revealed significantly higher & sum;PFAA concentrations in the muscles from the urban subregion (& sum;PFAA: 359.66 +/- 76.48 ng/g dw) compared to the rural subregion (& sum;PFAA: 328.86 +/- 87.51 ng/g dw). Seasonal fluctuations impacted PFAA concentrations in fish and crustacean muscles but exhibited negligible effects on bivalve muscles. Spatial variations only influenced PFAA concentrations in specific viscera (gill, liver, kidney), while seasonal changes had minimal effects on viscera. The organisms demonstrated varying bioaccumulation capacities, with crustaceans displaying the highest bioaccumulation potential, followed by crustaceans and fish. Both spatial and seasonal variations modulated the bioaccumulation patterns of PFAA in muscles, whereas bioaccumulation in viscera was only influenced by seasonal factors. Notably, PFAA biomagnification along the food web was exclusively governed by spatial distribution, remaining unaffected by seasonal changes. The human health risk assessment underscored the potential adverse health impacts of PFOS and PFOA, particularly on young children (aged 2 to <6 years). This study further proposed comprehensive recommendations for mitigating PFAA-induced health risks, encompassing source control, selective consumption, pre-cooking treatments, and strategic cooking method selection. This research provides crucial insights into the ecological behaviors and health implications of PFAA in urban fringe lakes.

However, the occurrence of NEOs in artificial waterways is unclear. The South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) is the largest water diversion project in the world. Water samples from the Luoma Lake to Dongping Lake section of the Eastern Route (ER)-SNWDP were collected and analyzed for eight widely used NEOs to study their spatiotemporal distribution, ecological risks, and health risks. The total NEO concentration was 9-666, 34-138, 8-126, and 7-103 ng L- 1 in the water diversion channel, Luoma Lake, Nansi Lake, and Dongping Lake, respectively. The average total NEO concentration in the water diversion channel in the dry season was twice as high as it was in the wet season, due to the precipitation dilution effect. Rather than Luoma Lake, Nansi Lake and Dongping Lake showed a seasonal difference in the average total NEO concentration. NEO concentrations in the three lakes were influenced by the inputs from natural rivers and the water diversion channels under artificial regulation. The seasonal variation in NEO composition between the water diversion channel and the three lakes suggested the channel water was not the only source for NEOs in lakes. For individual NEO ecological risks, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, and imidacloprid in the two seasons would result in high chronic risks in the water diversion channel, and moderate to high risks in Nansi Lake and Luoma Lake. Thiacloprid would result in high chronic risks in Dongping Lake in the two seasons and Luoma Lake in the wet season. For the integral NEO risks, none of the lake water sites exceeded the acute ecological threshold.

J	Volpers, M; Neumann, D				Volpers, M; Neumann, D			Tolerance of two tubificid species (Tubifex tubifex and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri) to hypoxic and sulfidic conditions in novel, long-term experiments	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Tubificid assemblages (seven species) from two eutrophic gravel-pit lakes (depth about 16 m) were studied in relation to hydrographic conditions (seasonal profiles of temperature, 02, pH, conductivity). In both lakes, severe hypoxia from June to November was accompanied by sulfide concentrations 1) of up to 25 mu mol L-1 (0.85 mg L-1) in the hypolimnion. While the absolute abundance of all tubificids decreased during this stagnation period, the relative abundance of Tubifex tubifex increased consistently because the other tubificid species, such as Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, suffered particularly high mortality. In long-term laboratory experiments of up to 14 weeks at 10 degrees C, groups of T tubifex and L. hoffmeisteri (eight to ten 4 mg-specimens each) were kept under various severely hypoxic and sulfidic conditions in a newly developed, computerised flow-through system simulating profundal conditions. The tubificids were able to remain in an almost natural substratum during the experiments. In T tubifex, the defecation rate (which is correlated with metabolic rate) was always slightly higher than that of L. hoffmeisteri. It was independent of oxygen content down to 0.5 mg O-2 L-1, but stopped below 0.3 mg O-2 L-1. L. hofftneisteri was much more sensitive to a sulfide concentration of about 30 mu mol L-1 in hypoxic medium (0.5 mg O-2 L-1, corresponding to 0.93 % P-O2) than T tubifex was. Under these conditions, Tubifex tubifex showed much lower mortality and even better growth than L. hoffmeisteri did. The higher sulfide tolerance of T tubifex in hypoxic conditions correlates with the dominance of this tubificid in the profundal of eutrophic lakes. This also relates to the higher sulfide resistance of both respiration rate and anaerobic energy metabolism in T tubifex.																			0003-9136					SEP	2005	164	1					13	38		10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0164-0013	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2005/0164-0013													WOS:000232714700002

The majority of drinking water sources in China are derived from rivers and lakes that are often significantly impacted by water pollution incidents. To tackle the internal mechanisms between water quality and quantity, in this study, a Copula-based spatiotemporal probabilistic model for drinking water sources at the watershed scale is proposed. A spatiotemporal distribution simulation model was constructed to predict the spatiotemporal variations for water discharge and pollution to each drinking water source. This method was then applied to the joint probabilistic assessment for the entire Yangtze River downstream watershed in Nanjing City. The results demonstrated a significant negative correlation between water discharge and pollutant concentration following a water emergency. The water quantity-quality joint probability distribution reached the highest value (0.8523) after 14 hours of exposure during the flood season, much higher than it was (0.4460) during the dry season. As for the Yangtze River downstream watershed, five key risk sources (N1-N5) and two high-exposure drinking water sources (W3-W4; AEI=1) =1) should be paid more attention. Overall, this research highlights a comprehensive mode between water quantity and quality for drinking water sources to cope with accidental water pollution.

Zooplankton composition and community structure in Lake Tiga, Kano, Nigeria	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Zooplankton in Lake Tiga was identified and its community structure assessed between March 2009 and March 2011. A total of 54 species of zooplankton was recorded, comprising two species of Protozoa, 26 species of Rotifera, eight species of Copepoda, 11 species of Cladocera, four species of Ostracoda and three species of insect larvae. Species occurrence and abundance were both higher in the dry season than in the rainy season. Occurrence showed an increasing trend from the upper basin towards the lower basin (dam site) in the surface waters and a decreasing trend from the surface down to the bottom of the lake. Zooplankton abundance showed no definite pattern in its surface horizontal variation but showed a decreasing trend from the surface down to the bottom of the lake. In terms of species diversity, Rotifera had the highest number of zooplankton species, followed by Cladocera, Copepoda, Ostracoda, insect larvae and Protozoa. In terms of abundance, Rotifera again had the highest abundance value, followed by Cladocera, Copepoda, Protozoa, Ostracoda and insect larvae. Species diversity and evenness indices indicated that Lake Tiga, although not pristine, was not polluted.

Post-flood dietary variation in the Mozambique tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus in the St Lucia Estuary, South Africa	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Although originally endemic to southern Africa, the Mozambique tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus is now among the most widely distributed exotic fish species worldwide. It has become the dominant fish species in the St Lucia estuarine lake (South Africa) since the closure of the mouth in 2002 and is therefore a crucial component of the food webs throughout the system. Following a decade-long drought phase, the estuary has received a large amount of freshwater inflow since 2011, resulting in a salinity decrease throughout the system. We compared dietary composition of O. mossambicus among 3 sites across a salinity gradient between the hypersaline and diluted stage to determine whether environmental conditions influence the diet of this species. Stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen were used in conjunction with gut content analysis to elucidate dietary composition. A wide range of dietary sources was found during the hypersaline stage, with all sources contributing similar proportions to the diet. However, during the diluted stage that currently prevails in the system, specific dietary sources such as sediment organic matter were more dominant in the diet. Trophic position and salinity showed a significant negative relationship, indicating the adaptability of this species to salinity changes. A high degree of variability in the stomach contents of these fish was identified, with clear differences among sites and between seasons. This is an indication of the trophic plasticity that this species exhibits, which aids its ability to adapt to different environmental conditions and dominate the fish community throughout the St Lucia estuarine system.

A total of 63 taxa were identified, among them 51 species of rotifers, 8 cladocerans, and 4 copepods. Rotifera represented the predominant component (79% of the total community), followed by nauplii, cladocerans, and copepods (15%, 5%, and 1%, respectively). The average total zooplankton abundance ranged from 9603 to 22,968 ind/m(3). The maximum and the minimum densities were measured in June and August of 2009, respectively. Of the identified zooplankton, 39 taxa were species with a low frequency in the lake. Among the species with the highest frequency of encounter were Coronatella rectangula, Chydorus sphaericus, Colurella adriatica, Keratella quadrata, Lecane closterocerca, L. bulla, and Polyarthra vulgaris. Zooplankton diversity showed a positive correlation with temperature and chlorophyll a. However, a significant negative correlation was detected between diversity and salinity.

J	Kyle, R				Kyle, R.			Thirty years of monitoring traditional fish trap catches at Kosi Bay, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and management implications	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												The catches of the traditional fish traps in the Kosi Bay estuarine lakes were monitored over a 30-year period from 1981 to 2010. Monitoring data were used to provide estimates of, and insights into, catch size and species composition as well as seasonal and annual cycles of catch abundance. Over 1.2 million fish, comprising 43 species and 23 families, were estimated to have been caught during the study period. Tag-and-release data were used to estimate the impact of trap fishing on fish stocks and comparisons were made with recreational fishing to indicate overall fishing pressure and the sustainability of the fishing. Trap numbers remained fairly similar from the first year of monitoring (1981) until 1994, but thereafter they more than trebled by 2001; although numbers decreased after this, they remained well above earlier levels. During this period, recreational angling was an important factor, and gillnetting - both legal and illegal - added to the fishing pressure. Information from the fish trap monitoring, together with results from fish mark and recapture studies, suggest a very high, and possibly unsustainable, catch rate that requires management intervention to return them back to historical and sustainable levels.																			1814-232X						2013	35	1					67	78		10.2989/1814232X.2013.769905	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/1814232X.2013.769905													WOS:000318980800009

Backscattering was checked against ground truth. Despite the good spatial resolution of the ASAR, its applicability for detecting snow cover, and especially wet snow, was only possible at much lower resolutions, since noise was found to be very high. Scenes with bare ground or with dry snow cover showed highest backscattering, with averages from -10 to -12 dB. Wet snow showed a shift towards lower values, peaking at -15 dB. A threshold of -13 to -14 dB was identified between dry/bare ground and wet snow scenes at Crater Lake. The backscatter difference to a reference snow-free scene usually provided better classification results, and a threshold ranging from -2 to -3 dB was found. Results show that, despite the relative ease of use of C-band ASAR, special care is necessary since the results show significant noise, and it should only be applied to large areas. Large seasonal patterns of snow melt were identified on Deception Island.

We studied the breeding success of Red-throated Divers during 1994-2011 in Nuuksio National park in Southern Finland. We conducted an experiment in which we used peat hummocks to build floating nesting sites for the focal species. We used a population in Evo, South-Central Finland, as our control (i.e., no management). We found that the Nuuksio population increased steadily, and that the birds had a relatively high breeding success (pairs with a brood 73%, juveniles/pair 1.04). The index of juveniles per pair did not suggest density-dependence in the Nuuksio population. All except one nesting attempt at Nuuksio and Evo failed in mainland shoreline mire margins. Our results indicate that artificial nesting sites increase the breeding success of the Red-throated Diver. We assume that the mitigation of the effects of disturbance with management can improve brood production in the species.					; Nummi, Petri/AAU-9666-2021	Nummi, Petri/0000-0003-1452-4633; 													0030-5685						2013	90	1					16	22																WOS:000317947800003

The aim of this short research note is to refer and assess seasonal variability and mortality of malaria in Ngogwe in southeast Uganda in 2011/2012 season. METHODS: We analyzed clinical records of patients admitted to Buikwe-Ngogwe Hospital in the period from July 1, 2011 to August 25, 2012 to assess seasonality of malaria. RESULTS: Altogether, 23,675 patients were admitted to Buikwe-Ngogwe Hospital due to fever illness and 14,940 malaria-positive samples were obtained (63.1%) from these patients. We have observed significantly higher number of malaria cases in December compared to period of June - November (p<0.01). Mortality rate was only 0.48%. CONCLUSION: Interestingly, we have observed seasonal variability in malaria occurrence in Ngogwe, Southeast Uganda, which is, not correlating with rainy season but with movement of population to the areas closer to Lake Victoria. However, despite of high prevalence, mortality of this disease remained low. The reasons for low mortality are probably a good access to health care facility and adaptation of artemisinin-based combinational therapy for documented malaria.

Indigenous fishing devices in use of capture fishing in Tripura	INDIAN JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE												Fishing with traditional devices is an old age practice followed by fisher folk of Tripura. The present fishing technique and devices are the results of knowledge and experience gained the fishing community from the ancestors. The documentation of these practices and devices are important for their development on scientific line and for betterment of fishing community. Hence an attempt has been made to study existing the fishing methods, designs, structures and operations of fishing gears of Tripura. The Rudra S agar lake of West Tripura district and Harijala water body of South Tripura district were selected for conducting this study. The survey results revealed that three types of fishing devices, viz, fishing gears with net, hooks and spears and traps are in use for fishing in the study area. It appears from the study of fishing devices of Tripura that though it is a small state of the country yet has a rich indigenous know how about capture fishing. The indiscriminate fishing, fishing in the breeding season, poisoning and fishing with gillnets are some of the ill practices of fishing observed in the study area. These are potential threats to the fish biodiversity of Tripura and as such these should be discouraged.

J	Bernhardt, J				Bernhardt, Jase			Determining Regional Weather Patterns from a Historical Diary	WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY												Prior to the twentieth century, there was a dearth of official local weather and climate observations for much of the United States outside of major cities. Useful information can be gleaned, however, from primary accounts, such as historical diaries kept by farmers and others whose interests were tied to the land. Herman Smith, a farmer in west-central New York State, kept a detailed record of daily life, including weather characteristics such as temperature, precipitation, and wind, for his farm near Covert. Two full years of his diary, 1884 and 1886, were recently published and selected for study. Although typically not numeric data, the lexicon used in the diary to describe relative heat and cold allow Smith's observations to be analyzed semiquantitatively in order to determine the weather experienced that year including factors affecting the growing season, as well as significant weather and climatic events. The analysis demonstrates that for Covertlocated in an area of topographic variability and proximal to the Finger Lakesmicroclimatic effects occasionally dominated over the synoptic circulation. This finding was further reinforced by comparison of Smith's 1886 records with those of a nearby farmer. Meanwhile, Smith's accounts also establish an inextricable link between his agricultural practices and the weather and climate patterns he observed. These findings underscore the value of acquiring climatic data from nonconventional sources for places and times when reliable data may be nonexistent in order to better understand how climate, and its impacts on the environment, have varied over time, across multiple scales.

Nutrient concentrations in the reservoirs increased in the direction of water flow, whereas Wenshan Lake was more eutrophic. Cyanobacterial blooms occurred in all four water bodies, with differing seasonal trends and dominant species. In Xili and Tiegang Reservoirs, the VBNC ratio (percent of VBNC state bacteria over total viable bacteria) was high for most of the year and negatively correlated with cyanobacterial density. Laboratory co-culture experiments were performed with four heterotrophic bacterial species isolated from Wenshan Lake (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella peneumoniae, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus cereus) and the dominant cyanobacterial species (Microcystis aeruginosa). For the first three bacterial species, the presence of M. aeruginosa induced the VBNC state and the VBNC ratio was positively correlated with M. aeruginosa density. However, B. cereus inhibited M. aeruginosa growth. These results demonstrate that cyanobacteria could potentially regulate the transformation to the VBNC state of waterborne bacteria, and suggest a role for bacteria in cyanobacterial bloom initiation and termination.																			0963-9292	1573-3017				OCT	2015	24	7-8			SI		1459	1466		10.1007/s10646-015-1476-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10646-015-1476-y								26048238					WOS:000365757800007

In this study, we tested the existence of intra- and inter-annual changes in the relative condition factors (kn) of three Curimatidae: Potamorhina altamazonica, Potamorhina latior, and Psectrogaster rutiloides. We used weight and length data from fish that were caught in eight floodplain lakes of the Rio Solimoes. These data were from experimental fisheries during each season of the hydrological cycle: flooding, flood, drying, and dry from 2004, 2005, and 2006. In general, there are similar patterns of intra-annual changes for these three species, with the highest estimates of kn during high water conditions. The lowest values were observed during the drying and dry seasons of 2005, when an extreme drought occurred in the Amazon basin. Higher values were observed during the same seasons in the year post-drought. We hypothesized that these patterns would be explained by the biological characteristics of these species and the effects of intra-annual hydrological changes, mainly the flood pulse effect, and by inter-annual climatic events, which are determined by global climate phenomena.

The seasonal dynamics of the biomass of Lemnaceae in isolates differed significantly from the control aggregation. The isolation negatively affected the growth of Lemnaceae, but had a positive effect on the development of the macroinvertebrate communities. Statistically significant differences in the abundance, biomass, and the number of species in phytophilic communities were not found between experimental isolates and in comparison to the control.

This characteristic has a great influence on dam and slope engineering. There is a large area of saline soil in western Jilin Province, the seasonal frost zone, and this soil is highly dispersive. We studied the properties of soil samples collected from vertical holes near Qian'an Dabusu Lake, assessing the particle size distribution and the chemical components. We also comprehensively identified the level of soil dispersivity by three standard methods, the pinhole test, the crumb test, and the double-hydrometer test. The soil composition and basic physicochemical properties are proved to be the most important factors which determine the dispersion degree of the saline soil. Our results showed that, within depth ranges from 0 to 1 m, silt particles highly influenced the soil dispersivity, and the total soluble salt accounted for >= 0.3%. At the first sampling point, in a tall soil column, the dispersion degree decreased with increasing depth, but this was not as obvious at the second sampling point, which was in a flat area. Nevertheless, the superficial soils of these two sampling sites were strongly dispersive, which must be taken into consideration for soil engineering in this region.					wang, gang/ITT-0670-2023														1674-3822					OCT	2015	7	5					579	586		10.3724/SP.J.1226.2015.00579	http://dx.doi.org/10.3724/SP.J.1226.2015.00579													WOS:000391107800016

ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT												The circulation in Lake Ontario is well known from past field and modeling studies. However, apparent changes in wind patterns, possibly due to climate change, have resulted in subtle changes in the currents' formation that have implications for water resources and aquatic habitats. A high-resolution three-dimensional numerical model using the Danish Hydraulic Institute's (DHI) MIKE 3 modeling framework based on a flexible mesh was developed to describe lake-wide and coastal circulation features in 2018, which were then contrasted with past studies. The validated model effectively described lake-wide processes that include season-specific large gyres in the Rochester and Mississauga basins and coastal currents along both northern and southern shorelines. During the isothermal season (non-stratified), a well-defined westward flow in the middle of the lake separates an anticyclonic (clockwise) gyre in the north, from the gyre and westward currents in the south. During the stratified season, key physical processes depicted in the model in the offshore and nearshore waters, including near-inertial waves (similar to 17 h), upwelling events frequency (5-10 days), and surface seiches (similar to 5 h), generally correspond with past studies. Upwelling events are the predominant northern nearshore physical processes, occurring during periods of south-westerly winds. Episodic Kelvin waves are mostly limited to the northern shore where wind direction and morphology can sustain them and where cross-shore transport at the coastal boundary layer is minimal. The results, backed by field observations, suggest that predominant circulation patterns in the northern nearshore have changed in recent years during the stratified season. We conducted four sensitivity analysis scenarios to test our hypothesis about climate change's influence over circulation patterns.																			1420-2026	1573-2967				APR	2025	30	2					219	239		10.1007/s10666-024-10003-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10666-024-10003-z		OCT 2024											WOS:001336785800002

Therefore, it is necessary to be able to distinguish fish from different lakes and coastal sea regions to ensure a good traceability of products in the fish market and to protect both consumers and fish stocks. Untargeted metabolomics using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a suitable tool for this purpose. It is an established method for determining various properties of biological and living systems, such as health, origin, type, etc. Statistical methods including principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are typically applied to NMR data to correlate spectra with a particular research question. Herein we examine fish from three closely related water bodies and demonstrate that reliable determination of the water body that a particular fish originates from by traditional statistical analysis (PCA and LDA) of fish NMR spectra is not possible. In contrast, determining the fish species is possible. We proceed to show that machine learning methods perform better and that a combination of statistical analysis (LDA) and random forest (RF), a supervised machine learning technique, allows reliable determination of the originating water body, while being also tolerant to seasonal variations. This is an improvement over prior work, which has dealt with more clearly distinguished origins of fish. Exceptional accuracy was achieved in correctly assigning fish to their origin even in a scenario where two of the water bodies are connected by a river through which the fish are known to migrate. Since determining the origin of fish is important in environmental protection, we recommend following up this approach and using it as the basis of a robust tool for environmental protection and other monitoring purposes.

ESTIMATING SPAWNING HABITAT AVAILABILITY IN FLOODED AREAS OF THE RIVER WAAL, THE NETHERLANDS	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS					National Meeting of the British-Hydrological-Society	JUN, 2008	Loughborough Univ, Loughborough, ENGLAND	British Hydrol Soc	Loughborough Univ			Fish spawning habitat availability in the river Waal is significantly influenced by seasonal and annual variations in discharge. In this paper we develop habitat suitability models, based on a literature survey of spawning preferences of the commonly occurring species roach (Rutilus rutilus), bream (Abramis brama), pikeperch (Sander lucioperca) and bleak (Alburnus alburnus). Within the resulting models water depth, flow velocity, water temperature and vegetation type were the most significant environmental parameters. Spatial data for the parameters were derived from a 2-D hydrodynamic model and detailed monitoring database. The area of suitable habitat available for spawning was calculated using the HABITAT software, based on species-specific suitability models and the environmental characteristics of two study sites on the river Waal over a 3 year period (1997-1999). The predicted available spawning area was compared with field data on the recruitment of young fish of each species for the same years and locations. There was a positive relationship between predicted available habitat and observed young of the year (YOY) densities for bream, roach and pikeperch. A negative relationship was recorded between predicted available area and observed YOY densities for bleak. The results indicate that optimal hydrological and hydraulic conditions differ even for species that are widely considered eurytopic. Moreover, annual differences in habitat availability indicate a strong influence of hydrological variability on population dynamics.

Inferring long-term changes in the physical-chemical environment of the shallow, enriched Lake Nero from statistical and functional analyses of its phytoplankton	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The qualitative and quantitative studies of the plytoplankton, concentration of inorganic nitrogen and phosphate and chloroplyll a in the water column and its seasonal and spatial variation have been studied in the open water of the large, shallow and highly eutrophic Lake Nero over periods representing more than one decade (1988-1989 and 1999-2003). The average qualitative characteristics of plytoplankton have remained stable over the period of observations; however; structural and functional characteristics have been highly unstable in the short term. This is controversial but, may be due to the high robustness of the ecosystem to the environmental stresses. The frequencies of species within seasonal-abundance parameters have been used, together with additional data on the dominance of the community expressed in terms of evaluated Species of the Functional Croups (SFG). Correlation and factor analyses were used to estimate the strength of selected environmental factors on the development of SFG. In the periods covered by our analyses, the selected parameters were always strongly correlated with first principal components, which were dominated by properties relating to the underwater light field. According to our investigation, the phytoplankton of Lake Nero supports a commonly occurring combination S1 filamentous cyanobacteria with C diatoms and participation J greens, M and H1 dinitrogen-fixing opts. It is typical of shallow, nutrient-rich lakes, comprising species that perform well under conditions of poor light. Individual species dominance varies but strictly among species making up the SI association. Full accord with the two hypotheses of the PROTECH (Phytoplankton RespOnses To Environmental Change) model has been demonstrated.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				SEP	2007	29	9					747	756		10.1093/plankt/fbm055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbm055													WOS:000249659600002

Phytoplankton species composition, numerical abundance, spatial distribution and total biomass measured as chlorophyll a concentration were studied in relation to environmental factors in September 1994 (dry season) and March 1995 (rainy season), respectively, in the Kenyan waters of Lake Victoria; 103 species were recorded. 2. Blue-green algae (Cyanophyceae) were most diverse, followed by diatoms (Bacillariophyceae), green algae (Chlorophyceae) and dinoflagellates (Dinophyceae). 3. Twinspan separated the phytoplankton communities in the Nyanza Gulf and those in the open lake during both seasons. During the dry season, the Nyanza Gulf was strongly dominated by blue-greens, while diatoms dominated in the open lake. During the rainy season, blue-greens remained dominant in the Nyanza Gulf although the number of species found was lower than during the dry season; in the open lake, blue-greens replaced diatoms as the dominant group and there were more species than in the dry season. 4. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the phytoplankton species distribution was significantly correlated with turbidity during the dry season and with SiO2 during the rainy season. Chlorophyll a concentrations ranging from 2.0 to 71.5 mg m(-3) in the dry season and 2.0-17.2 mg m(-3) in the rainy season confirm earlier reports of increasing phytoplankton biomass in Lake Victoria since the 1960s.																			0046-5070					APR	2000	43	4					529	543		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00525.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2000.00525.x													WOS:000086330700001
J	Rohrlack, T; Henning, M; Kohl, JG				Rohrlack, T; Henning, M; Kohl, JG			Mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa on Daphnia galeata's ingestion rate	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The possible effects of five Microcystis aeruginosa strains (two unicellular and three colony forming) on the filtering and feeding behavior of Daphnia galeata were investigated to clarify the mechanisms of the inhibitory effect on the ingestion rate of the animals. Of the tested cyanobacterial strains, three inhibited Daphnia's food ingestion. This was primarily caused by affecting the frequency and food transport efficiency of the maxillary contractions. As a result, Daphnia's swallowing rate, and in one case the amount of food contained in the swallowed boluses, were lower than in suspensions of well-ingestible food sources. In contrast, there is no indication that Microcystis can influence thoracic appendage beat or rejection rate. It is likely that colony-forming and unicellular strains can affect the ingestion process due to different factors. The mucilage of the colony-forming Microcystis strains HUB-W75 and HUB-W334 possibly produced a mechanical hindrance of the maxillules, which resulted in an abnormal movement and consequently in the inhibitory effects described above. This was related to the sugar composition of the mucilage polysaccharides, but not to the cellular microcystin content or occurrence of accompanying bacteria. The mucilage-lacking strain HUB 5-2-4, however, must contain another factor which interfered with the maxillules' movement in an unknown way.																			0142-7873					AUG	1999	21	8					1489	1500		10.1093/plankt/21.8.1489	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/21.8.1489													WOS:000081994200006

Refining our knowledge on its spatial distribution is a key point for its preventive management. To do so, we used in Chad a method of spatial smoothing of densities upon 7014 survey points (1965-1971 and 1986-2017) of the desert locust to develop seasonal distribution maps for invasion and remission periods. Three zones corresponding to breeding and gregarization areas have been identified: (1) Kanem/lake Chad, (2) Batha, (3) Ennedi. The first one may be a new gregarization area. These zones add to the Tibesti mountains where locust reports are less frequent than in the past, due to insecurity. More regular surveys should confirm that the distribution of the desert locust has recently changed.

J	Paasche, O; Larsen, J				Paasche, Oyvind; Larsen, Jorunn			Changes in lake stratification and oxygen distribution inferred from two contrasting records of magnetotactic bacteria and diatoms	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) and diatoms produce hard parts on seasonal timescales that continuously becomes embedded in various soft sediment archives. Consequently, they can, and are, frequently used to reconstruct past environmental conditions in oceans, fjords, and freshwater basins. In this study, we observe how these two cosmopolitan creatures can be used to track vertical shifts in the distribution of oxygen in a small mountain lake situated in western Norway. Several short and long sediment cores have been retrieved from the lake, allowing for a detailed reconstruction that spans the last 2500 years. During periods of enhanced runoff from the catchment the Oxic-Anoxic Transition Zone (OATZ) is lowered down to the lake-sediment interface, due to increased convection. We posit that this condition reduces the concentration of microaerophilic magnetite-producing MTB, an interpretation partly supported by rock magnetic analyzes. Preservation of diatom frustules is, however, improved whenever this oxygen-rich scenario prevails. Similarly, when runoff is low, and the OATZ is lifted above the lake sediment interface, MTB concentration seems to increase, whereas dissolution of diatoms is more common. This consistent antiphase relationship between MTB concentration and diatom preservation, occurring on a multidecadal timescale during lowest reconstructed lake-water pH in the lake's history, suggest a coupled response to subtle changes in external environmental variables that affect catchment and lake hydrology.

Solid-phase speciation and partitioning of As in the sediments appear to be primary determinants of both potential As regeneration rate and, conversely, the rate at which long-term burial of the pond's As burden will occur. Although iron (Fe) chemistry often controls As speciation in lakes, a higher rate of As regeneration in the south basin, accompanied by the absence of a correlation between regenerated As and Fe in this basin, suggest that additional factors operate to control As cycling in this lake. Solid-phase As speciation was remarkably similar between sediments of the two basins of this lake, about 40% of sedimentary As in upper sediments being in relatively labile (ionically bound and strongly adsorbed) fractions and a larger fraction of As being associated with recalcitrant minerals, likely sulfides. Extraction, X-ray fluorescence, and acid-volatile sulfide data collectively suggest that sedimentary As cycling in both basins is largely controlled by the formation of sulfide minerals. An accounting of the size of sulfur (S) pools supports this conclusion, showing that sufficient S exists in the north basin to control both Fe and As, while the south basin has lower S levels resulting in seasonal accumulation of Fe in the porewater.

Fine-scale spatial heterogeneity and seed size determine early seedling survival in a desert perennial shrub (Ericameria nauseosa: Asteraceae)	PLANT ECOLOGY												In heterogenous landscapes, seeds settle in some microsites more readily than others, independently of whether those microsites are suitable for germination and subsequent growth, and survival of seedlings. Wild seeds and seedlings of Ericameria nauseosa var. oreophila in the sand-dune ecosystem near Mono Lake, California show both concordance and conflict in where seeds are retained and where seedlings flourish. Using a field experiment, we followed performance of seeds and seedlings (i.e., the rate of germination and successful emergence, initial seedling size, seedling growth and survival over first growing season), by planting seeds of known sizes in pre-identified microsites (windward and lee aspects of interspaces between shrubs, under shrub canopies, and under snag canopies, respectively). Heavier seeds were more likely to germinate and emerge successfully and resulted in initially larger seedlings than lighter seeds. These initially larger seedlings subsequently remained larger over the growing season and lived longer than initially smaller seedlings. Independent of seed and initial seedling size, seedlings that germinated under the canopy of adult shrubs grew larger and survived longer than seedlings that germinated in interspaces (open space with little or no vegetation) or under snags (dead adult shrubs). Seedlings grown under the canopy of adult shrubs experienced significantly less solar radiation and wind-deposited sand than seedlings grown in interspace or snag microsites. Sand burial more than 1 cm was lethal for seedlings. The two variables of seed size and microsite type had by far greater impact on eventual growth and survival of seedlings than did aspect, and the effects of the former two variables were independent of each other. This study amplifies the body of work on E. nauseosa at this site demonstrating that the earliest events in the life history of this long-lived perennial shrub appear to persist through time despite the harsh and variable environment.																			1385-0237	1573-5052				FEB	2008	194	2					195	205		10.1007/s11258-007-9284-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-007-9284-y													WOS:000251309200004

A Remote Sensing Approach to Characterize Cold Region Watershed Storage and its Influence on Streamflow Generation	WETLANDS												The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) has an extremely variable climate and has pronounced impacts on wetlands as they are highly responsive to the variability in air temperature and precipitation. In recent years, the PPR has been in a novel wet climate continuum since 1993, facilitating severe flooding in the Devils Lake Basin (DLB), North Dakota- costing the US similar to$1B USD. Many studies using remotely sensed imagery reported a substantial increase in the number of surface water bodies and expansion of the existing water bodies during 1988-2013 period. In addition to surface water area, the water storage of the potholes also substantially increased. However, very few studies quantify the surface water storage and its dynamics to the recent increase in precipitation using remotely sensed data in the PPR. In this study, we utilize high resolution LiDAR DEM and monthly global surface water data (GSWD) to estimate filled storage of each pothole in the Starkweather Coulee Basin (SCB, 700 km(2))- a headwater basin draining to a terminal lake (Devils Lake). Our findings suggest that the SCB storage gradually filling up during two wet periods: 1990-1998 and 2009-2013, resulting in massive streamflow and subsequent flooding. The SBC fractional storage also exhibits a strong positive and exponential relationship with peak streamflow and annual streamflow volume indicating strong influence of wetland storage and fill-spill hydrology on the streamflow generation. The exponential relationships also point toward a threshold SCB fractional storage for generating extreme streamflow generation.					; Mahmood, Taufique/ABB-8369-2020	Mahmood, Taufique/0000-0003-1198-9603; 													0277-5212	1943-6246				OCT	2024	44	7							95	10.1007/s13157-024-01850-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-024-01850-3													WOS:001311125700002

Study focus: Previous studies often quantified the impacts of climate change, land use, and dam construction on flow regime by only focusing on two of these factors at one time. In addition, the previous method used to quantify the deviation in the timing of annual extreme water conditions has a flaw. Therefore, this study improved the formula for calculating the deviation in the timing of annual extreme water conditions. Moreover, we proposed a novel framework for quantifying the impacts of dam construction, climate change, and land-use change on flow regime. New hydrological insights for the region: The study observed significant alterations in the flow regime of the Ganjiang River Basin. These modifications were predominantly influenced by dam construction and climate change. Dam construction led to a notable increase in dry season flow and minimum flow indicators, while decreasing maximum flow indicators. Conversely, climate change resulted in a reduction of minimum flow indicators and an increase in maximum flow indicators. Climate change has also led to an increase in the frequency and duration of flow pulses. Intriguingly, dam construction and climate change played offsetting roles for 77 % of the indicators. Considering the global climate change context, judicious dam operation could to mitigate the impact of climate change on the flow regime.

A fuzzy comprehensive evaluation was conducted and the comprehensive trophic level index was applied to evaluate the lakes' water quality. The results showed differences in the regional, spatial, and temporal distributions of physical and chemical indicators in typical lakes in southeast Hubei. The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation showed that the water quality levels in Daye, Cihu, Baoan, and Xiandao Lakes for 2018 and 2019 were IV, IV, III, and II and V, IV, III, and II, respectively, with seasonal variations in water quality occurring during the year. The trophic level index results showed that Cihu Lake was mildly eutrophic in 2018 and moderately eutrophic in 2019, and Daye, Baoan, and Xiandao Lakes were mildly eutrophic, mildly eutrophic, and mesotrophic, respectively. Lake water quality was influenced by land use types, landscape configuration, inflowing rivers, precipitation, and interactions between land use and seasons. This study helps us to understand the trend and causes of lake pollution in Southeast Hubei, which is conducive to watershed management and the control of water quality deterioration, and also has an important role in regulating the sustainable development of industry and agriculture in the watershed.

Mytilocypridines produce desiccation-resistant eggs to persist in these habitats during unfavourable conditions. In this study, we used mytilocypridine eggs collected from sediments in salt lakes in Western Australia to analyse aspects of the ecology of these ostracods. We conducted two rehydration trials, where sediment was collected from dry lakes or the dry margins of lakes, rehydrated in a laboratory setting, and selected mytilocypridine species hatched and raised in cultures. The first trial found that the eggs of mytilocypridine species were unevenly distributed in a dry lake and could be hatched even after 27 months of dry storage with no discernible loss of viability. The second trial assessed the capacity of selected mytilocypridines to hatch and develop into adults under different salinity treatments. One species, Australocypris insularis, hatched and developed across a very wide salinity range (0-100 g/L). Egg/sediment samples provide a means for testing species' tolerance to physical and chemical variables throughout their entire life cycle, as well as for surveying the mytilocypridines in remote lakes that rarely hold water.					; lawrie, angus/LTF-3591-2024; Rahman, Mohammad/KHY-3819-2024	Pinder, Adrian/0000-0002-9390-7909; Rahman, Mahabubur/0000-0001-6678-3747; Lawrie, Angus/0000-0002-6766-1191													0018-8158	1573-5117				FEB	2025	852	3			SI		609	628		10.1007/s10750-024-05708-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-024-05708-x		OCT 2024											WOS:001326667500001

To fill this gap, we refined a process-based lake biogeochemical model to simulate global lake CH4 emissions, including representation of lake bathymetry, oxic methane production (OMP), the effect of water level on ebullition, new non-linear CH4 oxidation kinetics, and the coupling of sediment carbon pools with in-lake primary production and terrigenous carbon loadings. We compiled a lake CH4 data set for model validation. The model shows promising performance in capturing the seasonal and inter-annual variabilities of CH4 emissions at 10 representative lakes for different lake types and the variations in mean annual CH4 emissions among 106 lakes across the globe. The model reproduces the variations of the observed surface CH4 diffusion and ebullition along the gradients of lake latitude, depth, and surface area. The results suggest that OMP could play an important role in surface CH4 diffusion, and its relative importance is higher in less productive and/or deeper lakes. The model performance is improved for capturing CH4 outgassing events in non-floodplain lakes and the seasonal variability of CH4 ebullition in floodplain lakes by representing the effect of water level on ebullition. The model can be integrated into ESMs to constrain global lake CH4 emissions and climate-CH4 feedback.

During both the low- and high-water seasons, the stratification of water column was weak, and the euphotic zone depth was only half of the total water depth. The concentrations of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) and phytoplankton biomass indicated by chlorophyll a (Chl a) per unit volume during the low-water season was three to four times higher than those during the high-water season, whereas the per unit area weights integrated through the water column did not show any seasonal differences on the whole-lake scale. In the high-water season, the intrusion of river water with a very high nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratio (25-189) appeared to be the predominant nutrient source for the lake water with a low N:P ratio (7-27). In contrast, the N:P ratio of the laker water (2-20) was relatively low during the low-water season, implying the possibility of N-limitation. During the low-water season, Chl a concentrations were significantly higher in the north basin, which is far from the connecting point to the Tonle Sap River. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) ordination indicated seasonal and horizontal variations in the phytoplankton composition at the surface. The abundance of diatoms (Aulacoseira and Suriella) that favor mixing conditions tended to be higher in the offshore area and during the high-water season. Blooms of cyanobacteria that favor nutrient-rich and low-water movement conditions tended to occur at north basin stations and during the low-water season.

Sedimentology of perennial ice-covered, meromictic Lake A, Ellesmere Island, at the northern extreme of Canada	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES												The sedimentology of coastal, meromictic Lake A, Ellesmere Island (83 degrees 00'N, 75 degrees 30'W), was investigated to understand the linkages between the extreme lake environment and its sedimentary features. Four facies were identified within the sedimentary record that represent stages of the lake's development from a marine embayment to a meromictic lake. Despite low ecosystem productivity, both clastic and biogenic materials contribute substantially, and highly seasonal sedimentation, pervasive ice cover, and anoxia in the saline bottom water (monimolimnion) act to preserve annual sedimentary units (varves) within the upper part of the sedimentary record. Sediment texture is predominantly silt and clay, but the irregular presence of sand indicates past episodes of higher energy stream discharge to the lake. Oxygen incursions into the chemocline likely cause bacteria mortality and provide elemental sulphur for iron sulphides that are deposited in the sediments. Millimetre-scale sedimentary pellets are also a conspicuous feature in the sediments and are interpreted to result from littoral sediment transport by ice-rafting. Many of Lake A's notable sedimentary features are also evident in other High Arctic meromictic lakes, particularly those on the northern coast of Ellesmere Island. These similarities and the important biogenic component identified in Lake A suggest that processes in these sedimentary environments are more complex than previously thought.					; Vincent, Warwick/AAH-6152-2019	Vincent, Warwick/0000-0001-9055-1938; Antoniades, Dermot/0000-0001-6629-4839													0008-4077	1480-3313				FEB	2009	46	2					83	100		10.1139/E09-008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/E09-008													WOS:000264897400002
J	Fletcher, RJ Jr; Koford, RR				Fletcher, RJ Jr; Koford, RR			Changes in breeding bird populations with habitat restoration in northern Iowa	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Native tallgrass prairie and wetland habitat in the Prairie Pothole Region of the United States have declined over the past two centuries. Bird communities using these habitats have also experienced widespread declines that are often attributed to severe habitat loss and fragmentation. We estimated the change, or turnover, in bird populations in the Eagle Lake Wetland Complex, Iowa, with ongoing grassland and wetland restoration by linking geographic information system data and bird surveys in different land cover types (hayland, pasture, restored grassland, restored wetland and rowcrop agriculture) during the 1999-2001 breeding seasons. Habitat restoration efforts primarily converted rowcrop agriculture and pastures into grassland and wetland habitat. Based on land conversion, abundances of most species have likely increased in the area, including many species of management concern. Yet a few species, such as killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), have probably decreased in abundance. This estimation approach and these estimates provided a critical first step for evaluating restoration efforts; however, information on demographic parameters, such as nesting success, in restored areas is needed for understanding how restoration ultimately affects bird populations.

The AAFW system was a continuous-flow system constructed with one storage basin of 3 m(3) capacity, one phytoplankton tank of 3 m(3) capacity, and one zooplankton growth chamber of 1.5 m(3) capacity. The system was optimized by setting hydraulic retention time of phytoplankton tank as 3 days and D. magna density as 740-1000 individual l(-1). When the system was operated on eutrophic stream water that was delivering 471 g of total nitrogen (TN) and 29 g of total phosphorus (TP) loadings for 45 days, 250 g (53%) of TN and 16 g (54%) of TP were removed from the water during its passage through the phytoplankton tank. In addition, 64 g (14%) of TN and 4 g (13%) of TP were removed from the water by harvesting zooplankton biomass in the zooplankton growth chamber, resulting in significant overall removal rates of TN (69%), nitrate (78%), TP (73%), and dissolved inorganic phosphorus (94%). While the removal efficiency of the AAFW system is comparable to those of other ecotechnologies such as constructed wetlands, its operation is less limited by the availability of space or seasonal shift of temperature. Therefore, it was concluded that AAFW system is a highly efficient, flexible system for reducing nutrient levels in tributary streams and hence nutrient loading to large aquatic systems receiving the stream water.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2009	630	1					149	159		10.1007/s10750-009-9788-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-009-9788-7													WOS:000267030500011
J	Paterson, KJ; Schreider, MJ; Zimmerman, KD				Paterson, KJ; Schreider, MJ; Zimmerman, KD			Anthropogenic effects on seston quality and quantity and the growth and survival of Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata) in two estuaries in NSW, Australia	AQUACULTURE												The influence that catchment development has on the growth and survival of the Sydney rock oyster, through its effect on the quality and quantity of seston was investigated in Brisbane Water and Lake Macquarie. Developed locations recorded elevated levels of dissolved nitrogen (NH3 and NQ(x) and chlorophyll a compared to undeveloped locations. Total particulate matter (TPM), particulate inorganic matter (PIM), particulate organic matter (POM), particulate carbon (PC) and particulate nitrogen (PN) were All significantly higher at developed locations in both estuaries. The PC/Chl a ratios were high, indicating that the seston was comprised of detrital matter as opposed to living phytoplankton, yet the C/N ratios were low compared to those expected of estuarine conditions. Sydney rock oysters cultured at the developed locations attained a greater mean shell length and live weight than those,cultured at undeveloped locations however higher mortality rates were observed at developed locations. In Brisbane Water, seston quantity measures (TPM, PIM, POM, PC, PN) were positively related to live weight growth rate (GR) while shell length GR was negatively related to salinity. In Lake Macquarie, POM had a positive relationship with oyster live weight GR while shell length GR also had an inverse relationship with salinity. Thus, elevated seston loads associated with low salinities contributed to increased oyster growth at the developed locations where run-off is high. The concentration of the seston was therefore the controlling factor in the growth of oysters cultured in Brisbane Water and Lake Macquarie. The seston quality ratios indicated that the detrital, particulate component of the seston was high-quality food for bivalves, possibly due to associated microbial biomass. In New South Wales (NSW), a high proportion of oyster leases are located in estuaries sourced by developed catchments and the results of this study will be of interest to resource managers and oyster farmers.

J	Burger, J; Waishwell, L				Burger, J; Waishwell, L			Are we reaching the target audience? Evaluation of a fish fact sheet	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, over 16% of freshwater lakes and 7% of the rivers are under some sort of fish consumption advisory because of the presence of toxic chemicals. There is considerable interest in the issuing of information, advisories, and fact sheets concerning the consumption of wild-caught fish from contaminated waters, and in the actual consumption patterns of subsistence and recreational anglers. Despite the large number of consumption advisories issued by state agencies, there is little information on how these advisories, or other forms of risk communication, are perceived by target audiences, notably fishermen and women of child-bearing age. The states of South Carolina and Georgia issue consumption advisories for fish from the Savannah River, among other sites. To gain a greater insight into the perception of anglers about a supplemental fish fact sheet jointly developed by South Carolina, Georgia, federal agencies, and the Consortium for Risk Evaluation with Stakeholder Participation, we interviewed fisherman along the Savannah River. The objectives were to determine: (1) whether they had previously read the Fish Fact Sheet or had heard about the consumption advisories; (2) what major message they obtained from the sheet; (3) who they felt the fact sheet was aimed at, and who should get the Fish Fact Sheet; (4) who should be concerned about health risks from consuming the fish; and (5) the best method of disseminating such information. We interviewed 92 fishermen (37% black, 62% white) during the fishing season of 1999. Half had heard some information about consumption advisories, mainly from the media (64%). The study concluded that there were no ethnic differences in whether they had heard about the advisories, understood the major message of the fact sheet, felt they could reduce their risk from consuming the fish, or felt that it made a difference which agency issued the fact sheet. There were significant ethnic differences in the ways people thought the risk from eating fish could be reduced. sources of information about the risks from consuming fish, and what other information they would like about the risks associated with contaminated fish.

Over 2 years, waterbird counts were conducted every 15 days in these habitats. Non-metric multidimensional scaling was used to compare the composition and functional structure of the waterbird communities. Differences in both metrics were found among habitats throughout the year. These appear to be driven by spatial (presence of permanent water cover) and temporal gradients (yearly seasonality). Rice fields occupy a central position within the gradients. The composition and functional structure of waterbird communities in rice fields undergo significant changes throughout the year associated with the annual rice production cycle. Other habitats maintain more consistent communities, reflecting their more stable environmental conditions. Rice fields play a complementary role to other habitats in the landscape, likely acting as a buffer, partially mitigating the loss of some waterbird species amid the global decline of natural wetlands.

We analyzed a long-term data series (2009-2020) on the phytoplankton community in a large mesotrophic reservoir in the wet season to investigate the impacts of temperature and precipitation increases caused by climate change on the functioning and trait composition of the phytoplankton community. Over the last twelve years, the 3-month accumulative precipitation increased from 291.03 mm to 590.91 mm, and the surface water temperature increased from 25.06 degrees C to 26.49 degrees C in wet season, respectively. These changes caused a higher water level, stronger thermal stratification and lower nitrogen concentration in Daxi Reservoir. The dynamic equilibrium model indicated that the increased precipitation and water temperature-related environmental changes would result in a more diverse and productive phytoplankton community. The effects of increasing water temperature and precipitation on the niche complementarity and selection effects within the phytoplankton community were analyzed using structural equation model by means of the functional divergence index and functional evenness index, respectively, elucidating the reasons for the increase in cyanobacteria in the absence of a significant increase in nutrient levels. Based on these results, it is advisable that more stringent phosphorus control standards might be conducted to reduce the risks of cyanobacteria proliferation in the context of global warming.

However, studies on the direct and indirect effects of fire on biotic responses in aquatic ecosystems are still scarce. In this study, we investigated how water quality and phytoplankton community structure were affected by different ash concentrations from burning vegetation of a tropical savanna. We used a microcosm experiment to simulate the aquatic ecosystem with different ash concentration scenarios and evaluated the water quality and the composition, richness and density of phytoplankton over time. We found increased total phosphorus and ammoniacal nitrogen concentrations after ash addition, in addition to changes in electrical conductivity. We identified 242 phytoplankton taxa throughout the experiment and identified changes in species composition among treatments. We identified changes in the taxonomic richness of total phytoplankton, green algae and desmids over time. The density of total phytoplankton, diatoms, green algae, desmids and cyanobacteria also changed over time. Our results suggest that ash from terrestrial fires affects water quality and phytoplankton communities depending on the proportion of ash input. Our results serve as a basis for further investigations of the effects of fire on abiotic conditions in aquatic ecosystems and their communities over long periods of time. Finally, longer-term experiments are needed to evaluate delayed responses by the phytoplankton community.					; Carvalho, Priscilla/H-8698-2014; Nabout, João/I-2828-2014; Nabout, Joao/I-2828-2014; Sampaio de Jesus, Gabriel/ACL-0918-2022; Machado, Karine/AAT-6645-2021	Borges Machado, Karine/0000-0003-2744-7964; Nabout, Joao/0000-0001-9102-3627; Sampaio de Jesus, Gabriel/0000-0001-5623-9238; Bortolini, Jascieli/0000-0002-8738-7580													0046-5070	1365-2427				NOV	2024	69	11					1702	1715		10.1111/fwb.14337	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.14337		SEP 2024											WOS:001320047500001

The MPN for E. coli from all the samples exceeded the recommended guidelines of <2,000 microbes/100 mL. Pathogenic E. coli was detected in all three sites, with EPEC, ETEC, EAEC being most prevalent. The E. coli isolates showed 66% ESBL resistance and 94% carbapenemase resistance. Risk assessment showed recreational activities (rowing and swimming) posed a significant health risk as exceeded the annual risk benchmark limit of 1 x 10(4).

Lakes are a vital water resource, but are adversely affected by pollutants such as heavy metals and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from urban, agricultural and industrial activities. This can give rise to potential pollution-related health problems such as cancer and infectious diseases. Risk assessments are necessary to determine the degree of pollution and its effects on human health and ecological systems. Objectives. This study assessed the pollution status and a risk assessment was calculated to determine the degree of the pollution and its effects on the human health and the ecological system of Eleyele Lake in Ibadan, Nigeria. Methods. Physical and chemical parameters, heavy metals and PCBs were determined in the lake water using standard methods from December 2013 to February 2014 at ten different sites of anthropogenic activity. Results. Water pH ranged from 6.00-7.50, while electrical conductivity ranged from 205.00-221.00 mu s/cm(3). Dissolved oxygen ranged from 0.30-6.00 mg/L and total dissolved solids ranged from 105.00-113.00 mg/L. Phosphate levels ranged from 13-0.99 mg/L. Nitrate and sulphate in the dry season ranged from (3.10-3.80 and 35.81-40.97 mg/L) and (0.12-0.37 and 6.10-10.30 mg/L) in the wet season. Heavy metal concentrations were in the order cadmium (Cd) > zinc (Zn) > copper (Cu) > chromium (Cr) > lead (Pb) for the dry season and Cd > Zn > Cr > Pb > Cu for the wet season. Total PCBs ranged from 493.90-732.55 mu g/L and 52.00-390.03 mu g/L for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. All determined physical and chemical parameters were within permissible levels, while heavy metals and PCB concentrations were higher than permissible levels. Discussion. The hazard quotients and carcinogenic risk values were greater than acceptable limits, indicating that PCBs in Eleyele lake water pose adverse health effects to the local population. It was observed in this study that lower chlorinated PCBs were more prevalent than higher chlorinated PCBs. This may be attributed to the fact that the lower chlorinated PCBs are influenced by atmospheric deposition as a result of their volatility, and they are more susceptible to atmospheric transport than highly chlorinated PCBs. Conclusions. PCBs possess serious health risks to the population that depends on the lake as a source of domestic water and its aquatic organisms. Efforts are needed to reduce anthropogenic influence on the lake through strict environmental controls. Competing Interests. The authors declare no financial competing interests.

J	Stefan, CI; Krebs, CJ				Stefan, CI; Krebs, CJ			Reproductive changes in a cyclic population of snowshoe hares	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Reproductive output was estimated for a cyclic population of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) in the Kluane Lake region of the southwest Yukon Territory. Data collected by five researchers were collated over 8 years (1989-1996). Pregnant hares were captured and held in cages until they gave birth so that reproductive characteristics could be measured. Pregnancy rate, litter size, and neonate size fluctuated significantly throughout the cycle, changes occurring about 2 years before corresponding changes in density. Pregnancy rates were nearly 100% early in the breeding season, but declined up to 20% in the last gestation periods of the year. The number of litters produced in a breeding season varied between two (decline phase) and four (low, early increase phase). Litter size varied among years as well as among litters within a year, larger litters being born later in the breeding season. The body mass and size of newborn hares varied by 5-33% among years. The combined changes in pregnancy rate and litter size resulted in a cyclic change in total reproductive output ranging from a low of 6.9 young per female during the decline phase to a maximum of 18.9 during the second year of the low and early increase phases.																			0008-4301	1480-3283				NOV	2001	79	11					2101	2108		10.1139/cjz-79-11-2101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-79-11-2101													WOS:000172985500022

FISH DEPTH DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												A substantial body of literature exists about depth distribution of fish in oceans, lakes and reservoirs, but less is known about fish depth distribution in large rivers. Most of the emphasis on fish distributions in rivers has focused on longitudinal and latitudinal spatial distributions. Knowledge on depth distribution is necessary to understand species and community habitat needs. Considering this void, our goal was to identify patterns in fish benthic distribution along depth gradients in the Lower Mississippi River. Fish were collected over 14years in depths down to 27m. Fish exhibited non-random depth distributions that varied seasonally and according to species. Species richness was highest in shallow water, with about 50% of the 62 species detected no longer collected in water deeper than 8m and about 75% no longer collected in water deeper than 12m. Although richness was highest in shallow water, most species were not restricted to shallow water. Rather, most species used a wide range of depths. A weak depth zonation occurred, not as strong as that reported for deep oceans and lakes. Larger fish tended to occur in deeper water during the high-water period of an annual cycle, but no correlation was evident during the low-water period. The advent of landscape ecology has guided river research to search for spatial patterns along the length of the river and associated floodplains. Our results suggest that fish assemblages in large rivers are also structured vertically. Published 2013. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.

Such restrictions often generically assume that sediments resuspended by dredging result in adverse impacts to fish; this is the case in western Lake Erie where the environmental window was established due to potential impacts on walleye (Sander vitreus). To address this concern, laboratory studies mimicking sediment resuspension during dredging operations in western Lake Erie were conducted to determine whether suspended sediments affect walleye eggs and fingerlings. Newly laid eggs and 45- to 60-d old fingerlings from separate hatcheries were exposed for 72-h under flow-through conditions to 0, 100, 250, and 500 mg/L total suspended sediment (TSS). Fingerlings, eggs, and newly hatched larvae were analyzed for multiple lethal and sublethal endpoints. Data indicated no significant effects of suspended sediment on egg hatch success or fingerling survival after three days of exposure. No significant differences were observed when comparing percent egg viability in the control with any TSS treatment; however, a downward trend was observed at 500 mg/L. No significant differences were observed during comparisons of fingerling gill lamellae in the control with any TSS treatment; however, a statistically significant difference was observed when comparing gill lamellae in the control with the original supply animals. No significant differences were found between control means and unexposed eggs or any TSS treatment. These effect data for walleye will serve to better inform the setting of environmental windows for this species in western Lake Erie.

Collaborative Approach to Calibration of a Riverine Water Quality Model	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												Stakeholder involvement in watershed management decisions remains challenging, particularly when one is relying upon modeling efforts as one of the primary means to understand and communicate the complicated processes controlling a natural riverine system. To determine how to meet the instream water quality standards as required by the total maximum daily load (TMDL) program, a QUAL2Kw water quality model was developed and calibrated for the Jordan River, Utah. To improve transparency, increase stakeholder engagement, and reach agreement more effectively, a collaborative approach was taken to calibrate the model that included Utah Division of Water Quality (UDWQ) staff, consultants, key stakeholder representatives, and independent experts. The study reach of the Jordan River flows 83km from Utah Lake to the Great Salt Lake through the urbanized Salt Lake Valley in Utah. Several segments of the river have been listed by UDWQ as impaired for a number of constituents, but the present effort focuses on the dissolved oxygen (DO) impairment. In cooperation with stakeholder groups, four seasonal synoptic sampling surveys and additional research studies were conducted for use in calibrating and validating the model. The collaborative calibration process involved many meetings and workshops where model performance was iteratively evaluated in order to reach consensus on model inputs and parameterization. The end result of the collaborative calibration of the QUAL2Kw model was the development of a scientifically defensible tool used to establish a consensus that decomposition of organic matter and poor reaeration are the primary causes of the DO impairment in the Jordan River. Without the collaborative approach to calibration, agreement regarding the causes of water quality impairments would not likely have occurred. While clearly improving stakeholder believability in the model, a comparison of the collaborative calibration model performance to an autocalibrated version demonstrated that both approaches resulted in similar predictive accuracy.

Seasonal variations in PCR-DGGE fingerprinted viruses infecting phytoplankton in large and deep peri-alpine lakes	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Double-stranded DNA viruses infecting eukaryotic algae (e.g., phycodnaviruses) and cyanobacteria (e.g., cyanophages) are now recognized as widespread and ubiquitous in aquatic environments. However, both the diversity and functional roles of these viruses in fresh waters are still poorly understood. We conducted a year-long study in 2011 of the community structure of planktonic virus groups in the upper lit layer of two important freshwater natural ecosystems in France, Lake Annecy (oligotrophic) and Lake Bourget (oligo-mesotrophic). Using PCR-DGGE to target a number of different structural and functional signature genes, i.e.,g20, g23, psbA, polB, and mcp, the phytoplankton viruses were shown to display temporal and spatial variability. There were marked seasonal changes in community structure for all viral groups in Lake Bourget, but only for T4-like myoviruses and psbA-containing cyanophages in Lake Annecy. The multivariate statistical analyses revealed that (1) various environmental factors can directly or indirectly explain the community structure observed for each phytoplankton viral group, and (2) temporal patterns of T4-like myovirus community structure were similar between the two lakes. In general, our results (1) suggest that the observed algal virus patterns were associated with significant shifts in phytoplankton biomass and/or structure, which in turn were shaped by the abiotic environment, and (2) support the Bank model proposed by Breitbart and Rohwer (Trends Microbiol 13:278-284, 2005). This study provides new evidence that freshwater lakes contain a significant diversity of algal viruses, and that the distribution of these viruses strongly mirrors that of their hosts.

Bisphenol A (BPA), nonylphenol (NP), and octylphenol (OP) were the main contributors of the 8 EDCs. The concentrations of phenolic pollutants in surface water during the dry season were higher than those in the wet season. However, no significant seasonal differences were found among the steroid hormones. According to the evaluation of estrogenic activity (EEQ > 1.0), E2 and EE2 were the main contributors to estrogenic activity. EDC mixtures posed a higher risk to crustaceans and fish (RQ > 1.0) and a moderate to high risk to algae (RQ > 0.1). Fish were the most sensitive aquatic organisms. In the study areas, EE2, E1, BPA, NP, and E2 had a higher risk than the other three compounds and should be controlled as a priority.

An Extended Ecosystem Model for Understanding EE2 Indirect Effects on a Freshwater Food Web and its Ecosystem Function Resilience	WATER												Freshwater species are highly impacted by human activities and the consequences on ecosystem functioning are still not well understood. In the literature, a multitrophic perspective appears to be key to advance future biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) research. This paper aims at studying indirect effects of the synthetic hormone 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) on a freshwater food web by creating BEF links, through the interpretation of seasonal cycles and multitrophic interactions. An ecosystem model previously developed using experimental data from a unique whole-ecosystem study on EE2 was extended with the addition ofChaoborus, an omnivorous insect. During the experimental study, a collapse of fathead minnow was measured after one year of exposure. The simulation results showed that EE2 indirect effects on other fishes (horizontal diversity) and lower trophic levels (vertical diversity) were connected to multitrophic interactions with a top-down cascade effect. The results also demonstrated that adding an omnivorous, mid-trophic level group such asChaoborusenhances resilience. Conversely, missing such a species means that the actual resilience of an ecosystem and its functioning cannot be properly simulated. Thus, the extended ecosystem model offers a tool that can help better understand what is happening after environmental perturbations, such as with EE2.

Transition zones in small lakes: the importance of dilution and biological uptake on lake-wide heterogeneity	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Stream inflows are frequently the dominant route for nutrients from catchments to lakes. Studies on large, deep reservoirs and lakes have shown the importance of the fate of inflow plumes for nutrient accessibility to phytoplankton. However, few studies have considered shallow water transition zones between streams and lakes, often a feature of small lakes. This study examined the spatial and temporal dynamics of phosphorus in a shallow stream-lake transition in a small lake to improve our understanding of how phosphorus reaches the pelagic zone. Despite the high discharge levels, and the importance of dilution in explaining observed spatial gradients in soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a, we found evidence for significant biological uptake of SRP in the inflow embayment during the growing season. This may represent an additional mechanism for the dispersal of phosphorus from the embayment into the lake. The length scale for the transition zone was short (similar to 150 m) which indicated that the direct influence of the inflow on the wider lake was small. However, SRP measurements taken only from the pelagic site underestimated mean lake-wide concentrations when including transition zones by up to 18% during the growing season.

J	Xu, YJ; Wu, KS				Xu, Y. Jun; Wu, Kangsheng			Seasonality and interannual variability of freshwater inflow to a large oligohaline estuary in the Northern Gulf of Mexico	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Quantity, timing, duration, and fluctuation of freshwater inflow are important factors affecting the development and health of aquatic and adjacent wetland ecosystems in coastal estuaries. This study assessed six decades of freshwater inflow from the Amite River, Tickfaw River, and Tangipahoa River watersheds to Lake Pontchartrain, a large oligohaline estuary in the Northern Gulf of Mexico, whose flood waters caused recent damage to the city of New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. By utilizing the long-term (1940-2002) river discharge and climatic data from the three major tributary watersheds, monthly and annual freshwater inflows have been quantified and their spatial and temporal variations have been analyzed. On average, the three rivers discharged (+/- standard error) 0.27 +/- 0.04 km(3) freshwater monthly and 3.29 +/- 0.15 km(3) freshwater annually into the lake estuarine system, with the highest inflow from the Amite River (0.16 +/- 0.03 m(3) mon(-1), and 1.91 +/- 0.09 km(3) yr(-1)) and the lowest inflow from the Tickfaw River (0.03 +/- 0.00 km(3) mon(-1), and 0.34 +/- 0.02 km(3) yr(-1)). A distinct seasonality was evident with over 69% of the total annual inflow occurring during December and May (wet months) and with a low flow period from August to November (dry months). The monthly inflow during the wet months was positively correlated with the monthly precipitation (r(2) = 0.64), while the monthly inflow during the dry months was subject to evapotranspiration. Furthermore, the study found a 20-year low flow period from 1954-1973 (2.76 +/- 0.24 km(3) yr(-1)) and a 24-year high flow period from 1975 -1998 (3.84 +/- 0.24 km(3) yr(-1)), coinciding with both the climate variation and population growth in the watersheds.

J	Hongve, D				Hongve, D			Cycling of iron, manganese, and phosphate in a meromictic lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Lake Nordbytjernet (Southeast Norway) had up to 40 mg liter(-1) dissolved iron and 67 mg liter(-1) dissolved manganese in a stagnant layer. The ratio between iron and manganese loading was around 3:1, while the inventory of manganese was six times higher than for iron. High concentrations of dissolved iron occurred solely under strictly anoxic conditions, while dissolved manganese was unaffected by intrusion of oxygen during the autumnal partial circulation. Mixed potentials caused by oxidation of ferrous iron and reduction of manganic oxide or O-2 controlled the redox potential values, while dissolved manganese appeared to have no influence. The following main processes controlled the sedimentation rates: fluvial supply of suspended material, precipitation of ferric hydroxide and manganese oxide from the water column, and plankton production. Sorption to ferric hydroxide in the oxic zone and reductive desorption in the anoxic zone controlled the deep water stratification of phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, and some major cations. No similar effects were seen for manganese sedimentation. The iron sedimentation rate was enhanced in the anoxic zone due to redox coupling of iron oxidation and manganese reduction. Phosphorus was. depleted in the anoxic zone during periods of substantial ferric hydroxide sedimentation. Sedimentation of manganese under anoxic conditions seemed to be governed by precipitation of carbonate and phosphate. Residence times in the lake were 0.2 yr for iron and phosphorous vs. 3.3 yr for manganese and 1.4 yr for water.																			0024-3590					JUN	1997	42	4					635	647		10.4319/lo.1997.42.4.0635	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1997.42.4.0635													WOS:000071037700003

A common method is the paleolimnological approach. However, lakes can be influenced by multiple stressors over time, making it necessary to consider possible combined effects. In this study, we aimed to untangle the interpretation of subfossil Cladocera in relation to different environmental parameters in lakes of Baltic states. To determine indicator species that could be used for reconstructing past environmental conditions, we developed a 78-lake surface sediment training set. Lakes were selected to cover gradients of different lake sizes, depths, electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and trophic states. Redundancy analysis (RDA) identified pH, trophic state and EC as significant parameters influencing subfossil Cladocera species composition. Using IndVal.g analysis, we distinguished species that are indicative of a combination of parameters such as pH<6 and EC<100 mu S/cm (Alonella excisa, Alona rustica, Polyphemus pediculus, Holopedium gibberum, Drepanothrix dentata), pH>6 and EC>100 mu S/cm (Disparalona rostrata, Leydigia leydigi, Pleuroxus uncinatus, Pleuroxus trigonellus), pH>6 and oligotrophic/mesotrophic conditions(Monospilus dispar). We identified species that can be indicative of several parameters that do not necessarily combine (for example, Alonopsis elongata for pH<6 or oligotrophic/mesotrophic conditions or EC<200 mu S/cm), or were indicative of only one parameter (for example Paralona pigra, Ophryoxus gracilis - oligotrophy; Bosmina longispina- mesotrophy; Bosmina longirostris - eutrophy; Chidorus sphaericus, Oxyurella tenuicaudis-hypereutrophy; Leptodora kindtii pH>6; Pleuroxus aduncus EC>100 mu S/cm). These findings add to the understanding of subfossil Cladocera species interpretation in paleolimnological samples, enabling better assessment of anthropogenic influence and reference conditions of lake ecosystems.

J	Schettler, G; Romer, RL; O'Connell, M; Molloy, K				Schettler, Georg; Romer, Rolf L.; O'Connell, Michael; Molloy, Karen			Holocene climatic variations and postglacial sea-level rise geochemically recorded in the sediments of the brackish karst lake An Loch Mor, western Ireland	BOREAS												Palaeohydrology of the brackish karst lake An Loch Mor (Inis Oirr) was reconstructed based on its 11 600 year sedimentation record. Low calcareous early Holocene sediments, characterized by high TOC contents and deposited at generally low accumulation rates, show a gradual decrease upwards in the concentration of the siliciclastic sediment until c. 7000 cal. yr BP. From c. 9000 cal. yr BP, sediment accumulation became increasingly dominated by the deposition of autochthonous calcite and organic matter. The deposition of autochthonous calcite and its chemical composition (Ca/Sr, Ca/Mg) are determined by the subsurface inflow of freshwater from the catchment of the lake and by the balance between freshwater and seawater influx. During the early Holocene, the lake mainly received input of sea salt by sea-spray. The sediments document the further development from seasonal towards the onset of diurnal infiltration of seawater at c. 5100 cal. yr BP. At that time, the relative sea level must have risen nearly to its present level in Galway Bay. Diurnal seawater infiltration during high tides was controlled by freshwater input. Freshwater inflow from the catchment gradually increased with human impact on local vegetation (EVPT decrease). Permanent diurnal seawater infiltration in concert with this general freshwater increase made the geochemical sedimentation record highly sensitive to changes in annual precipitation. We use information from the palynological record to interpret geochemically inferred freshwater inflow variations in terms of dry and wet climatic periods and document distinct century-scale successions between wet and dry climatic episodes for western Ireland.					; O'Connell, Michael/GZL-2937-2022	O'Connell, Michael/0000-0002-6416-9900; Molloy, Karen/0000-0002-4768-9197													0300-9483	1502-3885				NOV	2006	35	4					674	693		10.1080/03009480600690811	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03009480600690811													WOS:000241100200006

During November 1989-December 1996, howlers used 36 of the 63 tree species present on the island as food. Selection ratios indicated that six Ficus species (particularly F. pertusa) were among the seven most important food species. Data on time spent feeding showed that the six Ficus species were among the eight most important food species for the monkeys. Howlers spent 64.2% of their feeding time on Ficus products with F. pertusa being consumed significantly more often than foods from other Ficus species. However, monkeys fed on only one third of the 81 adult Ficus trees on the island. No significant differences were found in various food constituents (water, ash, fibre, protein, carbohydrates, lipids) of the six Ficus and two other abundant species in the habitat, whether across species, plant parts (young leaves, mature leaves, fruits), or between seasons (wet, dry). Monkeys consumed Ficus fruits rather the leaves. Fruits showed a much higher energy,content per g dry weight than leaves. We also estimated the average daily biomass of leaves and fruits of Ficus spp. consumed by howlers and their energetic contribution to the daily diet of these monkeys. We suggest that some of these tendencies to frugivory reflect the abundance of Ficus trees within the home ranges of the howlers; when few fig trees are present, folivory is the dominant tendency, whereas when many fig trees are present, frugivory is dominant.

J	Stefan, HG; Fang, X; Hondzo, M				Stefan, HG; Fang, X; Hondzo, M			Simulated climate change effects on year-round water temperatures in temperate zone lakes	CLIMATIC CHANGE												A deterministic, one-dimensional model is presented to simulate daily water temperature profiles and associated ice and snow covers for dimictic and polymictic lakes of the temperate zone. The lake parameters required as model input are surface area (A(S)), maximum depth (H-MAX), and Secchi depth (z(S)), the latter, used as a measure of light attenuation and trophic state. The model is driven by daily weather data and operates year-round over multiple years. The model has been tested with extensive data (over 5,000 temperature points). Standard error between simulated and measured water temperatures is 1.4 degrees C in the open water season and 0.5 degrees C in the ice cover season. The model is applied to simulate the sensitivity of Minnesota lake water temperature characteristics to climate change. The projected climate changes due to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 are obtained from the output of the Canadian Climate Center General Circulation Model (CCC GCM) and the Goddard Institute of Space Studies General Circulation Model (GISS GCM). Simulated lake temperature characteristics have been plotted in a coordinate system with a lake geometry ratio (A(S)(0.25)/H-MAX) on one axis and Secchi depth on the other. The lake geometry ratio expresses a lake's susceptibility to stratification. By interpolation, the sensitivity of lake temperature characteristics to changes of water depth and Secchi depth under the projected climate scenarios can therefore be obtained. Selected lake temperature characteristics simulated with past climate conditions (1961-1979) and with a projected 2 x CO2 climate scenario as input are presented herein in graphical form. The simulation results show that under the 2 x CO2 climate scenario ice formation is delayed and ice cover period is shortened. These changes cause water temperature modifications throughout the year.																			0165-0009					DEC	1998	40	3-4					547	576		10.1023/A:1005371600527	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005371600527													WOS:000076952400006

Based on one year of data measured by the eddy covariance technique over Erhai Lake in 2015, the ASL stability (zeta) was divided into six ranges, including unstable (-1 zeta < -0.1), weakly unstable (-0.1 <= zeta < -0.01), near-neutral1 (-0.01 < zeta < 0), near-neutral2 (0 < zeta < 0.01), weakly stable (0.01 < zeta < 0.1), and stable (0.1 <= zeta < 1). The characteristics of ASL stability conditions and factors controlling the latent (LE) and sensible heat (H) fluxes under different stability conditions were analyzed in this study. The stability conditions of Erhai Lake have noticeably seasonal and diurnal variation, with the near-neutral and (weakly) stable stratification usually occurring before July, with frequencies of 51.7% and 23.3%, respectively, but most of the (weakly) unstable stratification was observed after July, with a frequency of 59.8%. Large evaporation occurred even in stable atmospheric conditions, due to the coupled effects of the relatively larger lake-air vapor pressure difference and wind speed. The relative controls of LE and H by different atmospheric variables are largely dependent on the stability conditions. In stable and unstable ranges, LE is closely correlated with the vapor pressure difference, whereas in weakly unstable to weakly stable ranges, it is primarily controlled by wind speed. H is related to wind speed and the lake-air temperature difference under stable conditions, but shows no obvious relationship under unstable conditions.					; Liu, Yang/AAK-4123-2020; Du, Qun/AAJ-6868-2020; Xu, Lujun/AAJ-5828-2020	Du, Qun/0000-0002-2273-1854; Meng, Xiaoni/0000-0002-7993-1865; 													1674-2834	2376-6123				SEP 2	2020	13	5					400	406		10.1080/16742834.2020.1769450	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/16742834.2020.1769450		MAY 2020											WOS:000543466700001

In general, the results from the geometrical analysis comply with those from the triple regression analysis. The smallest pumpkinseed (predominantly juveniles) differed significantly from the largest pumpkinseed (predominantly adults) in all the three populations. The major difference was that adults had a deeper body and larger belly area than juveniles, which is probably associated with more space for gonads in mature fish. Developmental patterns and external morphology in pumpkinseed from the River Otonabee seemed to be closer to pumpkinseed from the Danube than to those from Lake Looncall. This suggests that, in the pumpkinseed examined, ontogenetic changes in external shape depend on environmental conditions (epigenetical information) rather than on geographical and/or genetical isolation. Further examination of early development, fecundity, number of spawning acts per season, parental care, egg size, age at maturation, etc., will follow to test this hypothesis.

We determined the sequences of nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2 region from single Cryptomonas cells with a high success rate (83.3-97.9 %), excluding one case (56.3 %). A total of 325 sequences were obtained over eight sampling days from May 28, 2012, to October 3, 2012, and phylogenetic analysis indicated that all sequences were divided into six groups. Four groups were clustered together with known sequences of C. curvata, C. marssonii, C. pyrenoidifera or C. tetrapyrenoidosa, although the sequences of the other two groups did not show high similarity to known Cryptomonas species. Cryptomonas curvata dominated during the study period (45-98 %), and unidentified Cryptomonas species (group 2) became dominant at high water temperatures. The genotypic composition of C. curvata also varied temporarily, suggesting that the genotypic composition of Cryptomonas was susceptible to environmental changes. These results indicated that single-cell PCR can be used to analyze the species composition and ecology of Cryptomonas.					; Ohbayashi, Kako/V-8269-2019; Thottathil, Shoji/JRY-6701-2023; Nakano, Shin-ichi/M-5483-2016	Ohbayashi, Kako/0000-0002-4380-2690; Takao, Yoshitake/0000-0002-0741-7445; Thottathil, Shoji/0000-0002-3246-8930; 													1386-2588	1573-5125				SEP	2015	49	3					263	272		10.1007/s10452-015-9520-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-015-9520-9													WOS:000358581000001

Simulating water and sediment transport processes in an average water year revealed that the total volume of water and the amount of suspended sediment transported from the five main rivers upstream of Poyang Lake were approximately 1.56x10(11) m(3) and 1.25x10(7)t, respectively. The outputs of water and sediment from the lake to the downstream Yangtze River were approximately 2.17x10(11) m(3) and 1.53x10(7)t, respectively. During the wet season, especially between July and September, nearly 1.06x10(10) m(3) of water and 1.89x10(6)t of suspended sediment were transported upstream from the Yangtze River into the lake due to the high external water levels, which accounted for 4.88% and 12.35%, respectively, of the total annual transport from the lake into the Yangtze River.																			1747-6585	1747-6593				SEP	2015	29	3					391	401		10.1111/wej.12121	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.12121													WOS:000359305600011

Toxicity of waters from the St. Lawrence River at Massena Area-of-Concern to the plankton species Selenastrum capricornutum and Ceriodaphnia dubia	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In 1972, the US and Canada committed to restore the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Great Lakes Ecosystem under the first Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. During subsequent amendments, part of the St. Lawrence River at Massena NY, and segments of three tributaries, were designated as one Area of Concern (AOC) due to various beneficial use impairments (BUIs). Plankton beneficial use was designated impaired within this AOC because phytoplankton and zooplankton population data were unavailable or needed "further assessment". Contaminated sediments from industrial waste disposal have been largely remediated, thus, the plankton BUI may currently be obsolete. The St. Lawrence River at Massena AOC remedial action plan established two criteria which may be used to assess the plankton BUI: the second states that, "in the absence of community structure data, plankton bioassays confirm no toxicity impact in ambient waters". This study was implemented during 2011 to determine whether this criterion was achieved. Acute toxicity and chronic toxicity of local waters were quantified seasonally using standardized bioassays with green alga Selenastrum capricornutum and water flea Ceriodaphnia dubia to test the hypothesis that waters from sites within the AOC were no more toxic than were waters from adjacent reference sites. The results of univariate and multivariate analyses confirm that ambient waters from most AOC sites (and seasons) were not toxic to both species. Assuming both test species represent natural plankton assemblages, the quality of surface waters throughout most of this AOC should not seriously impair the health of resident plankton communities.

Seasonal Patterns in Aquatic Bird Counts at Five Andean Lakes of Ecuador	WATERBIRDS												Seasonal (semestral) counts of aquatic birds at five Andean lakes in Ecuador (Colta, La Mica, Yambo, Yahuarcocha and San Pablo) were analyzed to detect trends in population size between 2004 and 2011. Trends of four abundant species (Ardea alba, Anas georgica, Fulica ardesiaca and Oxyura jamaicensis) and those of five functional groups (based upon body size and diet) were tested using generalized additive mixed modeling. In total, 19 bird species were consistently recorded over the whole period. The Andean Coot (E. ardesiaca) was found in highest densities (c. 3 birds per ha at Colta and Yambo). No significant trend's were detected. However, the counts of functional groups exhibited a seasonal pattern (higher counts in February than in July), possibly due to lower resource availability in the dry season. Piscivorous species were relatively abundant at one lake (Yahuarcocha), which might be related to the introduction of Tilapiine cichlid fishes.

In the present study, the genotoxic effect of chlorinated drinking water (CDW) processed from raw water of D lake and Y river was evaluated in human HepG2 cells using the Comet assay and the micronucleus test. For that, HepG2 cells were exposed to XAD extracts of CDW corresponding to 0.167, 1.67, 16.7 and 167 ml CDW/ml cell culture. All CDW extracts caused a significant and dose-dependent increase of DNA migration in HepG2 cells. The level of DNA damage varied depending on the sampling time (season) and sampling site. The lowest concentration which caused a significant increase of DNA migration was 1.67 ml CDW/ml culture for water samples collected in August. Water samples collected in March showed their lowest observable effect levels in 167 ml and 16.7 ml CDW/ml culture for Y river and D lake, respectively. Additionally, significant increases of micronuclei (MN) frequencies were found in HepG2 cells after CDW treatment. However, in the MN assay the CDW samples collected in March exhibited higher genotoxicity than the August samples. In conclusion, HepG2 cells provide a useful tool for the detection of genotoxic effects of environmental mixtures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A Revision to the Distribution of Plumage Polymorphism in the Red-Tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis)	JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim: The high proportion of plumage polymorphism in raptor species presents exciting research potential. Unfortunately, fundamental knowledge gaps remain that limit our ability to fully understand the development and role of plumage polymorphism in this group and extend those insights to vertebrates as a whole. We report data that fills one such knowledge gap in the red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) that will enable investigations to uncover factors that influence the biogeography of plumage polymorphism in the species and raptors more generally. Location: North America. Taxon: Buteo jamaicensis (red-tailed hawk). Methods: We captured and outfitted four dark and 22 light morphs with GPS/GSM satellite transmitters during the non-breeding season in the Great Lakes region of North America to assess their breeding provenance and behaviours. We calculated 95% AKDE nesting home ranges during an 80-day period meant to capture the incubation and brood-rearing periods and compared home ranges by age and sex to contextualise movements. Results: Our results indicate that dark types nest in eastern Canada and belong to the same breeding population as the light individuals tagged in our study, extending the known distribution of plumage polymorphism in the species approximately 1500 km eastward into eastern Canada. Main Conclusions: This revised distribution of plumage polymorphism is a critical first step for understanding the biogeography of plumage polymorphism and assessing drivers of within-population trait diversity in this species, and predatory vertebrates more generally.

The Amazon Basin's rivers and lakes support Nearctic-breeding shorebirds during southward migration	ORNITHOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Identifying the migration routes and stopover sites used by declining species is critical for developing targeted conservation actions. Long-distance migratory shorebirds are among the groups of birds declining most rapidly, yet we frequently lack detailed knowledge about the routes and stopover sites they use during their hemisphere-spanning migrations. This is especially true for species that migrate through mid-continental regions in the Western Hemisphere. We therefore used satellite transmitters to track 212 individuals of 6 shorebird species during their southward migrations-Pluvialis dominica (American Golden-Plover), Limosa haemastica (Hudsonian Godwit), Tringa flavipes (Lesser Yellowlegs), Calidris subruficollis (Buff-breasted Sandpiper), C. melanotos (Pectoral Sandpiper), and Bartramia longicauda (Upland Sandpiper)-as they crossed the Amazon Basin of South America, a region from which reports of shorebird numbers are increasing but remain relatively rare. Our results make clear that the Amazon Basin provides stopover habitat for a large number of shorebirds: more than 74% of individuals tracked crossing the Amazon Basin stopped over in the region for an average of 2-14 days, with some spending the entire nonbreeding season there. All species selected stopover sites along the region's many rivers and lakes, while within stopover sites each species exhibited distinct habitat preferences. The timing of stopovers within sub-basins of the Amazon Basin also coincided with periods of low water, when the muddy, shallow water habitats preferred by most shorebirds are likely plentiful. Together, our results highlight the need for detailed investigations into shorebird abundance and distribution within the Amazon Basin, threats to shorebirds within particular subbasins, and links between shorebird conservation efforts and those targeting the myriad other species that inhabit this dynamic, hyper-diverse region. center dot Long-distance migratory shorebirds are declining worldwide. For many of these species, we lack essential information about their habitats throughout the year, including the stopover sites they use during migration.center dot In the Western Hemisphere, information is particularly lacking for the midcontinent of South America, a region that several shorebird species may cross during their southward migrations.center dot We examine satellite tracking data from 6 shorebird species to show that stops in the Amazon Basin are surprisingly common, occurring in more than 74% of southward migratory tracks.center dot Shorebirds selected stopover sites along rivers and lakes and exhibited distinct local-scale habitat preferences.

Identificar las rutas migratorias y los sitios de parada utilizados por las especies en declive es crucial para desarrollar acciones de conservaci & oacute;n espec & iacute;ficas.

Esto es especialmente cierto para las especies que migran a trav & eacute;s de las regiones medio-continentales del Hemisferio Occidental. Por lo tanto, utilizamos transmisores satelitales para rastrear a 212 individuos de 6 especies de aves playeras durante sus migraciones hacia el sur-Pluvialis dominica, Limosa haemastica, Tringa flavipes, Calidris subruficollis, C. melanotos y Bartramia longicauda-mientras cruzaban la cuenca amaz & oacute;nica de Am & eacute;rica del Sur, una regi & oacute;n en la cual los estudios sobre el n & uacute;mero de aves playeras est & aacute;n aumentando, pero siguen siendo relativamente raros. Nuestros resultados dejan claro que la cuenca amaz & oacute;nica proporciona h & aacute;bitat de parada para un gran n & uacute;mero de aves playeras: m & aacute;s del 74% de los individuos rastreados que cruzaron la cuenca amaz & oacute;nica se detuvieron en la regi & oacute;n durante un promedio de 2 a 14 d & iacute;as, y algunos pasaron toda la temporada no reproductiva all & iacute;. Todas las especies seleccionaron sitios de parada a lo largo de los numerosos r & iacute;os y lagos de la regi & oacute;n, mientras que dentro de los sitios de parada cada especie mostr & oacute; preferencias de h & aacute;bitat distintas.

Subfossil Simuliidae track past river flow into an industrially contaminated lake	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												Stoco Lake (Tweed, Ontario, Canada) has a history of industrial contamination and is heavily influenced by inflow from the Moira River. Stoco Lake is frequently affected by nuisance algal blooms (including cyanobacteria), which have largely been attributed to cultural eutrophication. To further our understanding of the environmental dynamics of Stoco Lake, we applied paleolimnological techniques to examine long-term trends in subfossil invertebrate assemblages, geochemistry, and inferred trends in whole-lake primary production from a sediment core representing similar to 70 years of environmental history. We examined past trends in Simuliidae abundance, geochemical variables, and historical river flow records to examine past hydrological conditions in Stoco Lake. Inferred whole-lake primary production and sediment core organic content increased between the late 1950s and early 1970s, likely reflecting increased eutrophication (e.g. from agricultural intensification and increased catchment activities), with some stabilization in the post-1970s sediments coinciding with the installation of a sewage treatment plant. The geochemical composition of the core highlighted the decrease in catchment-derived sediment inputs and an increase in percentage of organic content towards the top of the core. In addition, declines in the proportion of As and Ni coincided with the closure of the upstream Deloro Mine Site in the 1960s. Chironomidae and Chaoboridae (Diptera) assemblages indicate expansion of littoral habitat after the 1960s and a general stability of low-oxygen conditions in the hypolimnion over the past similar to 70 years. Several Simuliidae (Diptera: Nematocera) remains, indicators of fluvial conditions rarely discussed in paleolimnological studies, were present at their highest abundances in the pre- similar to 1975 sediments of the core, but disappeared after the early 1990s. Our findings suggest that changes in river flow (discharge, velocity, or seasonality) may have contributed to recent algal blooms. Overall, this study highlights the potential of Simuliidae in paleohydrological studies to help understand the role of river flow on lake conditions.

J	Mortsch, LD				Mortsch, LD			Assessing the impact of climate change on the Great Lakes shoreline wetlands	CLIMATIC CHANGE												Great Lakes shoreline wetlands are adapted to a variable water supply. They require the disturbance of water revel fluctuations to maintain their productivity. However, the magnitude and rate of climate change could alter the hydrology of the Great Lakes and affect wetland ecosystems. Wetlands would have to adjust to a new pattern of water level fluctuations; the timing, duration, and range of these fluctuations are critical to the wetland ecosystem response. Two "what if" scenarios: (1) an increased frequency and duration of low water levels and (2) a changed temporal distribution and amplitude of seasonal water levels were developed to assess the sensitivity of shoreline wetlands to climate change. Wetland functions and values such as wildlife, waterfowl and fish habitat, water quality, areal extent, and vegetation diversity are affected by these scenarios. Key wetlands are at risk, particularly those that are impeded from adapting to the new water level conditions by man-made structures or geomorphic conditions. Wetland remediation, protection and enhancement policies and programs must consider climate change as an additional stressor of wetlands.																			0165-0009					OCT	1998	40	2					391	416		10.1023/A:1005445709728	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1005445709728													WOS:000076637300013
J	Fraser, DJ; Bernatchez, L				Fraser, Dylan J.; Bernatchez, Louis			Ecology, evolution, and conservation of lake-migratory brook trout: A perspective from pristine populations	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Reintroduction or rehabilitation plans for fish populations in many systems (e.g., lakes) are complicated by limited data on ecological and genetic characteristics before human disturbances occurred. While no two lakes have identical physical and biological characteristics, a growing body of empirical evidence nevertheless indicates that parallel patterns of population structuring may evolve within northern temperate fish species. Examining the population structuring in undisturbed lakes of similar physical and biological characteristics may thus provide insight into the probable historical extent and causes of both population structuring and connectivity in human-impacted lakes. Here, we review research on the population structuring and evolution of migratory brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis in a relatively undisturbed, postglacial lake (Mistassini Lake, Quebec). We provide information on lake habitat use, the morphology and life history characteristics of populations, diets, lakewide genetic population structure, seasonal migration characteristics between spawning and feeding areas, population evolutionary histories, and the prevalence of lake spawning. The biology of Mistassini Lake brook trout has a compelling number of similarities with what is known about that of the "coaster" form in Lake Superior and lake-migratory brook trout elsewhere. Our review also has several implications for the rehabilitation of coaster populations with respect to (1) clarifying the degree of natural connectivity between populations; (2) predicting the likelihood of recolonization of vacant habitats; (3) choosing candidate source populations for translocations; and more broadly, (4) understanding the spatial scale of probable local adaptation. Mistassini Lake therefore provides a useful case study that applies to lake-migratory trout elsewhere. We hope that our research will stimulate managers and biologists working on similar systems with pronounced human disturbances to consider the interplay between ecology and evolution in future conservation efforts.

The two ponds lie within the Phantom Lake watershed, a subbasin of the Lake Sammamish watershed in Bellevue, Wash., which is developed as a commercial and residential area with impervious surface area as high as 57%. There are design differences between the two ponds, yet both are comparable to design recommendations set forth by local agencies. One pond was built for flow attenuation and water quality treatment; the other serves only to improve water quality. Fifteen storms and two baseflows were successfully sampled during the Northwest's wet season from October 1996 through March 1997. Pollutant removals varied between one-fifth and one-half for phosphorus, and greater than one-half for total suspended solids and most of the analyzed metals. Removal efficiencies were consistently better in the pond designed primarily for water quality.

J	George, DG; Winfield, IJ				George, DG; Winfield, IJ			Factors influencing the spatial distribution of zooplankton and fish in Loch Ness, UK	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The vertical and horizontal distribution of phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish in Loch Ness, Scotland, were monitored during one day-time and one night-time survey in July 1992. The vertical samples were collected at a site located at the northern end of the loch and the horizontal samples along a longitudinal transect. 2. The vertical distribution surveys demonstrated that the phytoplankton, the zooplankton and the fish were concentrated in the top 30 m of water above the seasonal thermocline. Within this layer, Cyclops stayed much closer to the surface than Eudiaptomus but both species moved towards the surface at night. 3. The most important factor influencing the horizontal distribution of the phytoplankton was the north-south gradient in productivity. The sub-catchments surrounding the north basin contain a greater proportion of arable land than those to the south and the concentrations of nitrate-nitrogen and phytoplankton chlorophyll increased systematically from south to north. 4. Zooplankton distribution patterns were influenced by wind-induced water movements and the dispersion of allochthonous material from the main inflows. The highest concentrations of Cyclops were recorded in the north, where there was more phytoplankton, and the highest concentrations of Eudiaptomus in the south, where there were higher concentrations of non-algal particulates. 5. There was no spatial correlation between total zooplankton and total fish abundance but the highest concentrations of small (1-5 cm) fish were recorded in the south where there was a large patch of Eudiaptomus. The number of Eudiaptomus at specific locations within this patch were, however, negatively correlated with the numbers of small fish. These results suggest that the fish were actively foraging within the patch and were depleting their zooplankton prey in the areas where they were most abundant.

J	Xia, XQ; Pan, JY; Pei, JT				Xia, Xianqiang; Pan, Jiayi; Pei, Jintao			A new approach to estimate total nitrogen concentration in a seasonal lake based on multi-source data methodology	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												Nitrogen, a key limiter in lake eutrophication, presents serious threats to both human health and ecological balance. Despite its non-optically active nature, this study introduces an advanced retrieval approach for total nitrogen, utilizing a synthesis of multi-source data and sophisticated machine learning algorithms to markedly boost estimation precision. This innovative method integrates environmental variables, such as water temperature, depth, and flow rate with spectral reflectance, significantly enhancing the predictive accuracy of our machine learning models with high stability. The models tested, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), with XGB outperforming others by achieving robust metrics: an R-2 of 0.78, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.21 mg/L, and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 16.04 %. Applying the optimized XGB model, we documented fluctuations in nitrogen concentrations within Poyang Lake across different hydrological phases in 2021, revealing the lowest nitrogen levels during the flood season and the highest in low water periods, with high concentrations at the inlets of the North Branch of the Ganjiang River and the Raohe River estuaries. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the model is not much sensitive to input feature errors, validating its stability. The approach proposed in this study may help more precise total nitrogen retrieval in other similar lake waters.																			1574-9541	1878-0512				NOV	2024	83								102807	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102807	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102807		SEP 2024											WOS:001312664700001
J	Hudon, C				Hudon, C			Impact of water level fluctuations on St. Lawrence River aquatic vegetation	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Historical records of average seasonal water levels in the St. Lawrence River over the past 80 years reveal cyclic variations of up to 1 m above (1976) and 1 m below (1965) present levels. These variations are probably related to climatic conditions in the basin. Over the same period, the vertical range of seasonal water levels decreased from 2.2 to 1.5 m because of discharge regulation. Exposure of new substrate during periods of extreme low water levels may facilitate the invasion of aggressive and (or) exotic species. In Lake Saint-Pierre, a strong negative relationship was observed between seasonal water level and the percentage of emergent plant cover. Under low water levels, the lake becomes a large (387 km(2)) marshland that could support a high plant biomass (286 x 10(3) t) whereas under high water levels, the lake shifts to a vast (501 km(2)) open-water body with a lower predicted plant biomass (117 x 10(3) t). A model of the major anthropic and climatic forces acting on water levels is also presented; it describes aquatic plant biomass allocation and species diversity under different water level conditions.

J	Bennett, MR; Doyle, P; Mather, AE				Bennett, MR; Doyle, P; Mather, AE			Dropstones: Their origin and significance	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												Dropstones are clasts which pose a hydrodynamic paradox or which have an exotic or extra-basinal lithology with uncertain provenance. Recently, dropstones have been consistently interpreted as the product of ice rafting, and have been used to substantiate the presence of cool climatic phases in the geological record. This review illustrates that not all dropstones are reliable as palaeoclimatic indicators. Dropstones are the product of two distinct entrainment and transport mechanisms: by a rafting agent, or as a projectile. Four main processes of transport and formation are identified: biological rafting, ice rafting, floatation and projectiles. Biological rafting agents include vertebrate gastroliths and other stomach contents, vegetational rafting and anthropomorphic activity. Ice rafting can be the product of ice bergs or seasonal sea, river or lake ice. Floatation of clasts in calm waters has been recorded for stones up to 25 mm in length. Projectiles are most commonly of volcanic origin. Given the range of transport and depositional mechanisms reviewed we argue that great care is required in the interpretation of the origin of dropstones.

The elimination of the bass was followed by a dramatic increase in the density of planktivorous fish, the disappearance of large zooplankton (e.g., two species of Daphnia that had historically dominated the zooplankton community), and the appearance of a suite of small bodied cladoceran (zooplankton) species. The system remained in this state until bass were reintroduced. As the bass population increased, the system showed a steady and predictable return to its previous state; planktivore numbers declined by two orders of magnitude, large-bodied Daphnia reappeared and again dominated the zooplankton, and the suite of small-bodied cladocerans disappeared. Within each cladoceran species there was a steady increase in mean adult body size as planktivore numbers declined. Total zooplankton biomass increased approximate to 10-fold following the return of large-bodied Daphnia, and water clarity increased significantly with increases in Daphnia biomass and total cladoceran biomass. These changes in community structure and trophic-level biomasses demonstrate the strong impact of removing a single, keystone species, and the capacity of the community to return to its previous state after the species is reintroduced.

Ellen			Modeling regional occupancy of fishes using acoustic telemetry: a model comparison framework applied to lake trout	ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY												Acoustic telemetry is a common tool used in fisheries management to estimate fish space use (i.e., occupancy) from a local habitat scale to entire systems. Numerous analytical models have been developed to estimate different aspects of fish movement from telemetry datasets, yet evaluations of model performance and comparisons among models are limited. Here, we develop a framework to evaluate model estimates of regional occupancy in large and fragmented systems using an acoustic receiver array in Lake Champlain. We simulated the tracks of 100 acoustically tagged fish using a random walk function and created detection events based on receiver positions and distance-based detection probability. Regional occupancy for the simulated data was estimated by six movement models that ranged in analytical complexity, and results were compared to the true distributions for each simulated track to evaluate model error. The six movement models included: (1) a basic residency index using detections alone; (2) a residency index using last-observation-carried-forward; (3) a centers of activity model; (4) linear and non-linear interpolations (i.e., least-cost paths); and (5 and 6) two dynamic Brownian bridge movement models generated using separate packages in R. We developed a model selection process to compare model performance and select the optimal analysis based on simulation error. This process showed significant differences in model performance among the six movement models based on model error. Overall, the model generating least-cost paths using linear and non-linear interpolations consistently provided the most accurate regional occupancy estimates. Based on these simulation results, we applied this model to a case study that evaluated patterns in the regional distribution of stocked lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in Lake Champlain, which demonstrated distinct regional occupancy of two stocked lake trout groups. These results demonstrate potential for large variability in interpretation of acoustic telemetry data for describing regional fish distribution dependent on the analytical method used.

In this tribe, the genus Fornasinius Bertoloni, 1853, includes two species found in West Africa: F. higginsi (Westwood) and F. klingbeili Z & ouml;ller, Fiebig,and Schulze. In this study, we present new data on the comparative ecology and biogeography of these two species, including sex ratio, population structure by size, monthly activity patterns and habitat features at two different spatial scales. These observations were conducted, mostly opportunistically, over a 20-year period in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana and Togo. Both species exhibited similar overall population structure and morphometrics. They were characterised by a male-skewed adult sex ratio (with possible bias), male-larger sexual size dimorphism and consistent population structure by size; the two species are seemingly parapatric (with the potential contact zone being separated in eastern Ghana by the Volta River and Volta Lake). Both are primarily found in the vicinity of trees that contained middens of hyraxes, such as Dendrohyrax dorsalis (F. higginsi), Dendrohyrax interfluvialis (F. klingbeili) and Procavia capensis (F. klingbeili). F. higginsi has been primarily observed in forest habitat, while F. klingbeili was found in both forests and Guinea savannahs. Occurrence sites of F. higginsi were predominantly characterised by higher tree cover, less bare areas and built-up zones. Although these beetles may be locally abundant within hyrax middens, they typically occur in only a relatively small number of sites within their preferred habitat. Monthly activity patterns differed between the two species. Although adults of both species were observed throughout the year, sightings of F. higginsi were more common during the wet season, whereas F. klingbeili sightings were more frequent in the dry season. The observed differences in monthly activity patterns between these ecologically and morphologically similar species may help to minimise interspecific competition in potential-yet unknown-sites of syntopy. Although some Fornasinius populations might be locally threatened by deforestation or overhunting of hyraxes, the careful management of hyrax populations should adequately ensure the conservation of these two beetle species.					; HEMA, Emmanuel/HLQ-2172-2023; Dendi, Daniele/AAO-8569-2020; Luiselli, Luca/AAG-9098-2020; De Palma, Michele/L-5350-2016; Behangana, Mathias/JEZ-5361-2023	Duc, Le/0000-0002-0529-076X; LE DUC, OLIVIER/0000-0001-8128-919X; Luiselli, Luca M./0000-0001-6878-2916; De Palma, Michele/0000-0001-9128-5459; FA, Julia Elizabeth/0000-0002-1572-9828													0141-6707	1365-2028				SEP	2024	62	3							e13325	10.1111/aje.13325	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aje.13325													WOS:001315244700001

Little is known about the zooplankton and macroinvertebrate communities of East African wetlands and the relationship with the abundance of greater flamingos. We aimed to investigate how the macroinvertebrate and zooplankton community fluctuated in relation to the variation of greater flamingo abundance in the Chelekleka, wetland, Ethiopia. Data were collected from May 2021 to February 2022, where monthly collections of zooplankton and macroinvertebrate samples were conducted at two predetermined sampling sites. The abundance of greater flamingos was recorded twice weekly. Different zooplankton (40 species) and macroinvertebrate (28 families) taxa were recorded in the wetland. Significant monthly variations in zooplankton and macroinvertebrate species richness and abundance were observed. The greater flamingos visited the wetland from December to February. The monthly abundance of greater flamingos varied significantly, with a maximum record of 154 in December 2021. The monthly abundances of most macroinvertebrates and some zooplankton were negatively correlated with the abundance of greater flamingos. This implies that the greater flamingo has a regulating effect on zooplankton and macroinvertebrate community structures. The Chelekleka wetland provides habitat for a diverse assemblage of zooplankton and macroinvertebrate taxa that attract populations of the greater flamingo and other migratory birds. However, anthropogenic activities threaten the wetland, which requires immediate conservation intervention to sustain the habitat and its aquatic communities.					; Argaw, Hailu Tilahun/ITV-2312-2023; Estifanos, Getacher/AGQ-3324-2022	Argaw, Hailu Tilahun/0000-0001-7608-2602; Beyene, Getacher/0000-0001-6510-8627; 														2351-9894				SEP	2024	53								e03018	10.1016/j.gecco.2024.e03018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2024.e03018													WOS:001256467500001

Examining 22 Years of Ambient Seismic Wavefield at Mount St. Helens	SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS												An increase in seismic activity precedes most volcanic eruptions. Whereas event-based forecasting approaches have been successful, some eruptions remain unanticipated, resulting in casualties and damage. Our study leverages the recent advancements in ambient field seismology. We explore features extracted from continuous ambient fields using traditional methods, for example, peak ground velocity, peak ground acceleration, root mean square, root median square, real-time seismic amplitude measurement, and novel methods (displacement seismic amplitude ratio and spectral width). In addition, we explore unsupervised learning of higher order wavelet features using scattering networks. We find that combining all the methods was necessary to disentangle the effects of seismic sources from structural changes at Mount St. Helens. Although the ambient wavefield-based approach does not yield additional or more significant precursory signals than event-based methods at Mount St. Helens, our study demonstrates that the ambient wavefield provides supplementary information, mainly about structural changes and complements traditional methods. The ambient seismic wavefield offers additional insights into long-lasting processes. We find enhanced wave attenuation correlating with geochemical measurements. We interpret this as ongoing structural changes, such as dome growth or the evolution of the volcanic conduit system. On annual and decadal timescales, we interpret seasonal seismic attenuation in the shallow subsurface as groundwater fluctuations, corroborated by observations at the nearby Spirit Lake level.

The Carhuacocha and Vichecocha lagoons, fed by glaciers, are important aquatic ecosystems regulated by dams. These dams increase the flow of the Mantaro River during the dry season, supporting both energy production and irrigation for croplands. Water quality in the Carhuacocha and Vichecocha lagoons was assessed between storage and discharge events by using the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CCME WQI) and multivariate statistical methods. The quality of both lagoons is excellent during the storage period; however, it decreases when they are discharged during the dry season. The most sensitive parameters are pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). This paper details the changes in water quality in the Carhuacocha and Vichecocha lagoons during storage and discharge events.

This study investigates the spatial and temporal distribution of microplastics in the Ikopa River (Antananarivo - Madagascar), which flows through a densely populated area, and examines their correlation with contamination levels in local fish species. By analyzing upstream and downstream stations across wet and dry seasons, only a notable increase in microplastic concentration downstream during the wet season was observed, ranging from 138.6 +/- 9.0 to 222.0 +/- 24.5 particles m-3, with polyethylene-co-vinyl acetate being the predominant polymer at 62.3 +/- 5.13% of the total sampled polymers. This distribution underlines the impact of urban activities on pollution levels. Fish species, gambusia and Nile tilapia, were assessed for microplastic occurrence in gills and gastrointestinal tracts. Higher contamination rates were found in gambusia, enlightening the influence of feeding behaviour and fish habitat on microplastics contamination. Ingestion of microplastics directly from the water column was evident in both species, with the detection of high-density plastics such as polytetrafluoroethylene and polyvinyl chloride suggesting likely sediment contamination. This research highlights the widespread contamination of aquatic environments and its direct impact on local wildlife, pointing to a clear requirement for effective pollution management strategies.

Since the 21st century, it has faced intensified human activities, particularly the Three Gorges Dam impoundment and sand mining. The water quality of Dongting Lake has significantly changed due to human activities and climate change. Currently, quantitative studies on the spatial-temporal variations of total suspended matter (TSM) during Dongting Lake's dry season and the human impacts on its concentration are lacking. This study utilizes Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI data to estimate the changes in TSM concentration during the dry season from 1986 to 2021, analyzing their spatial-temporal variations and driving mechanisms. By evaluating the atmospheric calibration accuracy and model precision metrics, we select a model based on the ratio of red to green band, achieving an R2 of 0.84, RMSE of 18.94 mg/L, and MRE of 27.32%. Applying this model to the images, we map the distribution of the TSM concentration during the dry season from 1986 to 2021, analyzing its spatial pattern and inter-annual variation, and further investigate the impacts of natural factors and human activities on the TSM concentration. Our results show the following: (1) From 1986 to 2021, the TSM concentration during the dry season ranges from 0 to 200 mg/L of Dongting Lake, with an area-wide average value between 41.61 and 75.44 mg/L. (2) The TSM concentration from 1986 to 2021 is significantly correlated with the water level. Before 2006, it correlates positively, but no significant correlation exists from 2006 onward. (3) From 2006 onward, the mean TSM concentration is notably decreased compared to that before 2006, likely due to the Three Gorges Dam, while our analysis indicates a significant positive correlation between the TSM concentration and sand mining intensity during this period. This study highlights the influence of the Three Gorges Dam and sand mining on the TSM concentration in Dongting Lake during the dry season, providing valuable insights for related research on similar lakes.					; xu, wenting/GVR-8851-2022; Yue, Yao/KIC-2405-2024; Li, Wenxin/AFE-3694-2022; jiarui, shi/JAC-4211-2023; zhou, yuting/JWP-5025-2024	shi, jiarui/0000-0003-3929-9655; Yao, Yue/0000-0001-5671-6399; 														2072-4292				SEP	2024	16	18							3509	10.3390/rs16183509	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16183509													WOS:001323234000001

However, the impact of human activities on heavy metal risk levels in water-carrying lakes remains unclear. This study aims to explore the risk mechanisms of heavy metals in Luoma Lake, an important water-carrying lake for the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. We explored the spatial and temporal differences in the distribution of heavy metals in Lake Luoma using methods such as the heavy metal pollution index (HPI) and assessed the risk variations using a health assessment model. The results indicated that heavy metal concentrations in water-carrying lakes generally decreased during the dry season, with Mn and Zn levels decreasing by 89.3% and 56.2%, respectively. The comprehensive score of HPI decreased by 13.16% following the retreating polder compared to the control area (Non-retreating polder area). Furthermore, the HPI at the drinking water intake was lower, which is closely associated with the elevated dissolved oxygen (DO) and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) resulting from water diversion. The annual average health risk across the entire lake was not significant, with higher levels observed in the control area. The annual non-carcinogenic risk levels of Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb range from 10-13 to 10-9, which are considered negligible risk levels. Notably, the carcinogenic risk posed by arsenic (As) through the drinking pathway reached 10-5 a-1, exceeding the maximum levels recommended by certain organizations. These findings provide a critical foundation for managing heavy metals in water-carrying drinking water sources.

In recent years, this river ecosystem has undergone rapid habitat deterioration due to anthropogenic disturbances, leading to a decrease in freshwater biodiversity. Owing to these anthropogenic impacts, the Chinese government imposed a "Ten-year fishing ban" (TYFB) in the Yangtze River and its tributaries. Ecological changes associated with this decision have not been documented to evaluate the level of success. This study evaluates the success of the TYFB by analyzing the changes in phytoplankton communities and comparing them to periods before the TYFB was imposed. A total of 325 phytoplankton species belonging to 7 phyla and 103 genera dominated by Chlorophyceae and Bacillariophyceae were identified. Species diversity according to the Shannon-Wiener ranged between 1.19 and 3.00. The results indicated that phytoplankton diversity increased, while both density and biomass decreased after the TYFB. The health of the aquatic ecosystem appeared to have improved after the TYFB, as indicated by the phytoplankton-based index of biotic integrity. Significant seasonal and spatial differences were found among the number of species, density, and biomass of phytoplankton, where these differences were correlated with pH, water depth, chlorophyll-a, permanganate index, transparency, copper, ammonia nitrogen, and total phosphorus based on redundancy analysis. Results from this study indicate that the TYFB played an important role in the restoration of freshwater ecosystem in the Yangtze River and its tributaries. The present study disentangled the mechanisms driving the seasonal and spatial patterns in the phytoplankton community structure, showing the response of environmental factors after the TYFB. Seasonal changes, spatial patterns, and environmental changes were the main driving factors of the phytoplankton community structure. The health status of aquatic ecosystem showed a tendency to improve after the TYFB. These results indicate that the TYFB plays an important role in the restoration of freshwater ecosystem, and also more attention need to be focused on anthropogenic habitat alteration.image					Xia, Wenxin/NAZ-1895-2025														2045-7758					SEP	2024	14	9							e70217	10.1002/ece3.70217	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.70217								39219569					WOS:001303042900001

Application of flow cytometry for examining phytoplankton succession in two eutrophic lakes	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Flow cytometry has potential as a rapid assessment technique to evaluate phytoplankton biomass and species composition. It facilitates for multi-parameter analysis of individual cells on the basis of light scattering effects induced from cellular constituents, as well as auto-fluorescence. Fluorescence emission characteristics may be especially useful in classifying cyanobacteria as they contain phycoerythrin which emits light predominantly in the 550-600 nm waveband, chlorophyll-a (650-700 nm emission) and allophycocyanin (660 nm emission). The objective of our study was to assess the utility of flow cytometry for the rapid identification and sorting of freshwater algae and cyanobacteria species. Using a selection of laboratory-cultured freshwater algae and cyanobacteria species, this study demonstrated unique light scatter and fluorescent characteristics for each species examined, allowing for rapid species identification and sorting of mixed populations of laboratory cultures and samples from two lakes in the Rotorua region (New Zealand). Analysis of lake water samples collected over seven months demonstrated changes in abundance and community composition of phytoplankton in the two lakes and demonstrates that flow cytometry may be a useful technique for examining seasonal changes in phytoplankton composition.

Though the overbank areas are generally characterized by lower flow strength, supply of finer-grained detritus and increased landform stability compared to the channels, the subtle differences among different overbank sub-environments may at times impart discernible lithologic and pedologic characteristics to their deposits. Based upon the sedimentology of the channel-fill bodies, the upper part of the Triassic Denwa Formation of a central Indian Gondwana basin has been interpreted as the deposit of an anabranching fluvial system comprising a number of virtually coexistent channels of different orders and characters that operated in a wide, low-gradient plain. Earlier studies had identified the preservation of very thick deposits of pedogenically modified fluvial overbank sediments in this succession. Most of the paleosols preserved within the overbank deposits are similar to modem Vertisols and calcic Vertisols, suggesting a seasonal semiarid to subhumid climatic setting. Though in terms of carbonate accumulation most of these paleosols are immature to at best submature, they display a wide variation in the organization of vertic features. This case study attempts to delineate the deposits of different overbank sub-environments within the upper Denwa Formation with the help of paleosol profile characters, stacking pattern of the profiles, and the nature of the host sediments. The sedimentologic and pedogenic characters of extra-channel deposits, taken together, led to the identification of three distinct associations representing three overbank sub-environments. The association comprising alternations of sheet bodies of heteroliths and mudstones, with simple or compound, paleosol profiles, with weak accumulation of carbonate, is interpreted as the deposits of splay complexes. The second association that comprises thicker mudstone intervals, virtually devoid of sand, and have cumulate to composite stack of vertic features without carbonate concretions, has been interpreted as deposits of distal floodplain depressions. The third association comprising mudstones with slightly mature paleosols that contain up to small-pebble-size calcareous concretions has been interpreted as deposits of sediment-starved elevated sites within the distal floodplain. The deposits of Denwa fluvial system show marked differences with the existing humid anabraching models. Again, in spite of having a semiarid to subhumid climate this system differs from the Cooper Creek, Australia, in having a mixed sediment load, resulting in the development of channel levee floodplain geomorphology and contrast between the in-channel and overbank lithologies. On the other hand, Denwa does not show a consistent trend in paleosol maturity away from the channel areas as suggested from the study of Willwood Formation. This deviation can be attributed to the multichannel character of the fluvial system, which allowed distal floodplain sites to receive sediment input from multiple sources. This caused a rather continuous pattern of sedimentation in distal sites and inhibited the widespread development of mature paleosols. The variability observed between the distal floodplain paleosols reveals the influence of the factors like local floodplain topography, sediment accretion pattern, and drainage conditions.																			1060-071X		978-1-56576-305-0				2011		97					125	142																WOS:000309690900007

The ROMS in structured grid has been linked with the unstructured CE-QUAL-ICM model by using the new linkage codes. To have more flexibility on computational resource and efficiency, the coupling of ROMS-ICM has been developed for the external linkage. The ROMS-ICM has been tested for the seasonal variation of state variables by applying to the Saemangeum tidal lake and coastal waters of Korea. The model performance has been calibrated with observed field data of water quality parameters such as temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, dissolved oxygen, phosphorus, and nitrogen. The data have been collected at more than 15 points in the tidal lake and coastal waters at every month in 2009. Major loadings of nutrients from river flows and controlling points at sea water gates of the tidal lake allow us to estimate the annual cycle of state variables. A process-based validation has been conducted by comparing the salinity budget estimated by using the ROMS alone and the ROMS-ICM. The calibration and validation results show a promising tool for understanding of existing condition and for predicting the future condition of the water quality in Saemangeum tidal lake and coastal waters.																			0749-0208	1551-5036					2011			2		64		1068	1072																WOS:000302825000007

Bioaccumulation in Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) from Laguna de Bay, Philippines	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												This study provides an assessment of the risks to human health associated with the exposure to heavy metals bioaccumulation in Nile tilapia (Orechromis niloticus) from Laguna de Bay: Samples of the fish were collected in eight sampling stations in three major areas of the lake during the thy and wet seasons. Dry season samples were collected from May to June 2010 and wet season samples from September to November 2010. Coordinates of sampling site locations were recorded using Global Positioning System (GPS) and plotted in Geographic Information System (GIS) digital maps. Heavy metals analyses for cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), and chromium (Cr) were conducted using an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) and a Mercury Analyzer (Mercur-Duo). Estimates of health risks associated with fish consumption were summarized according to non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health effects. Non-carcinogenic Health Quotient (NHQ) values of the five heavy metals showed that lead is the most urgent pollutant of concern in terms of adverse health effects from risks associated with fish consumption from all sampling locations in the lake. Among the five heavy metals only arsenic is a confirmed human carcinogen (Class A) through the oral route of exposure. The highest life time cancer risk for arsenic was computed,from sampling station 2B (west bay) during the dry season with risk value of 8.5x10-4 or an excess of 85 cancer cases per 100,000 population. From the point of view of human health protection and disease prevention, the Nile tilapia from Laguna de Bay is not fit for human consumption due to arsenic and lead contamination.																			0119-1144						2011	14	2					28	35																WOS:000298515100004

Multitemporal flooding dynamics of rice fields by means of discriminant analysis of radiometrically corrected remote sensing imagery	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												An automatic classifier based on a discriminant analysis (DA) was used to classify eight classes in relation to different stages of rice fields during the flooding season. This methodology is characterized by the fact that, once the training phase has been carried out, training areas are not required to perform new classifications. If the images have been radiometrically corrected in a consistent way, the classifier can be used in a retrospective mode using past images. For this study, the training phase was conducted with data taken in October 2006 and January 2007 while the automatic classifier was applied to a total of 10 Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images from the 2004-05 and 2006-07 seasons. An average level of accuracy of 93.4% (range 89.7-98.7%) demonstrates the capability of the method to obtain high-quality and quasi-instantaneous classifications and to carry out retrospective studies even when training areas are not available for past dates. Two examples of how the method can be used are included in this article: (i) a study of the temporal evolution of flooding covers by period and (ii) the use of vector enrichment as a thematic updating tool for the cadastre. An additional objective of the study was to analyse the importance of the different bands to ascertain the suitability of alternative sensors with spectral configurations other than those provided by Landsat. This analysis demonstrates that the absence of shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands results in a decrease of almost nine percentage points in the accuracy levels of the classification while the blue band can be excluded with minimal impact on the results.

Estimating mercury concentrations and loads from four western Lake Superior watersheds using continuous in-stream turbidity monitoring	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Many streams along the Minnesota coast of Lake Superior have been listed as impaired from either high turbidity or high fish mercury concentrations or both. Both turbidity and total mercury have been shown to be strongly correlated to total suspended sediment in many disturbed watersheds. Turbidity and total mercury concentrations and loads were estimated in four western Lake Superior watersheds from 2005-2006 using automated in-stream turbidity measurements. Regression models were developed relating this near-continuous turbidity data to grab sample measures of mercury during differing flow regimes. Total mercury values ranged from 1 to 28 ng l(-1) throughout the open water season and showed a close relationship to total suspended sediment (r(2) = 0.85, n = 23; p < 0.001) and a less robust but still significant relationship with turbidity (r(2) = 0.40, n = 34; p < 0.001) for all four streams. Mercury loads to Lake Superior were estimated to range from 8 to 97 g yr(-1) with watershed yields ranging from 0.5 to 4.3 mu g m(-2) yr(-1). Continuous turbidity monitoring appears to be a reasonable surrogate for both suspended sediment and total mercury concentration, providing information when manual sample collection is cost-prohibitive or logistically difficult, and across a wide range of flows.																			1463-4988						2011	14	4					422	432		10.1080/14634988.2011.624863	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634988.2011.624863													WOS:000298355900011

Spatial distribution of annual rainfall and precipitation in flood season in this basin is technically analyzed with GIS geo-statistics; variation tendency of total animal rainfall, sprinkle, downfall, rainstorm days and successive no-rain days are studied respectively with linear regression and credit analysis is also made on these variation tendencies. Results show that: (1) No significant changes have taken place on annual rainfall and precipitation in flood season in this basin in the past 50 years and periodic fluctuation is presented. Wavelet analysis reveals that annual rainfall has a quasi-period of 20 years and precipitation in flood season has a quasi-period of 6 years. (2) Annual rainfall and precipitation in flood season are featured by basically similar spatial distribution. Areas with heavy precipitation are concentrated in Raohe basin and Xinjiang basin in the northeast of Jiangxi province. (3) Total rainfall days and days of sprinkle in this basin are in a descending tendency; on the contrary, accumulated longest time of no rainfall in all observation station are in an ascending tendency; which indicates that risks of draught and flood occurrence in this basin are in an ascending tendency. (4) Spatial distribution of total rainfall days and mean annual precipitation differs a lot; Total rainfall days in west Jinggangshan area and central and east part of the basin are the most; spatial distribution of rainstorm days and mean annual precipitation are similar. Areas with the most rainstorm days are also concentrated in Raohe basin and Xinjiang basin in the northeast of Jiangxi province. It can be seen from this that spatial distribution of mean annual precipitation, storm rainfall and rainstorm days are closely linked with each other. (C) 20111 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Four sampling sites along a transect from stream to reservoir in a shallow bay of Sulejow Reservoir (Poland) were studied to test the above hypothesis, comprising a transition zone between lotic and pelagic habitats. Investigations showed that stream inlet into shallow bay acted as incubator for Microcystis blooms. The nutrient level, especially phosphorus, was identified as the major cause of cyanobacterial bloom growth. The increase of Microcystis biomass strongly correlated with increasing microcystin concentrations, however, a relationship with microcystin content was not observed. Toxicity of bloom demonstrated seasonal variability, reaching its maximum at the initial phase of bloom.

B	Pacini, N; Harper, DM		Dudgeon, D		Pacini, Nic; Harper, David M.			Aquatic, Semi-Aquatic and Riparian Vertebrates	TROPICAL STREAM ECOLOGY	Aquatic Ecology-San Diego											The course of aquatic vertebrate evolution has been moderated by extreme climatic events such as sea-level rise and flooding, with areas such as floodplains providing productive feeding grounds and refuges in times of drought. Aquatic and semi-aquatic vertebrates in the tropics have achieved a remarkable range of anatomical and physiological adaptations, in contrast to temperate latitudes where rivers froze during the last glaciations. Convergent adaptations across different families has been the norm, dictated by the need to swim and to efficiently exploit aquatic niches inhabited by invertebrates and fish. Most taxa are adapted to the lowland sections of large rivers, while few have evolved within fast streams. The current geographic distribution of aquatic, semi-aquatic and riparian species is a reflection of the abundance and variability of water supply in different regions, the obstacles presented to migration by mountain ranges, and the presence of large rivers which may serve as barriers or biocorridors. These vertebrates include a wide range of taxa, some that are more dependent on water than others, and a survey of the main taxa of herpetofauna and mammals is given here. Tropical streams are characterised by seasonal flows and inundation of the floodplain. Many aquatic and semi-aquatic vertebrates have become highly specialised and dependent upon these seasonal flood pulses conditions. They are vulnerable to habitat degradation or alteration associated with flow regulation, irrigation schemes and the conversion of floodplains to agriculture. Because of their specialism, occupation of more upland habitats is not possible, and aquatic and semi-aquatic vertebrates now include some of the most highly threatened species on Earth. Loss of these species, or large declines in their densities, will impact the ecology of tropical river ecosystems because of the important roles that aquatic, semi-aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates play in energy flow, nutrient cycling and riparian landscape engineering.

J	Phlips, EJ; Havens, KE; Lopes, MRM				Phlips, Edward J.; Havens, Karl E.; Marques Lopes, Maria Roselia			Seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton in two Amazon flood plain lakes of varying hydrologic connectivity to the main river channel	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton were evaluated in Lakes Amapa and Pirapora, small oxbows in the floodplain of Rio Acre, a tributary of the Amazon River in western Brazil. The two lakes differ primarily in their degree of connectivity to the main river channel, with the younger Lake Pirapora maintaining a connection year-round and displaying physical and chemical characteristics responding to rising river water levels, versus the older Lake Amapa connecting to file river only during a 2-3 month flooding phase and having a distinct period of isolation at the end of the dry season. The phytoplankton of Lake Pirapora has a low numeric density year-round and is dominated by small C-strategists (cryptomonads). The phytoplankton of Lake Amapa has a similar low density when the lake is connected to the river. However, once that lake is isolated and turbidity declines, density increases an order of magnitude and the assemblage becomes dominated by filamentous N-fixing Aphanizomenon tropicalis. Coincidentally concentrations of dissolved oxygen increase and levels of TN decline, similar to changes during autogenic Succession in temperate shallow takes. The seasonal changes in phytoplankton of Lake Amapa, from the little it is connected to the time when it is isolated from the river, generally conform to the C-S-R conceptual model Of Succession. This is the first study to directly compare lakes of different developmental stages, in terms of connectivity with the river channel. There remains a need for more comprehensive long-term comparisons of these unique lake ecosystems.

J	Rengefors, K; Anderson, DM				Rengefors, K; Anderson, DM			Environmental and endogenous regulation of cyst germination in two freshwater dinoflagellates	JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY												The role of excystment in relation to seasonal succession was investigated in two freshwater dinoflagellates, Ceratium hirundinella (O.F. Muller) Dujardin and Peridinium aciculiferum (Lemmermann). Field studies and laboratory experiments were performed to determine which factors regulate the timing of cyst germination. Environmental factors (temperature, light, nutrients, and anoxia) and endogenous factors (maturation period and biological clock) were investigated. Our main results indicate that temperature and internal maturation period determine when germination can, occur. C. hirundinella had a maturation period of 4.5 months and germinated in the laboratory and in the field at temperatures above 6 degrees C. P. aciculiferum had a maturation period of 2.5 months and germinated in the laboratory and in the field at temperatures below 7 degrees C. In addition, our results indicated that both species were regulated by a biological clock. Furthermore, anoxia prevented the germination of C. hirundinella, contrary to results in earlier studies. To conclude, we could explain the appearance in plankton of the two dinoflagellate species through two main factors regulating excystment, that is, temperature and maturation period.					; Rengefors, Karin/K-5873-2019	Rengefors, Karin/0000-0001-6297-9734; 													0022-3646	1529-8817				AUG	1998	34	4					568	577		10.1046/j.1529-8817.1998.340568.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1529-8817.1998.340568.x													WOS:000075712400002

The lacustrine ecosystem of the Bajo de Veliz Formation: A wet spot at the Carboniferous-Permian boundary in westernmost Gondwana	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												During the Carboniferous-Permian transition in the westernmost part of Gondwana, the environment became drier and more seasonal than the preceding humid estuarine and fluvial habitats of the Middle Pennsylvanian of central western Argentina. The Gzhelian-Asselian Pallero Member of the Bajo de Veliz Formation, located to the east of the Paganzo Basin, represents an ecosystem preserved in lake deposits. This unit comprises lacustrine facies, and the fossil flora and fauna contained therein represent a wet refuge developed within a regionally semiarid context. The flora is assigned to the Gangamopteris Biozone and includes specimens of lycophytes, equisetaleans, cordaitaleans, coniferophytes, and glossopterids that grew around the lake shoreline. Winged insects, arachnids, large eurypterids, and traces of fishes comprise terrestrial and aquatic fauna. This ecosystem is considered a wet spot similar to those that characterize the global paleoclimatic shift in low paleolatitudes.																			0031-0182	1872-616X				NOV 15	2024	654								112465	10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112465	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112465		AUG 2024											WOS:001306154100001
J	Abrantes, N; Nogueira, A; Gonçalves, F				Abrantes, Nelson; Nogueira, Antonio; Goncalves, Fernando			Short-term dynamics of cladocerans in a eutrophic shallow lake during a shift in the phytoplankton dominance	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The changes in the dynamics of cladocerans in Lake Vela (Portugal), as well as the morphologic and life history traits of the small-bodied cladoceran Ceriodaphnia pulchella, were studied intensively during one month characterized by deep and fast changes in the phytoplankton community: the beginning of the cyanobacteria dominance. Lake Vela, located in the Mediterranean region, is a polymictic shallow lake exhibiting characteristics typical of an advanced trophic status, namely the permanently turbid water, the reduction in biodiversity and the occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms. The density and composition of the. cladocerans populations varied considerably during the short-term period analyzed. Coincident with the increase of cyanobacteria, the density of Daphnia longispina decreased drastically, associated with an increase of Bosmina longirostris and Chydorus sp. The constant density of C. pulchella, even during the cyanobacteria dominance, and the strong relationship found between weight and size, suggests that the low quality of phytoplanktonic food in Lake Vela did not play an important role in its fitness. Besides the small size of C. pulchella, this fact could be also related to its diversified diet. Nevertheless, a closer examination of the life history parameters of C. pulchella revealed a reduction in the fecundity, size at first reproduction, mean size of ovigerous females and maximum size of the population, which suggest an increase of the fish pressure after the decline of Daphnia. C. pulchella showed also a short-life cycle and a fast turnover of individuals, which constitutes also an advantage, allowing a fast adaptive response of the population.

J	Apolinarska, K				Apolinarska, Karina			δ18O and δ13C isotope investigation of the Late Glacial and early Holocene biogenic carbonates from the Lake Lednica sediments, western Poland	ACTA GEOLOGICA POLONICA												Stable isotope composition (delta O-18 and delta C-13) of biogenic carbonates derived from the Lake Lednica sediments at Rybitwy, western Poland, was applied to obtain data on climatic changes during the Late Glacial and early Holocene. A wide range of carbonates occurring in the sediments was analysed for delta O-18 and delta C-13 records, including shells of several gastropod species, the bivalve genus Pisidium and carapaces of ostracods belonging to the subfamily Candoninae. The delta O-18 and delta C-13 records reveal changes commonly observed for the Late Glacial and early Holocene with the exception of the low oxygen isotope values of the Bolling and Allerod Interstadials. The latter is interpreted as a consequence of O-18-depletion of the lake water resulting from gradual melting of the dead ice that still filled the deepest parts of the Lake Lednica valley during the period described. The Younger Dryas Stadial begins with the isotopically lightest values in the sequence; however, due to the O-18-depleted values of the Allerod Interstadial the Allerod/Younger Dryas boundary is poorly marked. The Younger Dryas/Preboreal transition is documented by a significant shift in delta O-18 values of about 2-3 parts per thousand, resulting from an increase in the mean annual temperature. The delta C-13 record reflects the productivity level in the lake, with C-13-enriched carbonates during the Bolling and Allerod Interstadials, and the Preboreal and Boreal, when photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton and macrophytes was the most intensive. Differences in delta O-18 and delta C-13 values between mollusc shells and ostracod carapaces reflect the specific season and subhabitat of each carbonate secretion.

The main aim of the study was to evaluate influences of moderate degradation on taxonomic composition of larval chironomid assemblages in lowland streams, on their biological and functional diversity as well as on assemblage temporal stability, Larval chironomids were collected once a month from March through to October at seven sampling sites located on three, third-order lowland streams Orzysza, Swiecek and Konopka (38.6 km, 28.5 km and 20.5 km in length, respectively) in Mazurskie Lakeland (north-castern Poland). Sampling sites differed in terms of type of catchment utilization and distance from potential pollution sources. Totally 10 060 individuals of 92 chironomid taxa. were found in the streams - 48 were identified to the species level, the rest of them were identified as higher taxa. The most diverse chironomid fauna were found in stream Orzysza - 72 taxa, while both in streams Swiecek and Konopka. 52 taxa were found. The most important variable determining taxonomic composition of larval chironomids in studied streams was seasonality. Percentages of common, numerous and frequent species sampled at the stations diverse in terms of degradation did not differ significantly. An only exception was Chironomus sp. gr. plumosus - percentages of its larvae at degraded stations were significantly higher. Species richness, rarity, taxonomic diversity, taxonomic distinctness and temporal stability of chironomids were significantly lower in degraded habitats, while taxonomic composition of assemblages sampled at sites divergent in terms of degradation did not differ. Ecologically specialized species had been represented in higher percentages in more natural sites, which means, that assemblages were also more diverse functionally therein. It clearly shows increased ecological uniformity of degraded habitats when compared with more natural ones.

A total of 46 lakes were sampled; the highest sampling effort was made in the Kurgan region. Data were collected on general topography, salinity, ion composition, and temperature regime. Primary production was assessed by measuring water transparency and by determining phytoplankton species composition and density. The survey focused on the local Artemia populations: cyst and naupliar biometrics and adult morphometrics, and study of population dynamics. Based on these field data, an estimation was made of the available standing crop of cysts. Generally, the Artemia salt lakes in southwest Siberia are relatively small and shallow, and thus subject to major seasonal and annual fluctuations. In extreme conditions, they may temporarily turn into brackish water bodies or nearly entirely desiccate. Production (both primary and secondary) is generally low or moderate, except for relatively deep Bolshoye Yarovoye lake (Altay area). However, because of the high number of lakes, the area has commercial importance to cover a portion of the domestic need for Artemia cysts. Parthenogenetic populations dominate in the area; the species status of the few bisexual populations still needs to be established.

J	Park, LE; Cohen, AS; Martens, K; Bralek, R				Park, LE; Cohen, AS; Martens, K; Bralek, R			The impact of taphonomic processes on interpreting paleoecologic changes in large lake ecosystems: ostracodes in Lakes Tanganyika and Malawi	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY					GSA 2000 Technical Session	2000	RENO, NV	GSA				Nonmarine ostracodes are often used as proxy indicators for the biotic response to climate as well as anthropogenic changes in large lakes. Their large numbers, small size and sensitivities to environmental conditions make them ideal for assessing how organisms respond to environmental perturbations. However, little is known about the various taphonomic processes related to preserving these organisms in the lacustrine fossil record. Without understanding the amount of time averaging associated with these assemblages, any interpretation of their biodiversity and paleoecology may be problematic. To address these issues, we conducted actualistic experiments to determine transport, time-averaging, and the amount of taphonomic bias in ostracode sub-fossil assemblages. Sand transport experiments revealed significant mixing at all sites at shallower depths and significant mixing on rocky substrates but not sandy ones. Comparisons with ostracode material collected along the experimental transects support this model and demonstrate time averaging in both the sandy and rocky substrates. Preservational models were derived from the experimental data and applied to interpreting the paleobiologic record of ostracodes from piston cores in both Lake Tanganyika and Malawi. The core record reveals assemblages that have undergone significant time-averaging, and in the case of Lake Malawi, preservational degradation. In the core examined from Tanganyika, most assemblages resemble the time-averaged experimental model with respect to species richness, percentage of articulated shells and heavy bias towards adult dead individuals. In the Malawi cores, most of the valves were preserved only as internal molds. The taphonomic signature of these samples resemble the time-averaged assemblages of Tanganyika cores, even though carapaces are not often present. Both the experimental and live/dead valve data suggest significant time-averaging and transport, smearing seasonaly-early data in some environments involved in using ostracodes to assess biotic changes as a result of climate and or anthropogenically-induced environmental change. Ostracode species richness estimates were impacted by time averaging because transport of dead valve material occurs at high percentages in the shallow depths and on the rocky substrates, suggesting that the ostracode death assemblages in these areas will not reflect living populations. In addition, ecologic models based only upon death assemblages will be less resolved than those based upon live assemblages. A time averaging index was derived using the % dead juveniles ratio, as well as sedimentation rate and information on the population dynamics, if known.

J	Malmqvist, B; Zhang, YX; Adler, PH				Malmqvist, B; Zhang, YX; Adler, PH			Diversity, distribution and larval habitats of North Swedish blackflies (Diptera: Simuliidae)	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Blackfly species richness and community structure were analysed at fifty-six sites in northern Sweden in two seasons. The sites were situated in a wide range of streams and rivers from small springbrooks, bog streams and lake-outlet streams to medium-sized forest rivers and large rivers draining montane regions. 2. Thirty-nine blackfly species were found, with between two and thirteen species per site. Neither species richness nor abundance could be related to the environmental variables measured. 3. An analysis of labral fan size of blackflies indicated a clear trend for the prevalence of larvae with small fans in large rivers and larvae with larger fan size in small streams. Similarly, fan size related to current velocities so that large fans were associated with slow current velocities and small fans with high velocities. 4. A strong relationship existed between species composition and habitat, as seen in ordination by non-metric multidimensional scaling. The relationship found between fan size and habitat size-related variables, such as channel width, depth, velocity and substratum particle size, along with longitude and altitude, in partial least squares regression analysis offered an explanation of the species composition-habitat relationship. 5. In addition to testing that distributions of blackfly larvae reflect morphological traits, we tested two general hypotheses pertaining to distribution patterns: (a) that blackfly communities show bimodal distributions; and (b) that their distributions are nested. Neither of these two hypotheses was supported by our observations. However, widespread blackfly species were locally more abundant than those found at relatively few sites, thus showing a positive abundance-occupancy relationship.					; Zhang, Yixin/AAG-3575-2021	Zhang, Yixin/0000-0003-1546-4150; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				SEP	1999	42	2					301	314		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.444497.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1999.444497.x													WOS:000082837600008

While these iron-organic carbon complexes sequester vast quantities of organic carbon, the composition of the organic matter within them remains unknown for lacustrine environments. Here we present C K1s and Fe L3,2 edge Near Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS) spectra of surface sediments and authigenic iron complexes from adjacent basins of a pristine boreal lake located in Que<acute accent>bec, Canada, with contrasting oxygen exposure regimes. We demonstrate differences in organic carbon speciation in sediments from both basins, as well as co-localization of organic carbon and iron on a sub-micron scale in 100 nm thick samples. Differences in redox cycling across these two basins allow for a direct comparison of the effect of oscillating redox conditions on the composition of organic carbon sequestered by iron. Our results suggest that reactive organic molecules, which may be polysaccharides, were found preferentially associated with iron in the perennially oxic sediments compared to more phenol rich organics in the seasonally anoxic sediments, highlighting the importance of iron oxides in the protection and preservation of labile organic compounds. Traces of aliphatic carbon were observed in sediments from the anoxic basin, alongside carboxyl and aromatic functionalities. This carboxyl-rich aliphatic material could possibly interact with the sediment mineral matrix either through a ligand exchange mechanism between the mineral phases and the carboxyl functionalities, or via non-specific hydrophobic interactions involving the aliphatic moieties. Finally, our work also shows that OC:Fe ratios should be used with caution when inferring a binding mechanism between OC and iron oxides.					; Gélinas, Yves/K-4019-2013	Mirzaei, Yeganeh/0000-0003-2317-1841; 													0016-7037	1872-9533				OCT 1	2024	382						51	60		10.1016/j.gca.2024.08.018	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2024.08.018		AUG 2024											WOS:001302243200001
J	Balayla, DJ; Moss, B				Balayla, DJ; Moss, B			Spatial patterns and population dynamics of plant-associated microcrustacea (Cladocera) in an English shallow lake (Little Mere, Cheshire)	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Little Mere (Cheshire) is a small (2.7 ha) and shallow (average depth 0.7 m) fertile lake in Cheshire, UK. Nymphaeids cover almost 40 % of its entire surface during the growing season (April to October) and practically all the rest is covered by a mixed community of submerged plants. The lake was intensively sampled for plant-associated Cladocera and zooplankters from April 1998-April 2000. Samples were collected at five sites across the lake, three of them located within lily beds, the other two over submerged plant beds of mixed composition. Specific sampling techniques were developed for floating lily leaves, petioles, submerged plants and water. Significant horizontal differences were identified for most cladoceran species, both open-water and plant-associated, for chydorid periphyton scrapers and for filter-feeders. Daphnia hyalina (L.) and Ceriodaphnia sp were significantly more abundant in lily beds than in more open water in both growing seasons, suggesting lily beds are an effective refuge against fish predation. Size-structure and egg-ratio data support this contention. Egg-ratio models were examined for Daphnia hyalina and Simocephalus vetulus (O. F. Muller), a plant-associated cladoceran. The fertility of S. vetulus in lily beds was generally high throughout growing seasons. The construction of egg-ratio models for this species was hampered by their generally very patchy distributions.																			1386-2588					OCT	2003	37	4					417	435		10.1023/B:AECO.0000007045.85315.dc	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:AECO.0000007045.85315.dc													WOS:000187003000008

(part 1). The model was driven by the realistic meteorological forces observed in March 1998, with daily inputs of suspended sediment concentration that were derived from temporally and spatially interpolated satellite imagery. The model results show the significant impact of a seasonally recurring coastal resuspension plume on the spatial and temporal variation of the nutrients and plankton in southern Lake Michigan. The plume-released nutrients played an essential role in maintaining the nutrient level in the lake. Although the growth of phytoplankton in the plume depended on the availability of nutrients and light, the offshore decrease in phytoplankton biomass still satisfied the Sverdrup's relationship. Cross-shore fluxes of nutrients and phytoplankton were controlled by episodic wind events with a period of approximate to 5-7 days: offshore during southward winds and onshore during northward winds. The flux estimates for biological variables suggest that the microbial food web is a key contributor to secondary production in southern Lake Michigan and the lower trophic level food web system could be dynamically divided into two decoupled loops: (1) detritus-bacteria-microzooplankton-large zooplankton: and (2) nutrient-phytoplankton-detritus.

J	Boudreau, BP; Gardiner, BS; Johnson, BD				Boudreau, BP; Gardiner, BS; Johnson, BD			Rate of growth of isolated bubbles in sediments with a diagenetic source of methane	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Observation of bubbles in estuarine and coastal sediments indicates that bubbles at or below 10 cm depth grow on seasonal time scales (May-October). In order to determine the controls on this growth rate, we have constructed a diffusion-reaction model that accounts for the dynamics of methane formation. its diffusion through pore waters, its incorporation into a bubble, and the consequent growth of the bubble. The model produces an explicit equation for the radius of a growing bubble, R(t), with time using mean parameter values and under the assumption that the mechanics of the sediment response to growth can be neglected: [GRAPHICS] where phi is the porosity, D is the tortuosity-corrected diffusivity, c(g) is the concentration of gas in the bubble, S is the rate of methanogenesis near the bubble, R-1 is the half-separation distance between bubbles (R-1 >> R), c(1) is the ambient CH4 concentration, c(0) is the pore-water CH4 concentration at R, t is time, and R-0 is the initial bubble radius, if not zero. The effects of the source S and supersaturation (c(1) - c(0)), thus, appear as separate contributing terms, and this formula can then be applied even in those cases where apparently c(1) approximate to c(0). The model is applied to three sediments where bubbles have been previously studied, i.e., Cape Lookout Eight (USA), White Oak River (USA) and Eckernforde Bay (Germany). In all three cases, using the site-specific time-averaged parameter values; the model predicts seasonal growth rates, consistent with the observations. Furthermore, the source term dominates the rate of growth at the first of these two sites, whereas diffusion from the ambient supersaturation dominates at the German location. Real bubbles may follow a more complicated growth history than predicted by the above equation because of the mechanical properties of sediments; nevertheless, the overall growth times are concordant with ultimate diffusion central. The effects of rectified diffusion, that is, the pumping of gas into a bubble by pressure oscillations, e.g., from waves and tides, were also examined. Existing models for that process suggest that it is negligible, due to the low frequency of these types of oscillations.

A typical karst basin was chosen in this study to investigate the pollution characteristics of heavy metals, source-specific health risks, and control factors. The results indicate that during the rainy season, As, Cd, and Pb, as well as As during the dry season, were the primary elements responsible for water pollution in the watershed. Comparative analyses showed that the absolute principal component-multiple linear regression (APCS-MLR) model better identifies and quantifies the sources of heavy metals in karst basin waters. The analysis of health risks revealed that during the dry season, heavy metals in the basin posed a moderate cancer risk to adults (10(-4) < total cancer risk (TCR) < 10(-3)), whereas during the rainy season, these heavy metals posed a non-cancer risk (total hazard index (THI) > 1) and a moderate to high cancer risk (10(-4) < TCR < 10(-2)). The APCS-MLR model combined with the health risk analysis showed that Industrial waste discharge sources are the main contributors to the health of basin residents (29.39%-52.57%), making dry season As a non-cancer risk for basin residents, as well as rainy season As and Cd a non-cancer risk and a high cancer risk for basin residents. Therefore, reasonable planning for upstream industrial production should be developed, and priority should be given to monitoring and treating As and Cd pollution in water. Analyses also showed that input pathways, dilution effects, and hydrochemical characteristics may influence the spatial and temporal variability of heavy metals in the basin. The results provide essential information and significant reference for prioritising and managing the health risks associated with heavy metal pollution in water bodies in karst areas.																			1932-6203					AUG 23	2024	19	8							e0309142	10.1371/journal.pone.0309142	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0309142								39178302					WOS:001297958100035

The experiment was carried out in mesotrophic Lake Marz, in north-eastern Poland, for 6 weeks in two successive years. The initial stocking density was 1,250 larvae (20 DPH) per cage. Food selection according to the zooplankton groups (Rotifera, Cladocera and Copepoda) and length classes was expressed by the Strauss linear selectivity index (L). Zooplankton species composition in the lake was similar in the two seasons of the study and organisms shorter than 0.5 mm prevailed in the plankton. The mean number of prey found in burbot alimentary tracts increased from about 40 up to over 200 during the course of the study. A very large inter-individual variation in the amount of food organisms consumed by fish was noted. Analysis of the values of the Strauss food selectivity index shows that at the beginning of the first year of the experiment, burbot larvae preferred copepods, most numerous in the environment at that time; later, fish tended to select cladocerans. In the second year of the study, fish more often ate copepods, irrespective of their quantities in the environment. During the whole study, reared burbot larvae did not eat rotifers, even when they were numerous in cages. Similarly to the rotifers, the smallest planktonic organisms, measuring up to 0.5 mm in length, were typically neglected by fish, while the 0.6-1.0 mm group was most frequently selected. There were also considerable individual differences between particular burbot specimens in their food preferences.					; Kucharczyk, Dariusz/AFA-8748-2022; Zarski, Daniel/H-9091-2019; Kucharczyk, D./AFA-8748-2022	Targonska, Katarzyna/0000-0002-6273-2587; ZARSKI, Daniel/0000-0003-3082-9250; Skrzypczak, Andrzej Robert/0000-0002-1000-7543; Mamcarz, Andrzej/0000-0003-1443-2544; Kucharczyk, Dariusz/0000-0002-0889-0656; Furgala-Selezniow, Grazyna/0000-0003-0324-1726; Kujawa, Roman/0000-0003-0925-1204													0967-6120	1573-143X				FEB	2014	22	1			SI		41	52		10.1007/s10499-013-9707-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-013-9707-9													WOS:000329939600005

A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE FATTY ACID PROFILES OF TOTAL LIPID, NEUTRAL AND POLAR LIPIDS IN THE LIVER AND MUSCLE OF CAPOETA SIEBOLDII (STEINDACHNER, 1864) AND CAPOETA BALIKI (TURAN, KOTTELAT, EKMEKCI, IMAMOGLU, 2006) FROM TODURGE LAKE (SIVAS, TURKEY)	ACTA ALIMENTARIA												The fatty acid compositions of the total lipid, neutral and polar lipid fractions in the liver and muscle of Capoeta sieboldii and Capoeta baliki from Todurge Lake were determined. Major fatty acids found in total lipid (TL) and neutral lipid (NL) in liver and muscles were C16:0, C16:1 n-7, C18:1 n-9, C18: 1 n-7, C20:4 n-6, C20:5 n-3, C22:5 n-3, and C22:6 n-3. Beside these acids, C18:0 was another notable fatty acid in polar lipid (PL) fraction of the tissues investigated. The n-3/n-6 ratio, which is an indicator of health benefits of fish oils, was between 2.89 (PLs of liver) and 5.84 (PLs of muscle) in C. baliki, while it was found between 1.43 (PLs of liver) and 2.52 (NLs of muscle) in C. sieboldii. C. baliki was the excellent species in terms of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels in TL (43.92% in muscle) and PLs (52.94% in muscle) and C22:6 n-3 amounts (docosahexaenoic acid; DHA) were responsible for these high percentages. These results suggest that Capoeta species investigated have high nutritive value in terms of polyunsaturated fatty acids for human nutrition.

This study demonstrates the applicability of two of them (Assemblage index /Q/ and Algae Group Index /AGI/) for evaluation of water bodies from a lake type L4 as well as their comparability. Assessment of the ecological status of two lake ecosystems was performed in order to ensure successful protection, enhancement and management of lowland and semi-mountain lakes in Bulgaria. Data on the aquatic flora from Golyamo Skalensko Lake and Malko Skalensko Lake over a period of two years were used to assess their ecological status. In addition, the toxic potential of the established dominant cyanoprokaryotic species was also evaluated. Phytoplankton- and macrophyte-based metrics resulted in complementary evaluation of temporary and long-term environmental conditions. Despite the hydraulic connection and proximity between the two lakes, Golyamo Skalensko Lake and Malko Skalensko Lake appear as completely different ecosystems, according to the phytoplankton structure (species composition, number of species, abundance, seasonal succession), macrophytes and ecological status.

M.; Ghermandi, Andrea; Kumar, Amit			Estimation of hydrochemical profile and trophic status of a coastal Ramsar site in south west coast of India	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Coastal lakes are confronting a spectrum of threats arising from both natural processes and human activities. This study presents an investigation into the nutrient and trophic status of the Ramsar-designated (Ramsar site No. 1204) Ashtamudi Lake (ASL; area= = 56 km2), 2 ), situated along the southwest coast of India. To establish a comprehensive hydrochemical profile, 50 representative water samples comprising lake, surface and bottom layers were systematically collected from 25 distinct sites during the non-monsoon and monsoon seasons of 2017. Physcio-chemical characteristics were evaluated using standard protocols and procedures. The salinity observations consistently position the majority of the lake's area within the 'polyhaline' condition (18-30 PSU) throughout the year. The evaluation of nutrient ratios (DIN/DIP, DSi/DIN, and DSi/DIP) during the respective seasons highlights a prevalent phosphorus (P) and silicon (Si) limited scenario during non-monsoon period. This condition is marked by elevated dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations juxtaposed with lower levels of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP) and dissolved silicon (DSi). The computed Trophic Index (TRIX) unequivocally denotes a 'hypertrophic' state within the lake during the non-monsoon season. This characterization is upheld by TRIX values of 7.73+0.61 +0.61 and 8.06+0.62 +0.62 for surface and bottom water during non-monsoon. Further insight into the TRIX findings is derived from the supplementary Efficiency Coefficient (EF) index, which accentuates ASL's limited nutrient assimilation in conjunction with a substantial input of DIN. Overall, the sustained condition of occurrence of low dissolved oxygen and elevated DIN/DIP ratios exacerbates the hypertrophic state. This complex interplay heightens ecological strain, thereby imperiling aquatic organisms, particularly valuable fishery resources. Unfortunately, this situation invariably curtails the essential ecosystem services furnished by ASL. Therefore, the adoption of strategic interventions aimed at ameliorating nutrient influx and restoring a balanced trophic equilibrium stands imperative to mitigate ecological degradation and uphold the lake's pivotal contributions to its surrounding environment.

However, how anthropogenic disturbances and hydrological conditions jointly affect the composition and characteristics of DOM and DOP in river runoff remains unclear. This study used fluorescence spectroscopy, Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, and the stable water isotopes to interpret the chemical composition and properties of DOM and DOP as well as their linkages to anthropogenic disturbances and hydrological conditions in a typical P-contaminated tributary to the central Yangtze River. The results show in the wet season, the average abundance of humic-like components in DOM exceeded 60 %, while the average abundance of tryptophan-like components in DOM exceeded 50 % in the dry season. During the dry season, hydrological conditions had a greater impact on highly unsaturated DOM compounds compared to anthropogenic disturbances because a decrease in precipitation reduced the transport of terrestrial DOM into aquatic systems and increased water retention time in the river, promoting the production of unsaturated compounds from photochemistry. The effects of the two factors were similar in the wet season because active agricultural activities and intense precipitation jointly facilitated the entry of exog- enous humics into the runoff, leading to the similar relative abundance of highly unsaturated DOM compounds associated with both factors. Anthropogenic disturbances had a greater impact on aliphatic DOM and DOP than hydrological conditions, which was associated with intense human activities in the watershed, such as phosphate mining, agricultural cultivation, and domestic sewage discharge. This study provides new knowledge about the composition, properties and underlying mechanisms of DOM and DOP in the P-contaminated watershed runoff.

Melanoides is particularly important because it is widespread in Quaternary deposits throughout Africa and Asia and is ubiquitous in both fresh and highly evaporated lakes. Whole-shell and incremental growth data were collected from modern and fossil shells from two lakes in the Ethiopian Rift Valley. delta(18)O values in the modern shells from Lake Awassa are in equilibrium with modern waters, while delta(18)O values in subfossil shells from the margins of Lake Tilo indicate high rainfall during the early Holocene. Sequential analysis along the growth spiral of the shell provides information on seasonal or shorter-term variability of lake water during the lifetime of the organism.					; Telford, Richard/AAD-2249-2019; Lamb, Angela/K-5147-2016; Telford, Richard/C-1668-2008	Lamb, Angela/0000-0003-1809-4327; Leng, Melanie/0000-0003-1115-5166; Lamb, Henry Francis/0000-0003-0025-0766; Telford, Richard/0000-0001-9826-3076													0921-2728					JAN	1999	21	1					97	106		10.1023/A:1008079219280	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1008079219280													WOS:000079565700009

Current metrics used in lake surveillance monitoring programmes, including the European Union's Water Framework Directive, do not reflect browning sufficiently. The aims of the study were to explore the potential role of the functionality of rotifers as browning indicators and to improve understanding of the environmental parameters driving the functionality and diversity of rotifers. Seasonal data on rotifer communities and water quality from seven lakes with differing water colour and trophic conditions were analysed. The feeding guilds of rotifers enabled differentiation between lakes in terms of their ecological conditions, and, in particular, eutrophic and brown-water lakes were clearly distinguished from other lakes. The guild ratio of rotifers was positively affected by water colour, but inversely related to total phosphorus concentration. Our results suggest that zooplankton functionality provides a potential tool to assess ecosystem dynamics, particularly when assessing lake browning. Thus, our results suggest that application of the guild ratio of rotifers is a promising method to estimate the general browning status of lakes and may complement the metrics used in Water Framework Directive.

Different growth models for each sex were established for the first time for a natural population of a freshwater gammarid. The Laird-Gompertz growth curve was used because it best fit our data, and it was associated with an environmental forcing function to adjust the growth rate according to seasonal variations in environmental conditions. The growth curve was applied to a length decomposition obtained using the Bhattacharya method, realised on data obtained from a 1-year population dynamics study. The models allowed an assessment of biological traits such as lifespan, the age of sexual maturity, the potential number of generations per year, and the growth rate as a function of environmental conditions. Differences in growth rate between males and females were consistent with biological processes such as allocation of energy for reproduction. Dikerogammarus villosus had higher rates of growth and earlier sexual maturity than all other taxa studied, which may explain its invasive tendencies and its ability to colonize numerous new ecosystems, thus becoming a cosmopolitan freshwater species.					; Beisel, Jean-Nicolas/H-4392-2011; Piscart, christophe/AAD-8973-2019	Devin, Simon/0000-0003-4431-4987; Beisel, Jean-Nicolas/0000-0002-1935-7689; piscart, christophe/0000-0002-4054-4542													0008-4301					DEC	2003	81	12					2006	2014		10.1139/Z03-188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/Z03-188													WOS:000189089300011

Samples were collected on a monthly basis from January 2001 to December 2001. Results revealed higher levels of P in marine water samples collected during October-December 2001. The marine water P ranged from 0 to 0.38 ppm throughout the year. Speciation of P in marine sediment revealed that the Al bound P was maximum compared to Fe, Ca and organic bound P. Loosely bound and aluminium bound P was maximum during October-December especially in 10 and 20 m depth stations off Narakkal. Fe bound P was found to be least in June and September and highest during January-April. Low levels of Ca bound P were detected in samples collected during January-March and inorganic P was maximum in June and September. Organic bound P was maximum in 10 m depth stations and also during June and September. Phosphate fractions varied with locations and exhibited seasonal fluctuations.

In the study area, an oxygen minimum occurred in the metalimnion in the 10-15 m depth. No diurnal fluctuations in the position of the minimum were observed. Cladocerans inhabited the epilimnion throughout the study period and their vertical movements were restricted to above the thermocline and above the oxygen minimum. C. flavicans conducted a diurnal migration. During the day, the majority of the population inhabited the 12-15 m depth just in the oxygen minimum, while during darkness they were found in the uppermost 8 m. Smelts started ascending towards the water surface before sunset and reached the uppermost 3 m around 23:00. During daytime, the majority of smelts inhabited the depth of 7-9 m, where the water temperature was unfavourably high for them (18 degreesC). Smelts thus probably avoided the steep oxygen gradient in the metalimnion, whereas Chaoborus used the oxygen minimum as a refuge against predation. Those smelts that were found in the same water layers as Chaoborus used the larvae as their main prey. The metalimnetic oxygen minimum thus seemed to favour the coexistence of vertebrate and invertebrate predators, leading to a depression of cladoceran zooplankton.																			0018-8158					OCT	2000	436	1-3					81	90		10.1023/A:1026594006856	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026594006856													WOS:000165632300008

It is used for purposes such as irrigation water, industrial water supply, receiving environment for domestic and industrial wastes and fishing activities around the regions that the stream passes. The aim of this study is to determine the lead levels both in biotic (fish tissues) and abiotic (water and sediment) components of Emet Stream. Water, sediment and fish samples (Squalius cii, (Richardson, 1857); Capoeta tinca, (Heckel, 1843); Barbus oligolepis, Battalgil, 1941) were collected from eight stations (one of them is on the Kinik Stream and one of them is on the Dursunbey Stream) on the Emet Stream seasonally between the dates of November 2010 - August 2011. According to data, the lowest Pb concentrations of water and sediment were determined in El station (0.00307 mg/L and 10.48 mg/kg); the highest Pb concentrations were determined in E4 station for water (0.02503 mg/L) and in E8 station for sediment (48.53 mg/kg). Pb accumulations in biotic and abiotic components of Emet Stream were determined as sediment > fish tissues > water; the Pb accumulations in tissues of S. cii and B. oligolepis follows as, liver > kidney > gill > muscle; in tissues of C. tinca follows as, kidney > liver > gill > muscle respectively and it was also determined that biotic components of system were highly affected by the lead.					; Tokatlı, Cem/AAN-3814-2021	tokatli, cem/0000-0003-2080-7920; 													0030-9923					NOV-DEC	2012	44	6					1587	1592																WOS:000313462300018

Spatiotemporal Patterns of Impervious Surface Area and Water Quality Response in the Fuxian Lake Watershed	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH												The increase of urbanization level has led to the rapid increase of impervious surface area (ISA). The aim of this work is to clarify the relationship between the ISA and water quality and lay a foundation for the improvement and protection of the water quality in the basin. Taking the Fuxian Lake Basin in Yunnan Province as an example, based on the Landsat ETM+ remote sensing image and the Gram-Schmidt (GS) image fusion algorithm, the four-terminal model and the linear spectral mixture model (LSMM) were used to extract the impervious surface of the watershed from 2006 to 2015. And statistical methods were used to distinguish its relationship with water quality. The results show that the four-terminal model and the linear spectral mixture model can effectively extract the impervious surface information of the Fuxian Lake Basin. The average root mean square error (RMS) of the image decomposition results from 2006 to 2015 was less than 0.02. In the past 10 years, the ISA has changed significantly in the Fuxian Lake Basin. The ISA showed an overall upward trend from 2006 to 2015. It increased from 24.73 km(2) in 2006 to 35.14 km(2) in 2015, an increase of 10.81 km(2). From the value anomaly, the ISA in 2006 and 2009 is lower than the multiyear average, and those in the other years are higher than the multiyear average. The percentage of ISA in the basin was significantly positively correlated with Chemical Oxygen Demand-Mn (CODMn) and total phosphorus (TP) (r is 0.772, 0.763), and the correlation in the flooding season was greater than that in the dry season. The ISA threshold for water quality deterioration is around 10% in the Fuxian Lake Basin. Reducing ISA coverage, controlling ISA to less than 10%, and preventing nonpoint source pollution during flooding season will be the best measures to effectively improve the water quality environment in the basin.					; Peng, shuang/GPX-0999-2022	hong, liang/0000-0002-3670-526X; 													1687-9805	1687-9813				APR 25	2020	2020								4749765	10.1155/2020/4749765	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/4749765								32377205					WOS:000531594400001
J	Campbell, MR; Dillon, J; Powell, MS				Campbell, MR; Dillon, J; Powell, MS			Hybridization and introgression in a managed, native population of yellowstone cutthroat trout: Genetic detection and management implications	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Since the mid-1920s, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game has cultured Yellow-stone cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarki bouvieri at Henrys Lake to offset declines in natural production and for use in stocking programs throughout Idaho. Since the mid-1970s, they have also produced F-1 hybrids: female Yellow-stone cutthroat trout X male rainbow trout O. mykiss. The ability of fishery managers, when selecting broodstock, to visually distinguish returning cutthroat trout front F-1 hybrids is, therefore, crucial to avoid accidental introduction of rainbow trout genes into the hatchery-supplemented cutthroat trout population, To evaluate this ability, fish identified by staff as putative cutthroat trout or hybrids (an array of phenotypic characters are used), were sampled during two spawning seasons. Phenotypically identified fish were genetically tested using species-specific restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPS) of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA gene loci and diagnostic allozyme loci. Current levels of rainbow trout introgression in the cutthroat trout population at Henrys Lake were also investigated by analyzing samples collected from the lake and several of its tributaries. Results indicated that staff's phenotypic identifications were highly accurate in distinguishing cutthroat trout from F-1 hybrids when selecting broodstock (no F-1 hybrids were detected among 80 samples identified as pure). However, backcrosses of F-1 hybrids were identified in random collections of adults from the lake as well as fry from Henrys Lake tributaries, indicating introgression. Present levels of rainbow trout introgression are most likely the product of past rainbow trout introductions and limited, intermittent spawning of hatchery-produced F-1 hybrids with wild Yellowstone cutthroat, rather than the accidental crossing of F-1 hybrids with cutthroat trout at the hatchery. Current levels of introgression are inadvertently maintained by (1) the inability of managers to phenotypically identify and exclude as bloodstock individuals with low levels of rainbow trout introgression and (2) the limited, intermittent reproductive success of straying, hatchery-produced F-1 hybrids.																			0002-8487					MAY	2002	131	3					364	375		10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0364:HAIIAM>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2002)131<0364:HAIIAM>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000175453300002

Phytoplankton production was assessed from seasonal in situ C-14 and simulated in situ results, using on-board incubator measurements and knowledge of the vertical distributions of chlorophyll and irradiance. Bacterioplankton production was measured on two cruises with the leucine incorporation method. Zooplankton production was calculated from seasonal population samples, the carbon contents of different developmental stages and growth rates derived from published sources. Fish production estimates were based on hydroacoustic assessment of pelagic fish biomass and data on growth rates obtained from length frequency analyses and checked against daily increment rings of fish otoliths. Estimates for primary production (426-662 g C m(-2) a(-1)) were 47-128% higher than previously published values. Bacterioplankton production amounted to about 20% of the primary production. Zooplankton biomass (1 g C m(-2)) and production (23 g C m(-2) a(-1)) were 50% lower than earlier reported, suggesting that the carbon transfer efficiency from phytoplankton to zooplankton was low, in contrast to earlier speculations. Planktivorous fish biomass (0.4 g C m(-2)) and production (1.4-1.7 g C m(-2) a(-1)) likewise indicated a low carbon transfer efficiency from zooplankton into planktivorous fish production. Relatively low transfer efficiencies are not unexpected in a deep tropical lake, because of the generally high metabolic losses due to the high temperatures and presumably high costs of predator avoidance. The total fisheries yield in Lake Tanganyika in the mid-1990s was 0.08-0.14% of pelagic primary production, i.e. within the range of typical values in lakes. Thus, no special mechanisms need be invoked to explain the productivity of fisheries in Lake Tanganyika.

J	Tessier, AJ; Bizina, EV; Geedey, CK				Tessier, AJ; Bizina, EV; Geedey, CK			Grazer-resource interactions in the plankton: Are all daphniids alike?	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Daphniids have long been considered to be uniquely effective grazers in the planktonic food web of lakes, but whether all daphniid species are equivalent in this functional role is less clear. In particular, a common belief that large-bodied daphniids are more capable than smaller daphniids at controlling phytoplankton abundance has received limited testing. Using whole water column enclosures in a mesotrophic lake, we compared the ability of four common planktonic daphniids (Ceriodaphnia reticulata, Daphnia ambigua, Daphnia mendotae, and Daphnia pulicaria) to exploit a natural assemblage of phytoplankton. We established replicated monocultures of each daphniid species and allowed their populations to reach a carrying capacity determined by resources. We then compared the effects of each daphniid species on phytoplankton biomass, size structure, taxonomic composition and C:N:P stoichiometry. Populations of all four daphniids stabilized at very low birth and death rates, with larger species having a lower density but a higher biomass than smaller species. The seston C: P molar ratio was driven to equally high values (>300) in all treatments, however, daphniid effects on phytoplankton abundance and composition were quite different. The two smaller daphniids were less effective at depressing phytoplankton populations than were the two larger daphniids. This difference was associated with the persistence of a diverse assemblage of digestion-resistant green algae in the Ceriodaphnia and D. ambigua treatments but their elimination from the D. mendotae and D. pulicaria treatments. Several lines of evidence, including growth bioassays, that have used juveniles of a clone of D. pulex-pulicaria, suggest that body size was not an adequate explanation for these differences in daphniid species effects on phytoplankton.

These lakes are known for their high primary production due to local high temperatures, light intensities, and alkalinity (inorganic carbon). However, these lakes, normally within remote areas, receive low nutrient inputs. Ammonium (NH4+) 4 + ) recycling and/or nitrogen fixation can become the major N supply mechanisms for phytoplankton. However, the driving forces on microbial N nutrition in lakes with minimal anthropogenic disturbance remain poorly understood. Using stable isotope tracer techniques, NH4+ 4 + recycling rates were measured in 18 lakes and reservoirs in East Africa (Tanzania and Kenya) during the dry season in early 2020. Three functional genes (nifH, gdh, and ureC) relating to microbial N nutrition were also measured. The regeneration of NH4+ 4 + supported up to 71 % of the NH4+ 4 + uptake. Positive community biological NH4+ 4 + demands (CBAD) for all lakes and reservoirs indicate an obvious N demand from microbial community. Our study provides clear evidence that microbial NH4+ 4 + uptake rates linked closely to the dissolved organic matter (DOM) properties (e.g., the absorption coefficient at 254 nm, percents of total fluorescence intensity contributed by microbial humic-like and protein-like components) and that water residence time drives microbial NH4+ 4 + recycling by regulating the duration of in-lake DOM processing and influencing algal growth. Phytoplankton, especially those of Cyanophyceae, , showed maximum biomass and higher NH4+ 4 + recycling rates at a certain range of water residence time (e.g., 5-8 years). However, CBAD showed a decreasing trend with longer water residence time, which may be influenced by changes in the algal community composition (e.g., % Cyanophyceae vs. % Bacillariophyceae). ). These results indicate that DOM dynamics and the water residence time have the potential to facilitate the understanding of microbial nitrogen supply status in East African lakes.

J	Li, ZQ; Sun, ZH; Chen, L; An, SS				Li, Zhiqing; Sun, Zhaohua; Chen, Li; An, Shanshan			A large-scale hydrological and hydrodynamic coupled model for flow routing in the Yangtze-Dongting system	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												In lowland alluvial river systems consisting of mainstream, distributaries, and floodplain lakes, the flow dynamics are characterized by changing backwater effects and seasonal water storage and release, and the bed morphology is unstable due to frequent sediment deposition and erosion. Hence, models that can accurately and efficiently simulate hydraulic interactions with low topographic data demands are required for such water systems. In this study, we present a coupled flow routing model for the Yangtze River-Dongting Lake system by coupling a 1D hydrodynamic model for the mainstream with hydrological models for distributaries and the lake. A new approach is proposed to generate a set of rating curves to represent the combined impacts of the inflow and outlet stage on the lake storage volume, thereby an innovative hydrological routing method fully considering backwater effects is established. Additionally, an implicit fully coupled algorithm is presented to integrate the hydrodynamic and hydrological models, which demonstrates ideal numerical stability and high computational efficiency. The coupled model is applied to flow routing in the Yangtze-Dongting system, with the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients above 0.960, and most of the mean absolute error below 0.4 m (1000 m3/s) 3 /s) for stage (discharge). The model is also used to evaluate the impact of topographic changes during 1998-2016 on the flow process. The results indicate that the mainstream stage has decreased notably, while the reduction of the storage capacity of the lake is not yet remarkable. For the model proposed in this paper, only hydrological data and mainstream topographic data are necessary during model development, calibration, and application. In the context of continuous channel/lake bed adjustment in the middle reach of the Yangtze River Basin, the coupled model provides an effective tool for quantitatively evaluating the hydrological regime and flood process of a river system at a full scale.

Such conditions can influence the environment of freshwater organisms, including the zooplankton community. Our research aimed to assess the impact of environmental and hydrological conditions on the zooplankton of sites upstream and downstream of canal locks. The study was carried out in 2021 and 2022. Water samples were collected monthly from two canals during the growing season. We evaluated how water flow velocity and selected environmental parameters (i.e., water temperature, Secchi disk visibility, conductivity, oxygen concentration, saturation, pH and chl-a concentrations) influence the zooplankton diversity (T) density (N) and biomass (B). Our study showed that the zooplankton of the canals was highly diverse. Rotifers dominated over crustaceans in diversity and density at all sites of canals. The statistical analysis revealed differences in environmental and biological conditions between habitats located upstream and downstream of locks. Rotifers density and biomass changed approximately proportionally to changes in chlorophyll at sites upstream of locks. It supports the hypothesis that rotifer communities are defined by the bottom-up effect linked to food supply (phytoplankton). The growth of crustaceans (density and biomass), as well as total zooplankton biomass, was affected by water temperature at sites downstream of the lock.

Risk of capture is modified by hypoxia and interjurisdictional migration of Lake Whitefish (Coregonusclupeaformis)	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS												Interjurisdictional migrations lead to seasonally changing patterns of exploitation risk, emphasizing the importance of spatially explicit approaches to fishery management. Understanding how risk changes along a migration route supports time-area based fishery management, but quantifying risk can be complicated when multiple fishing methods are geographically segregated and when bycatch species are considered. Further, habitat selection in dynamic environments can influence migration behavior, interacting with other management objectives such as water quality and habitat restoration. As a case study, we examined a novel acoustic telemetry data set for Lake Whitefish in Lake Erie, where they migrate through multiple spatial management units that are variably affected by seasonal hypoxia and host a variety of fisheries. Combining telemetry results with fishery catch and water quality monitoring, we demonstrate three exploitation risk scenarios: (i) high risk due to high residency and high catch, (ii) high risk due to high residency in time-areas with moderate catch, and (iii) low risk due to residency in time-areas with low catch. Interestingly, occupation of low risk refugia was increased by the development of hypoxia in adjacent areas. Consequently, fishery management goals to sustainably manage other target species may be directly and indirectly linked to water quality management goals through Lake Whitefish.					; Vandergoot, Christopher/JAO-1190-2023; Schmitt, Joseph/AAC-3110-2021	Kraus, Richard/0000-0003-4494-1841; 													2045-2322					AUG 5	2024	14	1							18061	10.1038/s41598-024-65147-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-65147-5								39103373					WOS:001284942100024

Here, we investigated the alpha diversity, abundance and composition of the sediment nirS-type denitrifying bacteria in Poyang Lake during the wet, mid-dry and dry seasons using Illumina MiSeq sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. The results showed that only a small part of the total operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were shared by the three seasons. OTU richness, Chao richness estimator and Shannon index exhibited higher values in the wet season than in the dry season. Some regular patterns of variation in the composition of the nirS-type denitrifying community at three classification levels (phylum, class and genus) were found among seasons. Community structures of nirS-type denitrifying bacteria were significantly different across seasons. In addition, the abundance of nirS gene showed no seasonal pattern. Total nitrogen, total phosphorous and pH were the most significant factors elucidating the compositional variation of the nirS-type denitrifying community. This study provided a new evidence for the ecological effects of seasonal water level fluctuations and improved our understanding of the nitrogen removal processes in floodplain lakes.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate physicochemical properties and to discuss the causes of spatiotemporal variability in key physicochemical parameters at five different locations of Dal Lake. Water samples were collected in four seasons for 3 years (i.e., January 2019-December 2021) to evaluate various physicochemical properties using standard methods. The analysis shows that the macrophytic development has increased due to organic and inorganic load, leading to the Lake's deterioration. The analysis indicates positive and negative correlations among various parameters across five sampling sites. Principal component analysis shows that two components (PC1 and PC2) explain 47.35, 47.54, and 48.11% of the variability in the years 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. From 2019 to 2021, the continuous decrease in dissolved oxygen and increased levels of magnesium, conductivity, alkalinity, total hardness, calcium hardness, total phosphorus, and nitrate-nitrogen suggest a trend toward eutrophication in the lake.

J	HARTMAN, KJ; BRANDT, SB				HARTMAN, KJ; BRANDT, SB			ESTIMATING ENERGY DENSITY OF FISH	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												The use of bioenergetics models in fisheries ecology and management has increased rapidly in recent years, but application-specific information on energy content of fish and their prey has lagged behind. We believe this is because the process of directly measuring energy density is very time consuming. In this paper we present and evaluate a series of general empirical models that predict energy density (J/g wet weight) from fish percent dry weight. Data were gathered from the literature, obtained from cooperating investigators, and measured directly. Least-squares models were derived for all species combined and for orders, families, and species. All models were linear; however, logarithmic transformation was necessary to normalize residuals in the combined model. All models with more than four data points were highly significant (P < 0.002) and had coefficients of determination of 0.76 or greater. The model for all species combined (N = 587, r(2) = 0.95) was J/g wet weight = 45.29 DW1.507; DW is the percent dry weight of the fish. At all taxonomic levels, energy density models showed a strong positive relationship between energy density and percent dry weight. This relationship, if corroborated, should allow the estimation of seasonal and ontogenetic changes in energy density based solely on percent dry weight data.																			0002-8487					MAY	1995	124	3					347	355		10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0347:EEDOF>2.3.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1995)124<0347:EEDOF>2.3.CO;2													WOS:A1995QW86900006

Souza; Arun, Kumar; Udayashankar, Harikripa Narayana			Evaporation from dams governing the water cycle dynamics of a regulated river basin from the Western Ghats: Sharavati, India	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Sharavati River, Karnataka, India. Study focus: A small mountainous river system, Sharavati, was selected to study the impact of river damming on the hydrological cycle. Sharavati river flow is regulated by two dams, Linganamakki and Gersoppa. Despite the Western Ghats' global significance in controlling local and regional climates, the effects of damming on its hydrological cycles have received limited attention. A stable water isotopic approach was employed in the study. New hydrological insights for the region: The line-conditioned excess (lc-excess) was primarily negative across all seasons. Notably, the pre-monsoon season exhibited comparatively higher evaporation with high negative lc-excess, while the postmonsoon lc-excess values approached zero, indicating minimal evaporation. The sampling points from the dams exhibited very high evaporation signals, the evaporative loss during the pre-monsoon season from the Linganamakki reservoir was estimated as 10 %, and from the Gersoppa dam was 6 %. Consequently, groundwater sampled near the dams, plotted along the local evaporation line indicating recharge from the evaporated reservoir water. Damming has affected the hydrological cycle of the heavily regulated Sharavati River, transforming the entire catchment into a connected, narrow lake-like structure, especially during the pre-monsoon season. Since the Western Ghat river systems are regulated by many large and small dams, it is pertinent to study the impact of damming on the hydrological cycles of the entire system.

An accurate and high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for this region enables us to analyze it in a 3D environment and understand its intricate role as the Water Tower of Asia. The science teams of NASA realized an 8-m DEM using satellite stereo imagery for HMA, termed HMA 8-m DEM. In this research, we assessed the vertical accuracy of HMA 8-m DEM using reference elevations from ICESat-2 geolocated photons at three test sites of varied topography and land covers. Inferences were made from statistical quantifiers and elevation profiles. For the world's highest mountain, Mount Everest, and its surroundings, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) resulted in 1.94 m and 1.66 m, respectively; however, a uniform positive bias observed in the elevation profiles indicates the seasonal snow cover change will dent the accurate estimation of the elevation in this sort of test sites. The second test site containing gentle slopes with forest patches has exhibited the Digital Surface Model (DSM) features with RMSE and MAE of 0.58 m and 0.52 m, respectively. The third test site, situated in the Zanda County of the Qinghai-Tibet, is a relatively flat terrain bed, mostly bare earth with sudden river cuts, and has minimal errors with RMSE and MAE of 0.32 m and 0.29 m, respectively, and with a negligible bias. Additionally, in one more test site, the feasibility of detecting the glacial lakes was tested, which resulted in exhibiting a flat surface over the surface of the lakes, indicating the potential of HMA 8-m DEM for deriving the hydrological parameters. The results accrued in this investigation confirm that the HMA 8-m DEM has the best vertical accuracy and should be of high use for analyzing natural hazards and monitoring glacier surfaces.					; Ghosh, Koushik/J-3338-2019	Ghatage, Omkar/0009-0007-0005-4833; Roy, Subham/0009-0007-6704-2781; Dandabathula, Giribabu/0000-0003-3245-8094													1672-6316	1993-0321				AUG	2024	21	8					2562	2578		10.1007/s11629-024-8820-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11629-024-8820-8													WOS:001293363500016

Resource availability and heterogeneity affect space use and resource selection of a feral ungulate	ECOSPHERE												Animals adjust their habitat use patterns in response to changes in their physiological needs and environmental conditions. Understanding the mechanisms underlying resource selection and space use across time and space reveals effects of the environment on animals' decisions. We explored the effects of habitat availability and heterogeneity on the seasonal and annual space use and resource selection of two free-roaming feral burro (Equus asinus) populations in the United States within distinct climate and habitat conditions: the Sonoran Desert and the Colorado Plateau. As an introduced yet protected species in the United States, understanding burros' interactions with habitat elements is important for their conservation and management, as well as the conservation of sympatric wildlife. We used GPS locations of female burros (72 animals across both study areas) to delineate annual and seasonal ranges and resource selection patterns. We evaluated effects of mean and CV of habitat covariates, including forage, distance to water, and topography, representing availability and heterogeneity of resources, on seasonal and annual range size of burros. Moreover, we explored how burro seasonal and annual resource selection patterns were affected by availability and heterogeneity of resources. In the Sonoran Desert study area, burros had smaller seasonal and annual ranges and constant resource selection patterns across a year, likely due to a freshwater lake in the area, making water a nonlimiting resource. Human presence was the greatest factor affecting range size and resource selection in the Sonoran Desert, where burros selected for areas near roads and human recreation. In the Colorado Plateau study area, where resources were more seasonal, we found larger range sizes and fluctuating resource selection patterns compared to the Sonoran Desert population. Spatial variation in forage, water, and topography significantly affected range size of burros inhabiting the Colorado Plateau study area. Productive habitats with available water support smaller ranges and a more consistent pattern of resource selection. Our results highlight the positive effect of habitat heterogeneity and the negative effect of habitat productivity on range size of animals. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of habitat requirements for free-roaming burros that currently live under various climate and habitat conditions globally.

The seasonal dynamics of potentially toxic Microcystis were studied using microscopy and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) by assessing the microcystin-encoding microcystin synthetase gene E (mcyE) abundances. Water samples were analyzed over the lake areas, varying in depth, trophic level, and cyanobacterial composition during the growing period of 2021. The Microcystis mcyE genes were detected through the growing period (May-October), forming peak abundances in September with decreasing temperatures (8.9-11.1 degrees C). Total phosphorus (TP) and nitrate (NO3-) were the most relevant environmental variables influencing the Microcystis biomass as well as mcyE abundances. Comparison with previous years (2011, 2012) indicated that the abundance and seasonal dynamics of toxigenic Microcystis can be highly variable between the years and lake areas, varying also in dominant Microcystis species. Contrary to expectations, based on mcyE abundances, the increased risk of toxin-producing Microcystis can occur in Peipsi through the growing period, independently of the water temperature and biomasses of Microcystis.

This research utilizes a groundwater flow model through the application of the MODFLOW-NWT numerical simulator, aiming to explore the patterns of exchange between surface water and groundwater due to intensive seasonal lake inundation, and its consequential impact on the annual and seasonal groundwater storage within the vast Poyang Lake floodplain, China. New hydrological insights for the region: Simulation results indicate that the change in groundwater storage during the dry year (i.e., -24.96x107 m3/yr in 2022) has decreased by 186.35x107 m3 compared to the wet year (i.e., 161.38x107 m3/yr in 2020). The contribution of surface water infiltration is approximately 45 % of the regional groundwater budget during wet seasons, and groundwater discharge into surface waterbodies accounts for over 60 % of the groundwater budget during dry seasons. The lake infiltration during wet years is approximately 3 times that in dry years, and the flow of infiltrated lake water into plain aquifers is approximately 5 times that in dry years. The present study contributes significant knowledge regarding the impact of intensifying seasonal inundation on variations in regional groundwater budget in large lakeaquifer system.

J	Sun, ZH; Li, ZQ; Chen, L; Fan, JW; Liu, Y				Sun, Zhaohua; Li, Zhiqing; Chen, Li; Fan, Jiewei; Liu, Ya			Assessment of hydraulic performance changes of Dongting Lake after the Three Gorges Reservoir impoundment by a novel semi-empirical approach	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES												Floodplain lakes are important water storage areas in lowland regions that often undergo geomorphologic evolution, and timely topographic data are generally unavailable. In this study, to assess the impacts of lakebed deformation on hydraulic performance in Dongting Lake, a set of semi-empirical methods was proposed to establish performance graphs (PGs) using only hydrological data. These methods were used to evaluate the changes in water level, storage capacity, and flood detention ability in Dongting Lake caused by topographic adjustment after the Three Gorges Reservoir impoundment. These methods showed that PGs can effectively simulate the water level and outflow processes of Dongting Lake with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficients (NSEs) above 0.9. A comparison of the estimated water level and discharge using PGs from different periods suggested that bed erosion in Dongting Lake caused water level decreases of 0.18 m and 0.32 m during the flood and dry seasons, respectively. Because the magnitude of erosion at high elevations in the lake is small, the impacts of bed adjustment on the storage capacity and flood detention ability are not currently significant. This study showed that the hydraulic performance of a floodplain lake can be evaluated independently of topographic data under the condition of no reverse flows or negative water surface slopes.

Water samples were collected from five lake sites on three dates in the dry and wet seasons. Two sites on the main inflowing river were sampled on two dates in each season. Analysis was carried out for selected nutrients total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrate (NO3-N), total phosphate (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) as well as chlorophyll-a and silicate. Dissolved Oxygen (DO), % saturation, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, and secchi readings were measured in situ. Lamparelli's (2004) tropic state index (TSI) formula was used to assess trophic conditions. The key water quality issues identified are related to elevated concentrations of TSS, turbidity, and nutrients. TSS value (200 mg L- 1) and turbidity were high in wet. TAN levels were elevated in the lake (0.243 mg L- 1N) and the calculated unionized ammonia exceeded the no-effect limit. The SRP (0.927 mg L- 1P) and total phosphorus concentration were also elevated and significantly higher in the dry season. The lake is a hypertrophic system with the aforementioned sediment and nutrient levels exceeding thresholds for the protection of aquatic life. The lake is impacted by multiple co-occurring stressors. Land-use changes in the catchments and the use of various types of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to protect crops are exerting accelerated pressures on water quality in the lake and inflowing river. A suite of interventions both in terms of policy and practice, is urgently needed to halt its further degradation.																			2363-5037	2363-5045				AUG	2024	10	4							143	10.1007/s40899-024-01119-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40899-024-01119-x													WOS:001254823800001

Two surveys were conducted in 2007 during the dry and wet season. Four sampling sites were selected in the channel margin, based on the level of urbanization. At each sampling site, wood panels of Tabebuia donnell-smithii, Bucida buceras, Pinus sp., Cupressus lindlei and Abies religiosa were submerged during 8 weeks. Water temperature, dissolved oxygen, organic matter, phosphorus and most probable number of coliform bacteria were determined. Results were evaluated using the diversity index of Shannon and the index of similarity of Sorensen. The highest Ascomycete diversity recorded (H' = 1.152) was found at the third sampling site, located near commercial florist greenhouses. The lowest diversity (H' = 0.976) was obtained at the first sampling site, in front of Santa Cruz pier. Both values of diversity were in agreement with the urbanization level and physicochemical and bacteriological data. The wet season had the lowest diversity of freshwater Ascomycetes, perhaps due to the effect of the rainfall in this aquatic environment.

J	Boëchat, IG; Giani, A				Boechat, Iola G.; Giani, Alessandra			Seasonality affects diel cycles of seston biochemical composition in a tropical reservoir	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												We analysed diel cycles of total protein, lipid and carbohydrate content of seston in four seasonal sampling campaigns in a tropical hypereutrophic reservoir. Physical and water chemical variables and taxonomic composition of phytoplankton were measured in parallel. Seston lipid and carbohydrate contents exhibited highest values during the day, while protein content was highest at night. Carbohydrate content was negatively correlated with nitrate and nitrite concentrations. Lipid content was negatively correlated with temperature and positively with soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations. Protein content was positively correlated with temperature and negatively with SRP concentrations. In all sampling campaigns, the biochemical composition was correlated to the biovolume of phytoplankton. However, relationships differed between seasons. In the dry season, the relative biovolume of non-dominant groups such as cyanobacteria and bacillariophyceae was strongly correlated with all biochemical compounds of seston. During the rainy season, significant correlations were detected between biochemical compounds of seston and biovolumes of the dominant groups, chlorophyceae and euglenophyceae. We conclude that diel fluctuations in environmental conditions as well as changes in the community composition of phytoplankton affected seston biochemical composition during the diel cycles investigated. However, the type of interaction was clearly influenced by seasonality in this tropical reservoir.

Breeding Season Diets of Egrets in Southeast Australia: Implications for Future Population Viability	WATERBIRDS												Populations of egrets and other waterbirds in the Murray-Darling Basin of eastern Australia arc declining. River regulation and increasing frequency of droughts are considered to be mainly responsible by reducing the frequency and extent of flooding to temporary wetlands. However, other changes have occurred to wetlands, such;is the introduction of non-native fish, widespread severe declines in the abundance of native fish, increased salinity, sediment and nutrient concentrations, and removal of aquatic vegetation by livestock grazing. Current knowledge of the diets of egrets is inadequate for an assessment of any ecological implications arising from these changes. In this study the breeding season diets of Eastern Great Egret Ardea modesta and Intermediate Egret A. intermedia were quantified at a colony in the Murray Basin. Eastern Great Egrets depended mainly oil introduced Common Carp Cyprinus carpio (94% of diet biomass), a species regarded as a severe pest of river systems and wetlands within the Basin. Attempts to eliminate carp, without adequate restoration of native fish populations, Could result in further long-term declines in egret breeding success and survival. Intermediate egrets depended mainly oil adult and larval frogs (80% of diet biomass), species that are under threat from habitat degradation and predicted increases in the salinity of freshwater wetlands. A holistic approach to the restoration of wetlands, involving the integration of improved flooding regimes, pest fish management and reinstatement of native fish and amphibians, salinity control and restoration of aquatic vegetation will be needed to ensure the future of egrets and other fish-eating birds in the Murray-Darling Basin.

Pediatric emergency department visits for diarrheal illness increased after release of undertreated sewage	PEDIATRICS												CONTEXT. Contamination of local waterways may occur through release of partially treated sewage. The Environmental Protection Agency has recently reviewed regulatory standards for this practice. However, the health effects of these events have not been well studied. OBJECTIVE. Our goal was to identify any increase in visits to a pediatric emergency department for diarrheal illness after sewage bypass into Lake Michigan. METHODS. The study was conducted as a retrospective, observational time-series analysis in a tertiary care children's hospital emergency department with an annual volume of similar to 45 000 visits. We collected data for 2002-2004 pertaining to the daily number of emergency department visits for children ( aged < 19 years) for diarrheal illness ( using specified International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition codes as a reference). Daily diarrheal illness visits were the dependent variable in a time-series model. The primary independent variable was the occurrence of a sewage-bypass event in the 3 to 7 preceding days. Potential confounders included the season and daily rainfall. Separate models were created for visits from people living in zip codes that used Lake Michigan drinking water and those who used other water sources. RESULTS. Over the 3-year study period, there was a mean of 5.0 +/- 3.8 ( SD) daily visits for diarrheal illness from people who lived in zip codes that used Lake Michigan drinking water and 1.2 +/- 1.4 ( SD) from outside that area. There were 6 sewage-bypass events identified. After adjusting for the season and rainfall, there was a significant increase of 2.5 to 2.7 visits only from people who lived in zip codes that used Lake Michigan drinking water after the 2 largest of the 6 bypass events. CONCLUSIONS. Emergency department visits for diarrheal illness increased significantly after 2 events of release of partially treated sewage into area waterways. These data suggest a potentially harmful effect of such practices.																			0031-4005					DEC	2007	120	6					E1472	E1475		10.1542/peds.2007-0283	http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2007-0283								18055664					WOS:000251317200013

Simultaneous measurements of PCB concentrations in the gas and dissolved phases conducted in Green Bay in 1989 and in southern Lake Michigan in 1994-1995 were used to estimate air-water exchange fluxes. In this work, improved Henry's law constants for PCBs and new mass-transfer rates across the air-water interface were used to update the previous calculations. The new model calculations suggest that the net volatilization flux of PCBs out of Green Bay ranges from +170 to +5300 ng m(-2) day(-1), which is 2-20 times larger than previous estimates. The flux of PCBs in southern Lake Michigan exhibits net volatilization of +0.5 to +230 ng m(-2) day(-1) throughout the study period (May and July 1994, January 1995), whereas previous estimates reported that the net flux was seasonally absorptive. Thus, water-to-air fluxes are more important for the removal of PCBs from both Green Bay and Lake Michigan than previously recognized.

J	Scheffer, M				Scheffer, M			The effect of aquatic vegetation on turbidity; how important are the filter feeders?	HYDROBIOLOGIA					International Conference on Trophic Interactions in Shallow Freshwater and Brackish Waterbodies	AUG 03-08, 1998	BLOSSIN, GERMANY	Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisher, Tech Univ Cottbus				A review of the literature suggests that aquatic macrophytes can enhance water clarity and reduce phytoplankton biomass through shading, reduction of nutrient availability, excretion of allelopathic substances and reduction of resuspension. In addition, vegetation fields are reported to enhance grazing on phytoplankton by providing a day-time refuge against fish predation for planktonic filter feeders such as Daphnia and by providing a suitable habitat for macrophyte associated filter feeders such as Sida crystallina, Eurycercus lamellatus and Simocephalus velutus. I use a graphical and a simple mathematical model to explore how top-down control by these grazers may interact with the effect of reduced phytoplankton production due to the other factors mentioned. The analysis suggests that grazing tends to be an all-or-none effect, driving phytoplankton to a very low biomass once a certain threshold level of grazing pressure is exceeded. This threshold level is predicted to increase with the productivity of the phytoplankton. Thus, the model suggests that, in plant beds, productivity reducing factors such as shading and reduced nutrient concentrations can pave the way for top-down control of phytoplankton even by a relatively moderate population of filter-feeders, and that phytoplankton biomass will decrease sharply beyond a critical macrophyte (or grazer) density. Indeed such a discontinuous response is observed in field experiments. Also, the idea that filter feeding cladocerans such as Daphnia play a key role is in line with the observation that brackish lakes where Daphnia does not thrive tend to be turbid despite the often dense weed beds.

J	Danielsen, R				Danielsen, Randi			Dissimilarities in the recent histories of two lakes in Portugal explained by local-scale environmental processes	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The palaeolimnology of two shallow lakes, Vela and Bra double dagger as, in coastal Portugal, were investigated. The lakes are situated in a transitional area between a Holocene dune field and agricultural fields. This study focused on the local palaeoecology and palaeolimnology inferred from the stratigraphic records of pollen of hygrophilous taxa and non-pollen palynomorphs, with particular emphasis on algal remains, e.g. Pediastrum. The record of local-scale vegetation changes was utilized to reconstruct the evolution of the local environment in and around the lakes and to identify and explain dissimilarities between the two water bodies. Initially, the sites were wetlands similar to the dune flats and seasonal pools found in the region today. Lake genesis in both basins occurred relatively synchronously, about 2-3 centuries ago, in response to regional geo-hydrological and climatic forcing. Biotic and abiotic dissimilarities between the two lakes have existed since the time of lake formation. Knowledge of the modern ecology of local vascular plants and algae was used to elucidate differences in the recent histories of the two basins. Lake Vela has been more alkaline and displays higher trophic status than Lake Bra double dagger as. Dissimilarities between the two lakes are probably explained by differences in the flow paths and amounts of input waters, with Lake Vela receiving more nutrient-rich waters from fertilized agricultural fields. Lake Bra double dagger as receives greater inflow of water that passes through relatively nutrient-poor, acid soils.

Among OCs concentrations, PCBs (upto 5600 ng/g lipid wt.) were the highest, and those of other OCs were in the order of DDT > CHLs > HCHs > HCB. Studies on growth trend and seasonal variation of OCs in this species suggest a rapid reflection of the pollution levels in seawater where and when they were collected, regardless of body-length and time of collection. These results indicate that Japanese common squid is a suitable bioindicator for monitoring OCs pollution in waters around Japan. With regard to the geographical distribution of OCs in this species collected from waters around Japan, OCs concentrations in specimens from Japan Sea were higher than those from the Pacific Ocean. This result might reflect some existing of local pollution sources of OCs around Japan Sea, and slower water exchange between Japan Sea and open ocean. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Palacios, E; Rodriguez, A				Palacios, E; Rodriguez, A			Ranging pattern and use of space in a group of red howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus) in a southeastern Colombian rainforest	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PRIMATOLOGY												We studied a group of red howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus) bordering a lake in an eastern Colombian Amazon rainforest for 10 months. The group used an area of 182 ha located mainly on Pleistocene terrace forest and had no overlap with other howler home ranges. Home range use varied through the year as a consequence of fruit and leaf abundance. For example, during the fruit scarcity season the group used an area of flooded forest nearly exclusively, indicating that at least for a portion of the year they are habitat specialists. Two areas intensively used by the group were identified, representing 17.6 % of the home range, and within which 56.9 % of the feeding trees were located. Overall density of feeding trees within the group's home range was very low (1.12 trees/ha). Home range size, as well as mean length of daily ranges (1,150 m), is the largest reported for this species to date, and it is likely a consequence of the diminished productivity of the plant communities on poor soil. Our results give an interesting example of the ranging behavior of this primate, which clearly differs from previous descriptions of red howlers.

FACTORS AFFECTING WATER STRIDER (HEMIPTERA: GERRIDAE) MERCURY CONCENTRATIONS IN LOTIC SYSTEMS	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Water striders (Hemiptera: Gerridae) have been considered as a potential sentinel for mercury (Hg) contamination of freshwater ecosystems, yet little is known about factors that control Hg concentrations in this invertebrate. Striders were collected from 80 streams and rivers in New Brunswick, Canada, in August and September of 2004 through 2007 to assess the influence of factors such as diet, water chemistry, and proximity to point sources on Hg concentrations in this organism. Higher than average Hg concentrations were observed in the southwest and Grand Lake regions of the province, the latter being the location of a coal-fired power plant that is a source of Hg (similar to 100 kg annually), with elevated Hg concentrations in the lichen Old Man's Beard (Usnea spp.) in its immediate vicinity. Across all streams, pH and total organic carbon of water were relatively weak predictors of strider Hg concentrations. Female striders that were larger in body size than males had significantly lower Hg concentrations within sites, suggestive of growth dilution. There was no relationship between percent aquatic carbon in the diet and Hg concentrations in striders. For those striders feeding solely on terrestrial carbon, Hg concentrations were higher in animals occupying a higher trophic level. Mercury concentrations were highly variable in striders collected monthly over two growing seasons, suggesting short-term changes in Hg availability. These measurements highlight the importance of considering both deposition and postdepositional processes in assessing Hg bioaccumulation in this species. They also suggest that striders may be more appropriate as a terrestrial rather than an aquatic Hg sentinel, underscoring the importance of understanding the origin of food for organisms used in contaminant studies.

J	Lin, P; Klump, JV; Guo, LD				Lin, Peng; Klump, J. Val; Guo, Laodong			Chemical speciation, reactivity, and long-term burial of sedimentary phosphorus in Green Bay, a seasonally hypoxia-influenced freshwater estuary	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Sediment cores were collected along a trophic gradient in Green Bay, a seasonally hypoxia-influenced freshwater estuary in Lake Michigan, to measure various phosphorus (P) species, including exchangeable-P (Ex-P), iron-bound-P (Fe-P), biogenic-apatite and/or CaCO3-associated-P (CFA-P), organic-P (Org-P) and detrital-apatite-P (Detr-P). Although total phosphorus (TP) decreased with increasing depth, different P species exhibited distinct vertical distribution patterns with different post-depositional behaviors. The Ex-P, Fe-P and CFA-P species were identified as potentially bioavailable-P (BAP). Little variation was observed for Org-P and Detr-P species, especially below the upper-active-layer, both serving as the primary sink for P in sediment. Detr-P% decreased consistently from the near river plume station to the open bay in the north. P accumulation rates were estimated at 25.1 mmol-P/m(2)/yr (779 mg-P/m(2)/yr) in the south, 10.9 mmol-P/m(2)/yr (338 mg-P/m(2)/yr) in the central region, and 8.1 mmol-P/m(2)/yr (252 mg-P/m(2)/yr) in the north of Green Bay, showing a decrease in the depth of the upper active layer for P regeneration along the south-north transect. The overall potential P regeneration back into the water column increased from 2.8 mmol-P/m(2)/yr (87 mg-P/m(2)/yr) in the south, and 3.3 mmol-P/m(2)/yr (101 mg-P/m(2)/yr) in the central region to 5.6 mmol-P/m(2)/yr (173 mg-P/m(2)/yr) in the north of the bay, corresponding to P burial efficiencies of similar to 89 %, 70 % and 31 % along the trophic gradient. The recent decrease in Detr-P and thus the increase in BAP over the last 2-3 decades could be related to anthropogenic activities, such as damming and implementation of agricultural conservation practices. Conversely, a recent increase in TOC/TOP ratios may reflect the increased extent of trophic status and seasonal hypoxia in bottom waters and enhanced regeneration and recycling of particulate P in Green Bay since the 1960s. New results from this study provide an improved understanding of the linkage between sources, internal cycling, and long-term burial of P in the basin.

As the hydro-geological conditions at Lake Ammersee have not yet been finally clarified, we created simulation scenarios for the hydrodynamic modeling with various characteristics of sub-terrestrial inflow. The scenarios were based on a review of the state of available information regarding the geology of the Ammersee basin. Analysis of the simulation results for each scenario revealed obvious alterations in the reproduction of real-temperature in comparison to those produced without accounting for subsurface inflows. For some inflow characteristics the implementation of groundwater inflow induced more accurate approximations of simulation results to real conditions for almost all depths and seasons. This implies that the hydrodynamic simulation of water temperatures at Lake Ammersee, including subsurface inflow, provides reliable results. Additionally it was possible to estimate roughly the potential conditions of groundwater inflow into the lake.

FROM HYPERTROPHIC LAGOONS TO BIOENERGY PRODUCTION	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY												The study of natural environments, together with the knowledge of applied microbial ecology, can drive innovation in bioenergetic applications. Hypertrophic lagoons are characterised by rapid and huge biomass blooms and decomposition. In these salty shallow-water ecosystems the microbial degradation is supported by a chain of electron acceptors, in which oxygen is the first, and sulphate the last and most available one (about 3 g/l). The latter plays a pivotal role in the ecology of these environments. Bacterial sulphate reduction is strongly supported by small molecules produced by microaerophilic fermentation in warm seasons. The same microbial communities and metabolism can support also an effective methanogenesis in different environmental conditions where SO4 is depleted. A sediment sample collected in an hypertrophic coastal lake in Central Italy demonstrated a high hydrogen production capability in laboratory tests. The bacterial community was characterised by molecular techniques, after 210 h of acclimatisation in a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR), while producing high rate and yield of hydrogen in stable conditions. The selected inoculum, F-210 was successfully tested for hydrogen production on different kinds of organic wastes. Further, batch experimental trials in which F-210 added to a methanogens community showed an increase in the efficiency of methane production.					; Fenice, Massimiliano/L-9195-2014; Varrone, Cristiano/I-1658-2015; Marone, Antonella/P-9640-2016; patriarca, carlo/AAC-7470-2022; MARONE, ANTONELLA/P-9640-2016	Signorini, Antonella/0000-0002-4108-9393; Varrone, Cristiano/0000-0002-5638-6390; Patriarca, Carlo/0000-0001-5490-1830; MARONE, ANTONELLA/0000-0002-3210-9030													1311-5065						2014	15	2					537	546																WOS:000339362500015

Gross sedimentation rates (GSRs) in Lake Kinneret (Israel), regularly monitored from 1999 up to date with sedimentation traps, showed salient temporal and spatial variability. In the lake center, the annual mean GSR ranged from 1.9 to 6.0 g m(-2) day(-1). The accumulation rate of sediments at the lake centrum during the study averaged from 2.6 to 4.3 mm year(-1), in agreement with values obtained by sediment core dating. Organic matter (OM) content comprised 33-42 % of the sinking particulate matter in sediment traps located in the lake center and was 1.5-2 times lesser in peripheral stations. The highest seasonal values of OM content in traps were associated with collapse of algal blooms. Algae and their debris are the main components of OM and their fate in the water column can be well traced by photosynthetic pigments. Chlorophyte signature pigments display much lower degradability in the water column than those of diatoms and dinoflagellates and leave a relatively persistent residue in the buried sediments. Analysis of seasonal changes of algal signature pigments in the upper euphotic zone and those in sedimentation traps allow us to follow the fate of dominant algal phyla in the water column. We argue thatlarge individual algal cells may have better ability to survive in the deep non-stratified water column with limited light, while the ability to retain and recycle in the euphotic epilimnion under conditions of nutrient limitation may well confer an evolutionary advantage to small or buoyant algal populations. Despite large variation in algal community composition, the ratio of OM sedimentation flux to primary production (i.e., the export ratio) alters only slightly throughout the stratified period. Approximately 20 % of the OM supplied to the lake by primary production found its way to the traps. A large decline of water level in recent years affected the processes of particle resuspension and offshore translocation, which caused prominent site-specific impacts on the sedimentation regime. We argue that changes in sedimentation rates observed in the lake are related to fluctuations of loads from the watershed and prominent water-level fluctuations.

In this study, mean release values of phosphorus in depths and months representing the seasons (April, July, October, January) varied between 9.19 (January, 0-5 cm) and 119.08 mu g m(-2) d(-1) (October, 0-5 cm) in West Pond sediment which supplies water to the Sakaryabasi Fish Culture and Research Station. The mean negative phosphorus release dependent on months and depths were estimated as 1.25 mu g m(-2) d(-1) (July, 5-10 cm) and 46.45 mu g m(-2) d(-1) (October, 10-15 cm). The distribution of phosphorus fractions in the pond sediment: total organically bound phosphorus fraction (Org approximate to P) > calcium bound phosphorus fraction (Ca approximate to P)> carbonate bound phosphorus fraction (CO3 approximate to P) > iron + aluminum bound phosphorus fraction (Fe+Al approximate to P). In line with research findings the negative phosphorus release dependent on months and depths have revealed quantitatively that West Pond sediment is a sink not a source in terms of phosphorus. In the light of this, conservation of the aquatic macrophytes, role in preventing/suppressing the dissolved inorganic phosphorus release from sediment to overlying water, suggested as the best management technique of West Pond.

Field and laboratory incubation experiments were employed to manipulate Daphnia rosea growth environments. Sestonic eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) content was much lower, whereas carbon to phosphorus (C.-P) ratios were much higher in the epilimnion compared to the deep-water chlorophyll maximum (16 20 in). In a temperature-controlled incubation, Daphnia grew faster when fed seston from the deep-water chlorophyll maximum. In in situ cage incubations, D. rosea grew fastest in the epilimmon. Daphnia rosea in a migrating treatment exhibited intermediate growth rates between the ones for epilimnion and hypolimnion. A projection of D. rosea growth rates by growth models without regard to water temperature showed much higher growth potentials in the hypolimmon. However, with inclusion of water temperature, epilimnetic water always gave higher potential growth rates. In this lake, warmer temperatures of epilimnetic water override the higher food qualify and quantity provided by the deep-water chlorophyll maximum.

J	Hagerthey, SE; Kerfoot, WC				Hagerthey, SE; Kerfoot, WC			Groundwater flow influences the biomass and nutrient ratios of epibenthic algae in a north temperate seepage lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Groundwater flow influenced epibenthic algal biomass and N:P ratios at a seepage lake (Sparkling Lake, Wisconsin). During seasonal studies, biomass and seepage Bur were positively associated (r = 0.453; P < 0.001). Pore-water soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations (29.2-110.7 mu g PO4 liter(-1)), SRP fluxes, and algal biomass were significantly higher at high groundwater discharge sites than at low flow sites (<10.0 to 27.7 mu g PO4 liter(-1)). Pore-water ammonia (NH3) concentrations were significantly lower at high groundwater discharge sites (<10.0 to 566.0 mu g NH3 liter(-1)) than at low groundwater discharge and recharge sites (61.4-1464.9 mu g NH3 liter(-1)). The coupling between pore-water nutrient concentrations and local groundwater Bow dynamics suggests a mechanism for the observed spatial patterns in biomass. In situ experimental chambers evaluated coupling between epibenthic algal biomass, N:P ratios, and groundwater flow patterns. Biomass responded rapidly in chambers, reaching ambient levels within 1.5 months of initiation. Free-flow chambers in discharge regions had consistently higher soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), NO3-NO2, and O-2 concentrations, higher phosphate and nitrate-nitrite fluxes, higher algal biomass, and lower N:P ratios in the developing mat. Free-flow chambers in recharge regions had high ammonia (NH3) concentrations, lower algal biomass, and higher N:P ratios. These results confirm that groundwater-related nutrient fluxes influence the local physicochemical environment and affect epibenthic algal biomass.

Sediment is an active hot spot for microbial metabolism, driving the migration and transformation of elements in shallow lakes, which may control the DIC availability to influence algal spatiotemporal dynamics. Hence, we investigated the spatiotemporal changes of phytoplankton, DIC and sediment respiration rates in a eutrophic shallow freshwater lake under non-bloom conditions. There was a widespread deficiency of DIC in the lake, except the estuary. Sediment respiration was positively associated with changes in DIC concentrations, indicating that carbon metabolic activity of sedimentary microorganisms was an important inorganic carbon source for water columns. The availability of DIC in water columns regulated by sediment microbial respiration influenced the algal biomass, composition and productivity. The synergistic effects of seasonal temperature changes and sediment microbial respiration influenced the vertical distribution and migration of phytoplankton. Our results emphasized that carbon metabolic intensity of sediment microorganisms might play a key role in dynamics of phytoplankton, further impacting the spatiotemporal pattern and formation of algal bloom in eutrophic shallow freshwater lakes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2024	851	20					4873	4889		10.1007/s10750-024-05644-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-024-05644-w		JUL 2024											WOS:001274286100001

These turtles exhibited a mono-peaked diel activity pattern, with peaks during midday hours. Highest mean estimated densities were found in reed-bed habitat (9.51 individuals x ha-1) and in the open water habitat (lake) (9.12 individuals x ha-1), with much lower values in seasonally inundated grasslands (6.0 individuals x ha-1) and no turtles being found in temporary ponds. Density of reeds did not influence the selection of micro-habitat by turtles. Sex-ratio was even, and females attained larger size than males. Diet was carnivorous and relatively specialised, with large larvae of aquatic beetles (Hydrophilus piceus) accounting for by far the main prey item. In this regard, the food habits of the Azerbaijan turtles appeared more specialised than those of other E. orbicularis populations from elsewhere.

We evaluate the changes in the alluvial architecture of the Matasiete (Aptian) and Castillo (Albian) formations of the Chubut Group (Cretaceous) in the endorheic Golfo San Jorge Basin (Patagonia, Argentina) analyzing a 150 km transect along the San Bernardo Fold Belt, subsurface data, and coeval fluvial successions of the Los Adobes Formation in the nearby Canado<acute accent>n Asfalto Basin. The Aptian Matasiete Formation represents an externally-sourced, high-accommodation fluvial system with its headwaters in the current Canado<acute accent>n Asfalto Basin, flowing toward the alkaline lake of the Pozo D-129 Formation through N-S oriented sedimentary corridors of tectonic origin. Low sinuosity, fixed channels with ribbon geometries (mean thickness 7.3 m, W/T ratio 14) are encased in red-colored floodplain fines, whereas stratigraphic intervals rich in resedimented tuffs contain braided rivers with W/T ratio up to 90. Deposition of the overlying Albian Castillo Formation occurred in a W-E elongated basin disconnected from the Canado<acute accent>n Asfalto Basin, comprising aggradational, volcaniclastic floodplain deposits and smaller-scale fluvial channels of narrow-sheet geometries (mean thickness 3m, mean W/T ratio 45). The Castillo Formation shows spatial variation in fluvial styles and channel sizes, with intermittent to ephemeral rivers of small scale near the headwaters and seasonal, perennial rivers in downstream positions. Alluvial architecture changes between the Matasiete and Castillo formations reflect changes in the configuration of the basin boundaries, subsequent re-organization of the channel networks, and variable supply of volcaniclastic particles to drainage catchments of different hierarchy that evolved in areas with large variation of the preserved thickness.

Such systems are commonly found in low-gradient shallow-water continental down-warped lacustrine basins, which are favorable for the formation of composite reservoir-caprock assemblages. Nevertheless, our understanding of the sedimentary stratigraphy of the Neogene Guantao Formation remains limited due to the complex and variable spatial and temporal associations between fluvial and lacustrine deposits. Integrated analysis of the geomorphology and stratigraphy of the modern Poyang Lake Basin and ancient Bohai Bay Basin (BBB) allows us to develop a process-based fluvial-lacustrine interaction model of shallow-water depositional system. Three physiographic zones are identified based on seasonal lake shoreline migration during a certain geological sequence unit, namely fluvial-dominated zone (FDZ), fluvial-lacustrine interaction zone (FLIZ) and lacustrine-dominated zone (LDZ), respectively. The FDZ is always above the maximum lake shoreline without affection by lake basin water body and is characterized by channelized dendritic pattern of distributary channels with positive rhythmic cycles. The FLIZ is a dynamic interaction region between the maximum lake shoreline and the lowest lake shoreline. Reticular distributary channels, delta front and prodelta/lake deposits vertically superimpose and dominate the system that is featured by complex sandbody, stacked positive and negative rhythms and strong water body segmentation. The LDZ, away from the fluvial effect, was identified below the lowest lake shoreline exhibiting polycentric sheet water body, dominated by lacustrine mudstone interspersed with thin sheet-like sandstone. These results shed light on the spatial and temporal sedimentary heterogeneity in such dynamic fluvial-lacustrine interaction systems. The proposed fluvial-lacustrine interaction model may serve as a valuable analogue for identifying sedimentary types and predicting sandstone reservoirs in similar shallow-water settings ranging from continental down-warped lacustrine basins to cratonic basins, and fault-depression basin gentleslope belts.

Nematode abundances, biomass and secondary production were analysed. together with the species composition. proportion of feeding types and diversity of the nematode communities of the micro-habitats. Differences between the investigated micro-habitats in terms of seasonal variations, species composition, proportion of feeding types and diversity were expected. The annual mean values of nematode abundance, biomass and secondary production differed significantly between the micro-habitats. Abundances were highest on dead wood, whereas biomass and secondary production were highest in sediment. In the sediment and on leaf litter, nematode abundance and biomass showed pronounced seasonal patterns. The largest contribution to the total secondary production of the stream was from sediment nematodes. In total, 108 nematode species were detected in the micro-habitats during the 13-month study. Comparisons between them revealed differences in nematode species composition. The annual mean species number was significantly higher in sediment and on leaf litter than on dead wood and macrophytes, whereas the annual mean Shannon-Wiener index was significantly higher in sediment than at all other micro-habitats. All micro-habitats in the studied stream, as well as the stream as a whole, were dominated by nematode species belonging to the deposit feeders. Our study clearly showed that the composition of nematode communities from different micro-habitats within a single stream reach can differ markedly.

As an example of the biological matrix of lipids, for the entire procedure, we have used two Amazonian fish samples. Phenotype factor was taken into account when lipid contents of the Amazonian fish samples were evaluated, such as fish-eating habits in distinct Amazon seasonal periods, the flood and the drought. Results demonstrated the applicability of NMR as a powerful and useful tool for fish oil analysis. The omnivorous (T. elongates) and the piscivorous (C. monoculus) Amazonian fish differ in composition and distribution of lipids, which show differences not only because of the different eating habits between the two species. but also by the availability and quantity of food along the year, i.e., during the flood and drought Amazon periods.					; Tasic, Ljubica/C-3760-2013; Val, Adalberto/I-3377-2014; CORREIA, BANNY/L-6351-2017	SILVA BARBOSA CORREIA, BANNY/0000-0002-9283-8163; Tasic, Ljubica/0000-0003-2930-7332; 													0103-5053	1678-4790				APR	2020	31	4					662	672		10.21577/0103-5053.20190230	http://dx.doi.org/10.21577/0103-5053.20190230													WOS:000518371200004

In this study, seasonal variation of planktonic viruses were observed at three different trophic sites, hypertrophic, eutrophic, and mesotrophic regions, and the correlation between their abundances and other aquatic environmental components, such as bacterioplankton, chlorophyll a, burst size, pH, dissolved oxygen, and temperature, was analyzed for the period of an year. Virioplankton abundance detected by transmission electron microscope (TEM) ranged from 5.48 x 10(8) to 2.04 x 10(9) ml(-1) in all the sites throughout the study, and the high abundances and seasonal variations of planktonic viruses were related to the trophic status at the sampled sites in Lake Donghu. Their annual mean abundances were, the highest at the hypertrophic site (1.23x10(9) ml(-1)), medium at the eutrophic site (1.19x10(9) ml(-1)), and the lowest at the mesotrophic site (1.02x10(9) ml(-1)). The VBR (virus-to-bacteria ratio) values were high, ranging from 49 to 56 on average at the three sampled sites. The data suggested that the high viral abundance and high VBR values might be associated with high density of phytoplankton including algae and cyanobacteria in this eutrophic shallow lake, and that planktonic viruses are important members of freshwater ecosystems.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				MAY	2006	560						323	334		10.1007/s10750-005-1280-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-1280-4													WOS:000236092500024
J	Sala, MM; Güde, H				Sala, Maria Montserrat; Guede, Hans			Seasonal dynamics of pelagic and benthic (littoral and profundal) bacterial abundances and activities in a deep prealpine lake (L. Constance)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												In order to obtain a first insight into the characteristics of pelagic, littoral and profundal bacterial communities and their potential role for the degradation of organic matter in the deep prealpine Lake Constance, we compared the seasonal dynamics of bacterial abundances and activities during the annual cycle in the epilimnetic water of a central station as well as in surface layers of sediments at a central profundal and a littoral site. For this purpose, bacterial abundances (DAPI counts), rates of leucine incorporation, respiration of C-14-labeled substrates (glucose, phenol) and ectoenzymatic activities were measured biweekly-monthly at the different sampling sites. Bacterial densities in lake sediments generally exceeded those of epilimnetic waters by at least two orders of magnitude with higher values in profundal sediments. A seasonal pattern was well expressed for bacterioplankton, less pronounced for benthic littoral bacteria and hardly visible for profundal bacteria. Compared to pelagic bacteria, benthic bacteria exhibited lower specific rates of leucine incorporation, especially during the warmer periods. For profundal benthic communities specific rates of glucose respiration and of enzyme activities were permanently low with little seasonal fluctuation. In contrast, littoral benthic communities showed the highest values for these specific metabolic activities among the three sites tested. Additionally, the capacity of metabolism of phenol (used here as a representative of more recalcitrant aromatic substances) was by far highest respired for littoral communities, and almost lacking for pelagic communities. Evidence from the literature suggests that the qualitatively and quantitatively enhanced level of degradation capacities observed for littoral bacteriobenthos may be predominantly a result of the combined effect of increased supply of additional organic matter (e. g. allochthonous matter and macrophytes), an enriched bacterial gene reservoir in sediments, and frequent resuspension. Littoral benthic communities showed the highest specific metabolic activities exceeding those of bacterioplankton and profundal bacteriobenthos by an order of magnitude. As a whole, our results indicate that the overall contribution of the littoral area to degradation of organic matter must be comparable to that of the total pelagic water body although it comprises less than 10% of the lake surface.

Watershed hydrology mediates the recovery of an arsenic impacted subarctic landscape	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												A holistic understanding of the chemical recovery of lakes from arsenic (As) pollution requires consideration of within-lake biogeochemical cycling of As and processes occurring in the surrounding catchment. This study used a watershed mass balance approach, complemented by experimental sediment incubations, to assess the mobility and transport of As within a subarctic watershed (155 km 2 ) impacted by more than 60 years of atmospheric mining emissions. The period of record spanned a transition from drought to high streamflow between September 2017 and September 2019, which yielded insights into the interacting effects of hydrology and within-lake biogeochemical cycling of As. Internal loading of As from contaminated lake sediments (25 - 46 kg As year-1 ) and contributions from terrestrial sources (16 - 56 kg As yr- 1 ) continue to negatively impact lake water quality (19 - 144 mu g As L-1 ), but the relative importance of these loads varies seasonally and inter-annually in response to changing hydrological conditions. Wet conditions resulted in greater transport of As from terrestrial reservoirs and upstream areas, shorter lake water retention time, and increased the downstream export of As. During dry periods, the lake was disconnected from the surrounding watershed resulting in limited terrestrial contributions and longer lake water residence time, which delayed recovery due to the greater relative influence of internal loading from contaminated sediments. This study highlights that changing hydroclimatic regimes will alter trajectories of chemical recovery for arsenic impacted lakes through the coupling of within-lake and watershed transport processes.					; Chételat, John/AAE-4711-2020; Richardson, Murray/AAW-3465-2021	Jamieson, Heather/0000-0002-4227-5673; Palmer, Michael/0000-0002-3180-7224													0269-7491	1873-6424				OCT 1	2024	358								124480	10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124480	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124480		JUL 2024						38968985					WOS:001272109900001

This study explored the application of Electron Backscatter Diffraction combined with Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy to investigate a well-preserved middle Cretaceous lacustrine stromatolite from south-eastern Korea, unveiling ultra-high-resolution sedimentary processes that are often challenging to observe using conventional methods. Two types of microsparitic layers and one type of crystalline layer are distinguished based on their texture, crystal morphology and elemental composition. Both microsparitic layers are micrometre-thick and are characterized by poorly co-oriented calcite grains, but differ in their composition. Type 1 is depleted in magnesium but enriched in detrital elements such as silicon and aluminium, likely originating from the trapping and binding of detrital sediments on microbial mats during rainy seasons. In contrast, type 2 is enriched in magnesium but devoid of detrital elements, interpreted to have formed by the precipitation of calcium carbonate during dry seasons. The crystalline layers comprise fan-shaped calcite crystals (ca 500 mu m in length) with radiating internal structures, with their c-axes oriented perpendicular to the stromatolite layers. These structures resemble those observed in some modern freshwater stromatolites, which are interpreted as imprints of cyanobacterial fascicules. While the cyclic occurrence of types 1 and 2 microsparitic layers might imply annual seasonal cycles, the less frequent crystalline layers are interpreted as a result of environmental changes occurring every 27 to 30 years. This is the first study to apply Electron Backscatter Diffraction to stromatolites, showcasing its potential in unravelling both the formative and diagenetic processes of ancient stromatolites.

J	Szymczyk, A				Szymczyk, Artur			Relations between assemblages of carpological remains and modern vegetation in a shallow reservoir in southern Poland	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												This paper explores relations between assemblages of carpological remains and vegetation in and around a small, shallow reservoir in southern Poland. The study was conducted from 2006 to 2008. Quantity and distribution of species in the reservoir were recorded annually during the growing season. In October 2008, 40 samples of surface sediment (top 2 cm) were collected along transects at 10 m intervals. Samples of 100 cm(3) were prepared for analysis of plant macroremains. Assemblages of carpological remains generally reflect local vegetation well. In some cases, however, even analysis of numerous samples failed to fully capture the species composition or reflect plant ratios in the parent phytocenosis. Reasons for this include factors that affect seed production, transport and fossilization, which differ among species. Among the best-represented macroremains were plants of the rush phytocenosis. In analysed samples, macroremains of 68.8 % of extant rushes were identified. Sixty percent of submerged and floating-leaf taxa were found in carpological samples, whereas 26.7 % of the trees and bushes were represented in sediment deposits. Species composition of phytocenoses in the reservoir and in surrounding areas was best reflected by macroremains from the nearby reed bed. Numbers of diaspores of Mentha aquatica, Hippuris vulgaris and Carex reflected well their relative abundance in phytocenoses. Chara sp., Juncus inflexus and Eupatorium cannabinum were overrepresented, whereas Typha latifolia and Sparganium minimum were poorly represented in relation to contemporary plant cover. There were no diaspores of Phragmites australis, which dominates the contemporary reed bed. Besides the shape of a reservoir, the key factor influencing diaspore numbers is distribution of plant cover. In many cases, single diaspores (Potentilla erecta, Myosotis scorpioides, Lythrum salicaria, Scutellaria galericulata), or higher concentrations (Hippuris vulgaris, Mentha aquatica, Eleocharis palustris, Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, Chara sp.) reflected well the location of parent vegetation. The findings indicate that carpological remains in sediments can be an important source of information about plants in and around lakes. They generally reflect well local vegetation and in some cases may be used to identify taxa that dominated in the past.

Myxobolus cerebralis (Hofer) infection risk in native cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii (Richardson) and its relationships to tributary environments in the Yellowstone Lake Basin	JOURNAL OF FISH DISEASES												Conservation of native species is challenged by the introduction of non-native pathogens and diseases into aquatic and terrestrial environments worldwide. In the Yellowstone Lake basin, Yellowstone National Park, the invasive parasite causing salmonid whirling disease Myxobolus cerebralis (Hofer) has been identified as one factor contributing to population declines of native Yellowstone cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri (Jordan & Gilbert). In 2002 and 2003, we examined relationships between the stream environment and severity of M.cerebralis infection in native trout. Coefficients of variation of environmental features were calculated to examine variability. Ten years later, we reassessed infection levels at 22 tributaries broadly across the system. Results of principal component analysis (PCA) of physical features (2003) were negatively correlated with infection severity, mostly in lower jaw cartilage of cutthroat trout, and PCA of chemical features (and temperature) correlated with infection severity in cranial cartilage. Pelican Creek, where M.cerebralis prevalence and severity was high 2002-2003, remained high in 2012. We did not find evidence that the parasite had dispersed further within the system. Variable environmental features (physiological stress) across short spatiotemporal scales within a stream or season may possibly predispose salmonids to infection in the wild and facilitate parasite establishment.																			0140-7775	1365-2761				JUL	2015	38	7					637	652		10.1111/jfd.12280	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.12280								24953674					WOS:000355676200006

We investigated spatial overlap between predators (planktivorous fish larvae) and prey (zooplankton), and tested which physical and chemical variables of the water are related to the DVM of the studied communities. We performed nocturnal (8: 00 pm and 4: 00 am) and diurnal sampling (8: 00 am and 4: 00 pm) in the limnetic region of the lagoon for six consecutive months, from October 2010 to March 2011, which comprises the reproductive period of the fish species analyzed. During the day the larvae tried to remain aggregated in the bottom of the lagoon, whereas at night they tried to disperse in the water column. Especially for cladocerans, the diel vertical migration is an important behavior to avoid predation larvae of H. edentatus and P. squamosissimus once decreased spatial overlap between secured and its potential predators, which corroborates the hypothesis that DVM is a mechanism of predator avoidance. Although significant correlations were observed between the abiotic factors and WMD of microcrustaceans at certain times of day, the effect of predation of fish larvae on zooplankton showed more important in this environment, because the small depth and isolation not allow great variation of abiotic factors seasonally and between strata the lagoon.

Tso Lake, and Sela Lake. The focus was to carry out source apportionment using multivariate statistical analyses. PAH concentrations (& sum;PAHs) in the core sediment during the pre-monsoon were higher than the post-monsoon, suggesting an elevated sedimentation rate in the lakes. In general, low molecular weight PAHs (LMWPAHs) were more abundant than high molecular weight PAHs (Sigma PAHs) in both pre- and post-monsoon seasons in surface and core sediment samples. The 4-ring PAHs were the most profuse among all samples, followed by the 5-ring, 3-ring, and 2-ring PAHs. The average diagnostic ratio indicated that PAHs sourced from pyrogenic coal combustion, fossil fuel and diesel emissions. Metal fractionation revealed the predominant presence of Fe in all the HALs, with the highest concentration in Lake P.T. Tso. The residual fraction was highest for all HMs, except Cd, where the exchangeable fraction was prominent.

The features of the ecosystem, particularly physical and chemical elements, influence the evaluation of the quality of water resources. Lakes undergo extensive qualitative changes due to their vast amount of water. In general, these bodies of water represent geological conditions as well as water contamination produced by natural and human activities. In the present research, the prediction of the amount of phycocyanin (fPC) in the water of Lake Michigan has been implemented employing four tree-based machine learning techniques based on seasonality factors. Phycocyanin has significant effects on quality parameters such as turbidity, chlorophyll concentration, algal bloom, and dissolved oxygen in water by affecting the photosynthesis process of algae. Therefore, in this study, the prediction of the amount of phycocyanin dissolved in the lake water using the mentioned variables, along with the temperature of the water, specific conductance, and pH, has been able to interpret the quality of the water and the occurrence of phenomena such as algal blooms. The results of the models in predicting fPCs equal to 0.44 and 0.55 mu g/L were consistent with the natural conditions of the lake, and it seems that ensemble tree-based models, along with the biological index of fPC, formed the right combination of input and output parameters in modeling and obtained the lowest prediction error (root-mean-square error [RMSE] boosted trees = 0.0140 and RMSE random forests = 0.0141 mu g/L).					; Kheimi, Marwan/AAZ-4766-2021; Zounemat-Kermani, Mohammad/AAA-2946-2020; Almadani, Mohammad/AAU-1434-2021	Zounemat-Kermani, Mohammad/0000-0002-1421-8671; Almadani, Mohammad/0000-0003-2017-4932; Kheimi, Marwan/0000-0003-3962-9837; 													1936-0584	1936-0592				OCT	2024	17	7								10.1002/eco.2688	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2688		JUL 2024											WOS:001268302600001

For tropical lakes in monsoon Asia, there is currently a knowledge gap on MOB community diversity and the factors influencing their abundance. Herewith, we present a preliminary assessment of the MOB communities in three maar lakes in tropical monsoon Asia using Catalyzed Reporter Deposition, Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (CARD-FISH), 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, and pmoA gene sequencing. Correlation analysis between MOB abundances and lakes' physicochemical parameters following seasonal monsoon events were performed to explain observed spatial and temporal patterns in MOB diversity. The CARD-FISH analyses detected the three MOB types (I, II, and NC10) which aligned with the results from 16S rRNA amplicons and pmoA gene sequencing. Among community members based on 16S rRNA genes, Proteobacterial Type I MOB (e.g., Methylococcaceae and Methylomonadaceae), Proteobacterial Type II (Methylocystaceae), Verrucomicrobial (Methylacidiphilaceae), Methylomirabilota/NC10 (Methylomirabilaceae), and archaeal ANME-1a were found to be the dominant methane-oxidizers in three maar lakes. Analysis of microbial diversity and distribution revealed that the community compositions in Lake Yambo vary with the seasons and are more distinct during the stratified period. Temperature, DO, and pH were significantly and inversely linked with type I MOB and Methylomirabilota during stratification. Only MOB type I was influenced by monsoon changes. This research sought to establish a baseline for the diversity and ecology of planktonic MOB in tropical monsoon Asia to better comprehend their contribution to the CH4 cycle in tropical freshwater ecosystems.					; Papa, Rey Donne/AES-4252-2022; Austria, Eleanor/OFO-2422-2025; Wang, Ling/AGR-4917-2022	Poblete, Kamille/0009-0008-5555-2888; de Leon, Justine/0000-0002-7998-1416; 														1664-302X				JUL 9	2024	15								1410666	10.3389/fmicb.2024.1410666	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2024.1410666								39044952					WOS:001273768000001

One objective of this study was to determine if the new Spreadsheet-based Ecological Risk Assessment for the Fate of Mercury (SERAFM) model could be calibrated to the concentrations of unfiltered and dissolved total mercury, and unfiltered and dissolved MeHg in the water column for a reach on SBC and a related constructed wetland mesocosm for different seasons and residence times. SERAFM is a new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency steady state, single segment, mass balance mercury model that has been applied to lakes, and this study also examined the model's applicability for modeling an arid flowing water environment in different seasons. The average combined error between observed and model-estimated mercury concentrations was 12% and 17% for the reach and mesocosm, respectively. Some recommendations are proposed that may allow SERAFM to better model flowing systems.					; Gustin, Mae/LMP-3198-2024; Saito, Laurel/E-3096-2010	Knightes, Christopher/0000-0002-7784-5728; Saito, Laurel/0000-0003-3617-3133													0049-6979	1573-2932				JUN	2007	182	1-4					275	290		10.1007/s11270-007-9338-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-007-9338-8													WOS:000246360400024

In July 2003, an additional four birds were tagged with solar-powered PTTs. During the first two years (November 2003-October 2004), flight patterns of the tagged birds were independent. Interlake flight distances ranged from 16-441km (mean: 111.5km, n = 243), 68.3% being less than 100km and 96% less than 300km. There was no significant difference among the birds in the median length of their interlake flights. The number of days spent at each stopover ranged from 0 (less than 1d) to 153d (mean: 14.4d, n = 250). There was a significant difference among the birds in the number of days spent at each stopover. This difference was due to one very active bird that made 133 interlake flights during the period, visiting 12 different sites, spending a mean 5.2d at each site and travelling 12 600km. There was no significant difference among the other six birds. The seven birds' flights were confined to a 940km north-south range within the Great Rift Valley between Lake Logipi in northern Kenya and Bahi Swamp in central Tanzania. Their key site network consisted of eight alkaline lakes (Logipi, Bogoria, Elmenteita, Nakuru, Natron, Empakai Crater Lake, Manyara and Eyasi), and Lake Bahi, a seasonal lake in central Tanzania. The conservation status of these nine sites varies from well-protected to completely unprotected. None of the birds appears to have bred during either the 2002-2003 or the 2003-2004 breeding seasons (October-January), although other Lesser Flamingos bred at Lake Natron during both seasons, Lake Natron being the only East African site where the Lesser Flamingo has bred successfully during the past 45 years.																			0030-6525	1727-947X				JUN	2007	78	2					463	468		10.2989/OSTRICH.2007.78.2.55.135	http://dx.doi.org/10.2989/OSTRICH.2007.78.2.55.135													WOS:000248669100116

The catch itself, varying in the 1990's from 2 to 4 millions crayfish annually, is worth 4 to 8 millions euros. Crayfishing has been a crucial part of small-scale business farms with access to productive crayfish stocks. The catch has so far been mainly noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) but stockings with signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) during the past 15 years have started to produce commercial scale catches in Southern Finland. This has had a strong impact on commercial markets and has encouraged stocking of signal crayfish to an increasing number of water bodies, both legally and illegally. Noble crayfish stocks, on the other hand, have suffered from crayfish plague (Aphanomyces astaci) and watercourse construction. Up to 10 commercially productive noble crayfish stocks have been infected with crayfish plague annually. Most of the signal crayfish stocks have been infected as well, with the price being paid in loss of commercial value and even population collapse. The traditional way to catch crayfish is trapping during the crayfish season, with an increasing number of crayfish farmers competing for the same markets. Crayfish tourism is also taking its first steps, with a lot of opportunities for services targeted at urban upper class customers both in domestic and foreign markets. The future of Finnish crayfisheries remains uncertain at the moment with the following processes under way: spread of signal crayfish northwards, spread of crayfish plague, declining noble crayfish catch, restructuring of the commercial crayfish markets into several fractions, increasing demand for noble crayfish stockings, increasing demand for market size noble crayfish and demand for processed crayfish.																			0767-2861						2004		372-73					263	273		10.1051/kmae:2004001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/kmae:2004001													WOS:000226510300003
J	Hamsher, SE; Verb, RG; Vis, ML				Hamsher, SE; Verb, RG; Vis, ML			Analysis of acid mine drainage impacted streams using a periphyton index	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Fifteen stream segments in an acid mine drainage (AMD) impacted basin were sampled for periphyton, measured for water chemistry and evaluated for physical habitat in June, August and October in order to assess stream quality. Periphyton index of biotic integrity (PIBI) scores for individual stream segments varied among sampling dates, with the June and October scores being significantly different (p<0.05). The PIBI scores were correlated with six water chemistry variables in August and with at least one variable indicative of AMD in June and October. However, the PIBI scores and the individual metrics were generally not correlated to the measures of physical habitat. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMS) of water chemistry data identified four groups of streams-reference streams, heavily impacted streams, and two groups of moderately impacted streams. The same groupings were not evident in the NMS biplots of the PIBI scores, but the heavily impacted stream and reference stream groups were distinguished for the June and August data. When the PIBI scores were re-calculated using only the correlated six water chemistry variables, the NMS biplot for the August data distinguished the four groups from the water chemistry data.

J	Belayhun, M; Mekuriaw, A				Belayhun, Matiwos; Mekuriaw, Asnake			Modeling water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) distribution in Lake Tana, Ethiopia, using machine learning	REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT												Aquatic invasive plant, water hyacinth poses serious environmental and socioeconomic challenges. Understanding and predicting the spatiotemporal distribution of this species is important for reducing its environmental impact. Therefore, the present study aimed to model the distribution of water hyacinths in an important ecological region (Lake Tana) of Ethiopia using four machine learning models. We used 11 variables obtained from Sentinel-1 SAR bands, Sentinel-2A bands and indices, and bioclimate data sources. The models use 458 presence and 458 randomly generated pseudoabsence data as response variables and employ a tenfold bootstrap sampling method. The area under the curve (AUC), receiver operator curve (ROC), true skill statistics (TSS), coefficient of rank correlation (COR), sensitivity, specificity, and kappa coefficient were used to evaluate the models. The findings demonstrate that the random forest model outperforms the other models, with AUC values of 0.93 and 0.95, TSS values of 0.77 and 0.82, and kappa values of 0.76 and 0.82 in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. B12 (16% and 20%), NDWI (15% and 12%), mean annual temperature (13% and 14%), and B5 (11% and 12%) were found to be the most relevant variables during the wet and dry seasons, respectively. Water hyacinths have greater spatial coverage during the wet season than during the dry season because of high rainfall, high water levels and nutrient runoff. We can conclude that to detect and predict the spatiotemporal conditions of water hyacinth accurately, integrating Sentinel image indices and bands with bioclimatic variables and using machine learning models are crucial.

In a series of laboratory experiments, we studied the impact of an oomycete brood parasite on its Daphnia (waterflea) host. We asked whether Daphnia dump the infected brood and subsequently are able to reproduce again as was occasionally observed in a preliminary study. No viable offspring developed from infected clutches, but 78% of the infected females produced healthy offspring after releasing the infected brood while molting. Neither those offsprings' development success nor their mothers' reproductive potential was affected by the brood parasite. However, infected Daphnia had a reduced life-span and suffered an increased susceptibility to another parasite, an unidentified bacterium. Additionally, we studied the prevalence of this brood parasite and the unidentified bacterium in a natural Daphnia assemblage in a pre-alpine lake, across changing demographic and environmental conditions. The brood parasite epidemic seemed to be host-density dependent. Our results show that the brood parasite's impact on the host population is enhanced when combined with the unidentified bacterium.					; Wolinska, Justyna/N-6455-2014	Tellenbach, Christoph/0000-0002-9088-2187; Wolinska, Justyna/0000-0003-2913-2923; 													0029-8549	1432-1939				NOV	2007	154	2					369	375		10.1007/s00442-007-0826-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-007-0826-8								17713791					WOS:000250787000012

Biological availability and humic properties of dissolved organic carbon in Lake Balaton (Hungary)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The biological availability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was experimentally studied in water samples collected at the mouth of the River Zala and in the western and eastern basin of Lake Balaton (Hungary) in four seasons. The water samples were filter-sterilized and inoculated with the in situ bacterial population. The concentration of fulvic and humic acids were analyzed at the beginning of the experiment. The bacterioplankton biomass and DOC concentration were measured on day 0 and 28. The decrease in the DOC concentration and the ratio of the bacterial C/initial DOC concentration showed the microbial utilization of DOC. No seasonal changes in DOC availability were found at any of the sampling stations. The DOC bioavailability was higher in the river than in the lake water. A strong positive correlation was found between the bioavailability and the humic properties of DOC. The observed changes in the organic matter composition of Lake Balaton support the view that much of the not readily utilizable `refractory' DOM resides in the non-humic pool in standing waters.

J	Margenau, TL; Gilbert, SJ; Hatzenbeler, GR				Margenau, TL; Gilbert, SJ; Hatzenbeler, GR			Angler catch and harvest of northern pike in northern Wisconsin lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												We used creel surveys from 55 northern Wisconsin lakes during the period 19901999 to characterize the sport fishery for northern pike Esox lucius. The northern pike daily creel limit on all lakes was five fish of any size (no length limit). Creel surveys were conducted both during the open-water and ice fishing seasons. Directed effort (anglers specifically fishing for a certain species) for northern pike was 5.5 h/acre for open-water fishing and 3.9 h/acre for ice fishing. A greater percentage of all anglers directed effort toward northern pike during ice fishing (mean, 31%) than toward open-water fishing (mean, 11.9%). Directed catch rates for northern pike were highest during the open-water fishery. Open-water directed catch rates averaged 0.31 fish/h, compared with 0.20 fish/h for ice anglers. However, releases of living northern pike exceeded 80% during the open-water fishery but were less than 50% during the ice fishery, resulting in higher harvest rates for ice fishing. Ice fishing harvest rates for northern pike averaged 0.11 fish/h, compared with 0.06 fish/h for open-water fishing. Most northern pike harvested during both fisheries were 18.0-23.9 in (total length). The ice fishery harvested a greater proportion of northern pike 24.0-27.9 in, but the harvest of large northern pike ( greater than or equal to28.0 in) was similar in both fisheries. Angling pressure for northern pike did not increase during the 1990s in a subsample of seven lakes where creel surveys were conducted two times between 1990 and 1999. However, catch rates in these seven lakes nearly doubled from 0.20 to 0.37 fish/h, largely the result of increases from open-water angling.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				FEB	2003	23	1					307	312		10.1577/1548-8675(2003)023<0307:ACAHON>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(2003)023<0307:ACAHON>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000181587400030
J	Fricker, PD; Nepf, HM				Fricker, PD; Nepf, HM			Bathymetry, stratification, and internal seiche structure	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS												Internal seiches play a significant role in a broad range of physical, chemical, and biological processes in lakes. A detailed assessment of the impact of seiching requires an understanding of seiche structure, which is determined by bathymetry and stratification. In this study, internal seiche solutions are evaluated for arbitrary bathymetry and continuous stratification using a two-dimensional numerical model. Formulated in terms of a stream function, the model produces a finite set of linear internal wave eigenmodes and allows the computation of the complete velocity field (over a grid) associated with each seiche mode. Several idealized configurations of continuous stratification and variable bathymetry are used to explore the effect of nonuniform systems on internal wave structure. In particular, we focus on bed velocity distribution and the resulting potential impact on scalar fluxes, sediment transport, and internal wave damping. Model results are also compared to thermistor chain data collected in the Upper Mystic Lake (UML, Winchester, Massachusetts). Using an idealized description of the UML bathymetry and density profiles which emulate the seasonal variation of stratification in the lake, the evolution of bed velocities during the autumnal breakdown in stratification is assessed, providing insight into the fate of the contaminants entering the lake.

Among these changes, the basin area has decreased, and water levels have dropped. This paper focuses on a comprehensive analysis of the spatial variation of key climate parameters, such as temperature, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration over the Aral Sea. Moreover, we examined the transformation of seasonal water areas in the Aral Sea during the growing and non-growing seasons between 2002 and 2017 and the influence of climate and human factors on these changes using Landsat satellite data. Our results indicate that the western section of the Aral Sea has experienced a reduction in water area by 2.41 km2 and 1.83 km2 during the warm (R2 = 0.789) and cold (R2 = 0.744) seasons, respectively, over the investigated period. The decrease in lake water volume during the warm season can be attributed to local climate variations, as a strong negative correlation exists between seasonal water storage change and temperature (potential evapotranspiration). The correlation analysis shows that the water change in the northern part of the Aral Sea during the growing season has a significant positive correlation with temperature (R = 0.52) and an insignificant negative correlation with precipitation (R = -0.22). On the contrary, in the west and east parts of the Aral Sea, there is a significant negative correlation with temperature (R = -0.71 and -0.62) and a high positive correlation with precipitation (R = 0.71 and 0.55) during the growing season.

Here, we present a novel and efficient analytically based retracking approach for estimating LIT from high-resolution Ku-band (13.6 GHz) synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) altimetry data. The retracker method is based on the analytical modeling of the SAR radar echoes over ice-covered lakes that show a characteristic double-peak feature attributed to the reflection of the Ku-band radar waves at the snow-ice and ice-water interfaces. The method is applied to Sentinel-6 Unfocused SAR (UFSAR) and Fully Focused SAR (FFSAR) data, with their corresponding tailored waveform model, referred to as the SAR_LIT and FFSAR_LIT retracker, respectively. We found that LIT retrievals from Sentinel-6 high-resolution SAR data at different posting rates are fully consistent with the LIT estimations obtained from thermodynamic lake ice model simulations and from low-resolution mode (LRM) Sentinel-6 and Jason-3 data over two ice seasons during the tandem phase of the two satellites, demonstrating the continuity between LRM and SAR LIT retrievals. By comparing the Sentinel-6 SAR LIT estimates to optical/radar images, we found that the Sentinel-6 LIT measurements are fully consistent with the evolution of the lake surface conditions, accurately capturing the seasonal transitions of ice formation and melt. The uncertainty in the LIT estimates obtained with Sentinel-6 UFSAR data at 20 Hz is in the order of 5 cm, meeting the GCOS requirements for LIT measurements. This uncertainty is significantly smaller, by a factor of 2 to 3 times, than the uncertainty obtained with LRM data. The FFSAR processing at 140 Hz provides even better LIT estimates, with 20% smaller uncertainties. The LIT retracker analysis performed on data at the higher posting rate (140 Hz) shows increased performance in comparison to the 20 Hz data, especially during the melt transition period, due to the increased statistics. The LIT analysis has been performed over two representative lakes, Great Slave Lake and Baker Lake (Canada), demonstrating that the results are robust and hold for lake targets that differ in terms of size, bathymetry, snow/ice properties, and seasonal evolution of LIT. The SAR LIT retrackers presented are promising tools for monitoring the inter-annual variability and trends in LIT from current and future SAR altimetry missions.					; Duguay, Claude/G-5682-2011	Donlon, Craig/0000-0002-7359-0115; Mangilli, Anna/0000-0002-4457-3690; Duguay, Claude/0000-0002-1044-5850														2072-4292				JUL	2024	16	14							2510	10.3390/rs16142510	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16142510													WOS:001277513300001
J	Wilcox, JD; Stark, KA; Svetlov, R				Wilcox, Jeffrey D.; Stark, Karen Ann; Svetlov, Ruth			Estimating stream sediment loads to assess management options for a Southern Appalachian mountain lake	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Enka Lake is a 25-ha reservoir in the Southern Appalachian mountains surrounded by the Biltmore Lake residential neighborhood. The aesthetic and recreational value of Enka Lake can be negatively affected by turbid water and sediment buildup, resulting from stormwater originating upstream in its 15.38 km2 watershed. In this study, we monitored streamflow and sediment loads for nearly 2 years to better understand sedimentation dynamics and evaluate management options. We collected nearly 500 water samples throughout the watershed, focusing on two tributaries that provide the majority of streamflow into Enka Lake. During baseflow conditions, those tributaries are very clear (turbidity ranging from 1 to 20 NTU), but sediment-laden stormflow (turbidity > 1000 NTU) from dirt roads, gravel driveways, and poorly vegetated yards is common and, during extreme storm events, causes lake discoloration. Discharge-sediment data pairs were used to construct sediment rating curves and estimate sediment fluxes through these tributaries. The predicted sediment fluxes were tested with high-frequency sampling during and after three storms in different seasons; predicted values underestimated the peak sediment fluxes (0-400%) but generally matched total measured sediment loads. Estimates of annual sediment load from the two tributaries (540-900 tonnes/year) suggest that a dredging effort commissioned by the neighborhood association in 2016 may have removed only about 1-3 years' worth of sediment. Installing sediment forebays or other retention structures is likely the preferred sediment management strategy moving forward (over a regular dredging schedule) since they can be maintained more easily without affecting lake levels. Designing these retention structures will benefit from the estimates of stormflow and sediment fluxes, and the study design presented here-including the help of community-based volunteer samplers-provides a model that could be used at other sites in the Southern Appalachians and elsewhere.

J	Changnon, SA				Changnon, SA			Urban modification of freezing-rain events	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY												A new national database for freezing-rain occurrences during the 1945-2000 period provided an opportunity for a study of the potential urban effects on freezing-rain events. Numerous past studies of snowfall events in urban areas have defined decreases of 10%-35% related to the urban heat island. The heat island, which acts to elevate near-surface temperatures, could also keep some freezing-rain situations from occurring in the city. The study involved four cities in the Midwest and Northeast for which the average annual number of days with freezing rain are three or more, for which data from in-city stations existed, and for which data for several surrounding rural stations existed. The two largest qualifying cities, New York City, New York, and Chicago, Illinois, had sizable reductions in average and maximum annual freezing-rain-day frequencies, ranging from 16% to 43% less than values of surrounding rural stations, and their freezing-rain "seasons'' were 1-2 months shorter than those in surrounding rural areas. The ocean/lake influences at both cities, along with the heat island, also helped to reduce the local incidence of freezing-rain events. Two qualifying smaller urban areas, Washington, District of Columbia, and St. Louis, Missouri, had reductions in freezing-rain-day occurrences but had no shifts in the length of their freezing-rain seasons. Results suggest that freezing-rain occurrences in large cities are decreased between 10% and 30% by the heat island, which acts to keep rain from freezing to urban surfaces.																			0894-8763					JUN	2003	42	6					863	870		10.1175/1520-0450(2003)042<0863:UMOFE>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/1520-0450(2003)042<0863:UMOFE>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000183151500015

Operational effects on aquatic carbon dioxide and methane emissions from the Belo Monte hydropower plant in the Xingu River, eastern Amazonia	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Operational demands and the natural inflow of water actively drive biweekly fluctuations in water levels in hydropower reservoirs. These daily to weekly fluctuations could have major effects on methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions via release of bubbles from reservoir bottom sediments (ebullition) or organic matter inputs, respectively. The impact of transient fluctuations in water levels on GHG emissions is poorly understood and particularly so in tropical run-of-the-river reservoirs. These reservoirs, characterized by high temperatures and availability of labile organic matter, are usually associated with extensive CH4 generation within bottom sediments. The aim of this study is to determine how water level fluctuations resulting from the operation of the Belo Monte hydropower plant on the Xingu River, eastern Amazon River Basin, affect local CO2 and CH4 emissions. Between February and December 2022, we monitored weekly fluxes and water concentrations of CO2 and CH4 in a site on the margin of the Xingu reservoir. Throughout the study period, fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were 118 +/- 137 and 3.62 +/- 8.47 mmol m- 2 d-1 (average +/- 1SD) while concentrations were 59 +/- 29.77 and 0.30 +/- 0.12 mu M, respectively. The fluxes and water concentrations of CO2 were clearly correlated with the upstream discharge, and the variation observed was more closely associated with a seasonal pattern than with biweekly fluctuations in water level. However, CH4 fluxes were significantly correlated with biweekly water level fluctuations. The variations observed in CH4 fluxes occurred especially during the high-water season (February-April), when biweekly water level fluctuations were frequent and had higher amplitude, which increased CH4 ebullition. Reducing water level fluctuations during the high-water season could decrease ebullitive pulses and, consequently, total flux of CH4 (TFCH4) in the reservoir margins. This study underscores the critical role of water level fluctuations in near-shore CH4 emissions within tropical reservoirs and highlights significant temporal variability. However, additional research is necessary to understand how these findings can be applied across different spatial scales.

Using the ICON-Earth System Model, we show that a large-scale thaw of essentially impervious frozen soil layers may cause a positive feedback by which permafrost degradation amplifies the causative warming. The thawing of the ground increases its hydraulic connectivity and raises drainage rates which facilitates a drying of the landscapes. This limits evapotranspiration and the formation of low-altitude clouds during the snow-free season. A decrease in summertime cloudiness, in turn, increases the shortwave radiation reaching the surface, hence, temperatures and advances the permafrost degradation. Our simulations further suggest that the consequences of a permafrost cloud feedback may not be limited to the regional scale. For a near-complete loss of the high-latitude permafrost, they show significant temperature impacts on all continents and northern-hemisphere ocean basins that raise the global mean temperature by 0.25 K. Landscapes in the Arctic and subarctic zone are often very wet with highly water saturated soils and an extensive lake- and wetland cover. To some extent, this is due to the perennially frozen soil layers that underlay large parts of these regions and inhibit the movement of water through the ground. Thus, a thawing of the frozen soils, caused by rising temperatures, may ultimately lead to a drying of the landscapes. Here, we use simulations with the ICON-Earth System Model to show that such a drying increases regional temperatures via an atmospheric feedback: During the warm season, dryer conditions at the surface reduce the moisture transport into the atmosphere. This decreases the relative humidity in the boundary layer and the low-altitude cloud cover. Since clouds reflect more sunlight than the snow-free land surface, the reduced cloudiness increases the available energy, hence, temperatures and advances the thawing of the ground. Higher temperatures in the Arctic and subarctic zone, in turn, have important consequences for the net energy exchange between equatorial and polar regions. Thus, the effects of a large-scale drying of high-latitude soils may not be limited to the regional scale but could notably increase global mean temperatures. Advanced degradation of permafrost may facilitate large-scale landscape drying Dependency of clouds on terrestrial hydrology allows for feedback between permafrost thaw, diminished cloudiness and rising temperatures This feedback could amplify global warming notably					; Brovkin, Victor/C-2803-2016	de Vrese, Philipp/0000-0002-8813-7436; Brovkin, Victor/0000-0001-6420-3198; Stacke, Tobias/0000-0003-4637-5337													0094-8276	1944-8007				JUN 28	2024	51	12							e2024GL109034	10.1029/2024GL109034	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2024GL109034													WOS:001246236200001

Asymmetrical food web responses in trophic-level richness, biomass, and function following lake acidification	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												We tested for disproportional changes in annual and seasonal species richness and biomass among five trophic levels (phytoplankton, herbivorous, omnivorous, and carnivorous zooplankton, and fish) as well as altered trophic structure and ecosystem function following the 5-year experimental acidification of Little Rock Lake (Wisconsin, USA) from pH 6.1 to 4.7. Abiotic and biotic controls of trophic level response during acidification were also identified. Asymmetric reductions of species richness among trophic levels, separated by life stage and feeding type, were evident and changes in trophic structure were most pronounced by the end of the acidification period. Relative declines in richness of fish and zooplankton were greater than phytoplankton, which were generally unaffected, leading to a reduction of upper trophic level diversity. Each of the lower four trophic levels responded to a distinct combination of abiotic and biotic variables during acidification. pH was identified as a direct driver of change for only carnivorous zooplankton, while all other trophic levels were affected more by indirect interactions caused by acidification. Fluctuations in ecosystem function (zooplankton biomass and primary production) were also evident, with losses at all trophic levels only detected during the last year of acidification. The acidified basin displayed a tendency for greater variation in biomass for upper trophic levels relative to reference conditions implying greater unpredictability in ecosystem function. Together, these results suggest that trophic asymmetry may be an important and recurring feature of ecosystem response to anthropogenic stress.

PLANT AND SOIL												Nitrogen (N)-deficiency and lack of phosphorus (P) availability are major constraints to maize yields in Western Kenya. In a two-season field study in the lake Victoria basin, we tested the capacity of white lupin (Lupinus albus (L.), cv. Ultra), as a nitrogen-fixing crop with a highly efficient P-acquisition capacity, to increase maize yields when used as a companion or cover crop, or as a source of organic matter. Each experiment was performed on three different fields (Vertisols) differing in N/P availability, previous cropping history and in levels of infestation by the parasitic weed Striga hermonthica (Del.) Benth. Our results show that white lupin led to significantly higher yields of maize when used as a cover crop. When lupin was grown as a companion crop, it also slightly enhanced the yield of the co-cultivated maize. When lupin shoots were incorporated to the soil, the positive effect of lupin on maize growth was field-dependent and only occurred in the field most heavily infested with S. hermonthica. Despite the beneficial impact on maize yield, no clear effect of lupin on soil N and P availability or on maize N/P uptake were observed. In contrast, lupin significantly inhibited infestation of maize by S. hermonthica: when lupin was grown together with maize in pots inoculated with S. hermonthica, the emergence of the weed was strongly reduced compared to the pots with maize only. This work opens a new range of questions for further research on white lupin and its potential beneficial impact as a S. hermonthica-inhibiting crop.

The goals of this study were to determine the effectiveness of the wetland treatment technology in reducing contaminants in polluted natural water body and to characterize bacterial composition present in 3 constructed wetlands. Water samples were collected periodically for 12 months from three wetlands to determine the efficiency of the treatment system in removal of chemical pollutants. The reduction by the treatment was greatest for chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen and total phosphorus, but the removal of nutrients obviously varied with seasons. Plant uptake was highly responsible for nitrogen and phosphor-us removal. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to study the diversity of microbial community in the constructed wetland. Changes in the total bacterial community and ammonia-oxidizing bacterial composition were examined by DGGE and sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified fragments of the gene carrying the ammonia monooxygenase subunit A gene (amoA) recovered from matrix samples and DGGE bands. DGGE analysis of wetlands samples revealed that seasonal change had an effect on the diversity and composition of microbial communities in constructed wetlands. The sequence analysis showed ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in constructed wetlands were uncultivable and the population of AOB had a higher percentage of Nitrosomonas-like sequences from wetlands, while no Nitrosospira-like sequences were found.

However, a thorough understanding of the distribution patterns and ecological processes that shape the ARGs profile in interconnected river-lake systems remains largely unexplored. In this study, we collected paired water and sediment samples from a typical interconnected river-lake system, Dongting Lake in China, during both wet and dry seasons. Using high-throughput quantitative PCR, we investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of ARGs and the factors that influence them. A total of 8 major antibiotic classes and 10 mobile genetic elements were detected across the Dongting Lake basin. The unique hydrological characteristics of this interconnected river-lake system result in a relatively stable abundance of ARGs across different seasons and interfaces. During the wet season, deterministic processes dominated the assembly of ARGs, allowing environmental factors, such as heavy metals, to serve as main driving forces of ARGs distribution. When the dry season arrived, variations in hydrological conditions and changes in ARGs sources caused stochastic processes to					Liu, Xiaoyang/JUV-8314-2023; Li, Xiang-Long/AAP-5353-2020														0048-9697	1879-1026				OCT 10	2024	946								173926	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173926	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173926		JUN 2024						38906289					WOS:001261839200001
J	Hu, WQ; Hui, DF; Huangfu, CH				Hu, Wuqiong; Hui, Dafeng; Huangfu, Chaohe			Soil water status dominates growth and nitrogen acquisition strategy of Carex thunbergii in response to nitrogen and water additions	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												PurposeSubtropical lake riparian ecosystems experience seasonal water table fluctuations and increased nitrogen (N) deposition with changing N composition. However, the interplay of soil water content (SWC), N deposition chemical composition, and their interaction on plant growth through regulating N acquisition remains poorly understood. MethodsIn this controlled experiment with a sedge species Carex thunbergii, we investigated two treatment factors: (1) SWC at 100%, 60%, and 30% of field capacity, combined with (2) N treatments with NH4+:NO3- ratios of 1:3, 2:2, and 3:1. Treatment verifications were conducted using 15N isotope tracer ((NH4NO3)-N-15 and (NH4NO3)-N-15) technology. ResultsResults showed a notable trend of reduced biomass of C. thunbergii with increasing NH4+: NO3- ratio, especially under high SWC conditions. This negative effect of a high NH4+: NO3- ratio on plant biomass accumulation also aligned with reduced N use efficiency (NUE). Conversely, C. thunbergii exhibited accelerated N uptake with increasing SWC, with the most pronounced response observed in the treatment of NH4+: NO3- ratio of 3:1. Principal component analyses provided evidence for SWC-dominated functional coordination between plant below- and aboveground parts in mediating plant N acquisition, while correlation analyses revealed that NUE mainly contributed to belowground productivity of C. thunbergii. ConclusionsOur findings suggest that manipulating water table (as a proxy of SWC) and managing soil NH4+: NO3- ratios could optimize the productivity of this sedge species in riparian ecosystem. The coordination of leaf-root trait highlights the necessity to integrate above- and belowground traits for a comprehensive understanding of plant N acquisition strategies. Understanding plant N acquisition and use efficiency may help us better predict the potential impacts of future climate change components on ecosystem functions.

Ponds within lowland artificial watersheds (polders) play a critical role in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling. From the perspective of N & P control in management practices, it is needed to determine an optimal pond area ratio for polders. For this purpose, our study proposed a process-based modelling framework to investigate the response of polder N & P loss to pond area, and thus to determine the threshold value of pond area ratio to achieve maximum N & P reduction for polders. The proposed framework included two process-based models (NDP and PDP) specially developed to describe N & P dynamics in lowland polders. To evaluate the proposed performance of the framework, it was applied to 171 polders in Zhong River Watershed in Lake Taihu Basin, eastern China. Our investigation results revealed that the correlation between polder N & P reduction rate and pond area ratio had an abrupt shift of 13.6 %, 14.7 % for N & P, respectively. Therefore, polders with a pond area ratio of 13.6-14.7 % had the largest N & P reduction (5.27 and 0.19 kg/ha). Polder size affected P reduction rate, with smaller polders (<200 ha) showing a higher P reduction rate, while it did not affect N reduction rate. Compared with annual precipitation, rainy-season precipitation more significantly (P<0.01) determined polder N & P reduction. This study demonstrated the use of our process-based framework in characterizing the shifts for the pond area ratio for polders, and thus provided technical support for N & P control of lowland areas in water management practices.

J	Ficken, CD; Menges, E				Ficken, Cari D.; Menges, Eric			Seasonal wetlands on the Lake Wales Ridge, Florida: does a relict seed bank persist despite long term disturbance?	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Wetlands maintain biodiversity and provide numerous ecosystem services, so the pressure to perform successful restoration consequently is high. However, restoration projects rarely include an in-depth assessment of wetland potential for recovery, and restoration techniques may not be tailored to site-specific concerns. This study examined the seed bank of disturbed wetlands slotted for hydrologic, but not vegetation, restoration to determine if a seed bank comparable to that of nearby undisturbed wetlands persisted despite long-term anthropogenic disturbance. We compared the aboveground vegetation and seed bank compositions under drained, drawdown, and flooded conditions between undisturbed and historically ditched ("disturbed") wetlands. Disturbed and undisturbed wetlands shared fewer than 30 % of total aboveground species. While undisturbed wetlands were dominated by graminoids, disturbed wetlands had greater cover of forbs. The seed banks of disturbed wetlands had high species diversity, but their composition was dissimilar to that of nearby undisturbed wetlands. In total, the seed banks of both disturbance histories germinated 56 species; drained conditions had the fewest germinants while flooded conditions had the most. Germinant richness was significantly affected by disturbance, moisture, and their interaction; evenness was significantly affected by moisture, and Shannon diversity by disturbance. Because the seed bank of disturbed wetlands included many fast-growing wetland plants, passive vegetation restoration and active hydrologic restoration may result in wetlands overgrown with weedy species and with fewer conservative wetland plants. An understanding of the capacity for seed banks to re-vegetate wetlands post-restoration and approximate undisturbed wetlands is crucial to the overall success of restoration projects.

Mallard Survival and Nesting Ecology in the Lower Great Lakes Region, New York	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN												Ecology of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) breeding in the Lower Great Lakes Region of the United States has not been investigated as comprehensively as mid-continent populations of this species. We studied mallard breeding ecology in the Cowaselon Creek Watershed Area in New York during 2003-2004. Daily and 100-day breeding season survival of female mallards (n = 41) was 0.997 and 0.782, respectively, and was positively influenced by female age and body mass at time of capture. Eight radiomarked female mallards were killed by either mammalian or avian predators. Earliest and latest nest initiation dates were 14 April and 24 May 2003-2004, respectively, and females initiated nests in wetlands 10 days earlier than in uplands. Overall, average clutch size was 9.4 +/- 0.32 eggs (SE), and probability of reproductive success of females was 0.27, with nest success in wetlands and uplands of 0.71 and 0.42, respectively. Daily and 35-day nest success was 0.968 and 0.326, respectively. We found an estimated 70% of all initiated nests prior to clutch destruction or hatch; thus, our estimates of nesting and re-nesting effort may be biased low. Survival of breeding females and nest success were comparable or exceeded parameter estimates from other regions of the mallard breeding range. We suggest that wetland and upland habitats are both important to nesting mallards in New York and elsewhere in the Lower Great Lakes Region.

The deceptively complicated "elevation ordinary high water mark" and the problem with using it on a Laurentian Great Lakes shore	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												In 2013 the Laurentian Great Lakes are at historically low levels; but they will undoubtedly rise again as they always have in an ongoing pattern of seasonal, annual and decadal fluctuations. Those fluctuations, coupled with other physical dynamics unique to the Great Lakes system, will continue to shift shorelines lake-ward and land-ward dramatically over time, perhaps more so because of increased storminess from climate change. These shifting shores implicate legal doctrines that attempt to balance public interests and private property rights at the shore, and they complicate the Great Lakes states' efforts to effectively and fairly manage their Great Lakes shorelands. One challenge comes from using an elevation-based standard to mark ordinary high water, a method that is difficult conceptually to administer and that yields multiple marks over time. We describe briefly Great Lakes shoreline dynamics and the application of state Public Trust Doctrines to those shorelines, and we discuss in detail recent litigation in Michigan regarding use of an elevation-based standard to mark ordinary high water, illustrating the inherent problems with that standard. We conclude that the elevation-based standard should be abandoned, or if not abandoned applied in a manner to adequately safeguard public trust shorelands.

Comparison of vertical mobile hydroacoustic survey strategies for monitoring fish distributions in the Gironde estuary (France)	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												Today, hydroacoustic technologies are able to monitor fish populations and assess fish biomass by providing data of a high spatio-temporal resolution, and without damaging the environment. Such techniques are widely used in lakes and marine environments, but they remain much less tested in shallow waters - especially in estuarine habitats. Our study was carried out using a strictly methodological approach. This was necessary in order to take into account the highly changeable nature of the ecosystem in question. Hydroacoustic surveys were conducted in the mesohaline part of the Gironde estuary using SIMRAD EK60 split-beam echosounders, operating simultaneously at two frequencies (70 kHz and 120 kHz). Different mobile hydroacoustic surveys were tested in different seasons, with vertical acquisition, in order to compare variability of results due to the sampling strategy, and to validate the relevance of our design by repeating the surveys. The results obtained on survey design choices gave similar outcomes when sampling was carried out with or against the current and between two mobile designs. The comparison between flood and ebb tides gave different results from one day to another but we observed the same evolution for each flood tide or for each ebb tide on several successive days. This acoustic study in the Gironde estuary was used to validate a reliable sampling mobile design. It is the first step in the process of gaining a better understanding of estuarine ecosystems, an understanding that will be enhanced by combining our data with data from a variety of other sources.

Positive results from these methods purport to show, respectively, actively respiring bacteria (CTC+), cells with intact nucleoids (NuCC), and cells with intact membranes (MEM+). Concomitantly, bacterial metabolic activity was measured as electron transport system (ETS) flux, O-2 uptake, activities of peptidase, beta -glucosidase and Lipase, and rate of leucine incorporation in monthly samples taken for 2.5 yr at a pelagic lake station. Laboratory experiments followed changes during 22 or 40 h in the percentages of 'active' bacteria in GF/C-filtered lake water with or without substrate enrichment or antibiotic inhibitors of cell division, or with bacterivorous protists. In lake samples, each of the staining methods detected different aspects of cellular state or metabolic activity but all 3 indicated low percentages of 'active' bacteria relative to total bacterial abundance. CTC+ ranged from 1.0 to 27.3% (average 5.1%), NuCC from 1.4 to 42.9% (average 8.3 %) and MEM+ from 1.0 to 29.9 % (average 8.8 %), with no clear seasonal or spatial patterns. No significant correlations were found between the proportions of 'active' bacteria in lake water as determined by these methods, although such correlations were observed in the laboratory experiments. Significant correlations were obtained between ETS and O-2 uptake, peptidase and P-glucosidase, and between leucine incorporation and peptidase. ETS was significantly correlated with CTC+ and NuCC cell abundance, but not with total bacteria (DAPI counts). In contrast, peptidase activity correlated with total bacterial counts. Results of time course experiments indicated that some bacteria which initially appear to be inactive can become active when stimulated by substrate addition, even though cell division is inhibited. Grazing by protists increased the percentage of active bacteria, at least during the active predator-prey phase. Our data support the hypothesis that in natural waters usually only a small fraction (probably <20 %) of the entire bacterial assemblage is strongly active metabolically at any given time. This proportion may increase dramatically with localized substrate inputs. The concept of bacterial assemblages, heterogeneous not only in terms of phylotype, but also in terms of levels of metabolic activity will need to be considered in future aquatic ecosystem models.																			0948-3055					FEB 28	2001	23	3					213	224		10.3354/ame023213	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame023213													WOS:000167636500001

Importance of Canals for Florida Largemouth Bass: Lake Griffin, Florida	JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Canal systems are commonly found across the country and are rarely constructed to increase fish habitat or angling opportunities. From 2009 to 2011, we assessed the benefits of canals to the fishery at Lake Griffin, Florida, by measuring and comparing the Florida Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides floridanus population and angler use to the main lake. We used electrofishing, angler creel surveys, and a high-reward tagging study. Results from electrofishing surveys revealed a high relative abundance of Florida Largemouth Bass in the canals, with similar electrofishing catch rates and size structure to those in the main lake. The canal creel showed that anglers used canals throughout the study, with peak use during the spawning season. The tagging study revealed anglers caught Florida Largemouth Bass in canals throughout the 12-mo study and that Florida Largemouth Bass migrated between the lake and canals. We conclude that the canals support a significant portion of the overall angler effort for the Lake Griffin fishery. Failing to consider the canals at Lake Griffin results in substantial underestimates of fish populations, angler use, and the fishery's economic impact. Our data suggest, however, that monitoring only the lake section still may represent trends occurring throughout the entire body of water, resulting in lowering sampling time and financial requirements. Fishery managers can identify any impacts canal systems or other lake sections may have to the fishery by including additional sections of a body of water into their sampling protocol.																			1944-687X					JUN	2017	8	1					59	68		10.3996/082016-JFWM-061	http://dx.doi.org/10.3996/082016-JFWM-061													WOS:000403145300005

C.; Couture, Patrice			ENZYMATIC CORRELATES OF ENERGY STATUS IN WILD YELLOW PERCH INHABITING CLEAN AND CONTAMINATED ENVIRONMENTS	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Enzymes representing a variety of metabolic pathways were examined in yellow perch (Perca flavescens) collected from a metal-contaminated region (Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, Canada) to determine which were most closely related to fish condition factor, pyloric caeca weight, and visceral lipid accumulation, as well to seek a better understanding of the influence of metal contamination on the physiology and biometrics of perch. Compared to laboratory fish, wild perch were under important energy restrictions. The condition factor of wild fish was correlated with indicators of aerobic metabolism (citrate synthase, cytochrome C oxidase), protein anabolism (nucleoside diphosphokinase), and indicators of lipid accumulation (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, visceral lipid index). Pyloric caeca weights were well correlated with indicators of protein anabolism, but only when both seasons were examined together, possibly indicating a lag in the response of enzymes to changes in diet. The addition of contaminant stress to existing energy restrictions led to changes in the relationships between enzymes and biometrics, reducing the predictive power of the models for perch in contaminated lakes. The present study broadens our knowledge of the impact of metal contamination on energy accumulation and tissue metabolic capacities in wild perch. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2011;30:2148-2156.

A multi-variate methodology for analyzing pre-existing lake water quality data	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING												Environmental agencies are given the task of monitoring water quality in rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water, for the purpose of comparing the results with regulatory standards. Monitoring follows requirements set by regulations, and data are collected in a systematic way for the intended purpose. Monitoring enables agencies to determine whether water bodies are polluted. Much effort is spent per monitoring event, resulting in hundreds of data points typically used solely for comparison with regulatory standards and then stored for little further use. This paper devises a data analysis methodology that can make use of the pre-existing datasets to extract more useful information on water quality trends, without new sample collection and analysis. In this paper, measured lake water quality data are subjected to statistical analyses including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to deduce changes in water quality spatially and temporally over several years. It was found that the lake as a whole changed temporally by season, rather than spatially. Storm events caused the greatest shifts in water quality, though the shifts were fairly consistent across sampling stations. This methodology can be applied to similar datasets, especially with the recent emphasis by the U.S. EPA on protection of lakes as water sources. Water quality managers using these techniques may be able to lower their monitoring costs by eliminating redundant water quality parameters found in this analysis.																			1464-0325					SEP	2011	13	9					2477	2487		10.1039/c1em10119f	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1em10119f								21799998					WOS:000294436200014

In this study, volume-depth-based water storage estimation models were proposed for individual lakes and reservoirs in the Iberian Peninsula using the 30-year Global Water Surface dataset and reservoir morphometry methodology which enables to evaluate reservoirs where data were not available before. The models were subsequently implemented within the new hydropower model called LISENGY that provides the first comprehensive assessment of the temporal and spatial dynamics of water storage, water depth and hydropower production in the Iberian Peninsula. The LISENGY model was coupled with the distributed LISFLOOD hydrological model. The seasonal and interannual changes in energy production were assessed for 168 studied reservoirs with diverse morphometries, which is unique. Conical, concave and convex regression reservoir relationships were distinguished, and optimized turbine discharge and power production were computed. A 10-year water-energy linked system for the 2007-2016 period has been established for the Iberian Peninsula which was not available before. The results showed that it is possible to connect those two models and that the timing and magnitude of simulated storage were well reproduced. The study represents the first step towards integrated pan-European water-energy modeling. Future climate scenarios and energy demands are to be fed into the linked model system to evaluate expected future hydropower generation and possible water scarcity issues.

J	Gustafson, KE; Dickhut, RM				Gustafson, KE; Dickhut, RM			Distribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in southern Chesapeake Bay surface water: Evaluation of three methods for determining freely dissolved water concentrations	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY												Gas sparging, semipermeable-membrane devices (SPMDs), and filtration with sorption of dissolved polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to XAD-2 resin were evaluated for determining the concentrations of freely dissolved PAHs in estuarine waters of southern Chesapeake Bay at sites ranging from rural to urban and highly industrialized. Gas sparging had significant sampling artifacts due to particle scavenging by rising bubbles, and SPMDs were kinetically limited for four-ring and larger PAHs relative to short-term temporal changes in water concentrations. Filtration with sorption of the dissolved contaminant fraction to XAD-2 resin was found to be the most accurate and feasible method for determining concentrations of freely dissolved PAHs in estuarine water. Concentrations and distribution coefficients of dissolved and particulate PAHs were measured using the filtration/XAD-2 method. Concentrations of PAHs in surface waters of southern Chesapeake Bay were higher than those reported for the northern bay; concentrations in the Elizabeth River were elevated relative to all Ether sites. A gradient for particulate PAHs was observed from urban to remote sites. No seasonal trends were observed in dissolved or particle-bound PAH fractions at any site. Distributions of dissolved and particulate PAHs in surface waters of the Chesapeake Bay are near equilibrium at all locations and during all seasons.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				MAR	1997	16	3					452	461		10.1002/etc.5620160310	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620160310													WOS:A1997WN50800010
J	Gardner, JT; English, MC; Prowse, TD				Gardner, J. T.; English, M. C.; Prowse, T. D.			Wind-forced seiche events on Great Slave Lake: hydrologic implications for the Slave River Delta, NWT, Canada	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												A limited amount of research has focused on northern lacustrine deltas and the impacts of basin processes prevalent at these deltas. Wind-forced seiche events have received little focus in deltaic studies. The Slave River Delta, located on the south shore of Great Slave Lake (GSL), NWT, is an ideal environment to study the prevalence of wind-forced seiche events and the impact of seiche events on the hydrodynamics of the delta. This paper presents an historical analysis of seiche activity on GSL and the effect of seiches on water levels of the Slave River Delta. The seasonality, frequency, and magnitude of seiche events on the lake are quantified. A description of the wind characteristics that force these events is included. The radial distributary pattern of the delta suggests that water level response to seiche events within the delta may be particularly complex. Hydrologic data from delta distributaries illustrate the temporal and spatial dynamics of seiche response. During the open-water season, seiche response in the delta is affected by the seasonal hydrograph of the Slave River and wind conditions. Spatially, the slope of delta distributaries governs seiche response. Responses are most similar among zones in the delta rather than among different distributaries.

Spawning times were estimated by back-calculation based on developmental phase. Eggs were collected on 17 of 21 d sampled continuously from March 4 through March 25, 2002, when water temperatures were 10-16degreesC. A total of 31 shortnose sturgeon eggs were collected from egg mats. An additional 338 shortnose sturgeon eggs and I newly hatched yolk sac larva were collected from plankton nets. A minimum of 20 spawning events occurred in the tailrace during the 2002 spawning season. No relationship between mean daily discharge and spawning date was observed. Shortnose sturgeon spawned more often during the night than at any other time of day independent of generation.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2004	24	3					932	938		10.1577/M03-131.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M03-131.1													WOS:000223531200017
J	BUBIER, JL				BUBIER, JL			THE RELATIONSHIP OF VEGETATION TO METHANE EMISSION AND HYDROCHEMICAL GRADIENTS IN NORTHERN PEATLANDS	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 The bryophyte and vascular flora were described for a range of forested and open peatlands in the mid-boreal Clay Belt region of Canada, and in the subarctic region of the Labrador Trough, Quebec. The floristic patterns and their relationships to methane (CH4) emission, hydrology and water chemistry were analysed with classification (TWINSPAN), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). 2 Despite differences in vegetation physiognomy, chemistry, and geology, water chemistry (pH, Ca, Mg, K-corr) and hydrology explain most of the species distribution in both peatland regions. In the Clay Belt, bryophytes respond primarily to water table position, and secondarily to water chemistry; the reverse is true for the vascular flora. The bryophyte and vascular ordinations are more similar to each other in the Labrador Trough than in boreal sites. 3 Although CH4 emissions are lower in subarctic than in boreal sites, mean CH4 flux is strongly correlated with mean water table position (r(2) = 0.73) in both regions, but is not correlated with water chemistry. The highest CH4 emissions (seasonal mean greater than or equal to 100 mg m(-2) day(-1)) occur in raised bog and patterned poor fen pools where the peat mat is degrading. 4 The relationships among CH4 flux, mean water table position, and species distribution are similar in both boreal and subarctic regions. Bryophytes are generally better predictors of CH4 flux than vascular plants, except for certain species in flooded sites (e.g. Carer spp.). Bryophytes are also better indicators of the long-term average position of the water table, reflecting relative zones of methane production and oxidation over the season. In the vascular plant analyses, shrub cover indicates dry conditions and low CH4 flux in the sharply differentiated string-flark-pool topography of the subarctic fens, but is less predictive of CH4 emission in the drier hummock-hollow microtopography at boreal sites where shrubs and trees are more pervasive. Overall herbaceous or sedge cover is not indicative of CH4 flux in either region.																			0022-0477					JUN	1995	83	3					403	420		10.2307/2261594	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2261594													WOS:A1995RC68700005
J	Ludovisi, A				Ludovisi, Alessandro			Energy degradation and ecosystem development: Theoretical framing, indicators definition and application to a test case study	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												During the last few decades, the so-called "maximum dissipation principle" has raised a wide debate as a paradigm governing the development of ecological systems. In the present contribution, after having discussed the meaning of the term energy degradation within the framework provided by the entropy and the exergy balance, it is suggested to distinguish three different facets of the phenomenon of the energy degradation, respectively dealing with the overall, system and environmental degradation. In relation with ecological indication, the above classification shows that different types of indicators of energy degradation can be defined, thus emphasising that a clear reference to the specific facet considered should be made in order to avoid ambiguous statements. The behaviour of several thermodynamic indicators, which include previously derived indices and a new set of entropy-based indicators, is examined along the seasonal progression in a lake ecosystem, and the effectiveness of the considered indicators in characterising the development state is evaluated by comparing their responses with the main successional traits of the phytoplankton community. The results show that, although overall degradation and related indices may deserve consideration as indicators of the extent of the degradative (biotic and abiotic) processes acting within an ecosystem, their significance as indicators of development state appears to be limited. On the other hand, indicators related to environmental degradation appear to be more promising as indicators of the development state, provided that some methodological issues dealing with the effect of the abiotic noise are properly addressed. The net radiative entropy exchange shows a significant correlation with phytoplankton successional traits, thus suggesting that the entropy changes in the radiative portion of the entropy budget are the most informative in relation to the development state of aquatic communities. The methodology adopted also lends itself to be used for evaluating the energy quality associated with an energy flow, which is here measured by the energy-to-entropy ratio. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Borrebaek, B; Christophersen, B				Borrebaek, B; Christophersen, B			Hepatic glucose phosphorylating activities in perch (Perca fluviatilis) after different dietary treatments	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												Increased activity of hepatic glucose phosphorylation was observed in perch after feeding previously fasted fish. When a pellet diet containing 14%, carbohydrate was given, most of the increased activity had a low affinity towards glucose (S-0.5 = 19.5 mM) and resembled the mammalian glucokinase (Hexokinase IV or D) and the glucokinase-like activity previously observed in salmon liver. In addition, increased activity of a hexokinase with high affinity towards glucose (K-m = 0.50 mM) was observed with the pellet diet. An increase in the activity of this hexokinase alone was observed when the fish were fed with filet of cod containing less than 0.2%, carbohydrate. Perch with a very high hepatic glucokinase-like activity after eating the pellet diet had high activities of pyruvate kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, indicating a high capacity of glycolysis and carbohydrate utilization. Simultaneously, the activity of glycogen phosphorylase was strongly reduced while the activity of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was not significantly changed. These observations were made with perch captured in the spawning season and brought to the laboratory. Assays of glucose phosphorylation in livers of perch eating the natural diet (insects) in the lake showed no glucokinase-like activity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

J	SANDERS, RW; CARON, DA; BERNINGER, UG				SANDERS, RW; CARON, DA; BERNINGER, UG			RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BACTERIA AND HETEROTROPHIC NANOPLANKTON IN MARINE AND FRESH WATERS - AN INTER-ECOSYSTEM COMPARISON	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Despite differences in the species compositions and absolute abundances of planktonic microorganisms in fresh- and saltwater, there are broad similarities in microbial food webs across systems. Relative abundances of bacteria and nanoplanktonic protozoa (HNAN, primarily heterotrophic flagellates) are similar in marine and freshwater environments, which suggests analogous trophic relationships. Ranges of microbe abundances in marine and fresh waters overlap, and seasonal changes in abundances within an ecosystem are often as great as differences in abundances between freshwater and marine systems of similar productivities. Densities of bacteria and heterotrophic nanoplankton, therefore, are strongly related to the degree of eutrophication, and not salt per se. Data from the literature is compiled to demonstrate a remarkably consistent numerical relationship (ca 1000 bacteria: 1 HNAN) between bacterioplankton and HNAN from the euphotic zones of a variety of marine and freshwater systems. Based on the results of a simple food web model involving bacterial growth, bacterial removal by HNAN, predation on HNAN, and the observed relationships between bacterial and HNAN abundances in natural ecosystems, it is possible to demonstrate that bottom-up control (food supply) is more important in regulating bacterial abundances in oligotrophic environments while top-down control (predation) is more important in eutrophic environments.

However, global warming is expected to alter this phenomenon in deep reservoirs and thus may affect the digitalization process. While the frequency and intensity of extreme climate (EC) events are increasing under a changing climate, the impacts of these highly destructive events on thermal stratification and the related cascading effects on GDC cold-water supplies are still unclear. A two-lateral-dimensional thermohydrodynamic model was established to determine the characteristics of reservoir thermal stratification changes and its potential water environment impacts based on the heat extreme experienced by the Jinshuitan Reservoir, a large, pumped storage power station (PSPS) with a GDC in southeastern China. Fourteen different PSPS inlet/outlet schemes under 2 climate scenarios were designed, and two new indexes, namely, the risk index of cold-water shortage and the index of thermal stratification, were proposed to explore the impact of extreme climates on GDC water extraction. The results showed that compared to the present climate conditions, the reservoir experienced stronger thermal stratification with a 20.6 % average increase in thermal stability, a longer thermal stratification duration with a transitional trend from seasonal to permanent stratification, and a thinner cold-water layer with a 15-m average decrease. Changes in the thermal stratification of reservoirs under EC conditions will benefit some species, such as diatoms (except for early July and the period from mid-August to early October), green algae and cyanobacteria and the migration of warmwater fish, but adversely impact dissolved oxygen, diatoms and cold-water fish. Furthermore, the risk of coldwater shortages under EC conditions was consistently greater than that under average climate (AC) conditions (traditional assessment) when the elevation of pumped storage intake/outlet was less than 145 m. According to the traditional assessment method, the intake/outlet elevation of pumped storage reservoirs resulted in a 60.27 % increase in the risk of cold-water shortages during climate extremes. Furthermore, the demand for green coldwater withdrawal and optimal pumped storage power generation benefits were met when the PSPS intake/outlet elevation was 145 m. Beyond solving this specific case, this study elucidates the importance of linking the thermal stratification and data center of cold-water withdrawal to ECs. These findings provide new insights for increasing climate change resilience.

We hypothesized that a less mobile species, such as the bank vole, would lose genetic diversity quicker than the yellow-necked mouse, which can more easily cross habitat barriers. In contrast to this we found that the effects of isolation were much more prominent in the case of the mouse than the vole. In the vole population, on the larger island, genetic diversity remained constant over subsequent years in spite of marked isolation. On the smaller island, we noted an increase in genetic diversity which was probably caused by immigration of a small group of individuals. Genetic diversity in the mouse population decreased markedly over the course of the study. In the bank vole, the preservation of genetic diversity, especially on the larger island, may have been possible due to the specific spatial and social organization of this species, which allows the maintenance of a relatively stable number of individuals. In contrast to the bank vole, the lack of territorial behavior in adult females of yellow-necked mice may lead to frequent dramatic seasonal 'booms and busts' in population size and genetic diversity. This can lead to extremely low numbers of mice, which are likely to lead to the extinction of some island populations.

Water quality assessment of Loktak Lake, Manipur using Landsat 9 imagery	WATER PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY												The role of freshwater lakes in providing water resources and supporting ecosystems is essential. Monitoring water quality using remote sensing (RS) technologies is crucial for sustainable management practices. A study on Loktak Lake was done using RS algorithms to predict post-monsoon water quality. The multiplication band model (B1 x B6) demonstrated a moderate correlation with dissolved oxygen (DO) values (mg/l) with (coefficient of determination, R-2 = 0.47, root mean square error, RMSE = 0.23, and standard error of estimation, SEE = 0.23). The band combination (B2/B4) was strongly correlated with electrical conductivity (EC) values (mu s/cm) (R-2 = 0.60, RMSE = 9.44, and SEE = 9.69). For total dissolved solids (TDS) (mg/l), with an R-2 = 0.61, RMSE = 5.95, and SEE = 6.09, Band 2 demonstrated a strong correlation between field values and satellite imagery. The post-monsoon water quality map of the lake indicates lower concentrations of DO, EC, and TDS on the western side and elevated values on the eastern side.

J	Håkanson, L; Mikrenska, M; Petrov, K; Foster, I				Håkanson, L; Mikrenska, M; Petrov, K; Foster, I			Suspended particulate matter (SPM) in rivers: empirical data and models	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												This work uses three data-bases to derive the first (as far as we know) operational empirical model to predict concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in rivers. SPM is a variable of fundamental importance in aquatic sciences. This empirical model is meant to be used as a sub-model in models where the main aim is to predict concentrations of radionuclides, nutrients or metals in river water and biota. It is well known that SPM influences the transport of most types of pollutants in most systems and governs both primary phytoplankton and bacterioplankton production and hence also secondary production (e.g., of zooplankton and fish). An important feature of the requested model is that all variables needed to run the model should be readily accessible from standard monitoring programmes and/or maps. The UK data-base includes data on SPM, water discharge (Q) and many water quality variables for 79 river sites, and it covers a wide range in these variables and includes data from several years. This data-base has been used to address the within-site variability of SPM, and hence also the predictive power of the developed model for SPM. The characteristic coefficient of variation (CV = S.D./MV; S.D. = standard deviation; MV = mean value) for SPM in these rivers sites is very high indeed, 1.71. The factors influencing the variability of characteristic (median) SPM-values among sites in different rivers have been quantified and ranked using the other two data-bases, a European data-base including data on SPM, water discharge, latitude, longitude, continentality, and altitude, and a Swedish data-base, which includes a comprehensive set of data on catchment-area characteristics. The new empirical model is derived from the two latter data-bases. The measured river-characteristic SPM-values can be predicted from the following variables: (1) latitude (as a measure of mean temperature, primary production and weathering), (2) mean water discharge, (3) continentality (SPM increases with increased continentality), and from a simple system accounting for (4) the percentage of bare rocks, the relief of the catchment, the percentage of upstream lakes and the forest cover of the catchment area. The latter factors are categorised into three classes (1, 2 and 3) having little, average, or relatively large influences on the transport of suspended particulate matter from land to water. The presented model does not include any climatological variables or factors influencing daily to seasonal variations in SPM. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

C.; Ouillon, Sylvain			Seasonal and interannual variations of suspended particulate matter in a West-African lagoon (Nokoue lagoon, Benin): Impact of rivers and wind	ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE												This study, based on five years of monthly in situ data collected from 2018 to 2022, examines the seasonal and interannual fluctuations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration in Nokoue Lagoon, Benin. Seasonally, SPM exhibits significant variations primarily influenced by changes in river discharge. During lowflow periods (December to May), SPM concentrations are relatively low (<15 mg L-1) throughout the lagoon. During this time, slight temporal variations are correlated with wind energy and likely associated with wind-induced resuspension of sediments. This is confirmed by slightly higher concentrations of SPM in the bottom layers compared to the surface. Resuspension appears to be lower in the west than in the east, likely due to the increased presence of acadjas (brush parks) in the west, reducing fetch and wind intensity, thus decreasing resuspension. At the onset of the river flood period (July-August), associated with the West African monsoon, increased river flow generates a significant turbid plume extending from the northeast of the lagoon to the Cotonou channel, connecting the lagoon to the Atlantic Ocean. SPM levels then increase considerably (>100 mg L-1), with a pronounced SPM gradient from the western to eastern regions of the lagoon. The less dense freshwater laden with sediment from the rivers flows over the denser saline water of the lagoon, leading to slightly higher SPM concentrations in the surface layers. Between September and November, SPM concentration gradually decreases as river flows reach their peak values. Thus, on a seasonal scale, the relationships between SPM and river discharge show a temporal lag, resulting in a clockwise hysteresis cycle. This is explained by the early mobilization of fine sediments during rising river flows, followed by reduced sediment availability and dilution effects as the flood peaks. On an interannual scale, SPM variations are relatively low with slight temporal shifts observed in the formation and expansion of the turbid plume and peak SPM levels. The total SPM mass in the lagoon ranges from 0.2 to 0.3 x 10(4) tonnes during low-flow periods to 20-30 x 10(4) tonnes at the onset of flooding. We also discuss uncertainties associated with SPM determination, estimated at approximately 5-15%. This study leverages a unique database in West Africa and provides valuable insights into the hydro-sedimentary dynamics of Nokoue Lagoon.					van Beek, André/O-3753-2014; Chaigneau, Alexis/E-4324-2010; Ouillon, Sylvain/A-6292-2012; duhaut, thomas/AAX-8986-2020	Stieglitz, Thomas/0000-0002-2946-391X; BALOITCHA, Ezinvi/0000-0003-4497-8783; 													0272-7714	1096-0015				SEP	2024	304								108821	10.1016/j.ecss.2024.108821	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2024.108821		JUN 2024											WOS:001253076000001

Duckling survival increased with availability of flooded wetland habitat and decreased with salinity concentrations in a brackish marsh	ORNITHOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Waterfowl population recruitment is sensitive to duckling survival. We quantified predator types and survival rates for Anas platyrhynchos (Mallard) and Mareca strepera (Gadwall) ducklings in one of the largest brackish water marshes in western North America (Suisun Marsh, California) using 556 radio-tagged ducklings from 284 broods tracked during the 2016 to 2019 breeding seasons. Overall, 78% of ducklings died and 84% of mortalities occurred < 7 days after hatch. After hatching in upland fields, survival was greater for broods that hatched closer to flooded wetlands; broods had a >= 75% chance of surviving the move from the nest to water when nests were located <= 140 m from the nearest wetland and <= 50% chance of surviving when nests were located >= 970 m from the nearest wetland. Predation accounted for 91% of mortalities and was attributed to mammals (27.6%), birds (22.0%), snakes (4.4%), and unknown predators (46.0%). Anas platyrhynchos survival to fledging (54 days) was only 3.2% and 0.9% during 2 drier years and 11.7% and 16.7% during 2 wetter years. Mareca strepera survival to fledging was 9.4% to 11.2% among years. Daily survival rates for ducklings generally increased with the amount of flooded wetlands within 0.5 km (A. platyrhynchos) and 1.0 km (M. strepera) of the nest at hatch. Additionally, survival rates increased with duckling age and body mass at hatch for both species and decreased with hatch date for A. platyrhynchos but not M. strepera, which may be partially due to the earlier onset of A. platyrhynchos nesting. For ducklings that survived the initial move to water, survival rates were negatively correlated with salinity and this effect was more pronounced for younger ducklings. Anas platyrhynchos survival to 7 days post hatch decreased by 9.1% (wetter year) to 31.4% (drier year) when ducklings were in 12 ppt water (99th quantile of cumulative salinity concentrations experienced by ducklings) versus 0.5 ppt water. Mareca strepera survival to 7 days decreased by 7.4% when ducklings were in 12 ppt vs. 0.5 ppt water. Our results suggest that maintaining a network of low salinity wetlands within 1 km of upland nesting sites would likely improve duckling survival rates, especially during the critical 7-day period after hatch.

The average circulation during the four primary hydrological periods throughout the year are studied in detail. Despite the lagoon's shallowness, significant disparities between surface and bottom conditions are observed. During the flood season (September-November), substantial river inflow (-1200 m3/s) leads to nearly barotropic currents (-7 cm/s), 'directly' linking rivers to the Atlantic Ocean. Rapid flushing results in short water residence times ranging from 3 to 16 days, with freshwater inflow and winds driving lagoon dynamics. During the salinization period (December-January) the circulation transforms into an estuarine pattern, characterized by surface water exiting and oceanic water entering the lagoon at the bottom. Average currents (-2 cm/s) and recirculation cells are relatively weak, resulting in a prolonged residence time of approximately 4 months. Circulation during this time is dominated by tides, the ocean-lagoon salinity gradient, wind, and river discharge (-100 m3/s). During low-water months (February to June), minimal river inflow and low lagoon water-levels prevail. Predominant southwest winds generate a small-scale circulation (-3 cm/s) with a complex pattern of multiple recirculation and retention cells. Residence times vary from 1 to 4 months, declining from February to June. During the lagoon's desalination season (July-August), increasing river inflows again establish a direct river-ocean connection, and average residence times reduce to -20 days. Notably, a critical river discharge threshold (-50-100 m3/s) is identified, beyond which the lagoon empties within days. This study highlights how wind-driven circulation between December and June can trap water along with potential pollutants, while river inflows, tides, and the ocean-lagoon salinity gradient facilitate water discharge. Additionally, it explores the differences between residence and flushing times, as well as some of the limitations identified in the simulations used.					duhaut, thomas/AAX-8986-2020; Ouillon, Sylvain/A-6292-2012; Marsaleix, Patrick/Q-3389-2019; Chaigneau, Alexis/E-4324-2010; model, symphonie/C-2758-2013; MOREL, Yves/P-9043-2016	Marsaleix, Patrick/0000-0002-4506-5209; HONFO, Kodjo Jules/0000-0002-6246-9600; 													1463-5003	1463-5011				AUG	2024	190								102388	10.1016/j.ocemod.2024.102388	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2024.102388		JUN 2024											WOS:001252639100001

Special attention was given to nitrogen (N) dynamics because the study area receives some of the highest levels of atmospheric N deposition in the Rocky Mountains. We asked if the effect of regional N deposition would be manifested uniformly among neighboring lakes both in terms of ambient conditions and responses to greater nutrient inputs. Catchment vegetation appeared to be the main determinant of ambient nitrate (NO3), phosphate (PO4), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, although in-lake differences in recycling produced variable and contrasting NH4 levels. Phytoplankton chlorophyll a temporarily responded to early season NO3 peaks in the lakes with rocky watersheds, but chlorophyll means over the ice-free season were remarkably similar among lakes despite differences in both nutrient supply and zooplankton grazing. In most cases, phosphorus was limiting to phytoplankton growth, although the importance of N deficiencies was greater in lakes with forested watersheds and fringing wetlands.

Holocene hydroclimate variability of the Baltic region inferred from stable isotopes, d- excess and multi-proxy data at lake Nuudsaku, Estonia (NE Europe)	QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS												Long-term hydroclimate records provide an opportunity to understand potential drivers of the past, and give context to modern and future climate warming. A wide variety of proxy data now allow for reconstruction of climate variables that were not previously possible. Here we present a multi-proxy dataset including n-alkane 82H (82Hn-alk) values from an open-basin lake in Estonia to reconstruct past hydroclimate conditions for the eastern Baltic region. We complement our sedimentary 82Hn-alk data with existing carbonate-based oxygen stable isotope (818O) data to derive deuterium (d-) excess. We present multiple isotopic records and reconstructed relative humidity (ARH) values over the Holocene, and link these with modern precipitation 82H and 818O values to guide the interpretation of the paleo-proxies. Fossil pollen and chironomid-based temperature reconstructions, as well as biogeochemical data provide additional information for inferring past environmental changes. Our results indicate that the middle Holocene in Estonia had on average 6 +/- 3% higher RH values than the late Holocene. The 818O and 82H values were also higher during the middle Holocene, which we interpret as increased warm season precipitation. Our reconstructed d-excess values were relatively higher during the middle Holocene, indicating a more northerly or cold source water origin, in comparison to the late Holocene. In addition to the paleoclimatic significance, our results show how multiple quantitative proxies can be combined to characterize hydroclimate sensitivity to changes in relative humidity, temperature and moisture source.

Our study examined the seasonal changes in GHG emissions of a shallow, eutrophic, hardwater reservoir in Spain. We observed distinctive seasonal patterns for each gas. CH4 emissions substantially increased during stratification, influenced predominantly by the increase in water temperature, net ecosystem production, and the decline in reservoir mean depth. N2O emissions mirrored CH4's seasonal trend, significantly correlating to water temperature, wind speed, and gross primary production. Conversely, CO2 emissions decreased during stratification and displayed a quadratic, rather than a linear relationship with water temperature-an unexpected deviation from CH4 and N2O emission patterns-likely associated with photosynthetic uptake of bicarbonate and formation of intracellular calcite that might be exported to sediments. This investigation highlights the imperative of integrating these idiosyncratic patterns into GHG emissions models, enhancing their predictive power.

Recreational water quality response to a filtering barrier at a Great Lakes beach	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Recent research has sought to determine the off- or onshore origin of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in order to improve local recreational water quality. In an effort to reduce offshore contamination, a filtering barrier (FB) was installed at Calumet Beach, Lake Michigan, Chicago, IL A horseshoe-shaped curtain (146 m long, 0.18 mm apparent opening size, 1.5-1.6 m deepest point) was designed to exclude FIB containing or promoting debris and thus reduce the number of swimming advisories during the examination period of July through September 2012. Mean water Escherichia coli concentrations were significantly lower at southern transects (S; outside FB) than at transects within the FB (WN) and at northern transects (N; outside FB) (1.45 log (MPN)/100 ml vs. 1.74 and 1.72, respectively, p < 0.05, n = 234). Turbidity was significantly higher at the WN transects (p < 0.001, n = 233), but it tended to increase throughout the sampling season within and outside the FB. E. coli in adjacent foreshore sand was significantly lower at the WN transects. A combination of factors might explain higher E. coli and turbidity within the FB including increased sediment resuspension, trapped algae, shallowing within the FB, and large lake hydrodynamic processes. This remediation approach may find better use in a different hydrodynamic setting, but the results of this experiment provide insight on sources of contamination and nearshore dynamics that may direct future beach management strategies.

The concentration of & sum;NNIs detected in the Pearl River was higher than that in other river basins, with a median of 51.11 ng/L. During the dry season, the detection rate of & sum;NNIs was 77.4%, with concentrations ranging from 0.10 to 210.33 ng/L. During the wet season, the detection rate of & sum;NNIs was 85%, and the concentration of & sum;NNIs ranged from 0.10 to 117.03 ng/L. The estimated daily intake (EDI) of NNIs in the raw water and drinking water of each river basin is less than the reference dose (RfD) of imidacloprid. The potential risk of NNIs can be reduced by further optimizing the water treatment processes.

Wetland ecosystems are important locations for global biogeochemical phosphorus cycle. In this study, production and emission fluxes of free phosphine from four wetlands types in southern China were observed in different seasons. The results showed that the concentration of phosphine liberated from wetlands was at pg/m(3)-ng/m(3) level. The emission concentrations of different wetlands followed the sequence: paddy field (51.83 +/- 3.06) ng/m(3) >= marsh (46.54 +/- 20.55) ng/m(3) > lake (37.05 +/- 22.74) ng/m(3) >> coastal wetland (1.71 +/- 0.73) ng/m(3), the positive phosphine emission flux occurred in rice paddy field (6.67 +/- 5.18) ng/(m(2).hr) and marsh (6.23 +/- 26.9) ng/(m(2).hr), while a negative phosphine flux of (-13.11 +/- 35.04) ng/(m(2).hr) was observed on the water-air interface of Lake Taihu, suggesting that paddy field and marsh may be important sources for phosphine gas in atmosphere, while lake may be a sink of atmospheric phosphine gas during the sampling period. Atmospheric phosphine levels and emission flux from Yancheng marsh and rice paddy field varied in different seasons and vegetational zones. Both diffusion resistance in aqueous phase and temperature were dominating factors for the production and transportation of phosphine to atmosphere.

J	Kossoni, A; Giresse, P				Kossoni, Alice; Giresse, Pierre			Interaction of Holocene infilling processes between a tropical shallow lake system (Lake Ossa) and a nearby river system (Sanaga River) (South Cameroon)	JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES												The valley of the Sanaga River, notably in its lower course, experienced a marked alluvial accumulation (7-12 m thick) when the Holocene sea-level and thus the base level of the river approached the present zero. This resulted in an increased height of the floor of the streambed, which facilitated the overflowing of the floods over the top of the river banks. The sediments of Lake Ossa, situated approximately 35 km from the Atlantic shoreline, but the margins of which extend to 1-2 km from the Sanaga River, were studied on the basis of five sediment cores. This lake basin remained isolated from the river until 6500 cal. BP, from when we note the first alluvial accumulation, especially in its southern part. A more easily submersible segment of the lake shoreline about 2 km long was identified. Several specific mineralogical markers of the sandy fraction and the clayey fraction allow us to distinguish autochthonous materials emanating from proximal hillsides upstream of the river, and then to follow the increase of these allochthonous particles during the second half of the Holocene. The first important introduction of alluvial materials in the lake, notably sands, was associated with an acceleration of the accumulation rate. These sedimentary processes seem to have intervened independently of the climate change of the region; they began in a dense forest wet phase and continued during a period of relative opening of the landscape corresponding to more contrasted seasons. The accumulation of coarse alluviums in the lake occurred according to an approximately south-north axis, while that of the suspended load developed with a wider fan-like geometry. These sedimentary processes are diachronous according to the distance from the Sanaga River and so lead us to reconsider partly the palaeoenvironmental meaning of the assemblages of pollen and possibly also of diatoms from previous studies. These vegetal markers were previously considered to have been deposited in the lacustrine system, in restricted isolation. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

A case study focusing on Lake Shinji and nearby estuarine waters	LANDSCAPE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Musculista senhousia is a marine mytilid mussel native to Japan that constructs byssal thread mats (hereafter "mats") that destroy local fisheries, and so it is regarded as a biofouling species. To elucidate the factors that prevent the formation of mats of M. senhousia, we first observed the seasonal changes in the populations of M. senhousia in two rivers with similar salinities. Then we compared the condition of Lake Nakaumi, which is covered with dense mats at present, with the condition of the same lake before the decline of the eelgrass beds. The results showed that a particular set of conditions (in terms of salinity, dissolved oxygen concentration and sediment type) did not lead to the dense habitation of M. senhousia in one river, while mat construction was observed in another river with a similar set of conditions. Together with the past description of Lake Nakaumi, we conclude that larvae of M. senhousia head upstream all year round, and can settle as far upstream as the salinity remains within its range of tolerance. Whether it constructs mats depends on the presence of its predators.

Stochastic dynamics of phycocyanin in years of contrasting phosphorus load	ECOSPHERE												Resilience, measured by the distribution of passage times between alternate states, indicates persistence of a state in stochastic dynamic systems such as blooms of cyanobacteria in lakes. We used high-frequency datasets to compare the resilience of low and high states of phycocyanin, a pigment indicator of cyanobacteria, in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA, for three growing seasons that ranged sevenfold in external phosphorus (P) load. Each year we observed 139-265 passage times across the unstable threshold that separated the low- from high-phycocyanin states. Each sample of passage times is highly skewed with low median, larger mean, much larger SD, and wide tails extending to long lifetimes of a state. About 25% of events, whether low or high phycocyanin, lasted a day or more. Among these 3 years of contrasting external P load, there were no discernible differences in the resilience of either ecosystem state. We attribute this lack of contrast to the sustained recycling of P from sediments and the high stochasticity of phycocyanin in this lake.																			2150-8925					JUN	2024	15	6							e4903	10.1002/ecs2.4903	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.4903													WOS:001252871100001

Machine learning-based remote sensing techniques for monitoring water quality parameters (WQPs) have gained increasing prominence in recent years. However, these techniques still face challenges such as inadequate band selection, weak machine learning model performance, and the limited retrieval of non-optical active parameters (NOAPs). This study focuses on an urban reservoir, utilizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral remote sensing and ensemble machine learning (EML) methods to monitor optically active parameters (OAPs, including Chla and SD) and non-optically active parameters (including CODMn, TN, and TP), exploring spatial and temporal variations of WQPs. A framework of Feature Combination and Genetic Algorithm (FC-GA) is developed for feature band selection, along with two frameworks of EML models for WQP estimation. Results indicate FC-GA's superiority over popular methods such as the Pearson correlation coefficient and recursive feature elimination, achieving higher performance with no multicollinearity between bands. The EML model demonstrates superior estimation capabilities for WQPs like Chla, SD, CODMn, and TP, with an R2 of 0.72-0.86 and an MRE of 7.57-42.06%. Notably, the EML model exhibits greater accuracy in estimating OAPs (MRE <= 19.35%) compared to NOAPs (MRE <= 42.06%). Furthermore, spatial and temporal distributions of WQPs reveal nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient pollution in the upstream head and downstream tail of the reservoir due to human activities. TP, TN, and Chla are lower in the dry season than in the rainy season, while clarity and CODMn are higher in the dry season than in the rainy season. This study proposes a novel approach to water quality monitoring, aiding in the identification of potential pollution sources and ecological management.					; Chen, Xiang/JUF-0248-2023; D, F/JVP-2168-2024	chen, xiaohong/0000-0003-0809-5297; Lai, Chengguang/0009-0000-2793-9104; 														2072-4292				JUN	2024	16	12							2246	10.3390/rs16122246	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs16122246													WOS:001256399300001

This includes related statistical analyses, such as confidence intervals, to assess variability and identify cases where measures should be taken to reduce TSS and TP. Trend analysis of TSS and TP (C/L)s are performed, combining bootstrapping with the Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season, i.e., WRTDS_BT technique. The technique is used at ten selected monitoring stations of Northern Lake Erie, Eastern Lake Huron, and Lake Ontario and Niagara Peninsula in Ontario, Canada. Trend analysis over selected tributaries using flow-normalized (FN) TSS and TP (C/L)s reveals that trends in [FN-TSS] and [FN-TP] (C/L)s were highly variable, with significant decrease in a few stations. However, in most tributaries, TSS concentration levels are significantly higher than Canadian Water Quality Guidelines (CWQG) limit of 30 mg/L (following Toronto Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), Ontario) and TP concentration levels are significantly higher than the Ontario's provincial water quality objectives (PWQO) limit of 0.03 mg/L. Measures to reduce TSS and TP is effective at five tributaries (Humber River, Don River, Saugeen River, Big Creek, Nottawasaga River). Although the drivers are not explicitly identified, potential attributions are discussed for policymakers in the study area. Four tributaries had [FN-TSS] concentrations below CWQG limit (30 mg/L).Two tributaries had [FN-TP] concentration below PWQO limit (0.03 mg/L).Two tributaries had concentrations below both CWQG and PWQO limit.Best management practices (BMPs) are effective at six tributaries.

J	Rajora, K; Sarma, K				Rajora, Koshal; Sarma, Kiranmay			Assessment of Pollution Status in Surajpur Wetland using multivariate statistical analysis, Uttar Pradesh, India	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												The seasonal water quality of the Surajpur wetland was analysed using 13 physicochemical parameters, including pH, TDS, EC, temperature, total hardness, total alkalinity, DO, BOD, phosphate, fluoride, nitrate, sulphate, and chloride employing standardized procedures. Fifteen samples were collected in triplicate from five distinct locations within the wetland. These samples were then compared to the BIS and WHO standards (2012). The analysis used titrimetric techniques to determine DO, BOD, total hardness, total alkalinity, and chlorides. Moreover, phosphate, sulphate, and nitrate were determined through UV-spectrophotometry. The wetland has an alkaline nature, the hydrogeochemical facies that dominate the surface water are Ca2+, Mg2+, HCO3, and Cl-. The results indicate that TDS, total alkalinity, phosphates, and fluorides exceeded the permissible limits. The evaluation of water quality in the study area was conducted through the implementation of the standard Water Quality Index (WQI), the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index-(CCME-WQI) and the Comprehensive Pollution Index (CPI) and their associated parameters.. The CCME-WQI ranges from 46 to 53, indicating very poor/marginal water quality, the WQI value ranges from 82.80 to 96.18, indicating good water quality, while the CPI ranges from 0.9 to 1.15, indicating very poor/marginal water quality. The pH-EC and pH-TA, TDS-CPI, Cl-TH and the WQI-PO43- are negatively correlated at a significance level p < 0.01. The TA-EC, BOD-DO and TA-PO43- are negatively correlated at a significance level p < 0.05 as per the correlation matrix result. Using hierarchical cluster analysis, 5 sampling sites were divided into two clusters based on the similarity of water quality characteristics: comparatively less polluted and more polluted sites. The four principal components were identified using PCA, principal components contribute to 46.02%, 223.48%, 19.38% and 11.11%, of the total variance of the dataset respectively. The PCA indicate that the variation in water quality is due to anthropogenic activities around the vicinity of the wetland. In order to preserve the wetland's aesthetic value and ecological health, preventive measures such as de-weeding, preventing the infiltration of untreated sewage, and desilting are advised. Incorporating these measures can prevent potential damage to the wetland and ensure the survival of its ecology and aesthetic value.					; Sarma, Kiranmay/JDW-1412-2023	Rajora, Koshal/0009-0007-0186-3077; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				JUN	2024	83	12							381	10.1007/s12665-024-11622-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-024-11622-1													WOS:001238231300001

Spatial and, for the first time, temporal variations in stream water pH, temperature, electrical conductivity, and nitrate and phosphate concentrations are presented for four catchments (485 -13,500 km 2 ), all with glaciers and major urban areas. The catchments studied were: Kaskelen (Kazakhstan), Ala-Archa (Kyrgyzstan), Chirchik (Uzbekistan) and the Kofarnihon (Tajikistan). Measurements were made in cryosphere, stream water, groundwater, reservoir and lake samples over a 22 -month period at fortnightly intervals from 35 sites. The results highlight that glacier, permafrost and rock glacier outflows were primary and secondary nitrate sources ( >1 mg N L -1 ) to the headwaters, and there were major increases in salinity and nitrate concentrations where rivers receive inputs from agriculture and settlements. Overall, the water quality complied with national and World Health Organization standards, however there were pollution hot -spots with shallow urban groundwaters contaminated with nitrate ( >11 mg N L -1 ) and stream electrical conductivity above 800 mu S cm -1 in some agricultural areas indicative of high salinity. Phosphate concentrations were generally low ( <0.06 mg P L -1 ) throughout the catchments, though elevated ( >0.2 mg P L -1 ) in urban areas due to effluent contamination. A melt water dilution effect along the main river channels was discernible, in the electrical conductivity and nitrate concentration seasonal dynamics, 100 s of km from the headwaters. Thus, the input of relatively clean water from the cryosphere is an important regulator of main channel water quality in the urban and farmed lowland plains adjacent to the Tien Shan and Pamir. Improved sewage treatment is needed in urban areas.

Localities that showed regular diversity indexes along two years are coincident with those with better environmental quality indicated by other factors (frequency of abnormalities in fishes, DBO5, temperature, total coliforms, dissolved oxygen). The integrated quality index, however, was mostly influenced by abundance and richness, being the localities indicated as the best quality by this index coincident with those indicated as bad quality by other factors. The accomplished analysis demonstrated that when the measure of water quality gets better, the Margalef Index decreases. This demonstrates that even having an improvement in water quality, there is no improvement of structure of the fish community of this place.

Environmental Monitoring of Opportunistic Protozoa in Rivers and Lakes in the Neotropics Based on Yearly Monitoring	WATER QUALITY EXPOSURE AND HEALTH												The goal of this study was to standardise and use parasitological and molecular techniques in the analysis and seasonal monitoring of opportunistic protozoa in water from fluvial systems for human usage in the municipality of Goiania, the capital of the state of Goias, in the mid-western region of Brazil. We focused on Cryptosporidium sp. Cyclospora cayetanensis, Isopora belli, Microsporidia and Giardia lamblia. Water samples were collected monthly from February 2006 to January 2007 and concentrated using vacuum filtration and a positively charged membrane. Several methods were used to identify the different protozoa of interest. To detect coccidia (Cryptosporidium sp., Isospora belli, and Cyclospora cayetanensis), we used a Kinyoun hot-staining method and a modified Ziehl-Neelsen technique. Enteral microsporidia were detected by a hot-chromotrope technique while a MERIFLUOR (R) Cryptosporidium kit was used to confirm the presence of Cryptosporidium sp. Finally, we used PCR to detect Cryptosporidium parvum/hominis. Water is of vital importance to living beings; however, due to anthropic action, several microorganisms are disseminated into aquatic environments. Among them are opportunistic protozoa that infect mainly immunodepressed and immuno-suppressed individuals, children and elderly people. These S. protozoa pose a significant health hazard. Nevertheless, the presence of these pathogens is underestimated because they are not considered during routine environmental monitoring. In our study, we were able to observe the presence of Giardia cysts, Cryptosporidium sp. and Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in the bodies of water monitored in this research.

We studied the composition of fatty acids (FAs) in the seston from two small freshwater reservoirs (Bugach and Lesnoi) with distinct periodicity of domination by cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae during the growth season. 2. The diatoms in the both reservoirs were characterised by a high content of 14:0 and C16 unsaturated acids, whereas that of the essential FA 20:5omega3 [eicosapentanoic acid (EPA)] was low. The correlation between this polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) and diatom biomass was not significant in either reservoir. The percentage of 20:5omega3 in seston significantly correlated with the biomass of euglenophyta in Bugach and dinophyta in Lesnoi. Hence the diatoms, usually referred as a valuable food for zooplankton, were not an important source of the essential PUFA in these systems. 3. The dominant cyanobacteria in Bugach, and the green algae in Lesnoi, both contained the same marker acids: 18:3omega3 and 18:2omega6. Hence, a discrimination between these two phytoplanktonic groups on the basis of FA biomarkers may be difficult in some cases. 4. We found no significant correlation between the content of 20:5omega3 in seston and the biomass of the dominant daphniids in either reservoir. This is contrary to expectations, based on the literature, that EPA is generally important. Rather, the biomass of the two dominant Daphnia species in Bugach correlated strongly with the content of 18:3omega3 in the seston. The cyanobacteria were a probable source of this omega3 FA for Daphnia . We conclude that EPA is not always important for Daphnia populations although, in such cases, some other PUFA (e.g. 18:3omega3) might be related to their growth.					; Kalacheva, Galina/I-8975-2014; Dubovskaya, Olga/S-2163-2016; Sushchik, Nadezhda/P-9395-2015; Gladyshev, Michail/F-6975-2013; Kravchuk, Elena/AAO-9679-2020	Ivanova, Elena/0000-0002-3220-103X; Kravchuk, Elena/0000-0003-3185-6322; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				MAR	2003	48	3					394	403		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01009.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01009.x													WOS:000181027400002

The upper 50 m of the ice core were dated by multi-proxy analysis of stable isotopes (delta(18)O and delta(2)H), (137)Cs and Ca(+2) content, electrical conductivity, and insoluble microparticle content, together with reference historical horizons from atmospheric nuclear tests and known volcanic eruptions. This 50 m section corresponds to a record of environmental variations spanning about 80 years from 1919 to 1999. It was cut in 744 sub-samples under laminar flow in a clean bench, which were analyzed by Ion Chromatography for major ionic concentration, by a particle counter for insoluble aerosol content, and by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) for the concentration of 45 chemical species from Li to U. This paper focuses on results of trace element concentrations measured by ICP-MS. The high temporal resolution used in the analyses allowed classifying samples as belonging to dry or wet seasons. During wet season elemental concentrations are low and samples show high crustal enrichment factors. During dry seasons the situation is opposite, with high elemental concentrations and low crustal enrichments. For example, with salt lakes as main sources in the region, average Li concentration during the 20th century is 0.035 and 0.90 ng g(-1) for wet and dry seasons, respectively. Illimani average seasonal concentration ranges cover the spectrum of elemental concentration measurements at another Andean ice core site (Sajama) for most soil-related elements. Regional crustal dust load in the deposits was found to be overwhelming during dry season, obfuscating the contribution of biomass burning material. Marked temporal trends from the onset of 20th century to more recent years were identified for the concentrations of several trace species of anthropic origin, especially for Cu, As, Zn, Cd, Co, Ni and Cr. Among these elements, Cu shows average wet season crustal enrichment factors above 10(3), while the others range between 10(2) to about 5 x 10(2). P and K show moderate average wet season enrichment factors, suggesting an impact of natural biogenic emissions from the Amazon Basin. Pb has multiple anthropic sources in the region, from mining activities in the beginning of 20th century to automotive fuel after 1950s. From the large number of samples analyzed from Illimani, it was possible to derive an effective chemical characterization of the deposited background Andean soil dust aerosol during 20th century.

The effect on humus chemistry was significant: exchangeable Mg and Ca, effective acidity (EA), base saturation (BSe), pH, and effective cation exchange capacity (CECe) significantly increased, while exchangeable Fe significantly decreased. In the B horizon, liming increased exchangeable Ca, Mg, and Mn concentrations while decreasing other acid cations. No significant temporal trends in element concentrations in tree rings could be detected, although the lime treatment significantly changed the average xylem Mg and Mn concentrations as well as the average Mg/Mn and Ca/Mn ratios of the sapwood. The absence of temporal trends in rings from the last 20 yr implied a significant re-equilibration of elements through the sapwood. Significant relationships were found between averaged xylem Ca/Mn and Mg/Mn ratios and exchangeable humus Ca, Mg, Mn, Al, Fe, and H+ concentration, EA, CECe, and BSe, suggesting that the average xylem Ca/Mn and Mg/Mn ratios are strong indicators of the soil acid-base status.					; Ouimet, Rock/IQS-0362-2023; Duchesne, Louis/KEH-9796-2024	Ouimet, Rock/0000-0003-1282-2493; Duchesne, Louis/0000-0001-6784-445X; 													0047-2425	1537-2537				NOV-DEC	2002	31	6					1993	2000		10.2134/jeq2002.1993	http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2002.1993								12469849					WOS:000181953300026
J	Turner, RE; Dortch, Q; Justic, D; Swenson, EM				Turner, RE; Dortch, Q; Justic, D; Swenson, EM			Nitrogen loading into an urban estuary: Lake Pontchartrain (Louisiana, U.S.A.)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We constructed a nitrogen loading budget for the Lake Pontchartrain watershed located north of New Orleans, Louisiana ( U. S. A.). Water quality measurements, discharge estimates, and literature values were used to establish the annual and seasonal variations in loading rates for total nitrogen and nitrate. The relatively stable annual loadings (million kg N) are about 10 x that of the pre-settlement nitrogen loading, and come from atmosphere (1.3), the watershed (7.8), pumped urban runoff from New Orleans (1.0), and leakage through the Bonnet Carre flood control structure (0.5-0.9). Relatively minor additional amounts come from nitrogen fixation in the Lake. Occasional openings of the Bonnet Carre Spillway ( for flood protection) could triple the annual average loading within 1-2 months. Proposed smaller diversions (for wetland restoration) could raise present N loadings by 50%. The results of water quality management, flood protection and wetland restoration may thus have conflicting effects on the Lake's phytoplankton community, which is primarily nitrogen limited. Lowering the total nitrogen loading, however, seems quite possible, especially given that the present loadings are almost all reducible through existing technology, especially sewerage treatment. The analysis demonstrates that the consequences of ecosystem restoration efforts, continued population growth and flood protection to estuarine nitrogen budgets are intertwined with each other, have a seasonal component, and are changing as policies evolve.

Even different filtration volumes of the same plankton sample and, thus, different biomass loading of the filters, can distort the sequencing results. In this study, we designed an Arduino microcontroller-based flowmeter that records the decrease of initial (maximal) flowrate as proxy for increasing biomass loading and clogging of filters during plankton filtration. The device was tested using freshwater plankton of Lake Constance, and total DNA was extracted and an 16S rDNA amplicon was sequenced. We confirmed that different filtration volumes used for the same water sample affect the sequencing results. Differences were visible in alpha and beta diversities and across all taxonomic ranks. Taxa most affected were typical freshwater Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes, increasing up to 38% and decreasing up to 29% in relative abundance, respectively. In another experiment, a lake water sample was filtered undiluted and three-fold diluted, and each filtration was stopped once the flowrate had reduced to 50% of initial flowrate, hence, at the same degree of filter clogging. The three-fold diluted sample required three-fold filtration volumes, while equivalent amounts of total DNA were extracted and differences across all taxonomic ranks were not statistically significant compared to the undiluted controls. In conclusion, this work confirms a volume/biomass-dependent bacterioplankton filtration bias for sequencing-based community analyses and provides an improved procedure for controlling biomass loading during filtrations and recovery of equivalent amounts of DNA from samples independent of the plankton density. The application of the device can also avoid the distorting of sequencing results as caused by the plankton filtration bias.

J	Anisfeld, SC; Tobin, M; Benoit, G				Anisfeld, SC; Tobin, M; Benoit, G			Sedimentation rates in flow-restricted and restored salt marshes in Long Island Sound	ESTUARIES												Many salt marshes in densely populated areas have been subjected to a reduction in tidal flow. In order to assess the impact of tidal flow restriction on marsh sedimentation processes, sediment cores were collected from flow-restricted salt marshes along the Connecticut coast of Long Island Sound. Cores were also collected from unrestricted reference marshes and from a marsh that had been previously restricted but was restored to fuller tidal flushing in the 1970's. High bulk densities and low C and N concentrations were found at depth in the restricted marsh cores, which we attribute to a period of organic matter oxidation, sediment compaction, and marsh surface subsidence upon installation of flow restrictions (between 100 and 200 years before the present, depending on the marsh). Recent sedimentation rates at the restricted marshes (as determined by Cs-137 and Pb-210 dating) were positive and averaged 78% (Cs-137) and 50% (Pb-210) of reference marsh sedimentation rates. The accumulation of inorganic sediment was similar at the restricted and reference marshes, perhaps because of the seasonal operation of the tide gates, while organic sediment accretion (and pore space) was significantly lower in the restricted marshes, perhaps because of higher decomposition rates. Sedimentation rates at the restored marsh were significantly higher than at the reference marshes. This marsh has responded to the higher water levels resulting from restoration by a rapid increase in marsh surface elevation.

J	Mathooko, JM				Mathooko, JM			Disturbance of a Kenya Rift Valley stream by the daily activities of local people and their livestock	HYDROBIOLOGIA					Conference on Science and the Sustainable Management of Shallow Tropical Waters	APR 11-16, 1999	NAIVASHA, KENYA					Human and domestic animal activities and visits to an impacted site in the Njoro River, Kenya, were recorded from 1994 to 1995. The activities of people in the humid and wet zones of the stream included linen washing, water abstraction, excretion, bathing and swimming. Human and animal visits and activities along the Njoro River were on a daily basis and were patterned according to the time of the day, weather and seasons. Women formed the first group to visit the stream at dawn, followed by men and lastly, children. The diurnal pattern of visits was bimodal, with major peaks between 0600 and 1100 h and from 1600 h until dusk, The intensity of all major activities peaked at around midday and donkeys and cattle formed the largest proportion of the domestic animals that visited the stream, Much of the small-scale water abstraction occurred between 0700 and 1100 h, coinciding with the time when most people visited the stream, Water abstraction was most intense during the dry season. A mean discharge of 1.7 litres per second was measured whilst 0.3 litre of water per second was abstracted at the impacted site, implying that about 20% of the flow volume of the Njoro River was abstracted at a single site in one day. The effects of the human and animal activities oil the structure of macrozoobenthos in the wet zone of the Njoro River were studied oil the 'impacted site' in relation to all upstream reference site' and a 'downstream reference site'. Oligochaetes and chironomids dominated the fauna in all three sites. The impacted site had low patchiness and mean crowding, with the taxa distribution tending toward a randomly dispersed spatial pattern. The mean turnover (+/-SD) of the macroinvertebrates was 47 18, 48 26 and 36 22 in the impacted, downstream and upstream sites, respectively, The trampling of the streambed by humans and livestock could, therefore, alter the benthos structure through redistribution and reduction of faunal patchiness. The cumulative effect of small-scale, but widespread and frequent disturbances might have large impacts oil whole river systems. This study demonstrated that, in the tropics. quantification of the daily activities of people and domestic animals is important for future management of the Njoro River and consequently, Lake Nakuru.																			0018-8158					AUG 15	2001	458						131	139		10.1023/A:1013160918203	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1013160918203													WOS:000173248500015
J	Liu, ML; Li, XY; Cao, GC; Shi, FZ; Liu, F				Liu, Menglin; Li, Xiaoyan; Cao, Guangchao; Shi, Fangzhong; Liu, Fang			Seasonal CO2 fluxes from alpine river influenced by freeze-thaw in the Qinghai Lake basin, northeastern of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												River CO2 emissions, which contribute 53 % of the basin's overall carbon emissions, are essential parts of the global and regional carbon cycles. Previous CO2 flux calculates are mostly based on single samples collected during ice-free periods; however, little is known about the effects of freeze-thaw cycles on the river CO2 flux (FCO2) of inland rivers in alpine regions. Based on one year-round monthly continuous field sampling, we quantified the FCO2 and determined their driving factors in typical rivers during different freeze-thaw periods in the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB) using the thin boundary layer model (TBL) and the path analysis method. The findings indicated that (1) the average FCO2 in the typical rivers was 184.98 +/- 329.12 mmol/m(2)/d, acting as a carbon source during different freeze-thaw periods, and showed a decreasing trend with completely thawed periods (CTP, 303.15 +/- 376.56 mmol/m(2)/d) > unstable freezing periods (UFP, 189.44 +/- 344.08 mmol/m(2)/d) > unstable thawing periods (UTP, 62.35 +/- 266.71 mmol/m(2)/d); (2) pH, surface water temperature (Tw) and total alkalinity (TA) were the dominant controlling factors during different freeze-thaw periods. Interestingly, they significantly affected FCO2 more before completely frozen than after frozen, with Tw and TA changing from having promoting effects to having limiting effects; (3) in addition, dissolved carbon components indirectly affected FCO2, primarily through the indirect effects of pH and Tw in the UTP; wind speed (U) directly promoted FCO2 in the CTP; and Ca2+ and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were susceptible to indirect effects, which promoted/limited the release of FCO2 in the UFP, respectively. Our results reveal the changes of FCO2 and the factors influencing it in inland rivers within alpine regions during different freeze-thaw periods, thereby offering valuable support for carbon emission-related studies in alpine regions.

Gary			Using seasonal oscillations in fin ray microchemistry to chemically age Lake Sturgeon	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												Objective Nonlethally sampled pectoral fin rays are commonly used as aging structures for Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens, but they tend to underestimate the true age in older, slow-growing individuals (age > 14 years). Current aging practices involve counting bands along the structure, which are construed as annuli. Oscillations of certain trace elements corresponding with annuli have been seen across various fish species, with patterns continuing to the marginal edge of hard structures. This study explored the aging of fin rays by using microchemistry patterns in Lake Sturgeon of known age (n = 94; ages 5-21) to determine the potential use of this method as an alternative or supplementary aging technique. Methods Elements were chosen for age determination analysis by examining the relationship between profile minima/maxima and visually interpreted annuli. Fish were assigned ages using three different methods: (1) traditional interpretation (counting annuli along the structure), (2) chemical interpretation (examination of seasonal variations in elemental profiles with visually identified annuli), and (3) a statistical model (multivariate multiple changepoint analysis with finite differencing using raw elemental profiles). Result Mean absolute differences between age estimates and known age were significantly higher for the traditional interpretation method than for the chemical interpretation method. The mean coefficient of variation in estimated age was 11.14% for the traditional interpretation method and 4.04% for the chemical interpretation method. The changepoint model was able to correctly classify age for 100% of the samples within +/- 1 year in one population (ages 5-8) but could not classify samples from the second population (ages 12-21). Conclusion Our results suggest that chemical aging techniques could provide more reliable age estimates for juvenile and subadult Lake Sturgeon when fin rays are the only aging option. Further work is required to determine the applicability of the model for assigning ages to older fish and for use with different populations and structures.					; Loeppky, Alison/AAG-7439-2019	Anderson, W.

We evaluated the application of a widely used Total Suspended Solid (TSS) algorithm within ten small (16-117 m wide) tributaries of the Lake Champlain Basin in the Northeastern US. Sentinel-2 images captured within 5 h of depth-integrated TSS samples were identified and corrected for atmospheric conditions to generate TSS estimates. Linkages between sample attributes and errors in the relationship between measured and predicted TSS values were explored to identify potential limits on the application of existing TSS algorithms to small rivers. From a dataset of 64 unique measured-predicted values on rivers whose channel width was greater than one pixel (i.e., 10 m), we found that there are settings along smaller rivers, and discrete flow and seasonal conditions, under which broad-scale remote sensing applications may be applicable. The remote sensing algorithm had the greatest success predicting TSS for rivers with high background levels of sediment (i.e., large concentrations during smaller discharges). Errors in estimated TSS were three times greater on rivers with low background levels (average error of 174%) of sediment than high levels (average error of 57%), likely due to differences in the proportion of fine-grained particle-sizes in transport. We also found that estimated TSS error was less outside the growing season, when biological activity was limited and plants were dormant, and when higher flows occurred such that backscatter from the channel bed is less likely to interfere with the reflective signal. This effect was most pronounced on rivers with low background sediment loads; errors in estimated TSS were more than six times greater during the growing season on rivers with low background loads (average error of 216%) than when plants were dormant (average error of 48%). We hypothesized that algorithm performance on smaller rivers, as measured by channel width, would be prone to larger errors due to the greater influence of contrasting reflectance signals from soils and vegetation along riverbanks. The degree of limitation from this adjacency effect was not evident in our dataset perhaps because of a correlation between river size and sediment characteristics unique to our study area. An alternative parameterization of a single-band empirical TSS model for small rivers in the region, based on inclusion of readily identifiable geologic and temporal characteristics, suggests improved predictive power for small rivers. Results highlight the feasibility of extending remote sensing applications throughout the river network in temperate regions of the Northeastern U.S. Certain geologic settings, specifically those that transport finer-grained loads, are more likely to have accurate predictions, especially during the colder months, when in situ monitoring is particularly challenging, yet highly important because a significant portion of runoff events in the Northeastern U.S. occur in this time.					; Pahlevan, Nima/L-7746-2014	Diehl, Rebecca/0000-0001-9414-4045; 													2352-9385					AUG	2024	35								101234	10.1016/j.rsase.2024.101234	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2024.101234		MAY 2024											WOS:001325407100001

During 2002, we investigated the effect of tissue OC contaminant levels on the physiology and growth of nestling tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in the nestlings positively correlated with hepatic ethoxy-, benzyloxy-, and pentoxyresorufin-o-dealkylase enzyme activities and liver size. Despite detectable physiologic changes associated with body burdens of PCBs, reproductive success of breeding pairs was not affected. Hatching date was negatively correlated with PCB levels, alkoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (alkROD) activities, liver size, and serum protein levels. alkROD activities were largely dependent on hatching date because insect prey contaminated with PCBs were only abundant during a limited period of time during the breeding season.

The physiological responses and pathobiological developments that they elicit in fish have been extensively studied, mainly through acute toxicity experiments. This study was designed to examine the seasonal fluctuation of biochemical markers of oxidative stress in different tissues of a natural population of Cyprinus carpio inhabiting a shallow Mediterranean lake, along with the respective MCYSTs concentrations in blood and tissues at environmentally relevant MCYSTs values. MCYSTs content was assessed in liver, kidney, intestine, brain and muscle along with the MCYSTs in lake water and scum applying ELISA technique. Catalase activity, GSH/GSSH relative concentrations and lipid peroxidation were used as biochemical markers. Our results suggest that common carp of Lake Pamvotis exposed to naturally fluctuating concentrations of MCYST in water and scum contained stably high MCYST concentrations in all tissues that might pose a threat to public health. Liver and kidney were the primary target organs. Tissue concentrations did not correlate with the response of any of the elements of the antioxidant defence system. Hepatic catalase, GSH content and TBARS in all tissues tested followed the fluctuations of major limnological parameters, i.e. water temperature and oxygen concentration, chlorophyll-a, MCYST in water and scum, suggesting that they should be cautiously used to monitor exposure to MCYSTS in natural freshwater ecosystems.

As most of the water resources used for irrigation (mainly rivers and lakes) have an alkaline composition, rice cropping is often held as responsible for soil alkalinization. In order to evaluate the probability for this process to occur, we studied 3 different sites in West Africa where numerical simulation of the geochemical interactions between soil, irrigation water and groundwater were performed with PHREEQC. It was possible to simulate the evaporation of the ponding water, the mixing between groundwater and irrigation water, the lateral drainage (flushing) and the leaching, and finally the management of the crop residues. By performing prospective simulations over 60 cropping cycles it has been shown that soil alkalinization and sodication are not inevitable in these areas especially if the cropping is properly managed. Moreover, when straw is removed and the plot flushed before the new cropping season, alkaline soils can even be improved with rice cropping. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Nicholson, SE				Nicholson, SE			A semi-quantitative, regional precipitation data set for studying african climates of the nineteenth century, part I. Overview of the data set	CLIMATIC CHANGE												This article describes a historical archive of proxy and actual precipitation data that extends the African climate record back to the early nineteenth century. The 'proxy' archive includes verbal, documentary references which contain information related to rainfall conditions, such as references to famine, drought, agriculture or the nature of the rainy season. The precipitation archive includes all observations made in Africa during the nineteenth century. It consists of records for 60 stations in Algeria, 87 stations in South Africa and 304 stations scattered over the rest of Africa. Information is particularly plentiful for the 1880s and 1890s. The two parts have been be combined into a semi-quantitative regional data set indicating annual rainfall conditions in terms of anomaly classes (e.g., normal, dry, wet). This data set extends from the early nineteenth century to 1900 and distinguishes seven anomaly classes, using numbers ranging from -3 to +3 to represent very wet, wet, good rains, normal, dry, drought, and severe drought. The regionalization is based on 90 geographical regions shown via studies of the modern precipitation record to be climatically homogeneous with respect to the interannual variability of rainfall. The regional aggregation allows the voluminous fragmentary information available in historical sources to be used systematically to produce multi-year time series that can be directly integrated into the modern record for each region. The resultant time series can also be subjected to statistical analysis, in order to investigate nineteenth century climate over Africa. Spatial detail is added to the data set by utilizing a unique methodology based on climatic teleconnections established from studies of rainfall variability over Africa. The historical information and station records have been combined into a file containing a regional anomaly value for up to 90 geographic regions and the years 1801-1900. Gaps necessarily remain in the matrix, but as early as the 1820s over 40 regions are represented. By the 1880s generally around 70 regions or more are represented.																			0165-0009					AUG	2001	50	3					317	353		10.1023/A:1010674724320	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1010674724320													WOS:000169327000004

The eels were positioned daily from late April to mid-august, and their diel activity was studied during twenty four 24-h cycles. During day-time, the eels were resting in rootwads or in crevices inside stone walls or in crevices in between rocks. They became more active in the late afternoon but generally did not leave their residence before sunset, except under overcast weather. Activity peaked during the first part of the night then progressively vanished, and always ended before sunrise. The area exploited during night-time never extended over more than 40 m(2), except when the eel changed its residence. The intensity and timing of nocturnal activity and the extent of the daily activity area were: dependent on water temperature (respectively P<0.0001, P<0.05 and P<0.0005), with eels showing little or no activity when the diurnal temperature did not exceed 13 degrees C. Eels showed higher agitation under full moon and maintained their activity later in the night (P < 0.05). The eels showed restricted mobility, and occupied small stream areas (from 0.01 to 0.10 ha) in a non sequential mode, except for two fish which were displaced to the River Meuse by a spate in early June and were never recovered. The length and frequency of net daily journeys were higher (P = 0.005) at water temperatures above 16 degrees C in late May and June, which also corresponded to the period of immigration of eels from the River Meuse. This study thus shows that large yellow eels may adopt a highly sedentary lifestyle in a continental, fast flowing and densely populated environment, even at periods of the year when these stages usually show upstream migrations.					; Baras, Etienne/K-1894-2016	Baras, Etienne/0000-0002-3541-6597; 													0018-8158	1573-5117					1998	372						187	198		10.1023/A:1017072213791	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017072213791													WOS:000076445100023

The influence of habitat shelters, namely the buffering role of closed microhabitat conditions on Alpha diversity and community trait values during a long period of drought, was evaluated across the main habitat types of the park: miombo forests, mixed forests, transitional forests, and grasslands (open savannas). These habitat types comprised a distance gradient in relation to lake Urema, in the center of GNP. Miombo forests were farther from the lake while grasslands and transitional forests were in the floodplain area. Ground beetle communities were sampled using pitfall traps set up at 25 sites of each habitat type along an environmental gradient of tree canopy cover during the last twenty days of the dry season. Higher species richness of ground beetles was found in closed habitat shelters along the distance gradient to lake Urema. A higher functional diversity was also found along the canopy gradient, with larger sized and wingless species being more abundant in closed habitats than in open areas. This result highlights the crucial role of habitat closedness in the protection of sensitive ground beetles. In particular, the buffer effect of tree canopy and the protection of the understory plants and the litter layer was critical for the survival of hygrophilous species and will be key in conservation strategies to face climate aridification and habitat fragmentation.

Traits can vary independently or in an integrated manner, known as trait variation and covariation respectively. It has been hypothesized that a trade-off would emerge along a gradient of abiotic constraints in which trait variation would be favored under resource-rich conditions while covariation under resource-limited ones. Although many studies have provided empirical support for this trade-off, a consensus has not yet emerged, due to a lack of support in some cases. This study investigated variation and covariation in three leaf and four wood traits of 74 woody species from a rainforest, a semideciduous forest, and a Restinga heath vegetation in the Atlantic Forest, which are subjected to different water-related constraints. We asked: Is there a variation-covariation trade-off within and across vegetation types? How does incorporating intraspecific variability change the magnitude and pattern of trait covariation? We found a variation-covariation trade-off and a positive relationship both within and across vegetation types. Wood variation was higher and covariation was lower in the rainforest, likely due to the greater water availability. Conversely, wood trait covariation was higher and variation was lower in the Restinga and seasonal semideciduous forest. Differences between vegetation types are likely related to the species' strategies to prevent hydraulic failure, particularly for Restinga species that adjust their wood density and xylem vessel density in a coordinated manner. Accounting for intraspecific trait variability increased covariation across all vegetation types, particularly in the Restinga. This highlights the loss of functional information when analyses are based solely on species' mean trait values. Our results also contribute to this discussion by providing evidence that the trade-off or a positive relationship between trait variation and covariation may be context-dependent.

J	Frey, SN; Conover, MR				Frey, S. Nicole; Conover, Michael R.			Influence of population reduction on predator home range size and spatial overlap	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The increasing populations of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), raccoons (Procyon lotor), and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) in the Intermountain West have contributed to low waterfowl recruitment in recent decades. This effect prompted the need for predator removal at many waterfowl refuges, such as the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge (BRMBR) in the Great Salt Lake ecosystem. Our study examined the effects of the removal of predatory mammals at the BRMBR on the home range size and spatial overlap of the remaining populations of red foxes, raccoons, and striped skunks. The removal of predators through traps, snares, and night-shooting created a lower predator population during the predators' rearing and dispersal seasons. Predator removal did not result in a change of home range size for red foxes, raccoons, or striped skunks. In all species, home ranges were of similar size during the rearing and dispersal seasons and there were no differences among sexes. After predator removal, the proportion of a home range that overlapped with that of another conspecific decreased in foxes but increased in raccoons. However, predator removal did not change the proportion of inter-specific home range overlap between foxes and raccoons. These findings indicate that home range sizes of these mammalian predators were not constrained by their population densities prior to predator management. In this situation, predator control may be only temporarily successful in reducing predator populations. Managers may achieve more permanent reduction in predator population by decreasing food and shelter resources, thereby reducing the carrying capacity of the landscape.

PASADO Sci Team	Climatic influence of the latest Antarctic isotope maximum of the last glacial period (AIM4) on Southern Patagonia	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												This paper presents the first detailed paleoclimate reconstruction of the latest Antarctic isotope maximum (AIM4, similar to 33-29 ka cal. BP) at 52 degrees S in continental southeastern Argentine Patagonia. High-resolution sedimentological and geochemical analyses of sediments from the maar lake Potrok Aike (PTA) reveal a decrease in the thickness of flood-induced turbidites and a series of wind burst deposits during AIM4, both pointing to increasingly drier conditions. This interpretation is also supported by a significant amount of runoff-driven micropumices incorporated within the sediments that suggests a lower lake level with canyons incising thick tephra deposits around the lake. Increased gustiness and/or dust availability in southeast Patagonia, together with intensified Antarctic circumpolar circulation in the Drake Passage, dust deposition in the Scotia Sea and in Antarctica ice shelf, are consistent with a southward shift of the Southern Westerly Winds (SWW) during the AIM4. In contrast to other warmer AlMs, the SWW during the AIM4 did not migrate far enough south to generate upwelling in the Southern Ocean and they did not reach 52 S in SE Patagonia, as revealed by unchanged values of the rock-magnetic proxy of wind intensity obtained from the same PTA core. Nevertheless, the SWW displacement during AIM4 imposed drier conditions at 52 S in southeast Patagonia likely by blocking precipitation from the Atlantic Ocean, in a way similar to modem seasonal variations and the other Antarctic warm events.

Nevertheless, GW quality appraisal was not given due attention in the current study area (flat terrain part of the Tana sub-basin). This study sought to assess the seasonal and regional physicochemical GW quality parameters for drinking appropriateness using the drinking water quality index (DWQI) and support vector machine (SVM). The main cations in both the dry and wet study seasons were, in decreasing order, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Fe2+, according to the results. Conversely, the main anions were HCO3-, CO32-, Cl- or NO3-, SO42- and PO43-, ordered from higher to lower. During the two research seasons, Ca-HCO3 and Na-HCO3 were the predominant water types based on Piper diagram results. Reverse ion exchange and evaporation were the principal hydrogeochemical processes that control the hydrogeochemistry identified by Durov and Gibbs diagrams, respectively. Excellent GW quality class for drinking was demonstrated by the majority of geographical and seasonal DWQI readings over the two seasons. Nevertheless, during the rainy season, there was a noticeable decline in the GW quality condition around the northern shores of Lake Tana. Therefore, it is advised to implement comprehensive GW quality protection measures and improve system management to mitigate pollution to reduce health hazards in the examined region.

Although patterns in MC occurrence are being recognized, divergences in the global data still hamper our ability to predict the toxicity of cyanobacterial blooms. This study aimed (i) to determine the dynamics of MCs and other cyanopeptides in a tropical reservoir, (ii) to investigate the correlation between peptides and potential cyanotoxin producers (iii) identifying the possible abiotic factors that influence the peptides. We analyzed, monthly, eight MC variants (MC-RR, -LA, -LF, -LR, -LW, -YR, [D-Asp3]-RR and [D-Asp3]-LR) and other peptides in 47 water samples collected monthly, all season long, from two sampling sites in a tropical eutrophic freshwater reservoir, in southeastern Brazil. The cyanopeptides were assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The biomass of potential cyanobacterial producers and water quality variables were measured. MCs were detected in both sampling sites year-round; the total MC concentration varied from 0.21 to 4.04 mu g L-1, and three MC variants were identified and quantified (MC-RR, [D-Asp3]-RR, -LR). Additionally, we identified 28 compounds belonging to three other cyanopeptide classes: aeruginosin, microginin, and cyanopeptolin. As potential MC producers, Microcystis spp. and Dolichospermum circinalis were dominant during the study, representing up to 75% of the total phytoplankton. Correlational and redundancy analysis suggested positive effects of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and total phosphorus on MC and microginins concentration, while water temperature appeared to favor aeruginosins. A comparison between our results and historical data showed a reduction in total phosphorus and cyanobacteria, suggesting increased water quality in the reservoir. However, the current MC concentrations indicate a rise in cyanobacterial toxicity over the last eight years. Moreover, our study underscores the pressing need to explore cyanopeptides other than MCs in tropical aquatic systems.

A bioenergetics-based approach to explain largemouth bass size in tropical reservoirs	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												In tropical systems where largemouth bass Micropterus sabnoides have been introduced, maximum age is reduced to the point where few fish live beyond 3 years and adult growth rates are very slow. Concurrently, tropical largemouth bass have an extended spawning period (up to 8 months) and individual fish spawn multiple times each year. In this study, we examined the relationship between latitude and maximum size (record angler-caught fish) of largemouth bass from temperate to tropical environments and tested the hypothesis that the slow growth of adult largemouth bass is the result of excessive energy reallocation to reproduction. State and national record-sized largemouth bass were plotted against latitude for the USA, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Japan, Portugal (European record), Mexico, and Puerto Rico. Largemouth bass maximum weight increased as latitude decreased from 46.8 degrees N; peak maximum weight occurred at 27.9 degrees N. Below 27.9 degrees N, largemouth bass size records decreased as latitude decreased (R-2 = 0.67, P < 0.0001). Bioenergetics models were used to model observed growth (in Puerto Rico) and predicted growth based on a 2% mean daily ration (MDR), and reproduction scenarios were used to explain the difference between observed and predicted growth. The predicted weight in Puerto Rico was 2.7 times higher than observed weight during a simulated 6-month spawning season. This discrepancy could be accounted for by a range of spawning frequencies (events per season) and levels (percent body weight per spawn) for females (e.g., 10 spawns at 6% body weight per spawn). Similarly, a 15% decrease in MDR of nest-guarding males due to reduced ability to feed accounted for the difference between predicted and observed growth.																			0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2006	135	6					1535	1545		10.1577/T05-258.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/T05-258.1													WOS:000243345500010

This study used the Vertically Generalized Production Model (VGPM) with ocean color satellite data to estimate phytoplankton primary productivity (PP) in Qinghai Lake during the non-freezing period from 2002 to 2023. Field data from 2018 and 2023 were used to calibrate and verify the model. The results showed a seasonal trend in chlorophyll-a and PP, with the lowest values in May and peaks from June to September. Qinghai Lake was identified as oligotrophic, with annual mean chlorophyl-a of 0.24-0.40 mu g/L and PP of 40-369 mg C/m2/day. The spatial distribution of PP was low in the center of the lake and high near the shores and estuaries. An interesting periodic increasing trend in PP every 2 to 4 years was observed from 2002 to 2023. This study established a remote sensing method for PP assessment in Qinghai Lake, revealing seasonal and interannual variations and providing a useful example for monitoring large saline mountain lakes.					; luo, ying/HJP-8548-2023; Xiao, Fei/ITU-5939-2023	Ban, Xuan/0000-0002-8873-2585; 														2073-4441				MAY	2024	16	10							1433	10.3390/w16101433	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16101433													WOS:001231185900001

Investigating the Morphometry and Hydrometeorological Variability of a Fragile Tropical Karstic Lake of the Yucatán Peninsula: Bacalar Lagoon	HYDROLOGY												Comprehensive morphometric and hydrometeorological studies on Bacalar Lagoon, Mexico's largest tropical karstic lake and a significant aquatic system of the Yucat & aacute;n Peninsula, are lacking. This study provides a detailed analysis of its bathymetry, morphometry, and hydrometeorological characteristics. The lake's main basin stretches more than 52.7 km in length, with widths varying from 0.18 km to 2.28 km. It has a volume of 554.4 million cubic meters, with an average depth of 8.85 m, reaching depths of up to 26 m in the north and featuring sub-lacustrine dolines in the south, with depths of 38 m, 48.5 m, and 63.6 m. The study reveals seasonal variations in surface water temperature, closely linked to air temperature (r = 0.89), and immediate responses of water levels to hydrometeorological events. Water level fluctuations also exhibit seasonal patterns that are correlated with regional aquifer conditions, with a lag of 2 months after seasonal rainfall. Interannual variability in rainfall and water levels was observed. From 2010 to 2012, rainfall consistently remained below its mean climatic value, due to a prolonged La Ni & ntilde;a event, while the exceptionally wet conditions in 2020 were also associated with La Ni & ntilde;a. Extreme and anomalous hydrometeorological events, such as those following tropical storm Cristobal in 2020, revealed the fragility of Bacalar Lagoon, causing a notable transformation in lake color and transparency, shifting it from its typical oligotrophic state to eutrophic conditions that lasted longer than a year. These color changes raise questions about the factors impacting ecological health in tropical karstic regions. Additional factors affecting water quality in the BL in 2020, such as deforestation, coastline changes, and urban growth, warrant further investigation. Our study can serve as a starting landmark.

Making temporal dynamics relevant: The role of macrophytes in the phenological complexity of a shallow freshwater lake	ECOHYDROLOGY												A multidisciplinary approach demonstrates how submerged macrophytes generate high phenological variability in Hungary's Lake Balaton. A 239-month time series of water chlorophyll indices derived from Landsat 7 imagery from 1999 to 2019 was used. These data facilitated the generation of area-based phenological patterns, which allowed an assessment of phenological variability by correlating chlorophyll index sequences with spatially adjacent values. The results showed that phenological variability was consistently low (below 5%) at the farthest points from the shore, indicating uniform phenological processes in the pelagic zone of Lake Balaton. Conversely, the littoral zone showed almost eight times higher variability, indicating increased diversity in shallow water areas. In particular, extensive macrophyte biomass datasets revealed a direct relationship between increased phenological variability in the littoral zone and macrophyte biomass (Spearman rank correlation: 0.893). This research highlights contrasting phenological patterns between phytoplankton and macrophyte communities, driven by different life cycles, and the possibility of effectively using satellite data to delineate phenological separation within lakes.

Temporal Assessment of Phosphorus Speciation in a Model Ramsar Lake System in Asia	HYDROLOGY												This study focused on monitoring phosphorus (P) concentrations in the water of the Ramsar site, Lake Vembanad, with a special focus on the mouths of the river bodies draining into the lake, a known hotspot for eutrophication. Four phosphorus fractions-total reactive phosphorus (TRP), total acid hydrolysable phosphorus (TAHP), total organic phosphorus (TOP), and total phosphorus (TP)-were monitored during the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. The results revealed high levels of all monitored phosphorus fractions, with an average concentration exceeding 300 ppb P across both seasons, indicating a highly eutrophic state. Notably, TRP, TOP, and TP showed high concentrations in both the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods. These data suggest significant phosphorus input into the lake's surface water, potentially triggering excessive algal growth and threatening the biodiversity of this rich wetland ecosystem.

Halophilic Algal-Bacterial and Cyanobacterial Communities and Their Role in Carbonate Precipitation	PALEONTOLOGICAL JOURNAL												This work studies the diversity of cyanobacterial and algal-bacterial communities of saline water bodies in the Crimean Peninsula and Altai Region. Plant-bacterial communities are described for the first time. The dependence of the production and destruction on the season and salinity of the water body is shown. The development of planktonic cyanobacteria is related to the presence of zooplankton, the development of which is controlled by hydrogen sulfide. The high hydrogen sulfide tolerance of benthic cyanobacteria secures the integrity of cyanobacterial communities. Observations in nature and laboratory modeling show that the formation of mineral layers is restricted to conditions of supersaturation with mineral components. Carbonate precipitation can take place in cyanobacterial communities under conditions of mixing sea water enriched with Ca and Mg with continental water enriched with sodium carbonate. Cyanobacteria are able to form and transform various Ca-Mg-carbonates. Dolomite formation is a derived process that occurs in cyanobacterial mats in the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Carbonatization of cyanobacterial cells is considered using the example of the unicellular halophilic-alkaliphilic cyanobacterium Euhalothece sp. The accomplished study is of certain interest for interpretation of geological and paleontological data in the context of the supposed analogy between cyanobacterial mats and ancient stromatolites.

Data comprise a total monthly fish catch in tonnes from January 1977 to December 2006. We fitted an observation-driven model to the logarithm of the total monthly fish catch. The model contains seasonal effects and time-lagged terms for the preceding two months. We obtained an r-squared of 51% with both the seasonal and time-lagged coefficients which was statistically significant. Although the catch has decreased substantially in the last ten years, no long-term trend is evident. This model can be used for short-term and possibly medium-term fish catch forecasting. The catch in the Songkhla Lake basin may have exceeded the sustainable capacity due to over-exploitation and illegal fishing. Strengthening the political will to develop enforceable and sustainable fishing practices is therefore desirable.

Diel variation in food intake and diet composition of three native fish species in floodplain lagoons of the Macintyre River, Australia	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												The feeding periodicity of three species of fishes in floodplain lagoons of the Macintyre River varied during 24 h cycles. However, peak feeding activity (around midday and late afternoon) was similar among the species studied, despite differences in their trophic position. In contrast, sampling season and site seemed to have a stronger effect on the composition of the diet than time of day. These findings have implications for studies of trophic dynamics and food web structure in floodplain Lagoons.

J	Vallet, M				Vallet, Marine			Chemical ecology of plankton parasitism in algae	BOTANICA MARINA												Plankton parasites such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and unicellular eukaryotes are associated symbionts colonizing algal groups in aquatic ecosystems. They occur within a network of microbe-microbe interactions in which they parasitize phytoplankton and seaweeds, i.e., primary producers generating organic carbon and forming the basis of marine food webs. These parasites use algae as a source of nutrients and reproduce at the expense of their host, causing infectious symptoms leading to disease and death. Plankton parasites can reduce the algal populations, and the infection of one specific species may, in turn, favor the development of another, influencing the seasonal succession of algal blooms in oceans, seas, and lakes. Many parasites have free-living stages that zooplankton graze upon, representing a significant trophic link in food webs. The biology and life cycle of plankton parasites are well investigated in marine and freshwater algal hosts. Still, the chemical signaling mediating these microbial interactions and the effect of co-occurring symbionts remain underexplored. This review focuses on the diversity of plankton parasites infecting algae, with a particular emphasis on unicellular eukaryotes. The ecological role of plankton parasites, the mechanisms regulating cellular infection and host resistance, and the interplay of alga-parasite interactions with coexisting microorganisms are discussed.					; Vallet, Marine/AAU-7467-2021	Vallet, Marine/0000-0002-6878-0459; 													0006-8055	1437-4323				JUN 25	2024	67	3					211	229		10.1515/bot-2023-0062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/bot-2023-0062		APR 2024											WOS:001209062400001

In this study, we focus on the fossil -rich Zhuanchengzi Bed near Yingwoshan, and describe laminated lacustrine successions that show prominent rhythmites to understand subdecadal palaeoclimate variability. We highlight the cyclicity preserved at a millimetre -scale based on analysis of the rhythmic alterations between the light- and dark -coloured carbonate-siliciclastic layers. Coupling petrographic with phase -specific geochemical analyses, we infer these laminated successions represent varves. The light-coloured layers of the couplets, containing dolomitedominated carbonates, developed during warm seasons as a result of chemical precipitation enhanced by photosynthetic activities and rhythmic changes in the ambient water properties. The dark -coloured layers are mostly composed of siliciclastic and clay minerals representing terrestrial input during cold seasons. Varve thickness variations likely record seasonal climate changes regulated by ancient Asian Monsoons and decadelevel cyclicities, such as ENSO-like and solar cycles. Overall, the varve records in the Yixian Formation offer a novel perspective on the palaeoseasonality of the Jehol Biota and provide insights into the dominant climate mode over interannual time scales of the Early Cretaceous greenhouse world.					; Gao, yuan/HLH-1794-2023; Tian, Xingliang/GLU-3672-2022	Huang, He/0000-0002-5744-4273; 													0031-0182	1872-616X				JUL 15	2024	646								112241	10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112241	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.palaeo.2024.112241		APR 2024											WOS:001235873800001
J	Cózar, A; García, CM; Gálvez, JA				Cózar, A; García, CM; Gálvez, JA			Analysis of plankton size spectra irregularities in two subtropical shallow lakes (Esteros del Ibera, Argentina)	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Biomass irregularities in the plankton size spectra of two subtropical shallow lakes have been quantified assuming the classical observed generalities of the size spectra. During a seasonal cycle, three main functional size ranges determined the allocation of the spectra irregularities: microbial food web, nanoplankton-microplankton autotrophs, and herbivorous organisms. The structural adjustments within these trophic positions responded to the internal competition between functional guilds, mainly as the result of size-based characteristics related to the ability to eat and the susceptibility to be eaten. Despite the existence of a typical spectrum undulation resulting from self-organization (well-defined trophic positions, limnetic-benthic interaction), the biomass irregularities were an indicator of the main interactions disturbing the steady state. The mechanisms responsible for the irregularities operated jointly at ecosystem and individual levels. Thus, the irregular spectra of the eutrophic Laguna Ibera suggested a strong top-down control through cascade effects. Specific properties of peculiar organisms like filamentous cyanobacteria contributed to hold these stable irregularities. The higher spectrum regularity of the meso-oligotrophic Laguna Galarza emerged from a more balanced flow of biomass along the food chain.

J	Itoh, N; Tani, Y; Nagatani, T; Soma, M				Itoh, N; Tani, Y; Nagatani, T; Soma, M			Phototrophic activity and redox condition in Lake Hamana, Japan, indicated by sedimentary photosynthetic pigments and molybdenum over the last ∼250 years	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												We analyzed photosynthetic pigments, total organic carbon (TOC), biogenic silica, and Mo, a redox-sensitive element, in Pb-210-dated sediment cores to reconstruct the historical changes in primary productivity and anoxia in the central basin of Lake Hamana, a brackish lake in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, over the last similar to250 years. The algal photosynthetic pigments we analyzed included chlorophyll a (and its derivatives), chlorophyll b (and its derivatives), and carotenoids such as beta-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, diatoxanthin, fucoxanthin, alloxanthin, and alpha-carotene. Marker pigments for phototrophic sulfur bacteria were also recorded, including okenone and bacteriopheophytin a, originating from Chromatium (a genus of purple sulfur bacteria), and isorenieratene and bacteriochlorophylls e(1), e(2) and e(3) (and corresponding bacteriopheophytins) from brown Chlorobium (a brown-colored group of green sulfur bacteria). The occurrence of these pigments throughout the length of all cores indicates that the anoxia in Lake Hamana has existed over at least the last similar to250 years. The indicators related to primary productivity - TOC and pigments of aerobic and anaerobic phototrophs - and an indicator of anoxia, Mo, increased after similar to1860, indicating that productivity had increased in both the oxic and anoxic (sulfidic) zones. The depth profiles of the indicators in the sediment cores showed that among phototrophic sulfur bacteria, Chromatium preferentially increased relative to brown Chlorobium when the lake productivity was high, and hence high anoxia existed in the lake. This can be explained by a shallowing of the oxic/anoxic boundary zone due to changes in temporal and/or spatial extents of seasonal anoxia, which made the light intensity in the upper anoxic zone high enough for Chromatium to grow. The upper Chromatium layer may absorb the wavelengths of light that favor the growth of brown Chlorobium in the water column, resulting in a relative decrease in brown Chlorobium. During the 1950s, the trends among the indicators changed significantly. This change is attributed to the construction of training walls, built to direct tidal currents into the lake, on the Imagire-guchi Channel, the sole inlet of seawater to the lake, during 1954 - 1956, and the resultant increases of seawater intrusion and lake salinity. A decrease in okenone and bacteriopheophytin a, or in okenone/isorenieratene ratio, after similar to1960 accompanying a decrease in Mo, is attributed to a deepening of the anoxic zone, where the light intensity became too low for growth of Chromatium, more light-demanding than the brown Chlorobium. A decrease of zeaxanthin (cyanobacteria) after similar to1960 relative to lutein (green algae) and diatoxanthin (diatoms and dinoflagellates) indicated a change in algal assemblage, presumably due to the increased salinity. Principal component analysis with a data set of total algal carotenoids, okenone, isorenieratene, and Mo also suggested that a major change occurred around the 1950s.

However, the health of individual honey bees and their colonies is under pressure due to multiple stressors, including viruses as a significant threat to bees. Monitoring various virus infections could be a crucial selection tool during queen rearing. In the present study, samples from all developmental stages (eggs, larvae, pupae, and queens) were screened for the incidence of seven viruses during queen rearing in Slovenia. The screening of a total of 108 samples from five queen breeders was performed by the RT-qPCR assays. The results showed that the highest incidence was observed for black queen cell virus (BQCV), Lake Sinai virus 3 (LSV3), deformed wing virus B (DWV-B), and sacbrood virus (SBV). The highest viral load was detected in queens (6.07 log10 copies/queen) and larvae (5.50 log10 copies/larva) for BQCV, followed by SBV in larvae (5.47 log10 copies/larva). When comparing all the honey bee developmental stages, the eggs exhibited general screening for virus incidence and load in queen mother colonies. The results suggest that analyzing eggs is a good indicator of resilience to virus infection during queen development.					de Graaf, Dirk/HGD-4017-2022; Verbeke, Wim/F-8373-2010; da Costa Domingues, Caio Eduardo/V-4142-2017; Domingues, Caio Eduardo/V-4142-2017; Simenc, Laura/MBG-1304-2025; De Smet, Lina/A-7354-2013	da Costa Domingues, Caio Eduardo/0000-0001-8575-2735; 													2045-2322					APR 26	2024	14	1							9612	10.1038/s41598-024-60135-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-60135-1								38671077					WOS:001211019400089

To illustrate this issue, we sequenced clone libraries of the first adenylation domain of mcyB (mcyBA1) from Microcystis populations in a plateau lake. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two divergent groups of McyBA1 with two closely related subgroups within Group I. While neutral evolution was indicated on the whole McyBA1 domain, 1-5 recombination breakpoints and several codons under positive or negative selections were found. Significant seasonal changes of McyBA1 diversity were observed. Group I composed the major proportion of the McyBA1 pool throughout the growing season in the whole lake. Group IA and Group II denominated Microcystis strains isolated from this lake were characterized by preference production of microcystin-RR (62-85%) and microcystin-LR (>98%) respectively. We detected the intracellular microcystins in lake water and microcystin-RR was a main variant (mostly>50%). In summary, McyBA1 subgroups were dominant within the population of toxic Microcystis and contributed the predominance of microcystin-RR in the lake. The differences of substrate preference in microcystin biosynthesis among groups were caused by neutral evolution and homologous recombination.

Two model grid spacings are tested, 50 and 20 km, the simulation period is 1989-2008 and the lateral boundary conditions are from the ERA-Interim reanalysis of observations. The model is validated against atmospheric as well as lake variables. The model performance in reproducing precipitation and temperature mean seasonal climatology, seasonal cycles and interannual variability is generally good, with the model results being mostly within the observational uncertainty range. The model appears to overestimate cloudiness and underestimate surface radiation, although a large observational uncertainty is found in these variables. The 1D distributed lake model (run at each grid point of the lake area) reproduces the observed lake-average sea surface temperature (SST), although differences compared to observations are found in the spatial structure of the SST, most likely as a result of the absence of 3 dimensional lake water circulations. The evolution of lake ice cover and near surface wind over the lake area is also reproduced by the model reasonably well. Improvements resulting from the increase of resolution from 50 to 20 km are most significant in the lake model. Overall the performance of the coupled regional climate-1D lake model system appears to be of sufficient quality for application to climate change scenario simulations over the Caspian Sea Basin.					; Turuncoglu, Ufuk/B-5908-2011; Giuliani, Graziano/ABD-7431-2021; Giorgi, Filippo/C-3169-2013	Turuncoglu, Ufuk Utku/0000-0001-5499-7326; 													0930-7575	1432-0894				OCT	2013	41	7-8					1731	1748		10.1007/s00382-012-1623-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-012-1623-6													WOS:000324812200003

These systems are almost the only epigean source of fresh water available in this region. In spite of their biological importance, little is known about the morphometric and limnologic characteristics of these karstic systems. We measured limnological variables in eight cenotes in central Quintana Roo during February-May, 2001. Zooplankton biomass and chlorophyll a were also measured in order to determine if the behavior of primary and secondary production was related to environmental parameters. Important short-term changes were observed in nutrients (NO3-, NO2-, PO43-), biomass, and chlorophyll a. The morphometrically conditioned productivity (MCP), which evaluates the cumulative effect of several morphometric variables on production (area, maximum length, shoreline development, perimeter), showed a negative correlation with respect to zooplankton biomass, as did also both pH and temperature. Conversely, NO3- and NO2- had a positive correlation with zooplankton biomass. No correlation was found for chlorophyll a. Significant differences in NO3- (F = 61.52, p < 0.001), NO2- (F = 7.36, p < 0.001), zooplankton biomass (F = 17.57, p < 0.001), chlorophyll a (F = 62.19, p < 0.001), and conductivity (F = 497.49, p < 0.001) were found among the systems. These results indicate the existence of sharp differences between these karstic systems (oligotrophic, with smaller area, deep and less productive) and non-karstic ones, (eutrophic, larger area, shallow and more productive) but are similar to previous data from other karstic systems of Mexico and other parts of the world. However, understanding of these fragile tropical systems is in the initial phase. It is necessary to increase the intensity of these studies in order to allow a full explanation of their limnological behavior.

Exceedingly high mortalities occurred at Fulton River and in three spawning channels adjacent to Babine Lake. During these 2 years, the infection and subsequent death of prespawning adults resulted in an estimated 153.6 million fewer sockeye salmon fry produced from Fulton River and the three spawning channels adjacent to Babine Lake than the historical average. Resident fish were the most likely source of the parasite in the watershed because several species were found with light infections of I. multifiliis. Transmission of the parasite to anadromous sockeye salmon was enhanced by the high density of fish held below the spawning grounds for days or weeks prior to moving into the spawning channel. This is the first report of an epizootic of ichthyophthiriasis in wild spawning salmon.																			0899-7659					JUN	1998	10	2					143	151		10.1577/1548-8667(1998)010<0143:IMIEIS>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8667(1998)010<0143:IMIEIS>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000074170300008

However, the general importance of protozoans and bacteria as food sources for rotifers, a major component of planktonic habitats, has seldom been evaluated. Results of feeding experiments and the analysis of the food size spectrum of rotifers suggest that larger bacteria, heterotrophic flagellates and small ciliates should be a common part of the food of most rotifer species. About 10-40 per cent of rotifers' food can consist of heterotrophic organisms of the microbial web. Field experiments have indicated that rotifer grazing should generally play a minor role in bacteria consumption compared to feeding by coexisting protozoans. However, according to recent experiments regarding food selection, rotifers should be efficient predators on protozoans. Laboratory experiments have revealed that even nanophagous rotifers can feed on ciliates. Preliminary microcosm and chemostat experiments have indicated that rotifers, due to their relatively low community grazing rates compared to the growth rates of bacteria and protozoans, should generally not be able (in contrast to some cladocerans) to suppress the microbial web via grazing, though they may structure it. Filter-feeding nanophagous rotifers (e.g. brachionids) seem to be significant feeders on the smaller organisms of the microbial web (bacteria, flagellates, small ciliates), whereas grasping species (e.g. synchaetids and asplanchnids) seem to be efficient predators on larger organisms (esp. ciliates). Another important role of rotifers is their feedback effect on the microbial web. Rotifers provide degraded algae, bacteria and protozoans to the microbial web and may promote microbial activity. Additional experimental work is necessary for a better understanding of the function of rotifers in aquatic ecosystems.

In Scotland, there are more than 8000 standing waters, defined as lakes and reservoirs that have a surface area of more than 1 hectare. Only about 330 of these are monitored routinely to assess compliance with the WFD. The export coefficient tool PLUS+ (phosphorus land use and slope) has been developed to estimate total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in the unmonitored sites; modelled values are then compared to WFD target concentrations for high, good, moderate, poor, and bad status to assess compliance. These type-specific or site-specific targets are set by the regulatory authority and form part of a suite of physical, chemical, and ecological targets that are used to assess GES, all of which must be met. During development, the PLUS+ tool was applied to 323 monitored catchments and 7471 unmonitored catchments. The efficacy of the tool was assessed against TP concentrations observed in 2014 and found to perform well in the rural catchments. 51% of standing waters had the same modelled and observed WFD class (i.e., High, Good, Moderate, Poor, Bad), and a further 40% of standing waters had a modelled WFD class that was within one class of observed water quality. The tool performed less well in catchments with larger inputs of TP from urban sources (e.g., sewage). The greatest deviations between measured and modelled classes were explained by the shortage of information on wastewater treatment works, fish farms, migratory birds, levels of uncertainty in TP measurements, and the amount of in-lake re-cycling of P. The limitations of the tool are assessed using data from six well documented case study sites and recommendations for improving the model performance are proposed.					; May, Linda/D-7943-2011	Donnelly, David/0000-0001-5802-0491; May, Linda/0000-0003-3385-9973														1660-4601				JAN 2	2020	17	2							391	10.3390/ijerph17020391	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17020391								31936077					WOS:000516827400012
J	Becker, A; Lowry, MB; Taylor, MD				Becker, Alistair; Lowry, Michael B.; Taylor, Matthew D.			Scales of spatial and temporal variation of small bodied nekton within intermittently closed/open lakes and lagoons (ICOLLs) in south-eastern Australia	REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE												Intermittently open/closed lakes and lagoons (ICOLLs) are common in temperate regions of the southern hemisphere and are also found in parts Europe and North America. They are important nursery grounds for a variety of fish and crustacean species, and while they are regularly studied for a variety of purposes, dedicated analysis aimed at identifying levels of spatial and temporal variance, particularly for abundant smaller nekton are lacking. A hierarchical study was undertaken using cast nets, spanning four estuaries at multiple nested spatial and temporal scales to determine at which levels greater variation occurs. The four most common species including Glassfish (Ambassis jacksoniensis), Small-mouth Hardyhead (Atherinosoma microstoma), Eastern King Prawn (Penaeus plebejus) and Glass Shrimp (Macrobrachium intermedium) were considered separately. A consistent pattern emerged where high levels of spatial variance occurred among individual samples, while the least was generally observed among sites nested within estuaries. A similar pattern occurred when the nekton community was considered as a whole. However levels of residual variation were reduced by pooling individual casts into fewer replicates from each site, resulting most notably in an increase in the variation attributed to the Estuary scale. This produced a good balance in capturing both the small scale variation and broader patterns among estuaries. Temporal levels of variation were lower than the spatial observations for all four common species, as well as the community as a whole. However, greater variation was observed among seasons compared to months nested within seasons. These findings should provide guidance for future studies in ICOLLs where an efficient sampling program would focus on increased replicate samples within a site rather than sampling a large number of sites within a system and focus on seasonal variation.

J	de Oliveira, SA; Ferragut, C; Bicudo, CED				de Oliveira, Simone Alves; Ferragut, Carla; de Mattos Bicudo, Carlos Eduardo			Relationship between phytoplankton structure and environmental variables in tropical reservoirs with different trophic states	ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA												Phytoplankton structure is influenced by environmental factors, seasonal cycles and the trophic state of the system. The objective of the present study was to identify guilds of phytoplankton species that are representative of seasonality and trophic status. We evaluated phytoplankton biomass and species composition in five tropical reservoirs, with different trophic states and during rainy and dry periods. At most of the sampling sites, total biomass was higher during the rainy season. Moreover, high cyanobacterial biomass was observed in all reservoirs except for one of the mesotrophic reservoirs, which had no significant contribution from the group. Phytoplankton guilds associated with the trophic gradient and seasonality were identified. Additionally, trophic status was determined to be the most important community structure factor. The results emphasize the importance of taxonomic identification when monitoring phytoplankton structure and autoecology. Furthermore, these aquatic organisms are highly sensitive to environmental variations, making them useful tools for evaluating and/or monitoring the ecological condition of aquatic ecosystems.					de Oliveira, Simone/JHT-9351-2023; Ferragut, Carla/B-9875-2012; Bicudo, Carlos/D-2302-2015	Ferragut, Carla/0000-0002-4313-1436; Bicudo, Carlos/0000-0003-4030-9961													0102-3306	1677-941X				JAN-MAR	2020	34	1					83	93		10.1590/0102-33062019abb0207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0102-33062019abb0207													WOS:000521733100009

Deposition gauges were employed to collect both dry and wet deposition samples of particulate matter between 2018 and 2019. Elemental compositions of particulates collected during the sampling period were analyzed using Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (ED-XRF). The deposition fluxes of crustal and anthropogenic trace elements were also determined using standard methods. Results showed that in dry season, iron has the highest mean concentration (3283.61 mg/kg), while chromium has the lowest (0.023 mg/kg). On the other hand, in wet season, silicon and nickel have the highest and lowest mean concentrations of 159.34 mg/kg and 0.01 mg/kg respectively. Although the concentrations of these metals were higher in the dry season than wet season, there was no statistical significant difference between the mean concentrations of the elements measured in each season of the year (p > 0.05). The compositions of some of the elements in the particulate matters were found to be far above the recommended exposure limits prescribed by OSHA. The study concluded that the elemental composition of particulate matter in the airshed of the University Farm adversely impacts the ambient air quality of the Community.					; Sonibare, Jacob/AAB-7604-2022; Fakinle, Bamidele/AAU-4869-2020	ODEKANLE, EBENEZER LEKE/0000-0002-1260-0383; Fakinle, Bamidele/0000-0002-1465-7850; 														2405-8440				JAN	2020	6	1							e03216	10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03216	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03216								32042966					WOS:000510380200175

This study is conducted to produce Lake Chini water level prediction model by comparing several algorithms using data mining approach via classification techniques. Data from seven observation stations between 2011 and 2014 are collected from Pusat Penyelidikan Tasik Chini, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia and data from Melai station in particular is used for this purpose. The collected time series data is complex and high in dimensionality thus leading to low efficiency in data mining process. The analysis comprises of four phases that include data collection, data pre-processing, data mining and model development and interpretation and evaluation of patterns. To overcome high dimensional time series, dimensionality reduction approach such as Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) and Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) are applied while three classification techniques namely Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine are used to classify the data. Performance measures for each of the algorithms are evaluated and compared to select the most suitable model for the prediction.					; Othman, Zalinda/AAJ-7150-2020	Othman, Zalinda/0000-0001-9142-3612; 													1876-1100	1876-1119	978-981-15-0058-9; 978-981-15-0057-2				2020	603						215	226		10.1007/978-981-15-0058-9_21	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-0058-9_21													WOS:000612990300021

Phosphorus dynamics in a subtropical coastal lake in Southern Brazil	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Temporal and spatial variations of organic and inorganic forms of phosphorus in the sediments of a subtropical oligo-mesotrophic shallow lake were investigated in relation to water column parameters, sediment characteristics and benthic fauna. The main results found were: i) Phosphorus (P) concentration varied seasonally, with organic P and total P increasing in the sediments in warmer periods; i) Sediment spatial variation, in terms of grain size composition and organic matter content, influenced P concentrations; iii) quantities and qualities of P in the sediments were positively correlated with water parameters, especially DO and NO3, Chl-a, water temperature, pH, and total P. Negative correlations were observed between %OP and DO in sites 1, 3 and 4, and with NO3 in sites 2, 3 and 4; iv) benthic functional feeding groups showed significant relationships with temporal variation in sediment P concentration, including gathering-collectors, shredders, filterers and filtering-collectors. The results suggest a high importance of temperature mediated control of sediment-P release, both directly, through its direct effects on primary production and decomposition rates, and indirectly through its effects on other water and sediment parameters, especially dissolved oxygen concentration.

During rainy seasons, they form lakes where various species of fish live. Fish that live in amalgamation lakes or near streams may obtain contaminated water from mercury. Therefore, the aims of this research was to investigate the species of parasites as well as the condition of tilapia that live in the former pool of gold mining in Bombana Regency, Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. The samples that were used were tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus) with a total sample size of 40 fish. Fish condition factor was evaluated on the basis of body weight and length data. Examination of ectoparasites and endoparasites were performed on fish for prevalence and intensity parameters, while the measurements of heavy metals Hg were carried out on water and sediment and sampled four times. Based on the research results, three species of parasites attacking on external body of fish (ectoparasites) were found, namely Dactylogyrus sp., Ergasilus sp., and Microsporidia (Glugea sp.). Prevalence of those three parasites ranged from 10-90%, while intensity ranged from 1.7-3.5 parasite/fish. Condition factor of tilapia was between 2.70-3.81. Moreover, an average of Hg concentration was higher in sediment (0.167 ppm) than in water (0.039 ppm). Although it seems that the presence of parasites in fish is still relatively low and fish shows normal growth, people should not consume fish live in ex-mining ponds often for the health of the local community.					; IDRIS, MUHAMMAD/KEI-8255-2024; NUR, INDRIYANI/AHI-7350-2022	Suriana, Suriana/0000-0002-8301-5413; IDRIS, MUHAMMAD/0000-0003-4142-5585; Yusnaini, Yusnaini/0000-0002-8233-1924; 													1755-1307						2020	465								012042	10.1088/1755-1315/465/1/012042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/465/1/012042													WOS:000607205000042

The Mirim Lagoon watershed is one of the main transboundary basins in South America and is of great economic importance for the region because its waters are used for irrigation of rice fields and for the potable water supply to populations close to it, in this way, these uses may affect the quality of the basin waters. The data used in the study were provided and collected by the Mirim Lagoon Development Agency. Water quality parameters were selected in a five-year database and submitted to statistical tests that demonstrated their distinctions throughout the climatic seasons. The results showed that the parameters temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen and total phosphorus differ statically between the four climatic seasons. Were also identified four discriminative parameters between the seasons, being them dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen and total phosphorus. In this way, it can be concluded that the seasonality mainly affects anthropogenic pollution sources such as agricultural activities and domestic discharges.					; Guedes, Hugo/I-5007-2014	Pinto, Fernanda/0000-0002-8946-456X; Guedes, Hugo/0000-0002-3592-9595; Kruger Bork, Carina/0000-0003-3068-4303													0001-3765	1678-2690					2020	92	3							e20181107	10.1590/0001-3765202020181107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0001-3765202020181107								32785462					WOS:000562141700001

To help identify and characterize potential breeding grounds for mosquitoes, we utilize freely available satellite image data and software in combination with a mosquito trap system. Multispectral time-series analysis of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 5-8 satellite images of Lake Schmiechen (Swabian Alb, southern Germany), used here as a pilot and analog site for other lake and wetland areas potentially populated by malaria vector mosquitoes, reveals non-seasonal periods of flooding and drying and concomitant changes in the distribution of open shallow water. Water distribution maps are derived from spectral indices commonly used for wetland mapping (e.g., the NDWI2) and should be ground-truthed. In combination with the identification and counting of mosquitoes and the integration of other environmental parameters on-site, this approach provides a powerful tool to remotely monitor relatively small bodies and narrow networks of open shallow water that may provide habitats for mosquitoes. Combined remote sensing and on-site monitoring of potential malaria vector habitats can be implemented at low cost and with little effort in regions worldwide where the disease is established or emerging, and can be used to create or refine risk maps on small to large scales. The present approach can, moreover, complement public health programs and humanitarian efforts to fight insect-borne diseases.					; Holl, Felix/Y-9648-2019	Fotteler, Marina Liselotte/0000-0002-1225-1857; Holl, Felix/0000-0002-4020-9509													2377-6919		978-1-7281-7388-7				2020										10.1109/GHTC46280.2020.9342952	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/GHTC46280.2020.9342952													WOS:000657247100100
S	Srichandan, S; Rastogi, G		Finlayson, CM; Rastogi, G; Mishra, DR; Pattnaik, AK		Srichandan, Suchismita; Rastogi, Gurdeep			Spatiotemporal Assessment of Phytoplankton Communities in the Chilika Lagoon	ECOLOGY, CONSERVATION, AND RESTORATION OF CHILIKA LAGOON, INDIA	Wetlands Ecology Conservation and Management											Phytoplankton are the primary producers in aquatic ecosystem and play crucial role in the nutrient cycling, carbon fixation, and regulating the overall food-web dynamics. In addition to ensuring ecological services, phytoplankton species composition is also considered an efficient bio-indicator of the water quality. Thus, phytoplankton composition, diversity, and their distribution could be used as a biological proxy to assess the ecological health of a water body. Considering the ecological significance of phytoplankton, various studies have targeted them to understand their spatiotemporal variation and environmental drivers in the Chilika lagoon. Phytoplankton community structure of Chilika lagoon is influenced by several environmental factors (nutrients, light, and salinity) of which salinity predominantly determines the composition and distribution of phytoplankton communities. In Chilika lagoon, spatial variation in salinity regime provides a variety of habitats (e.g. oligohaline (0-5 ppt), mesohaline (5-18 ppt), and polyhaline (>18 ppt)) for the proliferation of freshwater, estuarine, and marine phytoplankton forms. Based on the published literature, a total of 739 phytoplankton species have been documented from the Chilika lagoon, which included a diverse assemblage of species spectrum represented by Bacillariophyta (270 species), Dinophyta (88 species), Cyanophyta (103 species), Chlorophyta (178 species), Euglenophyta (92 species), Chrysophyta (5 species) and Xanthophyta (3 species). Among these, Bacillariophyta has been shown to be the most diverse and abundant in the phytoplankton communities. The total inventory of 709 phytoplankton species during the post-restoration study (2000-2014) included 612 new records which were documented for the first time from Chilika lagoon. Long-term systemic monitoring of phytoplankton is essential to understand their intrinsic spatiotemporal variability and also to recover maximum species diversity in lagoon. Further, continuous and detailed observation of phytoplankton community is necessary to monitor the occurrence of toxic species and harmful algal blooms. In addition to the application of classical microscopy based taxonomic approach to document phytoplankton species diversity, efforts should also be directed to integrate the molecular tools such as high-throughput DNA sequencing to understand the genetic diversity of smaller size nano-phytoplankton and pico- phytoplankton in the lagoon ecosystem.

The objective of this study was to assess the input of the offshore zone to the total fish production. Hydroacoustics in areas > 5 m deep were sampled during the cold-dry season for 2 consecutive years. Results showed low fish densities (200-300 ind. ha(-1)), low biomass ( < 1 kg ha(-1)) and fish of small sizes (approximately 6 cm) in deep zones. Fish stock in the pelagic zone was concentrated between 2 and 13 m depth. The low colonization by fish was corroborated by the small catches achieved by experimental fishing in this part of the reservoir. This study has highlighted the limited contribution of the pelagic zone of a large neo-reservoir to fish production (low density, low biomass and few commercial species) when the reservoir was at its maximal water level. This study suggests that future management actions should mainly focus on the littoral zone.

These changes have serious impacts on the local ecological environment and the stability of engineering infrastructures. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is used to detect permafrost active layer depth, the upper limit of permafrost and the thawing of permafrost with the season's changes. Due to the influence of complex structure in the permafrost layer, it is difficult to effectively characterize the accurate structure within the permafrost on the radar profile. In order to get the high resolution GPR profile in the Tibetan Plateau, the reverse time migration (RTM) imaging method was applied to GPR real data. In this paper, RTM algorithm is proven to be correct through the groove's model of forward modeling data. In the Beiluhe region, the imaging result of GPR RTM profiles show that the RTM of GPR makes use of diffracted energy to properly position the reflections caused by the gravels, pebbles, cobbles and small discontinuities. It can accurately determine the depth of the active layer bottom interface in the migration section. In order to prove the accuracy of interpretation results of real data RTM section, we set up the three dielectric constant models based on the real data RTM profiles and geological information, and obtained the model data RTM profiles, which can prove the accuracy of interpretation results of three-line RTM profiles. The results of three-line RTM bears great significance for the study of complex structure and freezing and thawing process of permafrost at the Beiluhe region on the Tibetan Plateau.

The samples were from the Nam Ngiep (NN) River and Bueng Khong Long (BKL) Swamp, which are the representative of the lotic- and lentic-environments, respectively. These two habitats lay in the same geographical area but on the opposite banks of the Mekong mainstream. The samplings were conducted between May 2017 and April 2018. There were 365 H. dispar, 259 H. macrolepidofa and 298 O. vittatus samples in this study. The condition index of all three species were beyond 90% implying they can live well in both lotic and lentic environments. Reproductions of all three species were taken place in both environments with two peaks at the onset and end of rainy season. The samples from BKL showed early maturation than NN samples in all three (3) species. Feeding plasticity, though dominant by insects, was observed in Hampala spp., while O. vittatus can utilise any available detritus in both environments. Results clearly show that all the three selected non-obligatory riverine fish species can live very well in either lotic or lentic environments and imply that they can adjust themselves to reservoir environment.					; Jutagate, Tuantong/HJI-4778-2023	Jutagate, Achara/0009-0007-4835-3285; 													1985-3718	2180-4249					2020	31	2					159	173		10.21315/tlsr2020.31.2.8	http://dx.doi.org/10.21315/tlsr2020.31.2.8								32922673					WOS:000557902900008

Geographic variation in the flood-induced fluctuating temperature requirement for germination in Setaria parviflora seeds	PLANT BIOLOGY												Our aim was to search for specific seed germinative strategies related to flooding escape in Setaria parviflora, a common species across the Americas. For this purpose, we investigated induction after floods, in relation to fluctuating temperature requirements for germination in seeds from mountain, floodplain and successional grasslands. A laboratory experiment was conducted in which seeds were imbibed or immersed in water at 5 degrees C. Seeds were also buried in flood-prone and upland grasslands and exhumed during the flooding season. Additionally, seeds were buried in flooded or drained grassland mesocosms. Germination of exhumed seeds was assayed at 25 degrees C or at 20 degrees C/30 degrees C in the dark or in the presence of red light pulses. After submergence or soil flooding, a high fraction (>32%) of seeds from the floodplain required fluctuating temperatures to germinate. In contrast, seeds from the mountains showed maximum differences in germination between fluctuating and constant temperature treatment only after imbibition (35%) or in non-flooded soil conditions (40%). The fluctuating temperature requirement was not clearly related to the foregoing conditions in the successional grassland seeds. Maximum germination could also be attained with red light pulses to seeds from mountain and successional grasslands. Results show that the fluctuating temperature requirement might help floodplain seeds to germinate after floods, indicating a unique feature of the dormancy of S. parviflora seeds from floodplains, which suggests an adaptive advantage aimed at postponing emergence during inundation periods. In contrast, the fluctuating temperature required for germination among seeds from mountain and successional grasslands show its importance for gap detection.																			1435-8603					JUL	2011	13	4					660	666		10.1111/j.1438-8677.2010.00417.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1438-8677.2010.00417.x								21668607					WOS:000291679100012

Fish and hemipterans had the most MeHg on a wet weight basis, with levels exceeding 30 ng g(-1). The magnitude of MeHg accumulation in biota varies seasonally and does not always appear to be associated with changes in water column concentration. This is exemplified by periphyton, the base of the foodweb in the Everglades, at a high nutrient sampling site. Although limited in scope, MeHg concentrations presented for biota provide insight into beginning to understand the dynamic nature of Hg transfer in the Everglades foodweb on a spatial and temporal basis.

J	Urban, NR; Dinkel, C; Wehrli, B				Urban, NR; Dinkel, C; Wehrli, B			Solute transfer across the sediment surface of a eutrophic lake .1. Porewater profiles from dialysis samplers	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Porewater profiles often are used to identify and quantify important biogeochemical processes occurring in lake sediments. In this study, multiple porewater profiles were obtained from two eutrophic Swiss lakes using porewater equilibrators (peepers) in order to examine spatial and seasonal trends in biogeochemical processes. Variability in profile shapes and concentrations was small on spatial scales of a few meters, but the uncertainty in calculated diffusive fluxes across the sediment surface was, on average, 35%. Focusing of Fe and Mn oxides toward the lake center resulted in systematic increases in porewater concentrations and diffusive fluxes of Fe2+ and Mn2+ with increasing water depth; these fluxes are postulated to be regulated by the pH-dependent dissolution of reduced-metal phases. Despite higher concentrations of inorganic carbon, NH,, Si and P in pelagic compared to littoral sites, diffusive fluxes of these substances across the sediment surface increased only slightly or not at all with increasing water depth. Porewater profiles did reveal temporal changes in Fe2+, Mn2+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ that were an indirect result of the large, seasonal changes in seston deposition, but no clear seasonal variations were found in diffusive fluxes of nutrients across the sediment surface. The intense mineralization occurring at the sediment surface was not reflected in the porewater profiles nor in the calculated diffusive fluxes. Calculated diffusive fluxes across the sediment surface resulted from decomposition occurring primarily in the top 5-7 cm of sediment. Diffusive fluxes from this subsurface mineralization were equal to the solute release from mineralization occurring at the sediment-water interface. Buried organic matter acts as a memory of previous lake conditons; it will require at least a decade before reductions in nutrient inputs to lakes fully reduce the diffusive fluxes into the lake from the buried reservoir of organic matter.

Distribution of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (brGDGT) lipids from soils and sediments from the same watershed are distinct regionally (central Chile) but not globally	FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE												Quantitative reconstructions of past continental climates are vital for understanding contemporary and past climate change. Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are unique bacterial lipids that have been proposed as universal paleothermometers due to their correlation with temperature in modern settings. Thus, brGDGTs may serve as a crucial paleotemperature proxy for understanding past climate variations and improving regional climate projections, especially in critical but under constrained regions. That said, complications can arise in their application due to varying source contributions (e.g., soils vs. peats vs. lacustrine). As such, this study investigates brGDGT distributions in Chilean lake surface sediments and corresponding watershed soils to determine the source of brGDGTs to lake sediments. Global datasets of brGDGTs in lake sediments and soils were additionally compiled for comparison. Distinct brGDGT distributions in Chilean lakes and soils indicate minimal bias from soil inputs to the lacustrine sediments as well as in situ lacustrine production of brGDGTs, which supports the use of brGDGTs in lake sediments as reliable paleotemperature proxies in the region. The Sigma IIIa/Sigma IIa ratio, initially promising as a brGDGT source indicator in marine settings, shows global complexities in lacustrine settings, challenging the establishment of universal thresholds for source apportionment. That said, we show that the ratio can be successfully applied in Chilean lake surface sediments. Direct comparisons with watershed soils and further research are crucial for discerning brGDGT sources in lake sediments and improving paleotemperature reconstructions on regional and global scales moving forward. Overall, this study contributes valuable insights into brGDGT variability, essential for accurate paleoreconstructions.					; Contreras, Sergio/I-1858-2014; Araneda, Alberto/MAH-3037-2025	Tejos, Eduardo/0009-0007-1528-1908; Contreras, Sergio/0000-0001-7192-6810; 														2296-6463				APR 17	2024	12								1383146	10.3389/feart.2024.1383146	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feart.2024.1383146													WOS:001209845700001
J	Palik, BJ; Buech, R; Egeland, L				Palik, BJ; Buech, R; Egeland, L			Using an ecological land hierarchy to predict seasonal-wetland abundance in upland forests	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Hierarchy theory, when applied to landscapes, predicts that broader-scale ecosystems constrain the development of finer-scale, nested ecosystems,. This, prediction finds application in hierarchical land classifications. Such classifications typically apply to physiognomically similar ecosystems, or ecological land units, e.g., a set of multi-scale forest ecosystems. We speculated that hierarchical constraint also controls the development of small, nested ecosystems that are structurally distinct from the constraining matrix. We tested this hypothesis using seasonal wetlands in upland forest. Specifically, we related seasonal-wetland abundance in upland forest stands to multi-scale terrestrial ecological units, as defined by hierarchical combinations of regional physiography, glacial landform, soils, and forest cover. Moreover, we determined the spatial scale of terrestrial ecological unit that is the best predictor of seasonal-wetland abundance. Our study area is mapped into a set of nested terrestrial ecological units, including two subsections (differing in physiography), four land-type associations (glacial landforms), and 11 land types (forest vegetation, soil). We used a geographic information system to determine seasonal wetland densities in 16-ha plots located within the nested terrestrial ecological units. Cumulative plot frequency distributions of wetland density did not differ between subsections; 50% of plots contained no wetlands, 38% contained 1-3 wetlands, and 12% contained greater than or equal to4 wetlands. Frequency distributions differed among land-type associations (LTA). Ninety percent of plots on a glacial lake plain contained no wetlands, compared to 63%, 42%, and 38% for outwash, end moraine, and ground moraine LTAs, respectively. Ten percent of plots on the lake plain contained 1-3 wetlands, compared to 32%, 48%, and 43% for the outwash, end moraine, and ground moraine, respectively. The remaining plots on the latter three LTAs contained >3 wetlands. Frequency distributions rarely differed among land types. Compared to occurrence, identity and scale of the ecological unit were poorer predictors of actual wetland densities. Regression tree analysis, while significant, explained only 11.6% of variation in wetland density among plots. Still, the leaves of the regression tree differed in densities primarily based on LTA. Our results demonstrate that identity of constraining upland forest ecosystem explains significant amounts of variation in seasonal wetland abundance. We identify glacial landform as the scale of ecological unit having the greatest control over seasonal wetland abundance. We focus on seasonal wetlands in forests, yet our approach should apply to other small, nested ecosystems. This approach may facilitate conservation management of small, nested ecosystems by providing likelihood estimates of occurrence within mapped terrestrial ecological units.

J	Waiser, MJ; Robarts, RD				Waiser, MJ; Robarts, RD			Changes in composition and reactivity of allochthonous DOM in a prairie saline lake	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Inland saline lakes in semiarid regions of the Canadian prairies contain some of the highest known concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). This dissolved organic matter (DOM) represents a potentially important carbon and energy source for aquatic bacteria. Redberry Lake, an oligotrophic saline lake in central Saskatchewan, is located in a hydrologically closed basin and has high levels of DOC (seasonal mean 35 mg L-1). Despite such high DOC concentrations, lake water is clear. Lake DOM is predominantly allochthonous, and enters the lake via the major inflow, Oscar Creek. Despite its origin, this DOM is compositionally much different than its creek counterpart. Approximately 73% of total lake DOM is low in molecular weight (<1000 D). XAD-8 isolated hydrophobic organic acids (HPOA) are low in aromaticity, have high C:N ratios and a certain percentage are old (similar to 700 years). In comparison, creek water, despite having lower DOC concentrations than the lake (14.9 mg L-1) is highly colored. Fifty-five per cent of this DOC is low in molecular weight and isolated DOM has higher aromaticity and lower C: N ratio than lake DOM. As a result of these changes in DOM, ultraviolet light penetrates much deeper into lake water as compared to the creek. Photolysis experiments revealed that DOM in Oscar Creek and Redberry Lake is photoreactive. Changes in lake DOM are not only linked to location within a hydrologically closed basin and photochemistry, but provide the explanation for the optically different character of DOC in this geographical region. Changes in lake DOM have had an effect at the microbial level as well. Little of the lake DOM appears available fur bacterial growth as a result of these photochemical changes. Creek DOM, having;a shorter residence time, does not appear to have been as photochemically changed and consequently is more available for bacterial growth.																			0024-3590					JUN	2000	45	4					763	774		10.4319/lo.2000.45.4.0763	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2000.45.4.0763													WOS:000087558900002

Phosphate uptake by seston and epilithon in the Grand River, southern Ontario	AQUATIC SCIENCES												Phosphate uptake and release by epilithon and seston were measured in the eutrophic Grand River during May to October over three years. Measurements were performed in stirred beakers of freshly collected river water containing seston and, for measurements of uptake by epilithon, unglazed ceramic tiles that had been colonized by epilithon in the river. Areal PO43- uptake was dominated by the epilithon, especially when the water level was low, although uptake per ash-free dry mass was greater for seston. Uptake rates varied on both short (< 1 day) and longer (week to week) time scales. Uptake was sufficient to turn over the dissolved PO43- pool in as little as 27 min when soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration was low, but the average turnover time was > 1 h. On average, about half of sestonic PO43- uptake was by the picoplankton (0.2 -2.0 mu m) size-fraction, and this fraction was most important when total uptake was low. Net changes in SRP during incubations of river water were consistent with both epilithon and seston regenerating PO43-, at least at times, so that net uptake is less than gross uptake and probably near zero at low flow. These net uptake experiments also served to highlight some difficulties with measuring P dynamics in microcosms, especially that uptake and regeneration are high enough that PO43-, and therefore PO43- uptake, can change rapidly in microcosms filled with river water.					; Baulch, Helen/I-9529-2012	Taylor, William/0000-0001-8555-945X; Baulch, Helen/0000-0001-9018-4998; 													1015-1621	1420-9055				JUN	2006	68	2					181	192		10.1007/s00027-006-0806-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00027-006-0806-9													WOS:000238454000006

Most C. amazonicus were first sighted in water or on open ground, were active during the hottest hours of the day, and usually had low body temperatures associated with substrate temperatures. Dracaena guianensis were found mainly perching on shrubs and used higher perches located closer to the center of lakes compared to C. amazonicus. Both species appear to rely primarily on crypsis to escape detection by predators but will dive into water as a final means of escape. Crocodilurus amazonicus has a broad diet which includes terrestrial and aquatic prey, particularly spiders and hemipterans, whereas D. guianensis feeds primarily on aquatic snails. No association between body dimensions and prey dimensions was evident. Sexual size dimorphism was not significant in either species, contrary to results reported for other teiids elsewhere, but males of C. amazonicus had relatively longer bodies and tails than females. Clutch size of both species was small relative to their body size and relative to other Amazon teiids, apparently influenced by their semiaquatic habits and by locomotor constraints. We found reproductive females during March (wet season) and July (dry season), suggesting an extended reproductive season.					; Garda, Adrian/A-6636-2012; Colli, Guarino/A-5368-2008; Mesquita, Daniel/I-5007-2012; Franca, Frederico G.

Over the past nine years considerable information has been generated on cormorant feeding ecology, through the examination of approximately, 12,000 pellets collected on LGI, where three distinct cormorant feeding periods, pre-chick, chick, and post-chick, are delineated by, differences in diet composition and daily, fish consumption. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were the major prey during pre-chick and post-chick feeding periods. Alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), which move inshore to spawn in mid-June, dominated (>60%) cormorant diets during the chick feeding period. Mean daily, fish consumption (14.6) during the pre-chick feeding period was significantly, greater than during the chick feeding (9.3) or post-chick feeding (8.0) periods. The proportion of smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) in the diet increased over the season (0.8% to 7.2%), while the size of bass consumed declined (214 nun to 143 mm). Forage fish (mainly, alewife, three-spine sticklebacks [Gasterosteus aculeatus] and minnows) comprised 58% of the diet of LGI cormorants, followed by, panfish (37%) (yellow perch, pumpkinseed [Lepomis gibbosus], rock bass [Ambloplites rupestris]) and gamefish (5%) (mostly, smallmouth bass). On the average LGI cormorants consumed about 32.8 million fish annually,, weighing about 1.4 million kilograms. Cormorants from LGI consumed more biomass of smallmouth bass and yellow perch annually, than is taken by, sport (bass and bellow perch) and commercial (perch) fishermen.																			0380-1330						2002	28	2					182	192		10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70575-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(02)70575-3													WOS:000176424300007
J	Gevao, B; Harner, T; Jones, KC				Gevao, B; Harner, T; Jones, KC			Sedimentary record of polychlorinated naphthalene concentrations and deposition fluxes in a dated Lake Core	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Polychlorinated naphthalene (PCN) concentrations and fluxes were measured in a dated core from the profundal sediments of Esthwaite Water, a seasonally anoxic semirural lake in northwest England. The vertical profile shows that the Sigma PCN flux remained fairly constant at 0.4-0.6 mu g m(-2) y(-1) from depth until the early 1940s, escalating sharply thereafter to a subsurface maximum of similar to 12 mu g m(-2) y(-1) in the late 1950s to mid-1960s followed by a 4-fold decrease to the sediment-water interface. The Sigma PCN maximum predates the Sigma PCB maximum by similar to 20 years, broad ly consistent with the time lapse in the production and wide use of both compounds. Furthermore, there was a secondary peak in the profiles of both compound classes corresponding to the period of maximum input of the other compound class. This may be a result of PCNs present as impurities in the manufacture of PCBs and vice versa. The vertical profiles of the individual PCN homologue groups closely followed that of the Sigma PCN profile with no overall change in the mass percent contribution of individual PCN congeners throughout the core. To our knowledge, this is the first study to reconstruct the historical record of PCNs in the environment.

J	Anderson, BT; Gianotti, D; Salvucci, G				Anderson, Bruce T.; Gianotti, Dan; Salvucci, Guido			Characterizing the Potential Predictability of Seasonal, Station-Based Heavy Precipitation Accumulations and Extreme Dry Spell Durations	JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY												The release of seasonal (and longer) predictions of various climatological quantities is now routine. While undoubtedly devastating to lives and livelihoods, it is unclear whether seasonal extremes in precipitationfor example, extreme dry spells leading to droughts or heavy precipitation events leading to floodingrepresent a feasible target for these predictions, that is, whether they are potentially predictable or are instead inherently unpredictable more than a few days to weeks in advance. This paper assesses the potential for predicting seasonal extremes in observed precipitation as a function of region and time of year by decomposing the station-based variance into that attributable to short-memory behavior of typical meteorological eventsas generated from station-specific, seasonally varying, daily time-scale stationary stochastic weather models (SSWMs)and that attributable to longer-time-scale, potentially predictable changes in precipitation-producing processes. Findings suggest the potential for making skillful predictions of seasonal precipitation extremes over the United States is enhanced (reduced) during the cool (warm) season, particularly for heavy precipitation event accumulations. Further, this potential is accentuated along the West Coast, around the Great Lakes, and over the central plains and Ohio River valley but is diminished over the Northeast and northern Great Plains. However, findings also suggest the potential for producing seasonal (and longer) predictions of seasonal precipitation extremes is spatially and seasonally dependent. As such, this paper includes supplemental material for the potentially predictable variance of seasonal extreme dry spell lengths, heavy event accumulations, and total accumulations at 774 stations across all 365 days so readers can evaluate the potential predictability for the location, timing, and metric of most relevance to them.

Data on methane emission from wetlands on southern slopes of the Himalaya (SSH) have not been reported so far. Such data are very valuable for filling the gap and generating the whole emission patterns at regional or even global scale. We selected two wetlands at different altitudinal locations in Nepal, i.e. Beeshazar Lake (286 m a.s.l.) and Dhaap Lake (2089 m a.s.l.), to monitor the daytime methane emissions in monsoon season and dry season separately. Daytime methane emission varied between monsoon and dry seasons and also across different plant communities. The daytime methane emission variations were stronger in dry season than in monsoon season. The source/sink strengths of the two selected plant communities in each wetland were significantly different, presenting the strong spatial variation of methane emission within wetland. The methane emissions recorded in monsoon season were significantly higher (7.74 +/- 6.49 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 1.00 +/- 1.23 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in low and high altitude wetlands, respectively) than those in dry season (1.84 +/- 4.57 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) and 0.27 +/- 0.71 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1) in low and high altitude wetlands, respectively). Methane emissions from the low altitude wetland were significantly higher than those from the high altitude wetland in both of the seasons. Plant community height, standing water depth and soil temperature correlated to the methane emission from wetlands in this region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Size fractionated phytoplankton production in two humic shallow lakes with contrasting coverage of free floating plants	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We conducted a 1-year survey in two humic shallow lakes from the floodplain of the Lower Parana River, Laguna Grande Lake (LGL) and a relictual oxbow lake (ROL). We aimed to test two hypotheses: (1) the efficiency in light use of picoplankton (0.2-3 mu m) is greater as light restriction increases and (2) the contribution of picoplankton to the total productivity is higher when the total photosynthetic biomass is lower. We performed P-E curves for picoplankton and nano- and microplankton (> 3 mu m) using the C-14 assimilation technique. The light environments of the water bodies differed mainly owing to the development of free floating plants on the surface of the ROL and the dominance of phytoplankton in LGL. Primary productivity patterns in LGL were seasonality driven whilst in the ROL they were related to the coverage of floating macrophytes, which promoted light limitation and a lower productivity. In LGL, nano- and microplankton were in general more productive and the relative contribution of picoplankton to the total phytoplankton production decreased with the increase in total photosynthetic biomass. Hence, our study extends previously observed patterns to subtropical shallow lakes, where seasonality and free floating plants may influence the dynamics of phytoplankton production.

The Lake Manzala dredging project started in 2017 and aims to improve the water quality in the lake mainly by enhancing water exchange between the lake and the sea. Waterbird diversity was assessed at 12 selected sites from July to December 2022. The seasonal assessment included richness, evenness, abundance, and Simpson, Shannon, and Margalef diversity indices. Water and sediment quality were assessed by measuring physicochemical parameters at four sites covering the protectorate sides. The results show that there is an effect on the investigated water and sediment quality parameters over the protectorate, while pH almost did not change in 2022 compared with past years. The estimated bird species richness was 50 species belonging to 21 families and 10 orders. Bird species diversity varied spatially and temporally during the study period. The waterbird assemblage maintained sizable abundance and richness, which were higher at the coasts because all inner islands of the lake had been removed. The highest value of species richness was recorded at site 2 (42 species), and site 1 showed the highest value of abundance (1846 ind.). The abundance and richness of waterbird depend on habitat factors such as water depth, physical and chemical conditions, and water body size. The study showed that there is a relationship between water quality and waterbird. These results indicate that the project has an impact on water and sediment quality and waterbirds diversity in Ashtoum El-Gamil protected area.

In theory, the PP of phytoplankton in Lake Biwa may decline over decades due to warming, heightened stratification, and anthropogenic oligotrophication. Furthermore, the PP of large phytoplankton, which are inedible to zooplankton, along with biomass -specific productivity (PBc), could decrease. In this study, data from 1976 to 2021 and active fluorometry measurements taken in 2020 and 2021 were evaluated. Quantitatively, the temporal dynamics of mean seasonal PP during 1971 - 2021 were assessed according to the carbon fixation rate to investigate relationships among environmental factors. Qualitatively, phytoplankton biomass, PP, and PBc were measured in two size fractions [edible (S) or inedible (L) for zooplankton] in 2020 and 2021, and the L:S balance for these three measures was compared between 1992 (low-temperature/high-nutrient conditions) and 2020 - 2021 (high-temperature/low-nutrient conditions) to assess seasonal dynamics. The results indicated that climate change and anthropogenic oligotrophication over the past 30 years have diminished Lake Biwa ' s PP since the 1990s, impacting the phenology of PP dynamics. However, the L:S balance in PP and PBc has exhibited minimal change between the data from 1992 and the 2020 - 2021 period. These findings suggest that, although climate change and oligotrophication may reduce overall PP, they may not markedly alter the inedible/edible phytoplankton balance in terms of PP and PBc. Instead, as total PP declines, the production of small edible phytoplankton may decrease proportionally, potentially affecting trophic transfer efficiency and material cycling in Lake Biwa.

Temperature-related increase in growth rate in four freshwater lake fish species	JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY												Growth is one of the most direct and common ways fish respond to climate change, as fish growth is intimately linked to the temperature of the environment. Observational studies on the effect of shifts in temperature on fish growth are scarce for freshwater fish, and particularly lacking for lake populations. Here, changes in growth rate of bream (Abramis brama), perch (Perca fluviatilis), pikeperch (Sander lucioperca), and roach (Rutilus rutilus) over three decades were studied and compared with changes in temperature in the two largest lakes of western Europe: Lake IJsselmeer and Lake Markermeer in the Netherlands. In the autumnal survey catches of bream, perch, and roach, the mean length of YOY increased significantly between 1992 and 2021 in both lakes, but for YOY pikeperch, no temporal changes were found. In a length-stratified dataset of age groups of bream, roach, and perch, the relationship between length and age differed significantly between time periods. In the more recent time periods, indications for higher growth rates across multiple ages were found. Temperature during the growth season increased in the same decades and showed significant correlations with the YOY mean length, for bream, perch, and roach in both lakes, and for pikeperch in Lake Markermeer. These results point toward consistent temperature-induced increases in growth over the age groups for bream, roach, and perch. These increases were found despite the simultaneous process of de-eutrophication in this water system and its potential negative effect on food production. For pikeperch, it is hypothesized that the absence of temporal increase in YOY growth rate is related to its necessary switch to piscivory and subsequent food limitation; the lower thermal range of its main prey smelt, Osmerus eperlanus, is hypothesized to have inhibited food availability for YOY pikeperch and its opportunity to achieve higher growth rates.					; van Rijssel, Jacco/L-6177-2017	Volwater, Joey/0000-0003-4057-639X; van Rijssel, Jacco/0000-0001-8038-9674													0022-1112	1095-8649				JUN	2024	104	6					2044	2055		10.1111/jfb.15745	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.15745		APR 2024						38594227					WOS:001198814600001
J	Wania, F; Axelman, J; Broman, D				Wania, F; Axelman, J; Broman, D			A review of processes involved in the exchange of persistent organic pollutants across the air-sea interface	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Atmospheric deposition across the air-sea interface is the main input route for persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to the marine environment and its ecosystems. The main processes contributing to air-sea exchange of POPs are diffusive vapour exchange, precipitation scavenging of vapours and particle-sorbed chemicals, and dry deposition with particles. Additional processes within the atmosphere and surface water affecting this exchange are aerosol-vapour partitioning, and partitioning and sedimentation in the water-column. These processes are discussed and recent findings are summarised. Commonly employed expressions used for describing these processes in models are presented, with a special focus on the influence of temperature and other seasonal parameters. Research gaps are identified which have to be addressed to gain a solid understanding of the environmental transport and distribution of POPs. This is needed to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of recent international agreements to protect the marine environment from the deleterious effects of POPs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Changes in Mesopotamian spiny eel, Mastacembelus mastacembelus (Bank & Solender in Russell, 1794) (Mastacembelidae) milt quality during a spawning period	THERIOGENOLOGY												This study was carried out to determine the milt quality in male Mesopotamian spiny eel (Mastacembelus mastacembelus; Bank & Solender in Russell, 1794) during spawning season. Review was performed using 58 M. mastecembulus males captured from Ataturk Dam Lake in Turkey. Milt samples were collected and evaluated daily during sampling period. In collected milt, volume of milt, sperm motility percentage, the duration of forward motility, sperm concentration, milt production and milt pH were evaluated. On June 10, 2005, 72% of the males were spermiating, which increased to 100% in the middle of June and dropped to 72% by late June. Sperm motility percentage showed a significant improvement after beginning of spermiation (P < 0.001). Sperm concentration changed significantly (P < 0.001) in milt collected during sampling period. Duration of sperm motility increased significantly (P < 0.001) from beginning (8.22 min) through end (37.33 min) of spermiation. Milt production was maximal on June 15th, decreasing from a mean value of 3.12-0.46 x 10(9)/ml. The high pH in milt was observed during the week of spermiation (P < 0.001). In conclusion, the results show that season has a significant influence on semen quality in male M. mastecembulus corresponding to spawning season in hot arid. Milt of good quality was especially collected in the middle of June. Spawning season in this fish species was found to be short. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A total of 1,274,698 Artemia single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. The results showed that these populations could be geographically and genetically divided into four distinct groups, and that the Tibetan populations were further divided into two subpopulations with a trend of decreasing genetic diversity from west to east. The Tibetan population had the highest genetic diversity, whereas the Shanxi population had the lowest. There was moderate genetic differentiation between the Tibetan populations and greater genetic differentiation between the Xinjiang and Shanxi populations. IBD (isolation by distance) suggested that geographical isolation contributes to genetic differentiation. In addition, there was some degree of gene flow among the ten populations, with A. sinica showing unidirectional gene flow in all populations in the eastern Nagri region. Species distribution modeling showed that mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality, and annual precipitation were the main environmental factors affecting the distribution of Artemia populations and suitable habitats for Tibetan populations will be further reduced in the future. It is necessary to strengthen the protection of germplasm resources and formulate scientific protocols for the sustainable development and utilization of Artemia resources.																				2296-7745				APR 5	2024	11								1375641	10.3389/fmars.2024.1375641	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1375641													WOS:001205507800001

The dimictic Rimov Reservoir has a pronounced trophic gradient along its axis. In nearly all samples, rotifers were dominant by numbers and formed on average 60-95% of the total zooplankton (including copepod nauplii). There was a consistent pattern of increasing relative abundance of rotifers in the upper regions of the reservoir compared with the downstream parts. Very large rotifer populations could develop in the upper regions, often associated with flood events, but also coinciding with reduced abundance of crustaceans associated with stronger wash-out effects and the advent of turbid conditions. There was a greater similarity between two adjacent sites in the proportions of crustacean species than of rotifer species. This is partially due to the greater species diversity of rotifers than of crustaceans. The timing of the seasonal succession of zooplankton species showed a coherent pattern along the whole longitudinal profile. The site-specific zooplankton patchiness seems to be reduced as there was no site dependence if average data on zooplankton composition from downstream lacustrine sites were compared.

The impact of lake discontinuities on nitrogen biogeochemistry in river networks	INLAND WATERS												River networks connect terrestrial and marine ecosystems through transport of pollutants and nutrients. Lakes represent discontinuities within these river networks and can be important biogeochemical hotspots, introducing substantial changes to the aquatic environment. Nitrogen (N) is a key macronutrient that can potentially limit or colimit primary production, but the processes that determine the fate of N during transport through river-lake networks are poorly understood. We studied 3 river systems and their lake discontinuities, spanning a range of trophic states and average water residence times, to understand the changes introduced to riverine N biogeochemistry by lake discontinuities. In-lake processes noticeably altered the concentration and speciation of N. Annually, lakes reduced up to 44% of nitrate compared to main inflow concentrations while the variability in nitrate dynamics was seasonally large. The drawdown in surface nitrate concentrations resulted at times in phytoplankton colimitation by N in the lake as well as in the downstream river, where altered N patterns could persist for several kilometres. However, lakes occasionally subsidized N to downstream rivers as ammonium or dissolved organic N. Assimilation of nitrate in lake surface waters was one of the dominant processes impacting N availability; however, stable isotope data revealed an unexpected contribution of nitrification to N cycling in the epilimnion throughout the year and across trophic gradients. These changes in N concentration, as well as speciation introduced by lake discontinuities, have potentially important consequences for the composition and metabolism of communities in downstream rivers and contribute to our fundamental understanding of freshwater processes.

Value of long-term isotope monitoring of an index lake for tracking changes in lake water balances across a northern freshwater landscape	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: The Peace-Athabasca Delta, northeastern Alberta, a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance. Study focus: To explore the cause of change in water isotope composition at an 'index lake' ( delta SSL ; 'PAD 18'), a terminal basin where inflow equals evaporation, and the consequences for characterizing lake water balance across a region subject to the same atmospheric conditions. For two decades, water isotope composition at PAD 18 provided a relatively constant, reliable estimate of delta SSL , but experienced a pronounced shift in 2020-2021 when average flux-weighted ice-free season relative humidity increased by 4.6% from 66.2% (2015-2019) to 70.8% (2020-2021). Using flux-weighted air temperature and relative humidity data from 2020-2021, an independent calculation of delta SSL was determined to be equivalent to the average isotope composition of PAD 18 during 2020-2021. New hydrological insights: Results reveal re-equilibration of the lake water with the atmosphere following the rise of relative humidity readily provides an explanation for the change in isotope composition of PAD 18. We demonstrate the importance of accurate characterization of delta SSL , via the index lake method, for isotope-mass balance calculations using evaporation-to-inflow ratios from measurement of water isotope compositions of 61 lakes across the PAD in July 2021. Findings highlight the value of an index lake and appropriate parameterization of isotope-mass balance models for assessment and ongoing monitoring of water balances of nearby lakes, especially amidst future climatic variability.					; Hall, Roland/K-3165-2019	Imran, Arisha/0000-0001-8982-0600; 														2214-5818				JUN	2024	53								101765	10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101765	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101765		APR 2024											WOS:001222179900001

The accumulation of large amounts of surface water leads to subgrade diseases along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. Based on remote sensing photos obtained from Google Earth Engine and processing the photos using ENVI 5.6.3 and CAD 2019 software, this paper analyzed the distribution characteristics of surface water and studied the impact of roadside ponding on subgrade diseases. The results showed that the total area of surface water was more than 3.7 million m2, and the surface water was most widely distributed in large river areas such as the Tuotuo River and Buqu River. The subgrade diseases of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway could be categorized into three types: settlement, longitudinal crack, and frost boiling, which accounted for 71.09%, 17.13%, and 11.78% of the total number of subgrade diseases, respectively. Additionally, the ground mean annual temperature was an important factor affecting the distribution of surface water, with the surface water area showing an increasing trend with the increase in ground mean annual temperature, and roadside ponding was most likely to form in the high-temperature extremely unstable permafrost area.					; Mu, Ke/HII-8389-2022	Liu, Zhiyun/0000-0002-9559-730X; Cui, Fuqing/0000-0001-8828-9598; 														2073-4441				APR	2024	16	7							954	10.3390/w16070954	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w16070954													WOS:001201016100001

Traditionally, the trophic state has been assessed using the Trophic State Index (TSI), but recently, chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) has emerged as a new indicator of eutrophication. We conducted a 2-year seasonal survey in three interconnected Andean-Patagonian lakes (Argentina), with different hydrogeomorphic features and macrophyte cover, considering both low-water (LWP) and high-water (HWP) phases. We aimed to determine the influence of WLFs and macrophyte cover on TSI dynamics, and to evaluate the use of CDOM for monitoring the trophic state of these Andean-Patagonian lakes. TSI ranged from ultraoligotrophy to mesotrophy and showed significant changes between rainy and dry seasons, particularly in shallow lakes. WLFs were revealed to be an important regulatory factor in this connected system, since a pronounced differentiation of physicochemical variables was found among lakes during the LWP, and homogenization during the HWP. Submerged macrophytes strongly affected nutrient dynamics, especially nitrogen (N), and consequently TSI. During the LWP, nutrient release associated with macrophyte senescence resulted in elevated TSI values in the shallowest lake. During periods of macrophyte growth and higher hydrological connectivity, a dilution effect developed, with reduced TSI values. Strong positive correlations found between TSI and CDOM (a254) highlighted CDOM as a reliable indicator of TSI, even in ultra-oligotrophic lakes. The positive relationship of TSI-a355 suggests the potential use of optical satellites to estimate TSI, increasing spatial and temporal monitoring capabilities.

Water Budget for Lake Trafford, a Natural Subtropical Lake in South Florida: An Example of Enhanced Groundwater Influx in a Subtropical Lake Subsequent to Organic Sediment Dredging	WATER												A very detailed water budget analysis was conducted on Lake Trafford in South Florida. The inflow was dominated by surface water influx via five canals (61%), with groundwater influx constituting 12% and direct rainfall constituting 27%. Lake discharge was dominated by sheet flow (69%) and evapotranspiration (30.5%), with groundwater recharge of the hydraulically connected unconfined aquifer accounting for only 0.5%. The removal of 30 M tons (4.4 x 106 m3) of organic sediment impacted the groundwater influx, causing enhanced groundwater flow into the deeper parts of the lake and mixed flow along the banks, creating a rather unusual pattern. The large number of groundwater seepage meters used during this investigation led to a very reliable set of measurements with occasional failure of only a few meters. A distinctive relationship was found between the wet-season lake stage, heavy rainfall events, and pulses of exiting sheet flow from the lake. Estimation of the evapotranspiration loss using data collected from a weather station on the lake allowed the use of three different models, which, when averaged, produced results comparable to Lake Okeechobee (South Florida). A limitation of this investigation was the inability to directly measure sheet-flow discharges, which had to be estimated as a residual within the calculated water budget.

The largest lake in Tibet, Siling Co, has expanded most dramatically during recent decades. Using Landsat, GRACE and meteorological data, the expansion of Siling Co was detailed in four stages and the process was further explained. The results show that the lake area increased from 1 647.30 km2 in 1972 to 2 438.99 km2 in 2020. It experienced a slow growth at a rate 6.03 km2/yr from 1972 to 1988, while fluctuating at 1.44 km2/yr during 1989-1997, then accelerated at 60.28 km2/yr between 1998 and 2005, and expanded slowly again at 11.40 km2/yr since 2006. The continued expansion led to its merger with nearby Yagain Co in 2003. Terrestrial water storage (TWS) increase was also observed from GRACE (0.65 cm/yr), with about 0.75 coefficient of determination between the TWS and lake area during 2002-2020. The long-term expansion of Siling Co is related to the increasing trends of temperature and precipitation, but their contributions vary with time span. Specifically, the accelerated stage between 1998 and 2005 can be explained by the increased temperature and precipitation accompanied by a drop in evaporation, while the slow expansion since 2006 was due to the decrease in precipitation and temperature and the rise in evaporation. There is no obvious mass loss of glaciers revealed by GRACE during 2002-2020, which may be related to the negative trend of the temperature. Furthermore, the precipitation may still make a major contribution in this phase, as its average is about 93.9 mm higher than that in 1988-1997.					; Yu, Hongjie/S-7302-2019; JunHao, WANG/JNS-7490-2023	Wang, Junhao/0000-0002-4886-1067; Wang, Chuya/0000-0001-5054-2367; yang, yuande/0000-0001-7689-9698; 													1674-487X	1867-111X				APR	2024	35	2					687	699		10.1007/s12583-022-1761-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12583-022-1761-7													WOS:001207895500019

Benthic macroinvertebrates of a tropical lake: Lake Caco, MA, Brazil	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Benthic communities are highly relevant in the study of aquatic ecosystems, both for their role in the functioning of the ecosystem and also as markers or indicators of paleo-conditions. Their distribution, as in other communities, is conditioned by abiotic and biotic factors and to their interactions, which determine the structure of the community that is established. The aim of this study was to determine the taxonomic composition, abundance and spatial distribution of the benthic community, by collecting at 20 sampling sites in Caco Lake (State of Maranhao, Brazil). Seasonal variation in these community parameters was analysed and related to the seasonal displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The results indicated that changes occur in the taxa richness, diversity and density of the benthic species of this lake that are mainly related to seasonality. All those parameters were higher in the dry than in the rainy period. The family Chironomidae (Diptera, Insecta) was the most important component of the community, representing approximately 50% of the total benthic fauna of the lake. The identification of the Chironomidae currently occurring in Lake Caco is relevant, even at the genus level, considering the fact that this group produces fossilizing remains and could perhaps be good paleolimnological and paleoclimatic tracers that could be used to make inferences on past lake and climate conditions.

J	Beisner, BE; Peres-Neto, PR				Beisner, Beatrix E.; Peres-Neto, Pedro R.			Seasonal trophic dynamics affect zooplankton community variability	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												P>1. The degree to which communities are variable may be affected by the ecological conditions to which they are exposed and can affect their propensity to form alternative states. We examined the influence of two common ecological factors, predation and seasonal successional stage, on the variability in community composition of herbivorous pond plankton. In a highly replicated, two factor, mesocosm experiment we determined whether beta diversity was affected by seasonal successional stage of the community (two levels), by fish predation (presence/absence) or by their interaction. 2. Several significant changes were found in the composition of the rotifer, cladoceran and copepod assemblages. Most cladoceran abundances showed sharp declines in the presence of fish, while some rotifers, as well as their assemblage species richness, responded favourably to fish. The copepod assemblage was composed of omnivorous and carnivorous species, which added invertebrate predation to the experiment and which intensified as the season progressed. Copepods showed responses to fish predation that depended on seasonal successional stage of the initial community, because of changes in their stage structure and edibility as they grew from nauplii to adults. 3. Community variability was consistently high at the end of each month-long experimental period for both cladoceran and rotifer assemblages, except under two conditions. In the early season treatments, the rotifer assemblages were more consistent (lower beta diversity) in the presence of fish. This was attributed to high population growth rates for rotifers under these ecological conditions because of reduced copepod predation on them through a trophic cascade from fish. Low community variability was also observed in the late season for rotifers when fish were excluded and, as a result, they were exposed to high invertebrate predation from cyclopoid copepods. 4. Results from the early season support theoretical predictions that when community size increases, variability in composition should decline because of an increase in competitive processes over stochastic ones. Late season results suggest that a second mechanism, specialist predation, can also reduce prey community variability. Our study demonstrates that plankton communities may be more predictable under certain trophic web configurations and challenges ecologists to find ways to incorporate such inherent variability into experiments and community theory.					; Peres-Neto, Pedro/E-4717-2011; Beisner, Beatrix/ABG-7855-2020	Beisner, Beatrix/0000-0001-6972-6887; Peres Neto, Pedro/0000-0002-5629-8067; 													0046-5070					NOV	2009	54	11					2351	2363		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02266.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02266.x													WOS:000270613600014

The risk factors associated with disease were also identified. A random sample of 933 cattle from 17 herds was initially selected (January 1999, cold dry season). Cattle were identified by ear-tags and sampled in the rainy season (July 1999) and the cold dry season (January 2000). Each animal sampled was treated with diminazene aceturate (3.5 mg/kg). Samples were examined for the presence of T vivax using an antibody (indirect ELISA) and a parasite detection test (buffy-coat technique, BCT). Standardized questionnaires with information about the host and management practices were collected and evaluated for their association with seroprevalence (model 1) and parasitological prevalence (model 2) as indicator of host susceptibility to T vivax infection. Risk factors were selected using two approaches: ordinary logistic regression (OLR) and generalized estimating equations (GEE) to account for within-herd correlation. The apparent prevalence was 1.6% using BCT and 42.3% with indirect ELISA. The true prevalence in the sample was estimated to (2.0%-8.0%) with two assumptions of BCT sensitivity. Overall, 58.8% (BCT) and 100.0% (ELISA) of the herds had a least one-positive animal. In January-July 1999, apparent monthly incidence was calculated at 0.24% in comparison with 0.76% for August 1999-January 2000. The true monthly incidence was estimated at 0.36%-1.43% for the first period and at 0.94%-3.78% for the second period. Risk factors associated with seroprevalence were age, race, a great number of small ruminants in the herd, and latitude and longitude of pasture area in the rainy season. Risk factors associated with BCT prevalence were duration of seasonal migration and longitude of pasture area in the rainy season. In conclusion, T vivax is present and widely disseminated in the cattle herds of tse-tse free area of Lake Chad. Farm-level factors, particularly seasonal migration, should be considered as the main risk factors for infection and to host susceptibility to the parasite. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

First, the stream selection model based on current larval assessment sampling protocol significantly underestimated transforming sea lam-prey abundance, transforming sea lampreys killed, and marginal costs per sea lamprey killed, compared to a protocol that included more years of data (especially for large streams). Second, larval density in streams varied significantly with Type-I habitat area, but not with total area or reach length. Third, the ratio of larval density between Type-I and Type-II habitat varied significantly among streams, and that the optimal allocation of sampling effort varied with the proportion of habitat types and variability of larval density within each habitat. Fourth, mean length varied significantly among streams and years. Last, size at metamorphosis varied more among years than within or among regions and that metamorphosis varied significantly among streams within regions. Study results indicate that: (1) the stream selection model should be used to identify streams with potentially high residual populations of larval sea lampreys; (2) larval sampling in Type-II habitat should be initiated in all streams by increasing sampling in Type-II habitat to 50% of the sampling effort in Type-I habitat; and (3) methods should be investigated to reduce uncertainty in estimates of sea lamprey production, with emphasis on those that reduce the uncertainty associated with larval length at the end of the growing season and those used to predict metamorphosis.

J	Thiebaut, G; Muller, S				Thiebaut, G; Muller, S			Linking phosphorus pools of water, sediment and macrophytes in running waters	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The aim of our paper was to study the space and time variations of phosphorus contents in the sediment, water and tissue of aquatic plants. Tissue Total Phosphorus of six aquatic plants (Callitriche platycarpa, C. hamulata, C. obtusangula, Elodea nuttathi, E. canadensis and Ranunculus peltatus) was analysed alongside the sediment Total Phosphorus (TP) and Soluble Reactive Phosphorus concentrations (SRP) in water, at the same site. Twelve sites were selected, and, samples were collected to test the seasonal and the annual patterns of phosphorus variation in 3 compartments. Streams ranged from oligotrophic to eutrophic waters. The sediments varied from mesotrophic to eutrophic states. A highly significant site effect was shown for water and for sediment. Water SRP varied with time (season, year), whereas no significant time effect was established for the sediment TP. Tissue TP varied according to year and season in Callitriche platycarpa, C. hamulata and E. nuttaffli. The tissue phosphorus storage depended on the trophic level of sediment and water and varied according to species. The rank order of tissue TP content was C. obtusangula > R. peltatus greater than or equal to E. nuttallii greater than or equal to E. canadensis > C. plarycarpa > C. hamulata. Removal of aquatic plants biomass with its accumulated phosphorus could be an alternative technique to other eutrophication control strategies. Further work is needed to improve our knowledge to estimate the ecological risk of harvesting on biodiversity and on ecosystem function.																			0003-4088						2003	39	4					307	316		10.1051/limn/2003025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/limn/2003025													WOS:000187735000003

The products of 29 enzymes encoded by 67 protein-encoding loci resolved by allozyme analysis revealed a substantial amount of genetic diversity among populations distributed both within and among major drainages. The data support a model of population structure based on the nursery lake. A gene diversity analysis estimated that 0.4% of the total variability was attributable to the effect of sampling at different sites within nursery lakes, compared with 7.5% among nursery lakes within regions and 2.9% among regions. This diversity probably arises from isolation and genetic drift within nursery lakes and the tendency of sockeye salmon to home with great fidelity. Sockeye salmon from these drainages are commercially harvested in mixed-stock aggregations in upper Cook Inlet. Mixed-stock analyses using maximum likelihood methods with data from 27 loci were performed to estimate the proportion of source populations in upper Cook Inlet fisheries. Simulations indicated that six regional groups (Kenai River, Susitna and Yentna rivers, West Cook Inlet, Kasilof River, Northeast Cook Inlet, and Knik Arm) could be identified in mixtures at a level of precision and accuracy useful for fishery management. Samples from fisheries were analyzed both in-season (within 48 h) and postseason. Samples taken from within the rivers were also analyzed to evaluate the baseline and to estimate the contributions of individual spawning populations to the larger river systems.

J	Wronski, T				Wronski, T			Feeding ecology and foraging behaviour of impala Aepyceros melampus in Lake Mburo National Park, Uganda	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Intersexual and seasonal variation in foraging behaviour of impala (Aepyceros melampus), was studied in the Lake Mburo National Park, Uganda. There was a moderate seasonal difference in foraging efficiency (as measured by 'acceptable food abundance'), with a minimum in dry season and a maximum in Rainy season. The variation between sexes was more distinct with a pronounced minimum in time spent browsing of males in early wet season. By distinguishing between feeding time spent grazing and feeding time spent browsing the seasonal variation was confirmed. The proportion of foraging time spent feeding (expressed as 'food ingestion rate') showed an inverse pattern with a maximum in the late dry season (75.5%), decreasing values throughout the Rainy season and a minimum in early dry season (57.8%). Differences between sexes were explained in terms of reproductive demands and seasonal balance in terms of moderate climate throughout the year. Impala foraging patterns in the bimodal tropics (two Rainy seasons) is discussed and compared with unimodal tropics. The findings are matched against current ideas on optimal foraging.

This paper aims to enhance the ecological risk assessment (ERA) framework for antibiotics, to illustrate the distribution of these risks across different locations and seasons, and to identify the antibiotics that pose high ecological risk. This paper focuses on 52 antibiotics in 7 major basins of China. Relying on the optimized approach of ERA and antibiotic monitoring data published from 2017 to 2021, the results of ERA are presented in multilevel. Across the study area, there are marked variations in the spatial distribution of antibiotics' ecological risks. The Huaihe River Basin, the Haihe River Basin, and the Liaohe River Basin are the top three in the ranking of present ecological risks. The research results also reveal significant differences in temporal variation, underscoring the need for increased attention during certain seasons. Ten antibiotics with high contribution rates to ecological risk are identified, which is an important reference to formulate an antibiotic control list. The multilevel results provided both risk values and their ubiquities across a board study region, which is a powerful support for developing ecological risk management of antibiotics.

J	de Emiliani, MOG				de Emiliani, MOG			Effects of water level fluctuations on phytoplankton in a river-floodplain lake system (Parana River, Argentina)	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Several aspects of community organization were analyzed comparatively in a small side-arm of the Parana River (Correntoso) and a shallow floodplain lake (El Tigre) (31 degrees 41' S and 60 degrees 42' W), in relation to the hydrology of the system. Taxonomic and morphological composition in the river differed from that in the lake: the river had lower species richness (151 vs 218), different contributions of some Classes to total species number (higher Cyano-, Zygo- and Diatomophyceae vs higher Chlorophyceae), and diffent proportions of nannoplanktonic algae (67.5% vs 80.7%) and netplanktonic filamentous species (18.2% vs 4.2%). Phytoplankton biomass, higher in the lake than in the river due to the retention time, was mostly dominated by nannoplankton and netplankton. Lotic phytoplankton was dominated by typical fluvial species of Diatomophyceae (R-strategists). River conditions seem to maintain a subclimactic community, which was little impacted by the flushing of populations from floodplain lakes. Water level was the main factor controlling phytoplankton biomass, species diversity (H), evenness (E) and community change rate (sigma) in the river. In the lake, phytoplankton had an autogenic successional sequence during the isolation phase (C- to S-strategists) and other responses to disturbance, mainly during the hood (R-strategists). Frequent changes in phytoplankton composition, biomass, H, E and sigma, revealed a environmental instability in the lake, which may be explained by interactions of external factors (hydrology and climatology) and those of internal origin, such as nutrients and grazing.																			0018-8158					DEC 19	1997	357						1	15																WOS:000072604600001

In this study, we investigated the importance of local environmental and regional (spatial and landscape) predictors in structuring stream phytoplankton from the perspective of metacommunity theory. We seasonally sampled phytoplankton and abiotic variables from nine streams in three subtropical basins. Variation partitioning was used to investigate the influence of environmental, landscape, and spatial predictors on phytoplankton biovolume. Independent of the hydrological period (dry and rainy), the phytoplankton communities were predominantly structured by local environmental factors. In addition, the different land uses considered (landscape) showed weak significance during the dry season, with emphasis on the rural category. Biovolume values remained low, and diatoms and green algae were the most representative groups. Our findings are consistent with recognized ecological patterns for potamoplankton and emphasize local environmental filters as a fundamental regulator of phytoplankton biodiversity in lotic environments.

This study presents soil moisture and temperature spatial distribution in different seasons from the restoration sites using the geostatistical analysis expansion module of ArcGIS. The results suggested that the soil temperature shows an overall decreasing trend accompanied with the increasing of the depth in June and August; while, there was no obvious temperature differences among all the depths of September. In addition, the humidity in August and September increased with the increase of depth. However, the mean soil moisture of June did not follow any rules. The spatial distributions of soil temperature were high in the south of the survey area. Compared with the temperature, the spatial distribution of moisture shows a much larger variation. Principal component analysis was also used in this study. The results showed the high similarity of temperatures with different depths, while the soil moisture showed an obvious spatial differences between deep and top layers. Taking a shifting sand dune as the control area, we examined the effects of ecological restoration project on soil temperature and moisture of the study area.

Although climate conditions in 2003 and 2004 were nearly identical, large differences in streamflow were observed downstream from the Matawin dam. These differences resulted in numerous days without flow (no water release) during the growing period (May to August) in 2003, leading to man-made hydrological drought. While this drought had no effect on abiotic variables (grain-size distribution and nutrient concentrations in sediments), a significant decrease in the number of terrestrial species was observed in 2004 (year without drought) relative to 2003 (drought year) on three sand bars studied. This decrease is interpreted to result from prolonged submergence of the sites in 2004. Principal component analysis highlighted the effect of individual sites (first principal component) and of the interannual variability of streamflow (second component) on the number of species. The study suggests that, from a flow management standpoint, it is advisable to release enough water downstream from the dam during the growing season to prevent low-flow channel colonization by invasive terrestrial species.

Sources of Variation in the Abundance and Detection of the Endangered Florida Grasshopper Sparrow	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Information on factors affecting the abundance and detection of the endangered Ammodramus savannarum floridanus (Florida Grasshopper Sparrow) was required to determine appropriate management strategies and evaluate monitoring efforts. We examined annual point-count data, records of prescribed fire (2003-2008), observer variability, and landscape features for Three Lakes Wildlife Management Area to identify sources of variation in abundance and detection. The population of male Florida Grasshopper Sparrows was estimated to be 498 (95% CL = 354-641), which corresponded to 23.9 (95% CL = 17.0-30.7) males per km(2). Over most or all observed covariate ranges, abundance estimates increased with mean elevation above sea level, distance from outer edge of optimal habitat, and with growing-season burns (P <= 0.025). Abundance declined with time since last burn (P <= 0.006). Estimates of probability of detection ranged from 0.041 to 0.101. depending on observer and prior detections. Probability of detection declined with time of day, day of year, and days since last burn (P <= 0.058). The current prairie burn regime of 2- to 3-year intervals should be maintained with preference for increased growing-season burns. Annual point-count surveys should be continued. Surveys should be conducted within 2 hours of sunrise between mid-April and mid-May. Future monitoring should incorporate covariates of abundance and detection during the collection of data and in their analysis for population estimates used for recovery criteria.

A total of 95 zooplankton taxa were recorded. They were represented mostly by Rotifera, followed by Cladocera and Copepoda, as well as Copepodites, Nauplii of Copepoda and Dreissena veliger larvae. Most of the recorded zooplankton taxa are typical for the mesotrophic and eutrophic water bodies in Bulgaria. The highest zooplankton abundance and biomass were recorded in the reservoirs Poletkovtsi, Christo Smirnenski, Kula, Ogosta and Drenovets. The infested reservoirs were characterized with high zooplankton taxa richness, unstable dominant complexes, and low quantitative parameters (Rabisha), or seasonal fluctuations in abundance and biomass due to the share of Dreissena veliger larvae (Ogosta). Regular zooplankton monitoring in infested and non-infested reservoirs is required in order to further study the potential negative effects of Dreissena.																			0324-0770					SEP	2013	65	3					359	370																WOS:000325676600012

In this study we tested the hypothesis that epiphyton richness, diversity, density, and composition, associated with submerged macrophytes are affected by hydrological dynamics and by habitat heterogeneity. The macrophytes used as substrates were Eichhornia azurea Kunth, an emergent macrophyte, and Egeria najas Planch, a submerged macrophyte. The samplings were performed quarterly in 2009, the species richness, diversity, density, and composition of the epiphytic algal community were evaluated. The species richness was not different between the substrates. Regardless of the evaluated substrate, the month of March had the highest species richness and diversity, especially of Desmids and Chlorophyceae. E. najas recorded the greater variation in abundance, compared with E. azurea. Bacillariophyceae, independent of the period and substrate, represented over 50 % of total density. The species composition was different among the periods, in which March and June (low water) were more similar and formed the group I, while September and December (high water) formed the group II. In summary, the hypothesis was accepted, since we verified that the hydrological dynamics of the floodplain is the direct controlling factor on structure of epiphytic algal community, and the substrate heterogeneity is the indirect controlling factor.

J	Zinabu, GM				Zinabu, GM			The effects of wet and dry seasons on concentrations of solutes and phytoplankton biomass in seven Ethiopian rift-valley lakes	LIMNOLOGICA												The chemical characteristics and phytoplankton biomass (measured as chlorophyll-a concentrations) of seven lakes and one reservoir in the Ethiopian rift-valley were studied during the wet and dry seasons between 1990 and 2000. Mean concentrations of three major plant nutrients (nitrate-nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus, and silicate) increased during the wet seasons in four of the seven lakes, presumably as a result of mixing events and input from runoff. The changes in the major nutrient concentrations in the rest of the lakes were variable, but concentrations were usually higher during the dry seasons, most likely as a response to temporal variation in the phytoplankton biomass. pH measurements of the lakes did not show marked differences between the wet and dry seasons. Salinity (measured as conductivity) and total ions seemed to increase during the wet seasons in some of the lakes, possibly as a result of inflows that might carry high concentrations of solutes due to the heavy rains. Chlorophyll-a concentrations were higher during the dry seasons in most lakes except in three relatively more productive lakes. The results suggest that there could be light limitation in some of the Ethiopian rift-valley lakes, and events associated with the wet and dry seasons could bring about contrasting changes in nutrient levels and phytoplankton biomass in lakes, depending on the physical characteristics of the lakes.																			0075-9511					JUL	2002	32	2					169	179		10.1016/S0075-9511(02)80006-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0075-9511(02)80006-8													WOS:000178729900006

Effects of changing rainfall on the limnology of a Mediterranean, flowthrough-seepage chain of lakes	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY												Relationships between groundwater and lake ecology are often overlooked, but they may be strong, particularly in seepage lakes. As a result, the nature and degree of groundwater effects on lakes are usually neglected. In this study interactions among rainfall, groundwater and surface water and their limnological effects were traced seasonally for two years of changing rainfall in a Spanish flowthrough, seepage lake complex. Cumulative rainfall dictated recharge of groundwater with delays of nine months. Groundwater discharge, in turn, increased surface discharge downstream. Mediated by the geographical setting of lakes, both fluxes impinged on lake water renewal time, but effects of the latter on limnological variables were much stronger at the district scale than at the single lake scale. These water-renewal effects included the following: decreasing salinity, total phosphorus concentration and phytoplankton biomass and increasing water transparency and total nitrogen concentration as water renewal shortened, the nitrogen effect arising because of nitrate-rich water entering the lakes as groundwater levels rose. This complex response of a Mediterranean lake district to water availability may also be expected in cold temperate lakes as climate change effects become stronger.

We adapted a two-dimensional public domain model, CE-QUAL-W2, to test whether it could provide a hydrodynamically accurate simulation of the seasonal variation in the vertical-longitudinal thermal structure of Lake Erie. The physical forcing for the model is derived from surface meteorological buoys and measurements of precipitation, inflows, and outflows. To calibrate and validate the model, predictions were compared with an extensive set of field data collected during May through September 1994. The model accurately predicted water-level fluctuations without adjustment. However, significant modifications to the eddy coefficient turbulence algorithm were required to simulate acceptable longitudinal currents. The thermal structure was accurately predicted in all three basins, even though this laterally averaged model cannot simulate Coriolis effects. We are currently extending the model's water-quality module to include the effects of nutrient loading and zebra mussels on the plankton.					; Loewen, Mark/E-5645-2013	Loewen, Mark/0000-0002-6854-5926; 													0706-652X					MAY	2001	58	5					858	869		10.1139/cjfas-58-5-858	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-58-5-858													WOS:000168528100003
J	Han, PF; Wang, XS; Wang, JZ				Han, Peng-Fei; Wang, Xu-Sheng; Wang, Jun-Zhi			Using Large-Aperture Scintillometer to Estimate Lake-Water Evaporation and Heat Fluxes in the Badain Jaran Desert, China	WATER												Accurate estimation of evaporation (E-0) over open water bodies in arid regions (e.g., lakes in the desert) is of great importance for local water resource management. Due to the ability to accurately determine sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat fluxes over scales of hundreds to thousands of meters, scintillometers are more and more appreciated. In this study, a scintillometer was installed on both sides of the shore over the Sumu Barun Jaran Lake in the Badain Jaran Desert and was applied to estimate the sensible and latent heat fluxes and evaporation to be compared with the data of an evaporation pan and an aerodynamic model. Based on the field data, we further analyzed the seasonal differences in the flux evaluation using water temperature at different depths at half-hour and daily time scales, respectively. The results showed that in cold seasons, values of H were barely affected by the changes of shallow water temperature, whereas in hot seasons, the values were changed by 20%-30% at the half-hour time scale and 6.2%-18.3% at the daily time scale. In different seasons, shallow water temperature at different depths caused changes in the range of 0%-20% of LE (E-0). This study contributes to a better understanding of uncertainties in measurements by large-aperture scintillometers in open-water environments.

Decomposition in flocculent sediments of shallow freshwaters and its sensitivity to warming	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												Shallow waterbodies are abundant in many landscapes across the globe and are increasingly acknowledged for their role in freshwater C cycling. This study investigated organic-matter decomposition potentials in flocculent organic sediment, a rarely-investigated sediment type commonly found in shallow waters. Further, this study investigated how porewater chemistry and temperature affect decomposition rates within flocculent sediment. We quantified decomposition rates during 3 seasons by deploying a standardized substrate (cotton strips) within and above the flocculent sediment layer in the littoral zones of lakes, shallow through-flow wetlands, and depositional zones on the margins of stream channels of southwestern Michigan, USA. We then compared our results with those reported for other freshwater settings that used the same cotton-strip assay. There was high accumulation of organic matter in the shallow waterbodies, but decomposition rates in flocculent sediments averaged 1.7x greater than rates measured in oxic overlying waters and were generally only eclipsed by temperature-adjusted rates reported in streams, which are typically well-oxygenated, flowing environments. Rates were positively correlated with sediment porewater concentrations of soluble reactive P and dissolved iron and negatively correlated with ammonium. Warmer temperatures also resulted in increased decomposition rates, and the temperature sensitivity results suggest that decomposition rates in flocculent sediments could increase 11 to 52% with a 1 to 4 degrees C increase in water temperatures, a realistic range of increase for this region in the next 100 y if climate change continues at the current pace. Thus, high organic matter inputs, rather than slow decomposition, must lead to the development of flocculent organic sediments. Future warming could therefore increase decomposition rates and tip the balance toward net losses of organic matter.

Samples were collected and analyzed monthly, from March 2006 to February 2007, at five different locations along the river, and the multiple tube method was used to obtain total and thermotolerant coliform counts. The results varied from 130 MPN/100 mL to 1.6 Au 10(6) MPN/100 mL for total coliforms, while for thermotolerant coliforms the variation was between 40 MPN/100 mL and 5 Au 10(5) MPN/100 mL. The E. coli strains isolated from the samples were tested with 13 different antibiotics to determine their antibiotic resistance. The isolated strains were constantly sensitive to seven of the 13 antibiotics tested, and resistant to at least one of the other antibiotics. The results indicated that two factors could influence the increased contamination on this river, viz., seasonality parameters and domestic wastewater discharges. The determination of antibiotic resistance indices aimed to provide information on the anthropogenic influence. Only one of the locations investigated was considered critical due to the anthropogenic influence, with significant impacts from irregular domestic wastewater discharges.					silva, trajano/AAY-9731-2020; de Oliveira, Cintia Mara Ribas/C-5023-2016; VASCONCELOS, ELIANE/C-3865-2016; de Oliveira, Cíntia/X-2763-2019; Dziedzic, Mauricio/AAT-8875-2020	silva, trajano/0000-0001-7168-4161; de Oliveira, Cintia Mara Ribas/0000-0002-0051-9991; Dziedzic, Mauricio/0000-0001-8947-0129													0049-6979	1573-2932				JUN	2011	218	1-4					611	618		10.1007/s11270-010-0672-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-010-0672-x													WOS:000290724400054

Reconstruction of local environments of ancient population in a changeable river valley landscape (The Middle Vychegda River, Northern Russia)	GEOCHRONOMETRIA												In river valleys, both human occupation and subsequent preservation of archaeological sites are affected by active landscape transformation caused by river lateral migration, incision/aggradation cycles and changes of river hydrological regime. In the middle Vychegda River valley (Northern Russia), there are numerous traces of human presence since the Mesolithic. We exploit multi-disciplinary archaeological, geomorphological and geochronological approach to elucidate the environmental preferences of settlements positioning during different epochs of the Holocene. High resolution space image supplemented with data on alluvial stratigraphy derived from bank exposures and hand cores, as well as 51 radiocarbon dates were used to make the geomorphic map showing ages of floodplain/terrace segments and palaeochannels. Using this map together with sediment facial interpretation, position of archaeological sites was analysed in the context of local geomorphic and hydrologic situation. The majority of archaeological sites and modern settlements are found on terraces at river banks or at oxbow lakes which were well connected to the river. Few exceptions from this rule may be explained by seasonal character of dwelling functioning, ritual burial practice or specialization of settlements. Geomorphic situation was used as a background for planning further prospection of different-age archaeological objects.

J	Strong, C; Maberly, SC				Strong, Courtenay; Maberly, Stephen C.			The influence of atmospheric wave dynamics on interannual variation in the surface temperature of lakes in the English Lake District	GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY												Surface water temperatures in four lakes of the English Lake District (T-L) are shown to be sensitive to climate change and a large-scale atmospheric phenomenon known as tropospheric Rossby wave breaking (RWB). RWB occurs frequently near the English Lake District, bringing warm and moist air, or cool and dry air, from distant sources. RWB case examples and composites are used to show three dimensional circulations and anomalies of near-surface temperature and humidity associated with the two types of RWB (anticyclonic and cyclonic). Statistical models of lake surface temperature are developed for each season using objectively identified variability patterns of anticyclonic and cyclonic RWB, along with an index of Northern Hemisphere annual mean surface temperature (T-NH) to account for climate change. The statistical models, depending on season, account for 54-69% of T-L variance. RWB alone contributes significantly during each season, accounting for 37-52% of T-L variance after the effect of T-NH is removed. RWB is a key physical mechanism underlying the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a regional-scale weather-pattern that is frequently related to coherent lake properties. RWB may therefore be a more fundamental driver than the NAO in controlling interannual variation in the properties of lakes such as ice duration, metabolic rates, phenology, species composition and, via effects on stratification, underwater light-climate, nutrient-cycling and oxygen-depletion. Variation in other meteorological features that are linked to RWB, such as precipitation, may have additional effects. RWB is also likely to influence terrestrial and marine environments.

Elemental sulfur in the brine of Lake Doroninskoe (Eastern Transbaikalia)	DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES												The concentration of elemental sulfur (S(0)) in the upper oxic layer of the meromictic (stratified by water mineralization) soda Lake Doroninskoe (about 5.5 m depth) varied in the survey periods from the detection limit (0.002 mg/l) to the registered maximum of 0.444 mg/l, with an average value of 0.12 mg/l. In the lower hydrosulfide layer, these concentrations amounted to 0.012-1.88 mg/l. The results obtained point to the processes of sulfide sulfur oxidation under reductive conditions, and of sulfate reduction to form hydrogen sulfide in the oxic medium. The dynamics of the seasonal S(0)-thiosulfate ratio testifies to the dual (oxidative and reductive) nature of the latter.

J	Huszar, VLD; Caraco, NF				Huszar, VLD; Caraco, NF			The relationship between phytoplankton composition and physical-chemical variables: a comparison of taxonomic and morphological-functional descriptors in six temperate lakes	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The relationship between phytoplankton composition and physical-chemical variables was studied in six temperate lakes, characterizing the phytoplankton taxonomically or by a rarely used morphological-functional approach (m/f approach) developed by Reynolds (1997). This approach divides phytoplankton into three groups (C-, S- and R-strategists) by morphological characters thought to be related to light and nutrient acquisition. 2. The lakes ranged from oligotrophic to moderately eutrophic and exhibited both polymictic and dimictic patterns of mixing. Across the trophic gradient total phytoplankton biomass ranged from 0.3 to 4.8 mg (wet weight) L-1 and total phosphorus (TP) from 0.19 to 1.07 mu M. 3. The taxonomic groups predominantly represented were cyanobacteria, diatoms, dinoflagellates, chrysophytes and chlorophytes. The m/f group that was dominant (>50% of total biomass) in five of the six lakes was composed of S-strategists. In four of the six lakes the second most abundant group comprised R-strategists. In only one lake was biomass dominated by C-strategists. 4. Within-lake seasonal variations in taxonomic and m/f groups were not predicted well from physical or chemical variables. This lack of predictability is probably caused, in part, by the problem of rapid seasonal variation in environmental conditions as compared to the replacement time of phytoplankton. Considering the data as a whole, however, several physical and chemical variables were significantly related to taxonomic and m/f groups. Some correlations agreed with expectations from the literature and some did not. 5. For taxonomic groups, as expected, cyanobacteria were positively associated with temperature, pH and TP and negatively with light and NO3:TP ratios. Chrysophytes were negatively related to temperature, pH, soluble reactive phosphorus and TP. No other division showed a substantial correspondence to literature expectations. 6. For m/f groups: R-strategists were correlated with high dissolved nutrients (both N and P) and low light; S-strategists were correlated with low dissolved N. C-strategists were generally in low abundance in the study lakes, as might be expected from the generally low nutrients in the six lakes. Opposite to expectations, however, their abundance in the study lakes was negatively correlated to dissolved P. 7. Despite a lack of complete predictive ability, the m/f approach performed better than the taxonomic approach. This suggests that size and shape of phytoplankton may predict their response to physical and chemical conditions better than taxonomy at the division level.					; Huszar, Vera/J-7126-2012	Huszar, Vera/0000-0002-8096-1404; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	1998	40	4					679	696		10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.d01-656.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.1998.d01-656.x													WOS:000077818600008

Shift in piscivory by salmonids following invasion of a minnow in an oligotrophic reservoir	ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH												Predation can play an important role in structuring ecological communities, and predator-prey dynamics can be altered following the introduction of new species. An unauthorized introduction of redside shiner (Richardsonius balteatus) into reservoirs in the Upper Skagit River, Washington, USA created concern that a consequent shift in predator-prey dynamics in the reservoirs could reduce recruitment and production of native salmonids in the basin. We estimated predation mortality in Ross Lake on nonnative redside shiner and juvenile native salmonids to evaluate the potential role of predation in regulating these populations and limiting survival of native species of concern. We used bioenergetics modelling and stable isotope analysis combined with directed field measurements of growth, seasonal diet and thermal experience of piscivorous salmonids to quantify their consumption demand on prey fishes to evaluate the relative magnitude of predation mortality on invasive redside shiners and native salmonids. While redside shiner are the dominant prey fish species in Ross Lake, the modest biomass of native salmonids consumed could translate into substantial mortality, the magnitude of which depended on the timing and size at which prey fishes were eaten. This information provides important context for how nonnative species may indirectly impact native species through shared predation (apparent competition) and can inform conservation decisions surrounding nonnative species control, sustainability of native salmonids and introductions of anadromous fishes.

The type material consists of multiple specimens that were recovered in three large blocks, two containing over 60 individuals preserved on a single bedding plane. In addition, material from two other localities is referred to this taxon. One of these contains disarticulated remains of numerous individuals preserved in a single bedding plane. Material from the other locality, from a different region of Gansu, was collected years previously and consists of a block with multiple specimens previously attributed to Sinamia zdanskyi. We interpret the preservation of specimens from all three localities as resulting from the fish becoming isolated in a restricted area, possibly made seasonally inhabitable during flooding, that then was cut off from the main channel forming a small temporary lake or pond that eventually dried out, leaving the fish to be concentrated in a steadily shrinking water body. The covering sediments that preserved these fish were possibly deposited by a subsequent flood not long after the mass-death event. The type locality includes only Sinamia, but the other two localities include remains of a small turtle. The locality containing disarticulated remains also includes isolated crocodile and dinosaur teeth, suggesting that this locality is a crevasse splay. A phylogenetic analysis including the new species supports the monophyly of Sinamiidae, but not the monophyly of Sinamia.

Two rotifer species (Synchaeta pectinata Ehrenberg, Trichocerca simonei DeSmet) inhabiting the lake occurred near lake bottom (7-8 m depth) in the daytime. At night they were observed in surface waters (0-2 m). Both amplitude and speed of the rotifer migration were markedly higher than those of crustaceans. As invertebrate predators are scarce or altogether lacking in the lake, vertical stratification of rotifer and crustacean communities both seasonally and dielly may be caused by strong competition for very low food resources in the lake. This assumption is supported by the observed reverse changes in densities of zooplankton and their food (i.e. picoplankton) during a diel cycle.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP 1	2005	546						381	386		10.1007/s10750-005-4280-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-005-4280-5													WOS:000233117900040
J	Weithoff, G				Weithoff, G			Vertical niche separation of two consumers (Rotatoria) in an extreme habitat	OECOLOGIA												Herbivore populations are commonly restricted by resource limitation, by predation or a combination of the two. Food supplement experiments are suitable for investigating the extent of food limitation at any given time. The main part of this study was performed in an extremely acidic lake (pH 2.7) where the food web consists of only a few components and potential food sources for herbivores are restricted to two flagellates. Life table experiments proved that Chlamydomonas was a suitable food source whereas Ochromonas was an unsuitable food source. The two flagellates and the two rotifers exhibit a pronounced vertical distribution pattern. In this study, a series of food supplement experiments were performed in order to: (1) quantify and compare potential resource limitation of two primary consumers (Cephalodella hoodi and Elosa worallii, Rotatoria) over time, (2) compare their response at different temperatures, (3) evaluate the effect of having an unsuitable food source alongside a valuable one, (4) estimate the effect of predation on rotifers by Heliozoa, and (5) compare the results with those from other acidic lakes. Additionally, the spatio-temporal population dynamics of both species were observed. The field data confirmed a vertical separation of the two species with E. worallii dominating in the upper water layers, and C. hoodi in the deeper, cooler water layers. The results from the food supplement experiments in which Chlamydomonas served as the supplemented suitable food source showed that the two rotifers were food limited in the epilimnion throughout the season to different extents, with Cephalodella being more severely food limited than Elosa. The experiments at different temperatures provided evidence that Elosa had a higher optimum temperature for growth than Cephalodella. When the unsuitable food algae Ochromonas was added alongside the suitable food source Chlamydomonas, C. hoodi was unaffected but E. worallii was negatively affected. Predation of Heliozoa on rotifers was observed but the total effect on the rotifer dynamics is probably low. The comparison with other lakes showed that resource limitation also occurred in one other lake, although to a lesser extent. Overall, the vertical separation of the two rotifers could be explained by both their differential extent of resource limitation and differential response to temperature.																			0029-8549	1432-1939				MAY	2004	139	4					594	603		10.1007/s00442-004-1545-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-004-1545-z								15054658					WOS:000221235800013
J	Dang, HY; Lovell, CR				Dang, HY; Lovell, CR			Seasonal dynamics of particle-associated and free-living marine Proteobacteria in a salt marsh tidal creek as determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												The seasonal distributions of salt marsh free-living and particle-associated bacteria belonging to three subdivisions of the Proteobacteria were determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). More than 66% (median = 78%) of total bacterial cells that were stainable with the fluorescent DNA stain Yo-Pro-1 were also detected using the bacterial probe EUB338. The alpha -Proteobacteria , especially those from the marine Rhodobacter group, were abundant on suspended particles and as free-living cells all year round. The marine Rhodobacter group constituted more than 25% of the particle-associated bacteria and more than 18% of the free-living bacteria. Probes specific for three subgroups within the marine Rhodobacter group detected more than 49% of the total marine Rhodobacter group cells. These subgroups displayed different seasonal dynamics. The marine Rhodobacter group is clearly a widespread, diverse and important bacterial lineage in bacterioplankton and particle-associated assemblages in south-eastern United States salt marshes at all times of the year.

Bears killed a high proportion of spawning salmon when few salmon entered the creek (92% of 505 fish) and a much smaller proportion when the spawning population reached a historical high (16% of 15 631 fish). Selective predation on salmon that differed in length, sex, and spawning condition was measured by tagging salmon at the mouth of the creek immediately prior to upstream migration and then recovering dead tagged fish during daily surveys of the entire creek. The relative frequencies of large, medium-sized, and small salmon killed by bears indicated that the risk of predation was more than 150% greater for large than for small salmon. A higher proportion of the male salmon population was killed and a greater proportion of male bodies were consumed than female salmon. Selectivity for male salmon increased as the spawning season progressed, possibly because male salmon weakened earlier and lived longer in a weakened state than female salmon. Male salmon were attacked mostly along the dorsal hump area, whereas female salmon tended to be attacked along the abdomen, where eggs could be exposed. Bears selectively killed female salmon prior to spawning during 1 of the 3 years, but only 6.1-7.8% of the female spawning populations were killed prior to spawning. These data support the hypothesis that selective predation by bears may influence the body morphology of spawning salmon.																			0008-4301					JUN	2000	78	6					974	981		10.1139/cjz-78-6-974	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-78-6-974													WOS:000087790700010

Seasonal fluctuations, however, have received much less attention. This paper presents the results of two complimentary research efforts on the south-west shore of the lake. These illustrate how important both inter and intra-annual fluctuations in the level of the lake are, both in terms of their impact on the environment and in the response of the communities living on the lake shore. The paper compares a time series of the fluctuations in the level of Lake Chad as monitored by the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite with findings from participatory research with the communities of the south-west lake shore. It shows how the communities of the lake have responded to lake-level fluctuations with their livelihood choices. These results are used to show that although vastly different in scope, a high degree of complimentarity exists between remotely-sensed information and community-based research and that they are of potentially great value to development initiatives on the shores of Lake Chad.																			0016-7398					JUN	2000	166		2				156	172		10.1111/j.1475-4959.2000.tb00015.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-4959.2000.tb00015.x													WOS:000088242500004
J	Tanner, DK; Brazner, JC; Brady, VJ				Tanner, DK; Brazner, JC; Brady, VJ			Factors influencing carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus content of fish from a Lake Superior coastal wetland	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												The narrow fish nutrient ranges (C, 42.8-48.4%; N, 9.6-12.7%; P, 1.91-2.74%) in this study suggest that overall mean values are adequate for quantifying movement of C, N, or P as part of fish-mediated nutrient transport. We measured C, N, and P in 20 species of Lake Superior coastal wetland fish to better understand variability in fish elemental content caused by differences in species, habitat, season, life stage, or size. Fish were sampled within Bark Bay slough and at its inlet/outlet to Bark Bay, Lake Superior, from May to November 1995. Elemental content averaged across all fish (n = 192) was 45.1% for C, 11.3% for N, and 2.45% for P. We did find significant differences (p less than or equal to 0.05) among nine tested species. However, less than one third of the analyses were significant for effects of location or date of capture or fish length on fish nutrient content and nutrient ratios. Regressions of N:P ratios against growth rate indices and, separately, fineness ratios were significant, suggesting that growth rate and body shape are important factors driving N:P ratios in fish.

J	Dean, WE; Schwalb, A				Dean, WE; Schwalb, A			Holocene environmental and climatic change in the Northern Great Plains recorded in the geochemistry of sediments in Pickerel Lake, South Dakota	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												The sediments in Pickerel Lake, northeastern South Dakota, provide a continuous record of climatic and environmental change for the last 12000 yr. Sediments deposited between 12 and 6 ka (radiocarbon) show extreme variations in composition, oxygen and carbon isotopic composition of bulk carbonate, carbon isotopic composition of organic matter, and magnetic susceptibility. These variations reflect changes in sources of moisture, regional vegetation types, precipitation-evaporation balance, ground- and surface-water influx, water residence time, erosion, lake productivity, water level, and water temperature. The total carbonate content of late Pleistocene sediments steadily increased from <20% at the base of the core to as much as 80% in sediments deposited between 11 and 9 ka. By about 8 ka, the total carbonate content of the sediments had declined to about 40% where it remained with little variation for the past 8 kyr, suggesting relatively stable conditions. There are marked increases in values of delta(13)C and delta(18)O in bulk carbonate, and delta(13)C of organic matter, in sediments deposited between 10 and 6 ka as evaporation increased, and the vegetation in the watershed changed from forest to prairie. This shift toward more O-18-enriched carbonate may also reflect a change in source or seasonality of precipitation. During this early Holocene interval the organic carbon (OC) content of the sediments remained relatively low (2-3%), but then increased rapidly to 4.5% between 7 and 6 ka, reflecting the rapid transition to a prairie lake. The OC content fluctuates slightly between 4 and 6% in sediments deposited over the past 6 kyr. Like OC and total carbonate. most variables measured show little variation in the 13 m of sediment deposited over the past 6 kyr, particularly when compared with early Holocene variations. Although the magnetic susceptibility of this upper 13 m of sediment is generally low (<10 SI units), the upper six meters of the section is marked by striking 1 m cycles (ca. 400-500 yr periodicity) in susceptibility. These cycles are interpreted as being due to variations in the influx of eolian detrital-clastic material Century-scale cyclic variations in different proxy variables for aridity and eolian activity from sediments deposited over the past 2000 yr in other lakes in the northern Great Plains, as well as in sand dune activity, suggest that aridity cycles were the dominant feature of late Holocene climate of the northern Great Plains.

J	Silvano, RAM; do Amaral, BD; Oyakawa, OT				Silvano, RAM; do Amaral, BD; Oyakawa, OT			Spatial and temporal patterns of diversity and distribution of the Upper Jurua River fish community (Brazilian Amazon)	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												We studied spatial and temporal patterns in fish species composition and diversity at the upper Jurua River located in the west Brazilian Amazon. We collected with gillnet 822 fishes belonging to 90 species in the main Jurua River, its tributaries and the floodplain lakes during wet and dry seasons. Fish abundance and species richness were greater in the dry season. During that season, fishes may be concentrated due to the low water level, being caught more easily by gillnets. There has been a trend towards a greater fish biomass caught in lakes. This might be associated with a greater environmental stability as lakes may be less subject to large variations in water level. The fish communities differed between the two seasons and between lakes and the lotic environments (main river and tributaries). Fish species from the family Curimatidae were most abundant in the lakes, while Pimelodus spp. and Hypostomus spp. predominated in the main Jurua River. Seasonal variations in fish communities may be related to differences in the migratory behavior among fish species. Such spatial and temporal patterns influencing fish community structure at the Upper Jurua Extractive Reserve must be accounted for in management and conservation strategies.

These three shallow lakes share certain limnological features (size, mean depth, littoral macrophytes, among others) and the land usage in their basins (e.g. agriculture, cattle ranching and/or touristic activities). We surveyed the bird community at these three wetlands over three years (May 2006-May 2009), using transects and point counts to characterise their species richness, abundance, community composition and seasonality. We recorded a total of 135 species belonging to 41 families. The Relative Importance Index showed that the neotropic cormorant Phalacrocorax olivaceus, the cattle egret Bubulcus ibis, the white-tufted grebe Rollandia rolland and the white-faced ibis Plegadis chihi are the most representative species. Species richness, species composition and abundance differed between wetlands. Such differences could be attributed to particular factors such as proximity to urban centres or other wetlands, and to the impact of recreational activities. Considering that the Pampean region is currently under strong anthropogenic impacts, the present study contributes to the improvement of management plans that are currently in place or under development.					; Favero, Marco/AGF-7428-2022	Favero, Marco/0000-0003-1293-3417; 													0570-7358					JUN	2012	59	1					93	109		10.13157/arla.59.1.2012.93	http://dx.doi.org/10.13157/arla.59.1.2012.93													WOS:000314260600007

While SALMO is driven by process-based differential equations, the model ANNA is designed as recurrent feedforward neural network trained by time series data. Predictions of chlorophyll-a for the years 1979-1982 by both models were validated by means of measured data. Results showed that SALMO is able to predict annual average trends not only of chlorophyll-a but other chemical and biological state variables as well. It supports decision making by evaluating alternative scenarios for strategic eutrophication control. The model ANNA achieved reasonable accuracy in predicting timing and magnitudes of algal biomass up to 7 days ahead. The recurrent feedforward architecture of ANNA proved to be most efficient in order to model and predict seasonal dynamics of chlorophyll-a and its forecasting results can be utilized for early warning and tactical control of algal blooms in freshwater lakes. A sensitivity analysis conducted by ANNA revealed that algal abundance in Burrinjuck Reservoir is not only driven by physical and chemical characteristics of the water body but to a large extend by hydrological characteristics such as water depth as well.

J	Labonne, M; Ben Othman, D; Luck, JM				Labonne, M; Ben Othman, D; Luck, JM			Pb isotopes in mussels as tracers of metal sources and water movements in a lagoon (Thau Basin, S. France)	CHEMICAL GEOLOGY												Metal concentrations (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb) and lead isotopic compositions have been determined in mussel's fleshes from the Thau lagoon (S. France). Mussel spat from sea was introduced at different locations in the lagoon in June 1995, and subsequently sampled in October 1995, and January, May, and July 1996. Each location was chosen for its particular environment: (1) an industrial harbour at sea, (2) water treatment plant effluents. (3) nearby city with no seawater entries. and (4) the middle of the lagoon. A reference point was also kept at sea. Variations in heavy metal concentrations generally correlate with weight of the animals, but some could be linked to particular local and temporal events such as outflows or tourist activity. The Pb isotopic compositions of the soft parts allow: (1) to identify the predominant sources of Pb and their seasonal variations; (2) to estimate their respective impact; and (3) to present a dynamic vision of the water movements in the lagoon comparing with climatic observations (wind), and their mixing with seawater entries. The possible use of isotopic tools in understanding the capture and the storage of metal in different organs in the mussels is also discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

PCBs refocused: Correlation of PCB concentrations in Green Bay legacy sediments with adjacent lithophilic, invasive biota	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Green Bay sediments exhibit a gradient of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations from the mouth of the Fox River to the northern end of the bay. This study explored whether the sediment concentration gradient was reflected along Green Bay's rocky (non-depositional) eastern coast in a suspension feeder, the invasive quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis), as well as in the main predator on quagga mussels, the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). We performed congener-specific PCB analyses on quagga mussels and round gobies collected from ten sites along the east shore of Green Bay. PCB results were compared with sediment data. Regression analyses showed that mussel tissue PCB concentrations followed sediment PCB concentrations (F-1,F-6 = 16.4, P = 0.007) except at two sites near Sturgeon Bay where cleaner Lake Michigan water enters in tidal pulses. Round goby PCB concentrations also followed the sediment trends (F-1,F-7 = 8.17, P = 0.024). However, only a weak relationship between PCB concentrations in quagga mussel and round goby was found (P = 0.085), even though the species are trophically linked. Here, ontogenetic and seasonal details of round goby diet strongly influenced PCB concentrations such that in areas adjacent to high sediment PCB concentrations, fish length dictated round goby's PCB concentration (F-1,F-14 = 7.46, P = 0.016). Overall, our findings indicate that these exotic benthos refocus PCBs in near-shore regions in a pattern similar to that observed in sediments. Our results also highlight the need to understand trophic details in order to track contaminant bioaccumulation accurately. (c) 2015 International Association for Great Lakes Research.

The main aim of this study is to develop a hydrodynamics model of an actual dam reservoir in three dimensions for simulating a real dam reservoir flows for different seasons. The model is developed using nonlinear and unsteady continuity, momentum, energy and k-epsilon turbulence model equations. In order to include the Coriolis force effect on the flow in a dam reservoir, Coriolis force parameter is also added the model equations. Those equations are constructed using actual dimensions, shape, boundary and initial conditions of the dam and reservoir. Temperature profiles and flow visualizations are used to evaluate flow conditions in the reservoir. Reservoir flow's process and parameters are determined all over the reservoir. The mathematical model developed is capable of simulating the flow and thermal characteristics of the reservoir system for seasonal heat exchanges. Model simulations results obtained are compared with field measurements obtained from gauging stations for flows in different seasons. The results show a good agreement with the field measurements.																			0042-790X	1338-4333				MAR	2015	63	1					38	+		10.1515/johh-2015-0007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/johh-2015-0007													WOS:000356811500005

Model performance testing results show that producer accuracy and kappa coefficient of the ORF approach are 0.916 and 0.903, which are higher than the traditional maximum likelihood method. Furthermore, we analyzed the characteristic of land cover dynamic change and seasonal variation of wetlands landscape in 2002 and 2017, and revealed their driving mechanisms and ecological response process. The conclusions are as follows: (1) Lake area expanded in the past 15 years because of increased glacial runoff generated from global warming. Construction land and farmland replaced wetland areas in the middle and downstream regions. Moreover, due to the limitation of hydrothermal conditions in the canyon, few forests in the northeastern basin transferred to shrubs. (2) Dam, which was constructed in northern Napahai lake, controls water storage and made the lake area stable after 2013, so, area change percentage in 2017 from wet to dry season is lower than 2002. The wetland region in the central and downstream basin was synthetically affected by climate change and drainage projects, so its environment condition becomes dryer, and vegetation communities' succession shows a reversed process. (3) Ecological problems in the Napahai Basin were mainly reflected at aspects of agricultural nonpoint source pollution, overgrazing, and urbanization. These factors affected lake, soil, and groundwater in the Napahai Basin and destroyed the ecological health of wetland landscapes. Therefore, in order to realize sustainable development environmental resources, local government should propose the effective policies to restore the degraded ecosystem and protect natural wetland.

Dreissena bugensis profunda is a morphologically distinct dreissenid taxon, representing either a third species or a phenotype of D. bugensis. In in situ mussels, D. polymorpha and D. bugensis from the wave zone spawned simultaneously, approximately 1 week before D. bugensis profunda from the epilimnion and hypolimnion. Dreissena bugensis profunda from the hypolimnion spawned at 9 degrees C, which is below the previously accepted minimum dreissenid spawning temperature (12 degrees C), and may explain why D. bugensis profunda is proliferating in the hypolimnion. The gametogenic index of all taxa was significantly correlated with temperature at all sites. The gametogenic index of D. bugensis profunda from the epilimnion and hypolimnion was significantly correlated with water protein and chlorophyll a content, respectively. In mussels transplanted to the epilimnion, D. bugensis and D, bugensis profunda spawned simultaneously between August 18 and 28, approximately 2 weeks before D. polymorpha. In mussels transplanted to the hypolimnion, D. bugensis and D. bugensis profunda spawned between July 27 and August 18 at a temperature of 9-10 degrees C. Dreissena polymorpha neither spawned nor showed significant gametogenic development, which suggests that this taxon cannot successfully colonize hypolimnial waters.																			0008-4301					NOV	1998	76	11					2010	2019		10.1139/cjz-76-11-2010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-76-11-2010													WOS:000080396100005

The use of aquatic plants by populations of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) (Bivalvia: Dreissenidae) in a small glacial lake	NAUTILUS												We examined the early life history of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in a small Pennsylvania lake with limited natural hard substrate. Veligers first appear in May, and settled on Nuphar (Yellow Water Lily) stems and concrete substrates in equal densities. Later cohorts, however, did not settle on the stems. juveniles on stems abruptly abandoned their attachment in late August as the plant tissue began senescence. Aquarium experiments demonstrated that juveniles retained the ability to seek and find alternate substrates even after several months. Year-old zebra mussels were markedly unsuccessful in comparison. We speculate that in lakes with limited natural hard substrates aquatic plants may play an important role in zebra mussel recruitment, although juveniles must be able to locate alternate substrates as plant populations senesce at the end of the season. The resulting high mortality may limit mussel populations in these lakes.																			0028-1344					JUL 7	2010	124	2					100	106																WOS:000280086200004

Lake-level records since mid-1996 indicate seasonal water elevation variations of 0.3 m amplitude superimposed on a roughly "decadal'' feature of amplitude similar to0.6 m. Using an elastic Green's function and a simplified load geometry for GSL, we calculate that these variations translate into radial crustal loading signals of +/-0.5 mm (seasonal) and +/-1 mm (decadal). The horizontal loading signals are a factor of similar to2 smaller. Despite the small size of the expected loading signals, we conclude that we can observe them using GPS time series for the coordinates of these two sites. The observed amplitudes of the variations agree with the predicted decadal variations to <0.5 mm. The observed annual variations, however, disagree; this difference may be caused by some combination of local precipitation-induced site motion, unmodeled loading from other nearby sources, errors in the GSL model, and atmospheric errors.					; Davis, James/D-8766-2013	Elosegui, Pedro/0000-0002-4120-7855; Davis, James/0000-0003-3057-477X													0094-8276					FEB 5	2003	30	3							1111	10.1029/2002GL016579	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2002GL016579													WOS:000181887200005
J	Tollrian, R; Laforsch, C				Tollrian, Ralph; Laforsch, Christian			Linking predator kairomones and turbulence:: synergistic effects and ultimate reasons for phenotypic plasticity in Daphnia cucullata	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												The seasonal change in helmet size in Daphnia cucullata has been studied for over one century. Recently it has been shown that helmets in D. cucullata, which have been found to reduce predator caused mortality, can be induced by chemical cues released by several predatory invertebrates. However, it also has been shown that turbulence induces this trait. The relation and interplay of both inducing cues is not known. Here we present results from lab experiments showing that predator cues and turbulence can act synergistically. Both factors in combination induced significantly larger responses, compared to each factor alone, and helmets reached the maximum sizes found in natural lakes. This result might help to explain the observation of large helmets in this species in nature. The ultimate reason behind the turbulence induction is yet unknown. We link both induction factors to predation, as the ultimate reason, by testing the hypothesis that D. cucullata can respond to turbulence produced by swimming invertebrates. We found that helmet growth increased significantly in direct contact to both the heterospecific Daphnia magna and the predator Cyclops sp. Treatments which accounted for chemical cues alone did not increase helmet growth in response to cues from D. magna, or Cyclops under these conditions. Together, these results indicate that D. cucullata is able to respond to mechanical cues produced by swimming invertebrates. Thus, our study suggests that both chemical cues and turbulence generated by predatory invertebrates might act synergistically to induce helmets as effective protection against invertebrate predation.

This study focuses on the Cretaceous strata of the Qiantang Sag, proposing a multi-phase sedimentary model for the Cretaceous Period. Through detailed analysis of the regional geological structure and sedimentary strata, this study unveils the complex sedimentary processes experienced by the Qiantang Sag during the Cretaceous. Utilizing drilling and core data combined with seismic geological interpretation, this study identifies that the western part of the Qiantang Sag predominantly developed alluvial fan and braided river deposits in an arid to semi-arid environment during the Cretaceous. Detrital zircon U-Pb dating analysis provides key information on the provenance areas and sedimentation ages, indicating that the Zhe-Min Uplift was the primary source region for the Qiantang Sag during the Cretaceous. Integrating vertical sedimentary sequences with provenance analysis, this study proposes sedimentary models and reconstructs the paleo-depositional evolution of the Qiantang Sag across different geological periods. During the Early Cretaceous Yushan Period, the region was influenced by intense volcanic activity, while also developing alluvial fan deposits in an arid environment. The Late Cretaceous Minjiang Period was characterized by semi-arid alluvial fan and braided river deposits. In contrast, the subsequent Shimentan Period saw the development of similar deposits, with the possible addition of seasonal lake deposits.

Mussels as a bioindicator species are often used for assessment the presence of potentially toxic metals. Hence, the present study aimed to assess the effect of seasonal variations on some heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Pb, As, Zn and Cu) accumulation in water and Dreissena polymorpha from lake habitat. Our result indicated that Zn accumulated at a very high level in the zebra mussels while As accumulated at a high level in water samples. Seasonal variations significantly affected Cu concentration in the water samples (P < 0.05) while Cr concentration in the mussel samples was significantly affected by seasonal variations (P < 0.05). According to the water analysis, mean concentrations of metals are below the maximum limits established by the World Health Organization and USEPA, except As. Overall, our data emphasize anthropogenic pollution in the Turkish aquatic environment and confirm the use of D. polymorpha as a prospective biomonitor for metal polluted sites'.																			0007-4861	1432-0800				MAR	2024	112	3							43	10.1007/s00128-024-03869-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-024-03869-y								38409431					WOS:001171843100001

We developed a hierarchical object-based image classification model with multi-seasonal Sentinel-2 imagery and suitable spectral indices in order to map the aquatic vegetation in a Mediterranean oligotrophic/mesotrophic deep lake; we then applied the model to another lake with similar abiotic and biotic characteristics. Field data from a survey of aquatic macrophytes, undertaken on the same dates as EO data, were used within the accuracy assessment. The aquatic vegetation was discerned into three classes: emergent, floating, and submerged aquatic vegetation. Geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) proved to be effective in discriminating the three classes in both study areas. Results showed high effectiveness of the classification model in terms of overall accuracy, particularly for the emergent and floating classes. In the case of submerged aquatic vegetation, challenges in their classification prompted us to establish specific criteria for their accurate detection. Overall results showed that GEOBIA based on spectral indices was suitable for mapping aquatic vegetation in oligotrophic/mesotrophic deep lakes. EO data can contribute to large-scale coverage and high-frequency monitoring requirements, being a complementary tool to in situ monitoring.

Late Pliocene vegetation and climate of the Yushe Basin, Northern China	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												The Pliocene warm period is regarded as an analogue of future warming, and quantitative reconstruction of palaeovegetation and palaeoclimate during this period is helpful for predicting vegetation and climate changes in the future. Here, we quantitatively reconstructed the late Pliocene vegetation and climate based on phytolith assemblages from the Upper Zhangcun Formation in the Yushe Basin, Northern China. The results show that the vegetation was dominated by grasses with few trees, which conflicts with the pollen assemblage results. The possible reason for this contradiction is that phytoliths tend to mirror local, shoreline vegetation (grasses with few aquatic plants), while pollen tend to mirror both local and regional vegetation (trees in surrounding mountains and piedmont, grasses on lakeshores and aquatic plants in wetlands) in a small structurally confined lake. The phytolith-based quantitative reconstruction of mean annual precipitation (812-1673 mm) and warm season precipitation (417-1197 mm) provides values that are higher than those at present, revealing an increase in Asian monsoon rainfall during the late Pliocene, which is consistent with the pollen results, although the reconstructed vegetation is different. This study highlights the usefulness of phytoliths in reconstructing Cenozoic vegetation and climate and underlines the importance of landforms in determining phytolith and pollen assemblages in sediments.

J	Zhu, YM; Shu, KN; Yang, K; Chen, Z				Zhu, Yingmo; Shu, Kangning; Yang, Ke; Chen, Zhe			Purification Efficiency of Two Ecotypes of Wetland Plants on Subtropical Eutrophic Lakes in China	WETLANDS												The accelerated eutrophication rate of (sub)tropical lakes is a major environmental problem. Constructed wetlands are considered as an effective method to purify water bodies. However, the removal rate of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and other nutrients by wetland vegetation is quite different, and the continuous observation of plants and water ecosystems is required. In this study, the growth curves of two subtropical wetland plants, Phragmites australis and Zizania caduciflora, and their absorption effects on N and P in constructed wetlands were studied. The results showed that the growth curves of the two wetland plants were similar, reaching the biomass peak in July to August, and the cumulative absorption of N and P by plants had the same trend with the change of biomass. The N and P concentration of plants reached the peak in March to April, with higher concentration in Phragmites australis than that of Zizania caduciflora. At the end of the growing season, i.e. around October 20, the accumulated absorption of N and P by plants reached the maximum, which was the optimal time for harvest of subtropical wetland plants. Thereafter, the residues of plant litter entered the water, causing the recovery of N and P concentration in the water body, therefore affected the purification function of wetland. There is a strong correlation between the water purification efficiency and plant growth. With the increase of biomass, N and P accumulation in Phragmites australis and Zizania caduciflora, the N, P content and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in the water of wetland showed a significant decreasing trend. The removal rates of N, P, COD and suspended substance (SS) in the constructed wetlands with Phragmites australis and Zizania caduciflora as the main plants were 95%, 96%, 82% and 86%, respectively. In general, the purification capacity of Phragmites australis is slightly higher than that of Zizania caduciflora and precipitation had positive effects on the pollutants concentration of wetland water. The results provide scientific basis for plant selection and management of subtropical constructed wetlands.					chen, junchen/KHW-4086-2024														0277-5212	1943-6246				MAR	2024	44	3							29	10.1007/s13157-024-01787-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-024-01787-7													WOS:001163821700001

The sequential extraction method, high-resolution peeper (HR-Peeper), and diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) techniques were used to study the occurrence characteristics, release risk, and release mechanism of phosphorus (P) at the sediment-water interface (SWI) of Ulanor Wetland in the Hulun Lake Basin, Inner Mongolia, China. The mean total P concentration in overlying water was lower in August than that in May. Dissolved organic P (DOP) or particulate P (PP) was the main form of P in the overlying water. PP dominates in May and DOP in August. Refractory P was the main form of P in sediments. The concentrations of soluble reactive P and DGT-active P in the pore water of the sediment column were higher than those in the overlying water, and the concentrations were higher in August than those in May. Release of P in the wetland sediments occurred during the non-frozen seasons, with a higher risk in August than in May. The good linear correlation between dissolved P, Fe, and Mn in the DGT profiles verified their co-release due to the anaerobic reduction of Fe/Mn oxides. Moreover, alkaline sediments are also conducive to the release of sediment P. This study can provide data and theoretical support for eutrophication control in Ulanor Wetland and other similar water bodies in cold and arid regions.

Bird-habitat associations and local-scale vegetation structure in lowland brushlands	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												Brushlands support a diverse suite of bird species, including species of conservation concern in the western Great Lakes region of central North America. Information on how to effectively manage lowland brushlands for birds and associations between breeding birds and local-scale vegetation structure and composition is lacking. We surveyed lowland brushlands from 2016-2018 in Minnesota, USA, to assess bird-habitat associations using avian point-count surveys and fixed-radius vegetation plots. We used Poisson regression models to assess the associations between breeding bird species richness, total abundance, and abundance of frequently detected species (using counts as an index for abundance) to woody stem density and height, patchiness of woody stem density, variation of woody stem height, and number of woody plant species. Sedge wrens (Cistothorus stellaris), the most abundant species, were negatively associated with multiple woody plant metrics and positively associated with patchiness. Common yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) were the second-most abundant species and associated with low-stature woody plants (<1 m based on average heights in study sites). Bird species richness, alder flycatchers (Empidonax alnorum), chestnut-sided warblers (Setophaga pensylvanica), swamp sparrows (Melospiza georgiana), veeries (Catharus fuscescens), and yellow warblers (Setophaga petechia) increased with woody vegetation height. Chestnut-sided warbler and Nashville warbler (Leiothlypis ruficapilla) abundances also increased with woody stem density. We suggest that managing lowland brushlands to promote diverse woody plant structure, including tall shrubs and areas with patchy, open herbaceous cover, by implementing temporally and spatially variable disturbance regimes, may benefit bird species that rely on lowland brushlands with a range of vegetation structure requirements.					; Andersen, David/LXU-4664-2024	Frelich, Lee/0000-0002-9052-7070; Andersen, David/0000-0001-9535-3404; Hawkinson, Annie/0000-0002-9881-8622; 													0022-541X	1937-2817				MAY	2024	88	4								10.1002/jwmg.22568	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.22568		FEB 2024											WOS:001178393300001

Analysing the quality of Botswana's surface waters in terms of microbial contamination and postulating feasible treatment and removal means	ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY												The quality of public health depends amongst others, access to safe water that would not cause waterborne diseases. In Botswana, water is obtained from various sources that include perennial rivers, lakes, seasonal water basins and underground aquifers, to sustain various ecosystems including human life. Therefore, assessing water for the presence of potential contaminants that include pathogenic microbes gives an understanding on the overall quality of water in the country. Here, we review studies that were conducted to determine the extent to which surface water is contaminated in Botswana. We discuss the nature and prevalence of different pathogenic microbes throughout the country, notably in the Thamalakane, Boro, Notwane and Okavango Rivers. It became apparent that microbial contaminants may display seasonal variability and reflect land use. We then discuss some of the available water treatment options and point out the relatively new technologies that can be developed further. This is to give a foundation for future research where innovation is required, such as in the development of portable homemade nanofiltration setups and next generation materials like graphene. The main aim of the review is to sensitise the readership, public and governmental bodies on the prevalence of contamination as well as plausible purification and disinfection means.

Using spectral indices from Landsat, the current research evaluated droughts' magnitude and frequency in the Diyala River Catchment, Iraq, during the growing season for 2013 through 2022. Fifteen mosaics were created over ten years using forty images in TM and ETM + (167/36 and 168/37) that had been gathered from 2013 to 2022. The scenes are from two Landsat time series. The drought situation was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Vegetation Condition Index, and Normalized Difference Water Index. The research's findings revealed a rise in the DRC's occurrence and severity of drought over the past ten years, especially in 20 0 0 and 2008. However, between 2021 and 2022, the total vegetation covered based on NDVI decreased by 20.67% and 36.33%, respectively. In 2021 and 2022, the vegetation cover significantly decreased (54.3% and 29.5%, respectively). Derbendekan and Hemrin lakes, conversely, experienced declines of 15.1%, 7.12%, 108.38%, and 143.33% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Between 2013 and 2022, the DRC experienced an increase in drought, a decline in water body surface area, and a decrease in precipitation averages.

Dry-season soil water repellency affects Tahoe Basin infiltration rates	CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE												Lake Tahoe's declining clarity makes the identification of runoff and erosion sources and evaluation of control measures vitally important. We treated relatively undisturbed, native, forested sites of 10% to 15% slope with surfactant and used a rainfall simulator to investigate the effects of repellency. We compared infiltration measurements made by the simulator and a mini-disk infiltrometer (MDI). Runoff was produced by all plots with untreated water, but only two of 12 plots with surfactant. At volcanic soil sites, infiltration rates using surfactant exceeded those with water by only 20% when there was little litter cover, but with substantial litter the infiltration rates increased threefold. Similarly, at the granitic soil sites surfactant-enhanced infiltration rates were four times greater with scant litter, and eight times greater with substantial litter cover. Postsimulation soil moisture content and wetting depths were greater with the surfactant treatment. Excavations under surfactant treatments revealed that discontinuities in the soil's hydrophobic organic layer resulted in preferential infiltration zones in the mineral soils below.																			0008-0845	2160-8091				JUL-SEP	2010	64	3					141	148		10.3733/ca.v064n03p141	http://dx.doi.org/10.3733/ca.v064n03p141													WOS:000280103800008

Driving forces of the diet distribution of phytoplankton functional groups in a shallow tropical lake(Lake Monte Alegre, Southeast Brazil)	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY												Phytoplankton vertical and diel dynamics in a small shallow lake (Lake Monte Alegre, Ribeirao Preto, state of Sao Paulo) were investigated in two climatological periods: July 2001 (cool-dry season) and March 2002 (warm-rainy season). Monte Alegre is a eutrophic reservoir, with a warm polymictic discontinuous circulation pattern. The lake was thermally stratified in both periods, although dissolved oxygen varied less in the cool-dry period. Phytoplankton biomass was higher in the warm-rainy season and the vertical distribution was stratified in both seasons. Flagellate groups (L-m, Y, W-1 and W-2) and functional groups typical of shallow eutrophic environments (J, X-1 and S-n) were important throughout the study period. The lake's thermal pattern strongly influenced the vertical distribution of the phytoplankton community in both periods.

Monitoring the fluvial palynomorph load in a lowland temperate catchment and its relationship to suspended sediment and discharge	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Despite it being a component of the seston we know very little about fluvial (waterborne) pollen and spore (palynomorph) transport. This paper presents the results of a monitoring programme conducted over two years and at a catchment scale in South West England. A hierarchical monitoring network was established with flood peak samples taken at 9 sub-catchments, intra-hydrograph samples taken in two sub-catchments and time-integrated sampling undertaken at one location. In addition sampling was undertaken of probable palynomorph sources such as channel bed and bank sediments, and the airborne pollen flux was monitored using modified Tauber traps. The results support previous research in illustrating how the vast majority of fluvial pollen and spores are transported during floods (91%) and that the main control on waterborne palynomorph assemblages is the catchment vegetation and its spatial distribution but with a long-distance (extra-catchment) component. However, strong seasonal effects are also shown, and the importance of distinctive sources such as the riparian input, bed re-suspension and overland flow into drains and tributaries is revealed. Fine sediment in river pools appears to act as a selective store of damaged cereal type pollen grains derived from arable fields. Although pollen does form part of composite particles the data presented here suggest that the majority of the pollen is transported as single grains. Fluvial palynomorph loading is strongly dependant upon discharge and so concentrations in laminated or varved sediments could be regarded as a proxy for flood magnitude.

Temporal dynamics of inundation area, hydrochemistry and brine in Bakhtegan Lake, South-Central Iran	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study region: Bakhtegan Lake, southern Iran, is a "Wetland of International Importance" (Ramsar Site). Study focus: This study focuses on analyzing the time series of the lake's inundation area, identifying factors contributing to its shrinkage, and studying its hydrochemical characteristics. To map the inundation area, Landsat images from 1972 to 2019 were used and 64 water samples were collected from the lake during 2017-2019 for geochemical modeling. New hydrological insights for the region: The study reveals that the Bakhtegan Lake has become a seasonal lake with a long-term dry state since 2007. The lake's inundation area shows a significant correlation with the Kor River discharge, and the main reason for the lake's shrinkage is a decrease in river inflow due to over -exploitation in the basin and construction of two new dams since 2007. The lake water and brine below the lake bed have TDS concentrations varying between 70000 and 451000 mg/L and 118000-373000 mg/L, respectively. The Gibbs, Nanormalized ratio end -member diagrams show that the lake water chemistry is mainly controlled by evaporation. The saturation index indicates that brine samples were in an equilibrium state with gypsum, halite, and glauberite. The Spencer diagram and evolutionary pathway model suggest that water samples shifted toward natural sulfate -rich minerals during evaporation. The lake water evolution model predicts precipitation of halite, kieserite, and carnallite minerals during progressive evaporation.																				2214-5818				APR	2024	52								101714	10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101714	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2024.101714		FEB 2024											WOS:001195575900001

A major reason for this is the continuous supply of dissolved CO2 gas available to C. acidophila from fumaroles at the lake bottom. The delta(13)C of P. acidojaponica in Lake Katanuma varied seasonally and was positively correlated with P. dcidojaponica abundance at 1 and 4 m depths. This suggests that the higher P. acidojaponica biomass at 1 and 4 m produced the C-13-enrichment in the high-density algal mats because of the limited dissolved CO2 gas. The mean delta(13)C of benthic diatoms was higher than that of phytoplankton in Lake Katanuma, although the diatoms seemed to assimilate the same carbon source (CO2 gas) in the lake water.

Remote sensing has worked to fill this gap in observations, with active microwave sensors, particularly synthetic-aperture radar (SAR), being a crucial technology. However, the impact of wet conditions on radar and how interactions change under these conditions have been largely ignored. It is important to understand these interactions as warming conditions are likely to lead to an increase in the occurrence of slush layers. This study works to address this gap using the Snow Microwave Radiative Transfer (SMRT) model to conduct forward-modelling experiments of backscatter for Lake Oulujarvi in Finland. Experiments were conducted under dry conditions, under moderate wet conditions, and under saturated conditions. These experiments reflected field observations during the 2020-2021 ice season. Results of the dry-snow experiments support the dominance of surface scattering from the ice-water interface. However, conditions where layers of wet snow are introduced show that the primary scattering interface changes depending on the location of the wet layer. The addition of a saturated layer at the ice surface results in the highest backscatter values due to the larger dielectric contrast created between the overlying dry snow and the slush layer. Improving the representation of these conditions in SMRT can also aid in more accurate retrievals of lake ice properties such as roughness, which is key for inversion modelling of other properties such as ice thickness.

J	An, YJ; Kampbell, DH; Sewell, GW				An, YJ; Kampbell, DH; Sewell, GW			Water quality at five marinas in Lake Texoma as related to methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)	ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION												Water quality in five marinas on Lake Texoma, located on the Oklahoma and Texas border, was monitored between June 1999 and November 2000. Focus was to evaluate lake water associated with marinas for methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). Lake water was collected at locations identified as marina entrance, gasoline filling station, and boat dock. Occurrence of MTBE showed a direct seasonal trend with recreational boating activity at marina areas. There was a positive correlation with powerboat usage ratio, which was directly related to the gallons of gasoline sold. Sampling before and after the high boat use holiday weekends determined the apparent influence of powerboat activity on MTBE contamination. Boat dock locations were the most sensitive sites to MTBE contamination, possibly due to gasoline spillage during engine startup. The most common compound of the BTEX series found with MTBE was toluene and co-occurrence was most frequent at gasoline filling stations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

BATHYMETRIC, SEASONAL AND VERTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF FEEDING-TYPES OF NEMATODES IN AN OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE	VIE ET MILIEU-LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT												Although nematodes are the most common organism group in freshwater meiobenthos, little is known about their role in the trophic webs of lentic systems. In this report the bathymetric, seasonal and vertical distribution of four feeding-types of nematodes in the oligotrophic, alpine lake Konigssee are described. Deposit-feeders predominate at all depths, followed by epistrate-feeders, chewers and suction feeders. Deposit-feeders are particularly abundant in the littoral at 5 m water depth, epistrate-feeders in the tropholytic zone at 30 m depth, chewers in the littoral at 1 m depth and suction feeders in the littoral at 2 m and 5 m depth. All feeding types showed variation across months and water depths in their abundances. Chewers and suction feeders are slightly more common in deeper sediment layers than deposit- and epistrate-feeders. The nematode fauna of Konigssee is dominated by bacteria and algae feeders.

Practical use of Phragmites australis to study evapotranspiration in a wetland zone of Lake Balaton (southwest Hungary)	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												In the present study, evapotranspiration (ET) data from a common reed-dominated wetland and its meteorological controls was analysed using measured ET (ET (m)) in compensation evapotranspirometers. Six seasons in the time period between 2003 and 2012 were assessed with the objective of converting theoretical observations into long-term practical use. They reveal the effects of annual fluctuations and allow for a more exact understanding of the results of ET losses, which remain an elusive and substantial part of the hydrologic budget particularly in wetland habitats. Daily measured ET rates were strongly influenced by weather variables causing considerable variation of ET characteristics between the two distinguished season types. The results of multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that the major meteorological elements impacting the sum of seasonal ET was much higher in the warm growing seasons (857 mm), due to increased available energy for ET, than in the cool season (385 mm). The sum of average ET totalled 778.6 mm over measurements. A simplified water budget analysis confirmed that adequate water volume, caused by precipitation, entered the Kis-Balaton wetland (KBW) area during the cool season. Conversely, in warm seasons, only 21.5 % of total ET resulted from rainfall, accentuating its seasonality in wetland. This information about annual variability of long-term ET values would assist in finding an ideal solution for determining the proper water level needed. The current balance of habitat types in wetland should be permanently assessed by selection of the suitable water level in order to sustain the most appropriate wetland ecological conditions.					; Teixeira da Silva, Jaime/N-9198-2015	Teixeira da Silva, Jaime A./0000-0003-3299-2772; Soos, Gabor/0000-0003-0053-9447													0177-798X	1434-4483				FEB	2017	127	3-4					899	909		10.1007/s00704-015-1679-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-015-1679-4													WOS:000393667700030

By 1988, the Leptodora population exhibited seasonal dynamics characteristic of natural populations. The maximum seasonal abundance of Leptodora increased to 85 individuals m(-3) 3 yr following the introduction. After the appearance of Leptodora, small-bodied cladocerans (Ceriodaphnia and Bosmina) virtually disappeared from the lake. There were strong seasonal shifts in the dominance patterns of both cladocerans and copepods, and Daphnia species diversity increased. Results from this unplanned introduction suggest that invertebrate predators can have a rapid and lasting effect on prey populations, even in the presence of planktivorous fish. Small-scale (<20 km) geographic barriers might be as important as large-scale barriers to dispersal of planktonic animals.					; Ghadouani, Anas/A-2568-2008	Kiesling, Richard/0000-0002-3017-1826; Ghadouani, Anas/0000-0002-1252-4851													0024-3590	1939-5590				JUL	2004	49	4	2				1239	1249		10.4319/lo.2004.49.4_part_2.1239	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.2004.49.4_part_2.1239													WOS:000224979800003
J	Luo, L; Su, D; Wang, T; Guo, WS				Luo, Li; Su, Dong; Wang, Tong; Guo, Wenshan			Integrated assessment of available water volume for sustainable sponge city construction - a case study in Xi'an, China	WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												To address the lack of theoretical guidance for sponge city construction (SCC) in China, this study introduces a method to evaluate the available water volume (AWV) in urban watersheds. This evaluation is based on the water balance relationship, water volume, and ecological water demand (EWD). The Xi'an urban area was selected as a case study due to its water shortage and flooding issues. Results show monthly surface and subsurface AWV ranging between 53.06 and 53.98 million m3 and between 8,701.89 and 8,898.14 million m3, respectively. By maximizing the potential for surface AWV, an annual water supply of 527.75 million m3 could be provided, surpassing the annual artificial water consumption of 394.20 million m3, effectively addressing water scarcity. During the rainy season, implementing measures such as employing permeable paving materials, establishing wetlands and rainwater gardens, and constructing lakes and reservoirs can mitigate flooding caused by rainfall exceeding 32.8 mm. While the subsurface space in Xi'an holds significant potential for subsurface AWV utilization, revitalizing the ecological environment of subsurface water is crucial. Overall, the AWV theoretical framework offers a comprehensive solution to water shortage and flooding issues in the Xi'an urban area, serving as a vital theory for SCC. HIGHLIGHTS Available water volume (AWV) is a novel index to guide sponge city construction. Water volume refers to the maximum volume to store water resources. EWD refers to the minimum water resources to meet the ecological environment. AWV refers to the total dynamic water volume to store water and used by humans. Water shortage problem in Xi'an urban area can be solved by using AWV.

J	Burke, TR; Cadman, MD; Nol, E				Burke, Tianna R.; Cadman, Michael D.; Nol, Erica			Reproductive success and health of breeding Bank Swallows (Riparia riparia) in aggregate (sand and gravel) pit and natural lakeshore habitats	CONDOR												Bank Swallows (Riparia riparia) are designated as Threatened in Canada, in part due to loss of natural breeding habitat along lakeshores and rivers. Excavation in sand and gravel pits (aka aggregate pits) has increased availability of potential nesting habitat away from lakes and rivers, and these substitute habitats may be important to stabilize the decline experienced by some Bank Swallow populations. Over 2 yr, we collected data on Bank Swallow reproductive success from 2 natural lakeshore habitat sites along bluffs of the north shore of Lake Ontario and 7 aggregate pits in southern Ontario, within 100 km of the lakeshore. Nests at the lakeshore habitat were initiated earlier than in aggregate pits, 8 days earlier in 2014 and 13 days earlier in 2015. Neither clutch size nor number of nestlings were different between the 2 habitat types. There were differences in the number of fledglings produced between the habitat types, with Bank Swallows nesting in aggregate pits raising more fledglings per successful nest. However, birds nesting in aggregate pits also had significantly more nests that raised no fledglings, even though eggs in those nests hatched. Breeding adults from aggregate pits were initially heavier than those from the lakeshore habitat, but their mass decreased significantly over the nesting season. Fledgling masses were not significantly different between habitat types. Parasite loads on fledgling Bank Swallows from aggregate pits were significantly lower than on fledglings from the lakeshore. These indicators suggest that aggregate pits can provide at least equivalent habitat for Bank Swallows to that provided by natural lakeshore habitat, making them potentially key for the recovery of this species in Ontario.																				1938-5129				NOV	2019	121	4							du2050	10.1093/condor/du2050	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/condor/du2050													WOS:000514612000010

The Main Factor Determining the Dynamics of the Lake Ecosystem under Excessive Nutrient Loading (A Case Study of the Naroch Lakes)	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												The system of the Naroch lakes, which includes the eutrophic Lake Batorino, the mesotrophic Lake Myastro, and the oligo-mesotrophic Lake Naroch, serves as a model object for the study of the factors initially influencing the state of a particular lake ecosystem affected by variable nutrient loading. Throughout the 1970s-2000s, these lakes have been going through the stages of anthropogenic eutrophication, deeutrophication, and benthification. A set of continuous data based on the seasonal means of the eight parameters from each lake for the period 1978-2015 has been analyzed by Principal Component and Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA, or Caterpillar). In addition, we consider the dynamics of the trophic index of each lake, which had been calculated earlier at the same data set. The first main component is the stability of the lake ecosystem under variable nutrient loading, which is inversely related to the trophic state of the water body. This component determines the condition of the Batorino, Myastro and Naroch lakes by 63, 65, and 43% respectively.					; Alimov, Aleksander/V-7180-2017; Adamovich, Boris/AAN-3750-2020; Kazantseva, Tamara/T-9164-2017	Adamovich, Boris V./0000-0002-2664-2533; 													1995-4255	1995-4263				NOV	2019	12	6					544	561		10.1134/S1995425519060052	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1995425519060052													WOS:000511674500004

The range of DOC concentrations was characteristic fur productive coastal marine ecosystems (60% of samples in the range of 1-2 mg l(-1) and 40% between 2 and 3 mg l(-1)). Distribution of SAS concentrations was uniform and shifted coward higher concentrations in comparison to other coastal areas in the Adriatic Sea. Eutrophication in the lake is generated by nutrient recycling under anaerobic conditions. Systematically higher concentrations of chlorophyll a, DOC and SAS were determined at the chemocline in the bottom layer (10-12 m) than in the upper water layer (0.5-2 m). Seasonal variability of organic matter was discussed regarding distributions of microphytoplankton (cells >20 mum) and photosynthetic pigments as well as oxygen and salinity changes along the depth profile. The dissolved oxygen saturation reaching up to 300% in the water layer between 8 m and 10 m depths in May and June 1996, was correlated with enhanced concentrations of phytoplankton biomass (reflected as chi a and b, fucoxanthin, peridinin, zeaxanthin) and increased concentrations of DOC and SAS.

Therefore, growth experiments with larvae of the midge Chironomus riparius (Meigen) were performed using food items of differing composition. First-instar larvae were reared in the presence of different concentrations of each food item, and larval length and instar were recorded after 1 wk. Saturation growth curves were fitted, and for each food item the slope and the maximum length attained by larvae were estimated. Food items were analyzed for organic matter, C, N, P,carbohydrates, proteins, and total fat content. Maximum length attained by larvae reared on fish foods and on food items of animal origin was higher than maximum length reached on food items of plant origin. In general slopes of the growth curves for larvae reared on foods of plant origin were higher than slopes of the growth curves for larvae reared on fish food and food of animal origin. Foods of plant origin had lower N, P, and lipid content and higher carbohydrate content than fish food and food of animal origin. Ordination of food composition and the saturation growth-curve parameters indicated that the optimal food composition depended on the amount of food available. For instance, high N, P,and lipid contents stimulated growth at high food levels, whereas the amount of carbohydrate appeared to be important in defining growth at low food levels. We suggest that this interaction is caused by limiting energy availability at low food levels versus limiting food quality at high food levels.																			0887-3593					MAR	2000	19	1					158	168		10.2307/1468288	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1468288													WOS:000087205700011

Differences in external morphology between pumpkinseed from the oxbow and both native North American (River Otonabee, Looncall Lake, Canada) and non-native Central European populations (side arms of the River Danube, Slovakia) were evaluated. Two possible morphotypes among adults were observed, whereas the morphology of juveniles appears rather uniform across geographical location (i.e. Otonabee, Looncall, Danube). This suggests that environmental conditions, i.e. epigenetical information, seem to be responsible for most of variability in pumpkinseed morphology, which represents a function of epigenetical mechanisms. However, further investigation into epigenetical interactions, especially early development, fecundity, number of spawning acts per season, parental care, egg size and age at maturation are necessary to test this hypothesis.

J	Roy, D; Haffner, GD; Brandt, SB				Roy, D; Haffner, GD; Brandt, SB			Estimating fish production potentials using a temporally explicit model	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												A temporally explicit model is developed to predict the growth rate potential of fish in response to temporal fluctuations in both prey availability and temperature structure of the water column at both long (seasonal) and short (daily) time scales. The model was tested in a 20 m water column in Lake Ontario using chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytcsha) and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) as predator and prey species, respectively. Prey availability was assessed using acoustic techniques, while temperature was measured with a temperature-depth profiler. Chinook growth rate potential was significantly greater during June than during other sampled months. The latter months supported little to no chinook growth potential as a result of low overlap in conditions supporting growth. On a diel scale, chinook growth rate potential was typically greater during crepuscular and night periods than during the day. Results reveal that both short and long term variability of prey density and thermal structure impose stringent limits to fish growth potential and production, and that fish grow well only over finite periods. The temporally explicit model provides quantitative predictions of fish production potential as influenced by temporal changes in habitat quality and/or climatic conditions. In light of recent modifications to both local and regional climate conditions, and the localised nature of fish harvesting practices, this model can assist in setting realistic production estimates and future potential harvesting quotas.

Consequently, it is imperative to develop monitoring plans that offer a comprehensive understanding of plastic contamination in these aquatic environments, given their seasonal variations in hydrochemical characteristics and anthropogenic sources. Historically, most global lake monitoring campaigns have been limited to one -time or, at most, seasonal sampling. In this context, the primary objective of the present study was to assess the quantitative and qualitative monthly variations of floating plastics in Lake Maggiore, a large European lake with high ecological and economic significance. Twelve transverse transects were conducted from January to December 2022 using a Manta-net with a 100 mu m mesh. Characterization of each plastic particle was performed using a mu-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscope (mu FT-IR). The results revealed relatively low levels of contamination in Lake Maggiore when compared with other lakes worldwide exclusively from a secondary origin. However, a considerable heterogeneity was observed, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, we identified a 13-fold difference between the minimum (0.02 plastics/m3 in September) and maximum (0.29 plastics/m3 in December) concentrations of plastics, accompanied by significant variations in polymer composition. Our monitoring underscored the necessity of also considering the temporal variation as a potential factor influencing plastic contamination in a lake. Moreover, frequent sampling emerged as a crucial requirement to accurately gauge the extent of plastic pollution, yielding robust and valuable data essential for effective environmental management.					; Binelli, Andrea/B-2685-2017; Galafassi, Silvia/HLQ-2238-2023; Sbarberi, Riccardo/NHP-0898-2025; Magni, Stefano/LOS-8131-2024	Sbarberi, Riccardo/0000-0003-3824-9752; Galafassi, Silvia/0000-0001-5392-0271; Magni, Stefano/0000-0002-5440-5236													0048-9697	1879-1026				APR 1	2024	919								170740	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170740	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170740		FEB 2024						38340826					WOS:001186934700001

Ecosystem-scale insights into the dynamics of dissolved organic matter in an Asia's largest brackish water lagoon: Sources, fluxes, and biogeochemical significance	MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN												A twenty-four month long observational study conducted in an Asia's largest brackish water ecosystem, Chilika Lagoon, India, aimed to unravel dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics in this tropical brackish water ecosystem. The study assessed the interplay between allochthonous and autochthonous DOM sources during lean and active flow periods based on regional rainfall. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrogen (DON), and phosphorus (DOP) fluxes were analyzed, considering catchment runoff, phytoplankton production, benthicpelagic interactions, and sea-lagoon exchanges as contributors. Contrary to conventional thinking, the study found autochthonous processes to be more significant than conservative mixing in shaping DOM dynamics. It introduced a novel conceptual model illustrating the multifaceted origins of DOM, encompassing catchment runoff, phytoplankton, benthic-pelagic interactions, bacterial activity, and sea-lagoon exchanges. These findings underscore the importance of holistic management strategies for Chilika Lagoon to preserve its ecological health, given its vital role in global carbon cycling, fisheries, and aquaculture.

The annual discharge rate of Cs-134 from the catchment was much higher than that of Cs-137. This difference suggests that Cs-134 freshly derived from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident accumulated in the surface soil, which acted as a major sediment source. The seasonal changes in the Cs-137/Pb-210(ex) ratio in the trap samples corresponded well to the precipitation changes. This suggests that the precipitation intensity affects the source of eroded sediment in the catchment.																			0236-5731	1588-2780				FEB	2015	303	2					1497	1501		10.1007/s10967-014-3577-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10967-014-3577-0													WOS:000348192200083

Simulated rainfall of 15-60 mm with infiltration depths of similar to 0.3-0.5 m, the lateral water migration ratios of similar to 52.9 %-86.2 % and the differential distribution of tracers with depth in the flat sand lands indicate that 15 mm rainfall is the critical rainfall for effective recharge of deep soil water and that there is a shift from piston flow to preferential flow of water during infiltration. Soil micro-bedding and 4.2 % soil gravity water from locally wet surface soils and 6 mm of natural rainfall resulted in lateral migration of the tracer similar to 1.2 m and 0.4 m in the slope surface and soil respectively, indicate surface flow and lateral gravity water flow resulting from differences in hydraulic conductivity and water-holding capacity of the soil micro-bedding. Soil water storage at 0-4 m depth showed that the bottom of the slope was similar to 30 mm higher than the middle of the slope after the rainy season and similar to 9 mm higher before the rainy season; in general the post-rainy season was similar to 30-40 mm higher than the pre-rainy season. Surface flow and lateral gravity water flow in unsaturated soils increase the intensity of lateral water movement on the slope and improve the effective conversion rate of rainfall to deep soil water, especially below 15 mm. Annual recharge of deep soil water, assessed using soil water change and critical rainfall, will not be less than 8.5 mm and may even reach an upper limit of similar to 30-40 mm. The megadune slopes respond strongly to local precipitation, which is sufficient to maintain the lake, but extreme precipitation does not play a decisive role. The methods and results provided in this work can advance our understanding of the desert hydrological cycle and water resources.					shao, tianjie/AGK-6783-2022; Ma, Yandong/H-6903-2016; Chen, Yunfei/LFU-2558-2024	Chen, Yunfei/0009-0001-7528-0380; 													0022-1694	1879-2707				MAR	2024	631								130844	10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.130844	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2024.130844		FEB 2024											WOS:001184832500001

Bird surveys were conducted in 54 water bodies within four water body systems aboard a speedboat, in July 2003, at the peak of the high water season. We recorded 2,823 individuals representing 79 bird species associated with aquatic environments, most]), resident; of these, 34 were aquatic (exclusively associated with aquatic environments), and 19 were primarily piscivorous. The aquatic bird Communities of Mamiraua and Amana comprise a few abundant species and a higher number of rare species. Seven species accounted for 71.7% of all 34 aquatic birds recorded. In general, the more elongated the water bodies, the lower the aquatic and piscivorous bird species richness, and the lower the bird abundance. Piscivorous bird abundance was not significantly related to water body shape. Matrices of bird species by water body were Subjected to multivariate analysis using Principal Co-ordinate Analysis (PCoA). For the quantitative data (species abundance) and qualitative data (species presence/absence), the composition of the community of aquatic birds changed significantly among lacustrine water body systems, and was significantly affected by water body shape. The quantitative and qualitative composition of the piscivorous bird community did not change significant]), among water body systems, and were not affected by water body shape. The numerical analyses revealed a remarkably different behavior of the communities of aquatic birds and piscivorous birds, the former changing significantly with lacustrine water body morphology and local geography (water body system), and the latter being relatively insensitive to variation in these parameters. Water body shape is one of the determinants of aquatic bird community composition in the seasonally flooded wetlands of this part of Amazonia.

Short-term growth (RNA/DNA ratio) of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in relation to environmental influences and spatio-temporal variation in a shallow fluvial lake	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Shallow fluvial lakes are heterogeneous ecosystems in which marked spatio-temporal variation renders difficult the analysis of key ecological processes, such as growth. In this study, we used generalized additive modelling of the RNA/DNA ratio, an index of short-term growth, to investigate the influence of environmental variables and spatio-temporal variation on growth of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in Lake St. Pierre, Quebec, Canada. Temperature and water level had seemingly stronger effects on short-term growth than seasonal change or spatial variation between and along the lakeshores. Consistent with previous studies, the maximum RNA/DNA ratio was found at 20.5 degrees C, suggesting that our approach provides a useful tool for estimating thermal optima for growth in the field. The RNA/DNA ratio showed a positive relationship with water level, as predicted by the flood pulse concept, a finding with implications for ecosystem productivity in fluvial lakes. The RNA/DNA ratio was more variable along the north than the south shore, possibly reflecting exposure to more differentiated water masses. The negative influence of both high temperatures and low water levels on growth points to potential impacts of climatic change on fish production in shallow fluvial lakes.					; Rodriguez, Marco A./J-6492-2012; Rodríguez, Marco/J-6492-2012	Glemet, Helene/0000-0001-7549-359X; Rodriguez, Marco A./0000-0003-0391-9170; 													0706-652X	1205-7533				DEC	2007	64	12					1646	1655		10.1139/F07-126	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F07-126													WOS:000252760000002
J	Castro, BB; Gonçalves, F				Castro, Bruno B.; Goncalves, Fernando			Seasonal dynamics of the crustacean zooplankton of a shallow eutrophic lake from the Mediterranean region	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Little is known about the trophic interactions within shallow lakes from the Mediterranean region, although there is evidence of their distinctive features compared to northern temperate shallow lakes (particularly when considering their ichthyocenosis). To address this gap, we conducted a study on the seasonal dynamics of the zooplankton community in Lake Vela (Portugal), a turbid and eutrophic shallow lake, which exhibits marked dominance of alien fish species. Lake Vela was shown to be highly productive and turbid, except during a period of higher transparency, from January to April. The increase in transparency was attributable to a rise in water level, which reduced the amount of re-suspended particles. Transparency was additionally improved by a peak in Daphnia longispina densities (February and March), which transiently reduced chlorophyll concentrations to low levels (clear water phase). In the remainder of the year, the zooplanktonic assemblage was dominated by small-sized zooplankters (mainly Bosmina and cyclopoid copepods). Daphnia were virtually absent from August to December. Regression and multivariate analyses identified seston and fish predation as the main environmental gradients shaping the zooplanktonic assemblage. During the clear water phase, competition for resources also seemed to contribute to Daphnia dynamics. The observed pattern of seasonal dynamics of the zooplankton of Lake Vela was overall concordant with the PEG model, although the timing of certain events was different, most notably the peak of Daphnia dominance and the more prolonged influence of fish, relatively to northern temperate lakes. Our results suggest that both planktivory (by alien fish) and turbidity (seston) are issues that need to be addressed if adequate restoration programs are to be implemented.

From the mountains to the sea:: assemblage structure and dynamics in Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) in the Clyde River estuarine gradient, New South Wales, south-eastern Australia	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY												Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera: non-biting midges) were surveyed at five shallow riffle stations along the estuarine gradient of the Clyde River, southern New South Wales (35 degrees 45'S, 150 degrees 15'E). Benthic populations were sampled seasonally between April 2001 and January 2002, between an uppermost fully fresh station and 7 km south of the tidal limit at Shallow Crossing, encompassing a 23 km stretch. Biological structure and integrity of chironomid assemblages, which are essentially unknown in eastern Australia's estuarine environments, were elucidated. Assemblages were diverse: from 5732 chironomid larvae, 45 species belonging to four subfamilies were identified from riffles. All chironomid assemblages were strongly structured and non-random with respect to spatial position along the salinity gradient although relatively random with respect to temporal shifts between the five seasonal samples. Generally, the salinity gradient had strong effects on assemblage composition but no discrete brackish fauna was identifiable, and the abundance of many species declined gradually with distance from the freshest station. Dominant taxa in the brackish zone were Parakiefferiella'variegatus' and two species of Cladotanytarsus. Notably, the little-known Semiocladius crassipennis Skuse (Orthocladiinae) was abundant at the most marine-influenced station. Taxa present exclusively in freshwaters included several Tanypodinae notably absent from sites below Shallow Crossing at salinities normally tolerated in athalassic waters. Other species restricted to freshwaters included Nanocladius sp., Demicryptochironomus (Irmakia) sp., Polypedilum vespertinus (Skuse), Zavrelliella fuscoguttata (Kieffer), Riethia stictoptera (Kieffer) and Podonomopsis sp.

J	Mkumbo, OC; Mlaponi, E				Mkumbo, Oliva C.; Mlaponi, Enock			Impact of the baited hook fishery on the recovering endemic fish species in Lake Victoria	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												As gillnet yields of Nile perch stagnated in the middle of the 1990s, the hook and line fishery intensified in Lake Victoria. Frame surveys show that the number of hooks used in this fishery grew tenfold in the Tanzanian waters between 1992 and 2002. The increased use of endemic fish species as bait has gone largely unnoticed, but is thought to impede the recovery of these species in the lake. A survey was conducted in March 2003, covering 51 sites, to assess the impact of this fishery targeting Nile perch on the endemic species. The species used as bait were juvenile Clarias (41%), haplocromines (37%), dagaa (Rastrineobola argentea) (10%), Synodontis (3%), Mormyrus (2%), and Labeo (1%). The total annual weight of the mostly undersized and illegally caught ( beach seining, gillnets below 3" mesh) baitfish was estimated at 7,465 t. The size of the Nile perch caught is bait-dependant, with catches using Clarias bait having a modal length at 61-62 cm TL of which 20% is above the legal upper size limit. Catches with haplochromines and dagaa bait have a mode at 49-50 cm TL, with 62% below the legal lower size limit. Seasonal variations in the fishery and management implications of its legalization are discussed, while the threats to biodiversity conservation and the stability of the ecosystem are addressed.																			1463-4988	1539-4077					2007	10	4					458	466		10.1080/14634980701704197	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14634980701704197													WOS:000251239700011

Macroinvertebrate communities in sediment and plants in coastal Mediterranean water bodies (Central Iberian Peninsula)	ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY					2nd European Pond Workshop	FEB 23-25, 2006	Toulouse, FRANCE	Univ Paul Sabatier Toulouse III, CNRS, Pole Relais Mares & Mouilleres France, Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland, Univ Geneva, Pond Conservat, Univ Leuven				Sediment and plant-associated macro invertebrates were sampled in six shallow water bodies along the central part of the coast of Mediterranean Spain. The size of ponds, salinity and hydroperiod were highly variable. Seventy-one taxa were recorded, some of them were endemic or uncommon species, evidencing the important contribution of these ponds to biodiversity. Crustaceans and gastropods of biogeographical interest were found in the most primeval site. Correspondence analysis showed that macroinvertebrate assemblages responded to environmental variables such as salinity, temporality and eutrophication. The brackish water fauna was dominated by crustaceans, while oligochaeta and insect larvae were abundant in freshwater conditions. Oligochaetes were abundant at localities with high trophic level, whereas localities with semi-permanent waters were dominated by chironomids. The density of macroinvertebrates was clearly related with trophic state but we did not find significant relationships between density and salinity or water permanence. For plant associated samples our results showed negative relationships between species richness and temporality or salinity, contrary to sediment samples, where the Oligochaeta/Chironomidae ratio in sediments and the percentage of sensitive taxa (Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Trichoptera) were useful indices, and were dependent on pond typology. This study emphasizes the broad ecological variety of ponds found in these wetlands and their importance for biodiversity. Some ponds act as permanent biodiversity reservoirs in fluctuant marshes with seasonal dryness, calling for more attention on their ecological relevance for management strategies.

PCB mass transfer coefficients determined by application of a water surface sampler	CHEMOSPHERE												A water surface sampler (WSS) was employed in combination with greased surface deposition plates (GSDPs) to measure the particulate dry deposition and gas exchange of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Chicago, IL. Vapor phase PCB fluxes were calculated by subtracting the particulate fluxes obtained from GSDPs from total (particulate + gas) fluxes obtained from the WSS. Vapor phase PCB fluxes were divided by ambient air concentrations measured with a high volume sampler to calculate overall gas phase PCB mass transfer coefficients (KG). The calculated average PCB MTC was 0.54 +/- 0.47 cm s(-1). This experimentally determined average gas phase overall mass transfer coefficient, KG, agreed well with the ones reported from studies using similar techniques and agreed well with modeled values obtained using MTC correlations developed for the WSS.

Ordination analysis (CCA with variation partitioning) showed that in each lake, sediment variables were the most important environmental variables. However, the most important proportion of species variability in pooled data from both lakes was explained by lake-specific combinations of water, sediment and algal variables. Chironomid larvae were ordinated with increasing depth as follows: G. paripes, C. fulvus, C. crassicaudatus, Tanypodinae, and C. decorus. This trend was similar for both lakes individually as well as for the pooled data. As water depth increased, organic matter content and associated metals concentrations in sediment increased. Glyptotendipes paripes displayed significant, negative correlation with water depth and sediment total carbon content, while C. decorus showed a significant positive correlation with these variables; C. crassicaudatus did not show any significant correlation with either of these variables. The algal composition in the pooled data from both lakes was another important factor affecting the larval distributions. The proportion of G. paripes and C. decorus larvae increased with filamentous algal density, and C. crassicaudatus larvae with increasing Cyanobacteria. Although both study lakes were very shallow, the effect of water depth (alone or shared with environmental variables) on chironomid larval community composition was substantially higher than the seasonality (sampling month) effect.

Water samples were collected along two offshore horizontal transects from the mouths of the rivers Vistula and Odra and two vertical profiles in the Gdansk and Bornholm Deeps. Particulate/dissolved metal concentrations in the following ranges were measured (mg kg(-1)/mu g l(-1)): Cd-0(.)89-89(.)1/0(.)003-0(.)022, Pb-10(.)2-114/0(.)004-0(.)0088, Cu-20(.)2-214/0(.)14-0(.)80, Ni-27-71/0(.)59-1(.)63, Mn-53-7590/0-971, Zn-124-3460/0(.)30-1(.)62, Co-not analysed/0(.)003-0(.)235, Fe (%)-0(.)14-3(.)29/0-190, Al (%)-0(.)11-3(.)92/not analysed. Horizontal concentration gradients were found in the Gulf of Gdansk, which were attributed to the inflow of metals with the Vistula runoff. The lack of gradients in the Pomeranian Bay was explained by the Odra runoff having to pass through the Szczecin Lagoon, which acts as a trap for the suspended and dissolved loads carried by the river. The steep vertical gradients of both dissolved and particulate metals were put down to bioaccumulation at the surface, the presence of accumulated colloids above the halocline and redox phenomena in the suboxic zone below the halocline. These last involve diffusion of Fe(II) and Mn(II) from anoxic sediments, their oxidation to Fe(III) and Mn(IV) and possible formation of poorly soluble sulphides. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Modelling complex spatial-temporal drivers of habitat suitability for an imperilled stream fish	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Fish populations rely on complex environmental conditions involving physical, chemical, and biological factors. Understanding the factors that control population persistence and productivity is essential for species management. We assessed the distribution and associated habitat features of a species at risk in Canada, Silver Shiner (Notropis photogenis), within Sixteen Mile Creek, a tributary of Lake Ontario. Using random forest models, we quantified a range of ecological factors (n = 25) to estimate habitat associations for sampled populations and life stages (juvenile, adult). A complex set of ecological factors were informative predictors of Silver Shiner distribution, including physical (stream morphology, water velocity, substrate type), and biological (aquatic and riparian vegetation) conditions. Juveniles were less responsive to habitat conditions but exhibited high seasonal variability in occurrence. Adults were most common in stream sections with greater than 0.5 m depth and stream velocity less than 0.6 m/s, and areas without silt substrate. Broadly, the models predicted Silver Shiner distribution with 68-92% accuracy in non-training data. Our findings describe the habitat conditions that Silver Shiner currently occupies in an urban drainage, which may serve as a point of reference for habitat protection and restoration. Further, predictive species distribution models can serve to identify habitat for further monitoring and restoration.					; Bzonek, Paul/CAJ-0335-2022	Bzonek, Paul Alexander/0000-0003-2482-3522; 													0018-8158	1573-5117				2024 FEB 6	2024										10.1007/s10750-023-05455-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-023-05455-5		FEB 2024											WOS:001156375500001

It is characterized by the adsorption of pollutants, and its physical properties can affect water volume quality. In this study, SS dynamics were simulated using a 2D hydrodynamic model in the Nanji Mountain Nature Reserve (NNR), and the fluxes of pollutants caused by SS were calculated to assess the biological risks during the wet (May-August) and dry (November-March) seasons. High spatial and temporal variability in SS load within the NNR was found in this study. The average SS load in the reserve increased and then decreased during the year, and the SS input from Ganjiang significantly affected the SS load in the NNR (p < 0.01). The SS load uptrend in the NNR occurred later than that of Ganjiang during the wet season because of the SS sedimentation in the NNR. And the suspension of SS in the NNR during the dry season resulted in a later SS load downtrend compared to Ganjiang. High SS load from Ganjiang during the wet season was responsible for the high nutrient and microplastic fluxes in the NNR, which were 8.38 and 10.61 times higher than those in the dry season, respectively. And the pollutant fluxes during the wet season were almost all from Ganjiang. In contrast, higher waterbird diversity and population during the dry season is the main reason for the increased biological risk of contaminants. Therefore, monitoring and managing SS and its contamination concentrations in rivers entering the lake is helpful for the protection of ecologically sensitive areas and key species in the lake.

In many lakes, these changes are characterized by an unprecedented increase in organic carbon fluxes, potentially leading to a shift in biogeochemical cycles and in the balance between carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions. Understanding the response of the carbon cycle to natural and anthropogenic environmental changes is becoming a crucial challenge in the context of increasing global pressures. In this study, we reconstructed the changes in the trophic functioning of the benthic and pelagic food web, in response to accelerated eutrophication in four lakes over the last millenium. Changes in carbon pathways in food webs were assessed using stable carbon isotope analysis of chitinous subfossil remains of Daphnia, Bosmina, and Chironomini archived in sedimentary records. Changes in the trophic state were inferred from sedimentary geochemical analysis, including carbon accumulation rates, Chla accumulation rates and carbon-to-nitrogen ratios. Agro-pastoral activities were tracked by analysis of coprophilous ascospores. Results provided by this multi-proxy approach highlight recent disruptions in carbon sources and transfer pathways in lakes food webs. In particular, changes in the carbon isotopic signature of pelagic consumers suggest a recent increase in the use of 13C-depleted carbon sources such as methanogenic or respiration-derived carbon linked to recent changes in trophic state under the intensification of anthropogenic pressures.					; Etienne, David/A-7675-2013; Millet, Laurent/F-8730-2014; Masclaux, Helene/S-1265-2017	Essert, Valentin/0000-0002-3197-7397; BELLE, Simon/0000-0002-3786-5011; Masclaux, Helene/0000-0002-5869-8419													0959-6836	1477-0911				MAY	2024	34	5					604	618		10.1177/09596836231225726	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836231225726		FEB 2024											WOS:001156683700001
J	An, KG; Jones, JR				An, KG; Jones, JR			Factors regulating bluegreen dominance in a reservoir directly influenced by the Asian monsoon	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Current hypotheses, based on physical and chemical theory, that account for bluegreen-blooms in lakes were evaluated in Taechung Reservoir, Korea, during May 1993-November 1994. Seasonal patterns of chlorophyll (Chl) were similar in 1993 and 1994, but the taxonomic composition and size structure of the phytoplankton communities differed between years. During August-September 1994, bluegreens comprised > 80% of total cell numbers and net-Chl (fraction of Chl > 35 mu m) was 63% of total Chl, whereas in 1993, diatoms (Melosira) were the major taxa, and ultra-Chl (< 11 mu m) dominated. The major factor influencing bluegreen dominance in 1994 was a weak monsoon which was directly linked to strong water column stability (> 25 kg mu m(-)2), high water temperature (> 28 degrees C), and reduced silica input. Low N/or N:P ratios and the concentration of monovalent cations (Na+ and K+) were not determining factors in this system, but light and pH seemed to act as secondary factors. Our study suggests that the magnitude and frequency of bluegreen blooms in Asian waterbodies may be reduced during an intense monsoon, but increased during a weak monsoon.

Fish and angler use at a freshwater artificial reef	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												In November 1999, an artificial reef composed of granite rubble was built in southwestern Lake Michigan to attract smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu. Adult fish communities were sampled at the artificial reef site and a nearby reference site before (1999) and after reef construction (2000-2003) to determine whether the artificial reef attracted sport fishes. The total number of fish observed along scuba transects was higher at the artificial reef than at the reference site during 2000-2003. Smallmouth bass, rock bass Ambloplites rupestris, round goby Neogobius melanostomus, and yellow perch Perca flavescens were most commonly observed by divers at the artificial reef site, whereas the round goby was the most prevalent species observed at the reference site. Mean annual total gill-net catch per unit effort (CPUE) did not differ at the two sites after reef construction. Freshwater drum Aplodinotus grunniens, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, yellow perch, and salmonines were commonly caught at both locations. The presence of several of these taxa was related to water temperature but not location. Smallmouth bass presence was related to location; CPUE was greater at the artificial reef than at the reference site during 2000-2002. Rock bass CPUE also was greater at the artificial reef than at the reference site during 2002. Smallmouth bass association with the reef was seasonal and correlated with temperature. Although anglers were aware of the artificial reef, fishing effort and success were low, in part because few anglers targeted black bass Micropterus spp. Because water temperature strongly influences the use of structure by centrarchids in deep, cold lakes like Lake Michigan, care must be taken to site artificial reefs in zones of the most suitable water temperature for these species.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				AUG	2006	26	3					702	713		10.1577/M05-029.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M05-029.1													WOS:000240753900024

However, the response of the MBT'5ME to temperature changes, particularly in freshwater systems, remains incompletely understood. In this study, oxic mesocosms are used to assess the temperature sensitivity of brGDGTs and their producers, sampled from a lake (Lake Rot) and a river (Sihl River) in three different seasons. Three temperature treatments are employed (10, 17.5, and 25 celcius), representing control (in -situ temperatures), cooling, and/or warming treatments, with GDGTs and the bacterial community measured at several timepoints (24 h, 1, 2, 3 and 5 weeks). The control experiments showed that this experimental approach could not replicate natural conditions exactly, with small changes in chemistry (pH, conductivity, alkalinity) and bacterial community composition. Still, our mesocosm setup yielded valuable insights into the temperature -dependent production of lacustrine brGDGTs and MBT'5ME values, especially in warming treatments, while no response was observed in cooling treatments, potentially indicating limited sensitivity to cold temperatures. In the river mesocosms not the MBT'5ME but the IR ratio showed a temperature dependency, potentially driven by small changes in the water pH. Coeval changes in the composition of the bacterial community and the MBT'5ME and IR are determined to constrain potential GDGT producers. Although an increase in MBT'5ME in response to some warming incubations is observed, the temperature -sensitivity of MBT'5ME, as expected from GDGT studies on a global scale, is not supported by this experiment.

This study aimed to reveal the spatiotemporal distribution, mobilization kinetics, and potential risk of Ni in sediments of a typical multi-ecological lake, Lake Taihu, China.MethodsWe conducted seasonal monitoring of the spatial distribution of soluble and labile Ni in sediments using high-resolution dialysis samplers (HR-Peeper) and the diffusive gradient in thin-films technique (DGT), respectively.ResultsWe found that the total Ni concentrations in sediments (mean: 37.56 mg kg-1) all exceeded the background value (19.5 mg kg-1). The spatial distributions of soluble and labile Ni showed no notable fluctuations along the vertical profiles of sediments in all seasons. The DGT-induced fluxes model implied that there is a partial Ni resupply capacity in the sediment of all three ecological zones, but it is higher in the algal-type zones than in the macrophyte-type and transition zones. Furthermore, an assessment of the ecotoxicological risk found that the risk quotient values for Ni were less than 1 in all sampling seasons, indicating a low ecotoxicological risk of Ni in the sediments of Lake Taihu.ConclusionOur results indicate that the ecological risk in the algal-type lake zones requires special attention. Our findings help towards improving the level of understanding regarding the mobilization process and potential risk of Ni in sediments, which in turn can provide guidance for the prevention and control of sediment Ni pollution in lakes with multiple types of ecological zones.

MICROCYSTIN DETECTION IN CONTAMINATED FISH FROM ITALIAN LAKES USING ELISA IMMUNOASSAYS AND LC-MS/MS ANALYSIS	HANDBOOK ON CYANOBACTERIA: BIOCHEMISTRY, BIOTECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS	Bacteriology Research Developments											Cyanotoxin contamination in ichthyic fauna is a worldwide occurrence detected in small aquacultures and natural lakes, underlying a new class of risk factors for consumers. Microcystin contamination in fish tissues is a recent finding in Italian lakes, which monitoring requires fast and precise techniques, easy to perform and able to give results in real time. Three different ELISA immunoassay kits, LC-MS/MS triple quadrupole, MALDI-ToF/MS and LC-Q-ToF-MS/MS techniques were employed to analyze 121 samples of fish and crustaceans (Mugil cephaus, Leuciscus cephalus, Carassius carassius, Cyprinus carpio, Dicentrarchus labrax, Atherina boyeri, Salmo trutta, Procambarus clarkii) collected in lakes Albano, Fiastrone, Ripabianca and, from June 2004 to August 2006 in Massaciuccoli Lake, an eutrophic waterbody seasonally affected by blooms of Microcystis aeruginosa, a widespread toxic species in Italy. Some of these samples were analysed also by ion trap LC/ESI-MS/MS, MALDI-ToF/MS and LC/ESI-Q-ToF/MS/MS, to compare the relative potency of different mass spectrometry detectors. As a result, 87% of the analyzed extracts of tissues (muscle, viscera and ovary) were positive for the presence of microcystins, at concentration values ranging from minimum of 0.38 ng/g to maximum of 14620 ng/g b.w. In particular, the 95% of viscera samples (highest value 14620 ng/g), 71% of muscle samples (max value 36.42 ng/g) and 100% of ovary samples (max value 17.1 ng/g) were contaminated. Mugil cephalus samples were all positive, showing the highest values, ranging from 393 ng/g to 14,62 mu g/g. Some different cooking prescriptions were tested to verify the degradation of microcystins in cooking. Some discrepancies were observed in the results from different commercially available ELISA immunoassay kits; similarly, ELISA test results were from 3 to 8-fold higher than concentration calculated by LC-MS/MS analyses. The rapid screening and accurate mass-based identification of cyanobacteria biotoxins can be easily afforded by MALDI-ToF/MS, spanning over wide molecular mass range, that shows the molecular ion signals of the compounds in the sample. Nevertheless, accurate structure characterization of all compounds can be attained only studying their own fragmentation patterns by LC-Q-ToF-MS/MS. As a matter of fact, this hybrid mass spectrometry detector resulted highly sensitive, selective and repeatable in measuring the characteristic ions from each cyanotoxin studied; this technique was successfully employed in confirming known toxins, as well as in elucidating the molecular structure of several new compounds never described previously. On the other hand, ion trap and triple quadrupole LC-MS/MS offer high repeatability and sensitivity for identifying targeted known compounds, such as some microcystins, but could fail in detecting the presence of structural modified derivatives, or less abundant molecules. As a result, nowadays it is noteworthy that hybrid MS(MS) detectors giving full details about the molecular structure of many different biotoxins represent the most modem approach for "profiling" contamination levels and assessing the risk deriving to the consumers, both through freshwaters and foods.					messineo, valentina/JCE-7327-2023; Ferranti, Pasquale/ABF-8111-2021	Gallo, Pasquale/0000-0002-9676-2290; Messineo, valentina/0000-0001-6336-1768; FERRANTI, Pasquale/0000-0002-6250-6512															978-1-60741-092-8				2009							191	210																WOS:000271127500005

Restoration efforts have focused on revegetation of the lost seagrass species, which may well work in cases the seagrass loss is recent and the habitat quality has not been altered substantially. Recent studies in several estuaries in the U.S. report the similar change in the seagrass community structures: much of the habitats previously dominated by stable seagrasses (Thalassia testudinum and Syringodium filiforme in tropical and Zostera marina in temperate regions) are now replaced by Ruppia maritima, an Opportunistic, pioneer species that is highly dependent on sexual reproduction. The relative increases of R. maritima in seagrass habitats indicate that: (1) the coastal environmental quality has been altered to be more conducive to this species; (2) the quality of environmental services that seagrass beds play also have been changed; and (3) strategies for seagrass restoration and habitat management need to be adjusted. Unlike Zostera or Thalassia, Ruppia maritima beds are known for their seasonal and annual fluctuations. The authors' previous and on-going research and restoration efforts as well as literature reviews are presented to discuss the causes for and the potential impacts of this change in seagrass community on the coastal ecosystem and future restoration strategies.

J	Drouin, A; Sirois, P; Archambault, P				Drouin, Annick; Sirois, Pascal; Archambault, Philippe			Discriminating zooplankton communities in lakes with brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) and in fishless lakes	ECOSCIENCE												Natural geographic barriers and escarpments inhibited the post-glacial colonization of many lakes by fish on the eastern Canadian Boreal Shield. Hence, fishless lakes containing freshwater communities that evolved without fish predation are commonly found on the Boreal Shield next to fish-present lakes. The aim of this study was thus to assess how different top-down control from fish or invertebrate predation structure zooplankton communities in eastern Canadian Boreal Shield lakes throughout the ice-free season. We examined zooplankton community characteristics using univariate indices such as abundance, richness (S), evenness (J'), diversity (H'), and multivariate species assemblages (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) in 5 lakes with a single fish population, brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis, and in 5 naturally fishless lakes throughout the ice-free season. The total abundance of zooplanktonic organisms was significantly higher in fishless lakes over the whole sampling period; this was related to the presence of small herbivorous species such as rotifers. Species assemblages of zooplankton were also significantly different between the 2 types of lakes throughout the season, principally due to the high abundance of rotifers and the scarcity of immature and mature daphnids in fishless lakes. Our results suggest that the low intensity of selective predation by brook trout on large herbivores and the heavy predation by Chaoborus americanus larvae on daphnids in fishless lakes appear to be the key factors for structuring the zooplankton community. Multivariate indicators identified patterns that were not revealed with the usual univariate indices, showing the importance of selecting appropriate indicators for the assessment of community structure.

Modeling the water budget in a deep caldera lake and its hydrologic assessment: Lake Ikeda, Japan	AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT												The hydrologic assessment of a lake water budget can be helpful in achieving proper water management and sustainable water use. A model to analyze a lake water budget was developed and verified for Lake Ikeda, Japan. Lake evaporation was estimated by numerical analyses of lake water temperature and the lake energy budget. Inflow from the lake catchment area and leakage from the lake bottom were estimated based on the tank model and Darcy's law, and the model parameters were optimized by the shuffled complex evolution method. The estimated monthly lake evaporation rate is consistent with the evaporation rate estimated by the energy budget Bowen ratio method based on in situ data from 2004 to 2005. Moreover, the calculated time series of daily lake levels agrees well with those of measured lake levels during 1983 to 1999. Thus, the model is useful for. evaluating the lake water budget. Numerical analysis reveals seasonal and annual variation characteristics in the water budget components. Precipitation, inflow from the catchment area, and river water supply are generally high during the rainy season from June to July with substantial annual variation. Lake evaporation is greatest in October and least in April, but the annual variation is relatively small. Agricultural water use is relatively high from April to September. There are no marked seasonal changes in leakage and drinking water use. The lake level is generally highest in September and lowest in March, which is characterized by seasonal changes in water budget components. The model was also applied to 17-year simulations under hypothetical hydrologic conditions to examine the effect of water use and agricultural water management on the lake level. Results indicate that river water supply, provided under the agricultural water management system, effectively compensates for the decrease in lake water resulting from agricultural water use.

Phytoplankton: Composition, Development and Productivity	NILE: ORIGIN, ENVIRONMENTS, LIMNOLOGY AND HUMAN USE	Monographiae Biologicae											Phytoplankton is widely but unevenly developed in regions of the Nile system. These are successively examined here with regard to community composition and abundance, interpreted in relation to upstream-downstream changes, time-sequences, and probable limiting factors. Features in the headwater lakes are largely distinct from those in subsequent flowing sections of the river and in its reservoirs with seasonal or long-term retention. Regions with such retention are generally those with greatest, usually seasonal, plankton development, although some exceptions exist. Community composition is mostly dominated by diatoms (e.g. Aulacoseira granulata) or Cyanobacteria (e.g. Anabaena flos-aquae f. spiroides), but there are many species of green algae and some flagellates (e.g. Pediastrum, Volvox). A remarkable desmid association has been described from the small Lake Ambadi of the Sudd region. Diatoms are generally the pioneers in seasonal sequences or successions, which are often ended by the influx of relatively turbid though nutrient-rich floodwater. Sequences of species of estimated abundance have been studied intensively in relation to environmental factors in some reservoir-influenced regions. In the Blue Nile there is now a cascade system of two reservoirs linked by conditions of free-flow but subject to strong annual floodwater from Ethiopia. Events in the upper and more recent reservoir have brought about changes in those observed downstream. At Lake Nasser there is a community-differentiation between the main lake and its lateral arms or khors (e.g. Khor el Ramla). Here, and further downstream in Egypt, there have been maintained assessments of total abundance by chlorophyll-a estimation. In these, and in species biodiversity, there is evidence for some long-term changes. Nutrient-phytoplankton relationships include possible limitation by low concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and - for a common diatom - by those of carbon dioxide associated with pH levels above 9.0. Light-limitation is also expressed in determinations of photosynthetic productivity, available from several upstream and downstream regions. This productivity can be high, conditioned by community abundance, vertical light penetration, and a frequently high specific activity per unit measure of biomass.					; Sinada, Faisal/KBQ-9028-2024	Sinada, Faisal Abdalla/0009-0003-9884-0322; 													0077-0639		978-1-4020-9725-6				2009	89						431	462				10.1007/978-1-4020-9726-3												WOS:000270040800021
J	Kato, M; Fukusawa, H; Yasuda, Y				Kato, M; Fukusawa, H; Yasuda, Y			Varved lacustrine sediments of Lake Tougou-ike, Western Japan, with reference to Holocene sea-level changes in Japan	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL												Eighteen metres of laminated sediments were recovered in a Holocene sediment core taken from Lake Tougou-ike in 1992. The lamination, evident from the alternation of light- and dark-coloured laminae, records cyclic deposition of biochemical sediments. Annual environmental changes in and around the lake caused seasonal variations in sediment flux to the lake floor, explaining these cyclic variations in sedimentary facies. AMS C-14 dating of organic remains from 40 horizons in the succession supports the interpretation of each light-to-dark couplet as an annual increment. Each laminated couplet is identified as a non-glacial varve, formed mainly by seasonal changes in diatom productivity. Varve counting and C-14 dating provide a detailed Holocene chronological framework, with time resolution on the order of individual years, within which to reconstruct paleoenvironmental changes recorded in the sediment core. Holocene relative sea-level changes at Lake Tougou-ike were estimated with +/- 10 yr precision using the variable authigenic iron mineral content of the sediment as a proxy. The results demonstrate that the relative sea level at Lake Tougou-ike rose abruptly at about 8900, 7700, 5600, 4000, 3600 and 2700 cal yr BP, and decreased gradually in the intervening intervals. These relative rises in sea level are demonstrated to be coeval with ice-sheet discharge events recorded in sediment cores from the North Atlantic Ocean. Abrupt coastal environmental changes caused by sea-level changes likely took place throughout the Japanese islands, and will probably be identified in both the Holocene and the last glacial interval, the latter being a time when Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles were clearly active in the North Atlantic region.

An upper unit is composed of relatively simple cycles of grey mudstones and yellowish marlstones. Recognized cycles have mean thicknesses of 5.6 and 1.6 m. The lake deposits contain evidence of seasonal, orbital and long-term climatic change. Seasonal change is documented by numerous desiccation surfaces especially in the Malmros Klint Member and Carlsberg Fjord beds, orbital change is suggested by the composite cyclicity, and long-term climatic change is indicated by the systematic upwards change in sedimentary characteristics of the lake deposits. The sedimentary features of the Malmros Klint Member suggest lacustrine deposition in a dry climate that fluctuated between desert and steppe conditions, the Carlsberg Fjord beds probably record lacustrine lake deposition in a rather constant dry (steppe) climate, while the Tait Bjerg Beds record lake sedimentation in a climate that fluctuated between dry (steppe) and warm moist temperate. In the Tait Bjerg Beds the upward change in cycle characteristics indicates a shift towards more humid conditions. Climatic deductions from sedimentary facies are in good agreement with climate maps of Laurasia, as simulated by numerical climate models. Palaeomagnetic data indicate a northward drift of East Greenland of about 10 degrees from ca. 25 degrees N to ca. 35 degrees N in the Middle to Late Triassic. The Fleming Fjord Formation which represents ca, 5 m.y, of the Late Triassic interval was deposited during latitudinal drift of 1-2 degrees, It is possible that the observed long-term upward shift in climatic indicators within the formation can be ascribed to plate drift, but southward shift of climatic belts could also have been of importance.

Spatial distribution and diet of Lake Michigan juvenile lake trout	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Most studies of Lake Michigan lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) have focused on adults, with scant attention to juveniles (<400 mm). We explored the spatial distribution and diet of juvenile lake trout using U.S. Geological Survey September bottom trawl data (2015-2022) and stomach content information opportunistically collected since 2012 by various agencies using multiple gear types. Most juvenile lake trout in the September bottom trawl survey were caught at 37-64 m bottom depths. Length frequency data from the bottom trawl survey identified three size classes likely associated with wild juvenile lake trout age: < 85 mm (similar to age-0), 85-170 mm (similar to age-1) and > 170 mm (similar to age-2+). Largest catches of wild lake trout < 170 mm occurred along a northeastern transect (near Frankfort, Michigan), whereas most > 170 mm were collected along southern transects. Mysis diluviana was the dominant prey for juvenile lake trout < 170 mm, and > 250 mm were primarily piscivorous, while 170-250 mm appeared to be a transitional period of switching from Mysis to fish. Species composition of prey fishes consumed by lake trout varied spatially and we found evidence of seasonal and annual diet variation within Grand Traverse Bay. Diporeia, once an important component of juvenile lake trout diet, appears to no longer be consumed by juvenile lake trout in Lake Michigan to any measurable degree. Continued research on the ecology of juvenile lake trout may provide insight into the effects of a changing ecosystem on juvenile lake trout diet and growth, thereby contributing to the effort to rehabilitate the Lake Michigan lake trout population.

Elevated sulfate reduction in metal-contaminated freshwater lake sediments	JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES												Although sulfate-reducing prokaryotes have long been studied as agents of metals bioremediation, impacts of long-term metals exposure on biologically mediated sulfur cycling in natural systems remains poorly understood. The effects of long-term exposure to metal stress on the freshwater sulfur cycle were studied, with a focus on biologic sulfate reduction using a combination of microbial and chemical methods. To examine the effects after decades of adaptation time, a field-based experiment was conducted using multiple study sites in a natural system historically impacted by a nearby zinc smelter (Lake DePue, Illinois). Rates were highest at the most metals-contaminated sites (similar to 35 mmol/cm(3)/day) and decreased with decreased pore water zinc and arsenic contamination levels, while other environmental characteristics (i.e., pH, nutrient concentrations and physical properties) showed little between-site variation. Correlations were established using an artificial neural network to evaluate potentially non-linear relationships between sulfate reduction rates (SRR) and measured environmental variables. SRR in Lake DePue were up to 50 times higher than rates previously reported for lake sediments and the chemical speciation of Zn was dominated by the presence of ZnS as shown by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS). These results suggest that long-term metal stress of natural systems might alter the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur by contributing to higher rates of sulfate reduction.

In spite of the paucity of soil cover the chemical composition of the streams is regulated much as in typical forested watersheds. Soils and other shallow groundwater matrices such as boulder fields appear to be more important in controlling surface-water chemistry than their abundance would indicate. The chemical composition of the major source waters (usually thought of as end-members whose chemical composition is relatively constant over time) changes at the same time that their mixing ratio in streams changes, confounding use of end-member mixing models to describe stream-water chemistry. Changes in the chemical composition of these source waters are caused by the ionic pulse of solutes from the snowpack and the small size of the shallow groundwater reservoir compared to the volume of snowmelt passing through it. The brief hydrologic residence time in the shallow groundwater indicates that concentrations of most dissolved constituents of stream water were controlled by fast geochemical processes that occurred on timescales of hours to days, rather than slower processes such as weathering of primary minerals. Differences in the timing of snowmelt-related processes between different areas of the watershed also affect the stream-water chemical composition. Cirque lakes affect discharge and chemical composition of one of the streams; seasonal control on stream-water NO3 and SiO2 concentrations by diatom uptake in the lakes was inferred. Elution of acidic waters from the snowpack, along with dilution of base cations originating in shallow groundwater, caused episodes of decreased acid-neutralizing capacity in the streams, but the streams did not become acidic.

The focal point of the settlement, the natural lake of Nainital, continues to draw scores of visitors every season. In Nainital, presently, tourism is prevailing as 'mass tourism' with a mass appeal. The mass scale of tourism in an ecologically sensitive area is bound to be a delicate matter. The physical area around the lake is highly restricted bound by the slopes of surrounding ridges. The scope of expansion of the town seems to be highly improbable, until and unless it seeks to expand beyond the Municipal boundary. The vital question arises how to make tourism sustainable in this small but promising town which is practically perched on the local catchment area of a natural lake. Today, Nainital is looking for a development model which should uphold its position in the tourism market as well as save its ecological integrity; because in face of any ecological eventuality this mountain habitat will go into irretrievable loss.																			2365-757X		978-3-319-47145-7; 978-3-319-47144-0				2017							383	397		10.1007/978-3-319-47145-7_24	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-47145-7_24	10.1007/978-3-319-47145-7												WOS:000418025900025

Are latrine sites an accurate predictor of seasonal habitat selection by river otters (Lontra canadensis) in freshwater systems?	MAMMAL RESEARCH												Temporal variation in the availability of food resources is a likely driving factor influencing the distribution and habitat use of river otters (Lontra canadensis). Although latrine sites are commonly used to determine habitat selection, it is unclear if latrine sites are an accurate predictor or even a useful indicator of the seasonal habitat use and distribution of river otters. We apply resource selection functions (RSF) to both latrine and telemetry locations to investigate whether latrine sites identified along lake shorelines during the ice-free season are appropriate predictors of otter habitat selection along shorelines during the ice-free and ice-cover seasons in central British Columbia, Canada. We found that the top models describing otter latrine sites and telemetry locations during the ice-free season were similar. The top RSF models and associated coefficients for the ice-cover season differed, however, with otter presence being positively influenced by shallower water depths. For the spatial extrapolation of averaged RSF coefficients, we found that 21.4 and 69.3 % of predicted latrine habitat along lake shorelines overlapped with ice-cover and ice-free habitat generated from telemetry locations, respectively. The location and activity at latrine sites appear to be a useful method for monitoring otter distribution and habitat use during the ice-free, but not during the ice-cover season. The results of our RSF analyses as well as home range measurements of otters in our study area suggest that cold temperatures and ice cover may be a limiting factor for the distribution of otter populations at northern latitudes.																			2199-2401	2199-241X				JAN	2017	62	1					37	45		10.1007/s13364-016-0297-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13364-016-0297-6													WOS:000392323900004

The main objective of this study is to provide inventory of landslide-dammed lakes in the Cordillera Blanca, overview on their typology and discuss their geomorphological significance exemplified by two case studies. Existing, failed and infilled landslide-dammed lakes are simultaneously present in the area of interest. Three sub-types of existing landslide-dammed lakes are distinguished: (i) landslide/rockslide-dammed lakes situated in the main valleys; (ii) debris cone-dammed lakes situated in the main valleys; (iii) lakes situated on landslide bodies irrespective their location. Lakes of sub-types (i) and (ii) reach significant sizes, while lakes of sub-type (iii) do not. The dam formation of lake sub-types (i) and (iii) is usually connected with a single event, while the dams of sub-type (ii) are usually formed by several generations of debris deposition over time. It was shown, that landslide-dammed lakes in the study area are characterized by relatively low mean lake water level elevation (4115 m a.s.l.) and large catchments (in some cases up to 80 km(2)), compared to other lake types. Lakes of sub-type (ii) are predominantly situated in central glacierized part of the Cordillera Blanca, while lakes of sub-types (i) and (iii) are situated rather in the already deglaciated piedmont areas, reflecting the conditions and mechanisms of dam formation. Two illustrative examples are, further, studied in detail: rockslide-dammed Lake Purhuay close Huari in Maranon River catchment; debris cone-dammed Lake Jatuncocha in Santa Cruz valley, Santa River catchment.

The reed vegetation is a great ecological danger for the DDBR, annual GHG emissions due to fire, in case it is not harvested at intervals of 1-2 years. MRS is the machine of a new technology that provides the reed vegetation harvesting as sheaves, throughout the year, but especially during the warm season, when the reed vegetation is still bearing leaves, the harvested material making it suitable to obtain alternative energy. To harvest this vegetation, the MRS equipment was designed to realize cutting, forming and binding the sheaves of reed vegetation in deep water conditions. For not to influence the MRS floatability, regardless of the load size, the equipment has been designed with a reduced weight, being equipped with its own float. The paper presents the kinematics scheme of the MRS equipment transmission and the correlation of its characteristics to achieve the functions, regardless of the speed of harvest. The equipment transmission is driven by a hydraulic motor with adjustable speed, being composed of a transmission with gears and levers for the cutting device and a transmission with a chain for drive the formation and binding mechanisms of the sheaves.

A total of 19 taxa (10 living and 9 subfossils) was reported for the first time from the reservoir. Cypridopsis vidua was the most frequently occurring species with a wide ecological ranges and seasonal distribution. Numbers of living ostracods (the alpha diversity) were found lower than the average numbers of species per lake in Turkey (13.2 spp./lake). When the alpha diversity of the reservoir (2.079) was in the medium, beta diversity (5.2) was ranged from low to medium. Results exhibited natural aquatic habitats showed relatively higher dissimilarities in species composition than small man-made habitats and the reservoir. A possible implication of finding such low numbers of species in such artificial habitats may depend on the age of the reservoir. Finding most of the cosmopolitan (and cosmoecious) species from the reservoir is the indication of ostracods primary succession. Accordingly, long-term studies are recommended to understand possible changes in species assemblages in future.

Hydrogeochemical Control and Dissolved Load Origin of Surface Water from Sao Joao River Drainage Basin: Seasonal Variations Approach	REVISTA VIRTUAL DE QUIMICA												Sao Joao Drainage Basin is an important and strategic waterbody located in one of the most popular turism region of Brazil. However, the fast economic and subsequent population growth in that region have created untreated wastes from several anthropogenic activities, which include the trace metals disposal in the surface water. This study aims to relate the major ions and trace metals behavior along one year sampling campaign, giving information about their source and chemical control in the three main fluvial compartments of the drainage basin. The chemical data reveals that the pluviosity is the main responsible for the physicochemical parameters and the water dissolved constituents' variations. The geological and anthropogenic contributions, which are the main sources of water constituents, were assessed by the Inorganic Chemical Index. Those data corroborates the great influence of pluviosity and reveal the anthropogenic contribution in some parts of the Juturnaiba Reservoir.					de Oliveira Gomes, Olga/F-1542-2013; Silva-Filho, Emmanoel/Y-7281-2019; da Silva Filho, Emmanoel/Y-7281-2019; Marques, Eduardo/JLN-0575-2023	Silva-Filho, Emmanoel/0000-0001-6444-6851; Duarte Marques, Eduardo/0000-0003-1133-9408; 													1984-6835						2017	9	5					2100	2120		10.21577/1984-6835.20170125	http://dx.doi.org/10.21577/1984-6835.20170125													WOS:000432040500022

It is filled by the Eocene Huadian Formation comprising thick lacustrine oil shale-and coal-bearing sediments. Oil shale, mudstone and carbonaceous shale samples have been collected to determine their mineralogical and geochemical (major, trace and rare earth elements) characteristics. These data are used to evaluate sediment provenance as well as paleoclimate and depositional environment. The fine-grained sediments in the Huadian Formation are derived from felsic volcanic rocks and granites, mixed with minor amounts of mafic and sedimentary rocks. Geo-chemical proxies confirm sediment recycling in the source region. Clay mineralogy and indices of chemical alteration suggest that a subtropical warm and humid climate prevailed during deposition of the fine-grained sediments. The data also suggest climatic changes during deposition of the Huadian Formation, from a stable warm and humid climate causing intermediate chemical weathering (Pyrite Member), to a seasonal dry-wet climate (Oil Shale Member), to a stable warmer and more humid climate causing strong chemical weathering (Carbonaceous Shale Member). Based on inorganic proxies, the fine-grained sediments in the Huadian Formation have been deposited in an anoxic fresh-water environment. Only the sediments of the Oil Shale Member reflect fluctuating freshwater and brackish conditions. The Eocene climatic change controlled lake level variations and water chemistry. A brackish and strictly anoxic environment together with a warm and humid climate was beneficial for the formation of high quality oil shale, whereas fresh-water conditions and warm and more humid climate favored peat accumulation.

The reservoir is characterised by low algal biomass, low nutrients (i.e. N and P) and high water clarity/transparency. Fifty-four species of phytoplankton were recorded, comprising Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Cyanophyta, Desmids, Dinophyta and Euglenophyta. Chlorophyta numerically dominated in the hot dry season, whereas Bacillariophyta, Desmids, Dinophyta and Euglenophyta dominated in the cool dry season. Species richness was highest at the onset of the cool dry season, in response to high nutrient concentrations. Phytoplankton abundance and composition were significantly correlated with temperature, nitrates and total nitrogen. Nineteen zooplankton species were recorded, including Copepoda, Cladocera and Rotifera. Overall, Cladocera were numerically dominant and became most abundant during the cool dry season. Rotifers and copepods dominated during the hot dry season. The zooplankton abundance was correlated with reactive phosphorus and phytoplankton abundance. The trophic state of Mazvikadei Reservoir seems to have stabilised and to have assumed the physico-chemical characteristics and plankton community typical of an oligotrophic lake.

In this study, we used Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites data to retrieve the TWSC in Tien Shan and Qi Lian Mountains. Variation of seasonal TWSC was obvious. However, the seasonal and annual differences reflected the imbalance of water resource distribution in two mountains. The TWSC decreased in the Tien Shan Mountains but increased in the Qi Lian Mountains during 2003 to 2010. Permafrost and glaciers play an important role in the water cycle in arid mountain regions. Demands for water for agriculture need more groundwater extraction for irrigation and glacial melt feeding the rivers which leads to the state of loss of TWSC in Tien Shan Mountains. Increase and thickening of the active layer of permafrost could lead to more infiltration of surface water into the groundwater, which result in increasing water storage and changes in the regional water balance. According to water balance, precipitation and evaporation changed little in short time, and TWSC changed obviously, whereas runoff showed an increasing trend in the Tien Shan Mountains and a decreasing trend in the Qi Lian Mountains.

Water samples from thirteen sites of the PRW were collected in March, May, August and December 2012, and analyzed for Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, Ni, Cr, Fe, Mn and Co concentration using an atomic absorption spectrometer. Multivariate data analysis techniques including principal component analysis (PCA) and Kohonen's self-organizing maps (SOM) were utilized to examine significant spatial and seasonal variations of heavy metals, as well as to identify possible sources. The results showed that concentrations of Pb (100%), Fe (90%), Mn (52%), Cd (25%) and Ni (11%) exceeded the maximum admissible concentrations, which would pose health risk to aquatic organisms and humans. Greater contamination was observed in the locations adjacent to the Guangzhou metropolis. Heavy metal concentrations varied more during wet seasons than during dry seasons. This may be due to the effect of rainfall carrying metals from the watershed or diluting the concentrations of heavy metals at specific sites. Potential anthropogenic sources of metal pollution in the PRW surface water were identified from three categories based on principal component loadings, which may provide decision making background for enabling sustainable development by government programs.					li, ziqi/JDC-9141-2023														1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	5					3350	3357																WOS:000403134800030

Hence, in order to understand how cyanobacteria affect the feeding behavior of cladocerans with different body sizes, feeding rates (FR) of zooplankton cladocerans Daphnia carinata and Moina macrocopa on the mixture of toxic or non-toxic Microcystis aeruginosa with Scenedesmus quadricauda during a 24-h period was investigated. FR of M. macrocopa was found generally low in the mixed toxic Microcystis diets, except for the sudden increase after 8h of exposure, while FR of D. carinata decreased continuously in the mixed toxic diets. The dynamics of FR of both cladocerans on specific algae was similar to that of the total FR. There is no apparent selectivity displayed for either of the two cladoceran species on the mixed diets. There is no significant difference between the strains of Microcystis, suggesting that the feeding pattern of M. macrocopa maybe more of avoiding Microcystis rather than feeding inhibition resulted from the toxicity of algae. Unlike M. macrocopa, there was a significant difference in D. carinata between the strains of Microcystis over time. The reason for feeding inhibition of D. carinata might be toxicity after continuous exposure to the toxic cyanobacteria.																			1863-0650					JUL	2013	41	7					645	650		10.1002/clen.201100643	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/clen.201100643													WOS:000322154700003

During this period, D. cucullata biomass, as well as its contribution to the total cladocerans biomass clearly decreased. We found that among the six morphological parameters analyzed in D. cucullata, body length, height of the head and length of the tail spine had a tendency to decrease. The maximum values of these traits and carapace length also decreased. The morphology of D. cucullata appeared to be influenced by factors such as food availability, fish predation and an exclusive presence of D. cucullata among Daphniidae species. Increased water mixing in the reservoir may have also affected the changes in the head inclination of D. cucullata.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2004	526	1			SI		119	127		10.1023/B:HYDR.0000041609.76694.fd	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:HYDR.0000041609.76694.fd													WOS:000223915900012
J	Zurawsky, MA; Robertson, WD; Ptacek, CJ; Schiff, SL				Zurawsky, MA; Robertson, WD; Ptacek, CJ; Schiff, SL			Geochemical stability of phosphorus solids below septic system infiltration beds	JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY												Review of 10 mature septic system plumes in Ontario, revealed that phosphorus (P) attenuation commonly occurred close to the infiltration pipes, resulting in discrete narrow intervals enriched in P by a factor of 2-4 (Wood, J.S.A. 1993. MSc thesis, Dept. Earth Sci., University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ont.; Ground Water 36 (1995) 1000; J. Contam. Hydrol. 33 (1998) 405). Although these attenuation reactions appeared to be sustainable under present conditions, the potential for remobilization of this P mass, should geochemical conditions change, is unknown. To test the stability of these P solids, dynamic flow column tests were carried out using sediments from three of the previously studied sites (Cambridge, Langton and Muskoka) focusing on sediments from the 'High-P' and underlying (Below) zones. Tests were continued for 166-266 pore volumes (PVs), during which time varying degrees of water saturation were maintained. During saturated flow conditions, relatively high concentrations of PO4 were eluted from the Cambridge and Langton High-P zones (up to 4 and 9 mg/l P, respectively), accompanied by elevated concentrations of Fe (up to 1.4 mg/l) and Mn (up to 4 mg/l) and lower values of Eh (<150 mV). The Below zones from Cambridge and Langton, however, maintained lower concentrations of P (gencrally<2 mg/l), Fe (<0.2 mg/l) and Mn (<1 mg/l) and maintained higher Eh (>250 mV) during saturated flow conditions. During unsaturated flow, P and Fe declined dramatically in the High-P zones (P<1 mg/l, Fe<0.2 mg/l), whereas concentrations remained about the same during saturated and unsaturated flow in the Below zones. This behavior is at least partly attributed to the development of reducing conditions during saturated flow in the High-P zones, leading to reductive dissolution of Fe (III)-P solids present in the sediments. Reducing conditions did not develop in the Below zones apparently because of lower sediment organic carbon (OC) contents (0.03-0.04 wt.%) compared to the High-P zones (0.2-0.65 wt.%). At the Muskoka site, where the sediments were noncalcarcous, low values of P (<0.2 mg/l) were maintained in both the High-P and Below columns and reducing conditions did not develop. Results indicate the possibility of remobilizing P accumulated below septic system infiltration beds should conditions become more reducing. This could occur if sewage loading patterns change, for example when a seasonal use, lakeshore cottage is converted to a permanent dwelling. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This study was undertaken to assess the impact of the new mouth opened at Sipakuda in order to facilitate water exchange between the lagoon and the sea. High values of temperature 35.3degreesC and salinity about 32 ppt were noticed near the mouth during the hot and dry premonsoon and postmonsoon periods respectively. The overall average salinity ranged from 0.32 - 32.0 ppt recorded at the northern sector (Kalupadaghat) and near the mouth. The maximum secchi disc value was 0.91 m only. Dissolved oxygen content and pH ranged from 3.9 to 13.9 ml/l and 6.4 to 9.8 respectively. The nutrient contents showed distinct seasonal and spatial variation. Higher phosphate value than the nitrate is a noteworthy feature during the present study period, which could be due to the addition of phosphate through the land drainage. Visible changes have been noticed in spatio-temporal variations of physico-chemical parameters as a result of the opening of new mouth.

After the collapse of Soviet-type agriculture in the early 1990 s, total N loadings decreased sharply while the in-lake total P concentration increased, forming favourable conditions for harmful bloom-forming N, fixing (N(2)fix) cyanobacteria. The average percentage of the biomass of N(2)fix cyanobacteria in total phytoplankton biomass increased from 13 % in 1983-1991 to 29 % in 1992-2001. Gloeotrichia echinulata, a species capable of vertical migration and consequent transport of P from the lake bottom to the upper layers developed earlier in the season (June) at lower nutrient concentrations than other cyanobacteria in L. Peipsi (Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Microcystis). The fixation of N-2 by G. echinulata as well as its ability to use sediment phosphorus could bring about the enrichment of the water column with nutrients. This enables the other N(2)fix species Anabaena and Aphanizomenon as well as Microcystis, which is not generally N-2 fixing but requires high nutrient concentrations, to flourish.

J	Zhang, FZ; Dickman, M				Zhang, FZ; Dickman, M			Mid-ocean exchange of container vessel ballast water. 1: Seasonal factors affecting the transport of harmful diatoms and dinoflagellates	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Our study of 34 ships (20 direct from Oakland, California, USA, and 14 more after open ocean exchange) is the first year-long seasonal study to assess the effectiveness of open ocean exchange of ballast waters. The highest number of harmful species occurred in April and February when water temperatures in Hong Kong (China) and Oakland were low. The periods with the greatest species richness of harmful species did not correspond to periods with the highest abundance of harmful species. The latter occurred in early September and mid-August, when Skeletonema costatum (14 000 cells l(-1)) dominated the plankton in the ballast water from Oakland Harbor. From April 1996 to April 1997, ballast water samples were collected from 34 Orient Overseas Container Lines Ltd skips which took 16 d to travel from Oakland to Hong Kong. Of the 34 ships, 14 exchanged their Oakland Harbor ballast water for open ocean water (referred to here as reballasting). Open ocean was defined as waters with a depth >2000 m. Once reballasting was completed, the contents of ballast tank no. 1 were not discharged until the ship reached Hong Kong. Six harmful diatoms and 9 harmful dinoflagellate species were observed in the ballast water from Oakland Harbor. These included the diatom Chaetoceros concavicornis and the PSP (paralytic shellfish poisoning) toxin producing dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. Of the 15 harmful species found in the Oakland Harbor ballast water, 8 (53 %) were also found in the ballast water of ships that had exchanged coastal for open ocean ballast water. The abundance of harmful species in open ocean ballast water was 87 % lower than those in the ballast water from Oakland Harbor. The reason that mid-ocean exchange failed to eliminate all harmful diatoms and dinoflagellates was probably because the ballast tank was never completely emptied before it was reballasted with mid-ocean water.																			0171-8630						1999	176						243	251		10.3354/meps176243	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps176243													WOS:000078918200021

The sites followed a spatial gradient, from the river inflow to the dam. To evaluate the molecular diversity of the community, we used the fingerprinting method DGGE (Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis), and at the same time taxonomic analyses based on species morphology were performed under inverted microscope. The most important genera were assembled in three groups: picocyanobacteria, filamentous cyanobacteria and Microstistis species. Picocyanobacteria belong to a group known for smaller cell size, were observed in all five sampling sites and were dominant especially in sites closer to the dam or in the transition zone. Filamentous cyanobacteria were mainly found closer to the river inflow. A seasonal variation was detected, with higher picocyanobacterial biomass during the rainy season, while nanoplanktonic species were more common in the dry season. Thus, the reservoir showed spatial and temporal variability in the phytoplankton community composition. These patterns were related to variations observed in nutrient concentration and temperature. Picocyanobacteria were a very important part of the phytoplankton community and represented on average 85% of total cyanobacteria biomass. The morphological technique revealed higher diversity than the molecular method possibly because of the low number of deposited sequences available for picocyanobacteria. The oligomesotrophic status observed in Volta Grande reservoir was most likely the main factor responsible for the dominance of this group since the relative importance of picocyanobacteria increases in less eutrophic environments.

PHENOLOGY AND ETHOLOGY OF ADULT LASIOPOGON SLOSSONAE COLE AND WILCOX ROBBER FLIES (DIPTERA: ASILIDAE) IN A NEW YORK RIPARIAN HABITAT	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON												Seasonal abundance, daily activity, and behavior of adults of the robber fly Lasiopogon slossonae Cole and Wilcox were assessed with a capture-mark-recapture procedure for a population along 1 km of riverside in the Adirondack Mountains near Lake Placid, New York. Over the 2015 season, a total of 240 individuals were uniquely marked at this site; 73 were re-sighted at least one more time. The overall emergence window for this population in 2015 spanned 47 days with a maximum individual lifespan observed of 23 days; adult seasonal phenology periods for three other years are also summarized from presence/absence observations. In 2015, the adult sex ratio was slightly male-skewed (58%), but there was no significant difference between the sexes in home range size or perch distance from water. Flies packed more tightly into microhabitat patches as the overall abundance increased, and individuals showed some fidelity to relatively small home ranges (the median area of activity for marked individuals was 20 m(2)). However, longer dispersal also occurred rarely-the farthest movement we observed was 726 m over nine days. Individuals were active from morning to evening (usually 10:00 to 18:00) with a daily activity period that appeared to depend on both light intensity and temperature. Prey consisted mostly of Empididae, but also included Simuliidae, Anthomyiidae, and Cicadellidae. Both males and females were observed mating with multiple partners on different days.

Distribution and abundance of marsh-nesting colonial waterbirds in Prairie Canada	WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY												Waterbird species face numerous threats and many are declining globally, but knowledge of distribution, abundance, and trend remains poor for many species. Five species of marsh-nesting colonial waterbirds are poorly monitored in Canada, and especially so in the core of their range in the Canadian Prairie Provinces (Alberta. Saskatchewan, and Manitoba). We summarized published and unpublished data on abundance and distribution of breeding colonies of Western Grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis), Franklin's Gull (Leucophaeus pipixcan), Black Tern (Chlidonias niger), Forster's Tern (Sterna forsteri), and Black-crowned Night-Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. We also examined the degree of overlap in nesting phenology (egg dates) and summarized survey methods that have been used to monitor the species during the breeding season-information that may be useful for the development of a multispecies monitoring program. For all species. the largest number of records of breeding colonies occurred in Alberta, with records declining eastward through Saskatchewan and Manitoba. We identified a number of breeding colonies occurring outside of currently defined species ranges, especially for the poorly studied Forster's Tern. Of 137 waterbodies hosting a colony of at least one species over the past 10 yr, 57 (41.6%) hosted colonies of at least 2 species, and 3 (2.2%) hosted colonies of all 5 species. Species tended to be reasonably synchronous in their breeding phenology, but Franklin's Gulls and Black-crowned Night-Ilerons tended to initiate nesting slightly earlier than the other species. We conclude that a multispecies survey timed in late May or early June to count nests and/or incubating adults, using either ground-based or aerial surveys, would likely be the most appropriate for monitoring all species jointly in the Prairie Provinces. The approach we take to compiling data from multiple sources on species occurrence and breeding phenology may be applicable to others wishing to examine the feasibility of a multispecies monitoring plan.					; McKellar, Ann/JEF-2803-2023	Bidwell, Mark/0000-0002-8678-7259; McKellar, Ann/0000-0002-7032-3759; 													1559-4491	1938-5447				OCT	2019	131	3					583	597		10.1676/18-180	http://dx.doi.org/10.1676/18-180													WOS:000489589300014

Cladoceran (Crustacea) Niches, Sex, and Sun Bathing-A Long-Term Record of Tundra Lake (Lapland) Functioning and Paleo-Optics	WATER												Under fundamental ecosystem changes in high latitude lakes, a functional paleolimnological approach may increase holistic understanding of lake responses and resilience to climate warming. A similar to 2000-year sediment record from Lake Loaejavri in the tundra of northern Finnish Lapland was examined for fossil Cladocera assemblages to examine long-term environmental controls on aquatic communities. In addition, cladoceran functional attributes, including functional diversity (FD), UV absorbance (ABS(UV)) of Alona carapaces, and sexual reproduction (ephippia) in Bosmina and Chydoridae were analyzed. Cladoceran communities responded to a major change in benthic habitat quality, reflected as elevated (increasingly benthic) sediment organic matter delta C-13 signal since the 17th century. FD fluctuations showed association with climate oscillation, FD being generally higher during warm climate periods. These ecological changes were likely attributable to diversification of littoral-benthic consumer habitat space. ABS(UV), irrespective of increases during the Little Ice Age (LIA) due to higher UV transparency of lake water, was lower under increasing autochthony (benthic production) suggesting establishment of physical UV refugia by the benthic vegetative substrata. Bosmina ephippia exhibited a decreasing trend associated with increasing benthic production, indicating favorable environmental regime, and, together with chydorid ephippia, transient increases during the climate cooling of the LIA driven by shorter open-water season.					; Rantala, Marttiina/GWV-8049-2022	Rantala, Marttiina/0000-0002-3231-5926; Nevalainen, Liisa/0000-0001-6837-8753; Luoto, Tomi/0000-0001-6925-3688; Kivila, E.

Temporal, spatial, and biological variation of nematode epidemiology in American eels	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												American eels (Anguilla rostrata) are infected by the non-native parasitic nematode Anguillicoloides crassus, which can cause severe swim bladder damage. We investigated epidemiology of A. crassus to better understand its population-level effects on American eels. Nematode prevalence, abundance, and intensity and swim bladder damage were quantified in glass eels, elvers, and yellow eels from the lower Chesapeake Bay and related to season of capture, river system, and total length. Age-variant force-of-infection and disease-associated mortality were estimated using a three-state irreversible disease model, which assumes recovery is not possible. Results showed glass eels have very low infection prevalence and severity compared with elvers and yellow eels. Nematode abundance varied by season, river, and eel length, whereas swim bladder damage varied by season and eel length. Nematode abundance and swim bladder damage were weakly positively correlated. Force-of-infection, based on swim bladder damage, peaked at age 2, and disease-positive eels had an estimated lower annual survival probability of 0.76 compared with disease-negative eels. Full understanding of American eel population dynamics will require broader knowledge of cryptic disease-associated mortality throughout North America.

Long-term survey data reveal large predator and temperature effects on population growth of multiple zooplankton species	LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY												Predators can strongly affect prey communities, but their influence may be difficult to distinguish from bottom-up and other environmental effects. The problem of assessing predator impact is especially difficult in large systems that do not allow for comparisons across multiple units (e.g., small lakes) that have varying predator density. For instance, the invasion of the predatory zooplankter, Bythotrephes longimanus, into the Laurentian Great Lakes contributed to the nearly complete disappearance of several zooplankton species, but current effects on extant zooplankton are not well understood. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) applied to long-term data time series (1994-2012) to examine B. longimanus effects on zooplankton species in Lake Michigan. Because B. longimanus abundance varied over time, our approach allowed assessment of predator effects from field data while accounting for other factors, including food resources, temperature, and seasonality. Results suggest that B. longimanus substantially reduces some zooplankton population growth rates, with the largest effects on species that B. longimanus affected more strongly in experiments. For example, at maximum B. longimanus abundance, Daphnia mendotae, Bosmina longirostris, and Diacyclops thomasi population growth rates were estimated to be reduced by 17%, 30%, and 21%, respectively, compared to no effect on calanoid copepods. Results further indicated positive temperature effects on population growth that differed by species. Our study thus provides field-based evidence for ongoing impacts of invasive species and temperature on zooplankton production and composition, with potential consequences for planktivorous fish, and exemplifies how GAMs can be used to determine predator effects from time series data.

J	Baker, KM; Kirk, WW; Stein, JM; Andresen, JA				Baker, KM; Kirk, WW; Stein, JM; Andresen, JA			Climatic trends and potato late blight risk in the upper Great Lakes Region	HORTTECHNOLOGY					Workshop on Trends and Fashions in Fruit Cultivar Development	JUL 19, 2004	Austin, TX	Amer Pomol Soc				Concern in the agricultural community over observed and projected climate change has prompted numerous studies on the possible implications for crop yields. However, relatively little work has focused on disease management. In the upper Great Lakes region of the United States, late blight (Phytophthora infestans) of potato (Solanum tuberosum) is a temporally sporadic disease, occurring only when microclimate conditions within the canopy are favorable and inoculum is present. This and other studies indicate that historical climatological trends in the upper Great Lakes region have resulted in warmer and wetter growing season conditions, as well as local increases in precipitation totals and in the frequency of days with precipitation. Consequently, the risk of potato late blight is increasing. Historical trends in hourly weather variables and potato late blight risk as expressed by a modified Wallin disease severity value index were analyzed at seven regional weather stations from 1948-99. All sites showed significant trends in at least one of the risk estimates. While late blight risk was greatest at all locations in August, periods of increasing risk occurred across the region particularly during July. The increases in disease risk appeared to be associated with upward trends in dry bulb and dew point temperature at nearly all of the stations, especially during July and August. Increased risk of potato late blight has implications for extension agents and commercial horticulturists that include increased emphasis on grower education and application of integrated disease management techniques.																			1063-0198	1943-7714				JUL-SEP	2005	15	3					510	518		10.21273/HORTTECH.15.3.0510	http://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTTECH.15.3.0510													WOS:000230256200020

This study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of benthic invertebrate communities located close to the mouths of the Kalambo and Lunzua Rivers, at the southern end of Lake Tanganyika, and subject to varying degrees of sediment load. 2. Metrics of exposure to riverine sediments were associated inversely with abundance and diversity of benthic organisms at sampling locations adjacent to both river mouths, indicating a major effect of riverine sediments on the structure of near-shore benthic communities. 3. A lower abundance of benthos was found at the mouth of the Lunzua River, which exports significantly higher sediment loads than the Kalambo. 4. Seasonal cycles of abundance and diversity in the benthos varied with distance from river mouths. This has important implications for monitoring programmes investigating benthic communities close to the mouths of rivers. 5. Our findings suggest that recent increases in the sediment loading of Lake Tanganyika, owing to anthropogenic catchment disturbance, impact significantly on biological diversity throughout the lake littoral, which provides habitat for the majority of species in the lake.					; Donohue, Ian/A-7270-2010; Irvine, Kenneth/M-5756-2013	Donohue, Ian/0000-0002-4698-6448; Irvine, Kenneth/0000-0002-1010-9064													0046-5070					MAR	2004	49	3					320	331		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01187.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01187.x													WOS:000188989600008

There were quantitative differences between some fatty acids in the muscles of wild and reared rainbow trout. The most abundant fatty acids in both wild and reared fish were palmitic acid (16:0), stearic acid (18:0), oleic acid (18:1 omega 9), and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 omega 3). The levels of omega 3 series and omega 6 series fatty acids in wild fish muscle were higher than in the reared fish. The omega 3/omega 6 ratios in muscle were found to be 1.92 (reared fish) and 2.28 (wild fish). The higher omega 3/omega 6 ratio in the wild fish might be a result of the season and the richer feeding conditions in the river under natural conditions. However, daily and continuously reared fish might be turned into more beneficial food for human consumption.

The aim of the study was to analyse the annual developmental cycle of ovaries of the European perch from the Oder river, Lake Dabie and a drainage canal (Warm Canal) carrying post-cooling water from the Dolna Odra power plant (annual average water temperature in the canal is higher by 6-8 degrees C than the water of the other sampling sites). Most of the female perch caught in the canal carrying post-cooling water had immature stage 2 gonads (delayed development of the gonads) and were smaller than the fish from the other sites. No traces of spawning in the form of deposed egg strings were found in the drainage canal. Adult individuals avoid high temperatures found in the Warm Canal. In April, in perch from all sites, ovaries with post-spawning oocytes were observed. The spawning season of the females lasted from the beginning of April until May. Stage 4 of gonad development, with oocytes in advanced vitellogenesis, was the longest and ranged from September through February.					; Pilecka-Rapacz, Malgorzata/K-8138-2012; Kirczuk, Lucyna/AAY-7889-2020	Kirczuk, Lucyna/0000-0003-3710-8982; Pilecka-Rapacz, Malgorzata/0000-0002-1423-8808; 													0015-5497	1734-9168					2015	63	2					85	93		10.3409/fb63_2.85	http://dx.doi.org/10.3409/fb63_2.85								26255460					WOS:000354011800001

Annually laminated sediments from Onondaga Lake, New York (USA) provide a basis for high-resolution studies of lake degradation and recovery	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The chronology of a 184-cm-long sediment core from Onondaga Lake, New York (USA), is known with annual certainty from 2006 to the 1880s. Sediment age is known with similar precision, but less confidence, from the 1880s to the 1820s. Paired dark and light laminations are visible throughout most of the core, and are confirmed as annual varves by individual particle analysis and well-defined Cs-137 age horizons. The varves can be correlated with historical impacts on the lake to within 1-2 years, stratigraphic resolution that is comparable to the best obtained from other varved lakes in which minimally disruptive sampling techniques such as freeze coring were used. Seven stratigraphic units and four sub-units were defined using visual description and the Sr/Ca profile. Onset of laminations correlates to an 1822 change in lake level. The core contains evidence of past water-quality changes, including: (1) shortened extent of seasonal calcite supersaturation in the lake during the 1800s, (2) salt industry activity during the mid-1800s, (3) calcite-precipitation (whiting) events during the 1900s, and (4) greater impact of local hydrology on lake sedimentation prior to 1900. During the late 1800s, varves were interrupted by an approximately 12-year interval of non-laminated sediment that corresponds to a time of major alteration and industrial development in the watershed. There are no apparent turbidite layers in the sediment column. Onondaga Lake owes its remarkably preserved, 200-year sediment record largely to its high rate of sediment accumulation. The rate rises from 0.1 to 0.3 cm/year just after artificial lowering of the lake water level in 1822, to about 1 cm/year during the 1900s. This study shows that anthropogenically altered lakes can contain stratigraphic records in their bottom sediments with temporal resolution comparable to the annual time steps of mechanistic water-quality models. It also demonstrates the utility of the Sr/Ca ratio profile as a sediment descriptor in carbonate-rich lake systems and provides a detailed stratigraphic basis for continued historical water-quality assessment in what used to be one of the world's most polluted lakes.

The synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) could detect the surface uplift/subsidence in millimeter-level resolutions, which is powerful for the permafrost monitoring. In recent years, high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with centimeter-level resolution makes it possible to explore the permafrost change not only in regional scales but also in the local scales. In this paper, TerraSAR-X Staring Spotlight (ST) mode data in the Beiluhe of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) from Jun. 2004 to Dec. 2004 was used to explore the fine features of permafrost during the thawing/freezing seasons, and the coupling between the permafrost and the infrastructures in local scales. It is shown that the main displacement of permafrost is related to the landcover types, ground materials and soil moisture. The drainage system has impact on the settlement and heave in the permafrost area. The asymmetric deformation patterns of the thermalkarst lakes are determined by the permafrost configurations of lakes. The anthropogenic activities and infrastructures are the other factor influencing the permafrost thermal regime and displacement distribution.					; zhao, lin/M-9536-2018; Wang, Chao/N-9848-2019; zhang, zhengjia/GWA-0586-2022; Tang, Yx/HMV-9782-2023; Zhao, Lin/M-9536-2018	Wang, Chao/0000-0003-4887-923X; zhao, lin/0000-0003-0245-8413; 															978-1-4673-7297-8				2015							320	324																WOS:000380439100078

However, lakes in the cold regions are usually covered by ice for 5-6 months. To get a better understanding of stable isotopes characteristics and indications in lake ice bodies, ice and water were sampled during the icebound season in both the ice and water bodies in Dali Lake, and deuterium, oxygen-18 total nitrogen (TN), and the major ions were analyzed. The results showed that deuterium and oxygen-18 compositions (delta D-delta O-18) compositions in the ice body were greater than in the water body beneath, scattered on a straight line, and deviating downward from the global meteoric water line in the top right. The ice profile showed that the delta D-delta O-18 compositions increased from the ice surface downward and decreased near to the bottom. In contrast, the TN and the major ions in the ice decreased from the ice surface downward and increased near to the bottom, meaning that the concentrations of delta O-18 had a negative correlation with the concentrations of TN and major ions. These indicated that stable isotopes can be used for tracing the nutriment and ion transport processes in the ice body.					; shi, XIAOHONG/KRP-1855-2024	Zhen, Zhilei/0000-0002-9494-4875; 													0273-1223	1996-9732					2015	71	7					1065	1072		10.2166/wst.2015.065	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wst.2015.065								25860710					WOS:000353560300015
J	Edmundson, JA; Mazumder, A				Edmundson, JA; Mazumder, A			Linking growth of juvenile sockeye salmon to habitat temperature in Alaskan lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We examined the influence of temperature on the size of age-1 smolts of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka relative to that of food availability and density dependence across a variety of Alaskan lakes. We analyzed data from 36 lakes providing 134 lake years (annual means) of data. These lakes represent clear, organically stained, and glacially turbid lake types, They produce age-1 sockeye salmon smelts exhibiting a threefold variation in average length (52-145 mm) and a 30-fold variation in average weight (1-30 g). We used simple regression analysis to test for linkages between age-1 smolt size and the independent variables zooplankton biomass (mg/m(2)), smolt density (number/km(2)), length of the growing season, and mean water column temperature. Zooplankton biomass (ZB) was the strongest single predictor of smolt size, accounting for 52% of the variation in mean age-1 smolt fork length (FL) and weight (W). Individually, smolt density (SMD) accounted for only 10% of the variance in age-1 smolt size: however, mean water column temperature (T(s)) explained 24% of the variation in FL and 19% of the variation in W. Smolt size was unrelated to the length of the growing season (S); however, growth rate indexed by length varied inversely with S while growth in terms of weight did not. Subsequently, we combined all factors into a multivariate model of age-1 smolt size and the population's biological and thermal environment. Taken together. the factors ZB, SMD, and T(s) accounted for 70% of the variation in FL and W. The influence of temperature on smolt size appeared to be more direct (through its effect on metabolic rates) than indirect (through limiting food availability [plankton]), Our results may influence fishery management objectives and serve as a template to project future trends in juvenile sockeye salmon growth under different climatic conditions.																			0002-8487					JUL	2001	130	4					644	662		10.1577/1548-8659(2001)130<0644:LGOJSS>2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(2001)130<0644:LGOJSS>2.0.CO;2													WOS:000169852700010

Triplicate plates were inoculated and incubated for 5 d, during which color development was monitored twice daily by optical density (OD595) Optical densities in plate wells containing carbon substrates were corrected for blank absorbance at each measurement time. Then, data on optical densities of all substrate wells were selected from a single measurement time, to construct a community-level physiological profile. This measurement time was chosen so that plates would be compared at similar levels of color development. This data selection also generally maximized correlations of substrate utilization patterns determined from replicate plates. Multivariate analyses (ordinations) of the community-level physiological profiles identified several amino acids, carboxylic acids, and carbohydrates associated with seasonal patterns of substrate utilization. Multivariate analyses further revealed patterns in substrate utilization common to all 4 lakes: strong relative responses to amino and carboxylic acids in cool seasons and strong relative responses to carbohydrates in warm seasons. These patterns may be driven by seasonal events among phytoplankton that influence carbohydrate supply, and appear to be dampened in an oligotrophic lake, which does not support high algal abundance.

Submergence Responses of Cool-Season Annual Plants and Potential for Fish Habitat	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												The artificial water regimes of flood control reservoirs limit vegetation establishment in littoral zones and produce mudflats with limited habitat for juvenile fishes. One strategy to enhance habitat on mudflats is to sow cool-season plants to provide submerged structure when inundated. However, how the structure of these plants persists following inundation has not been evaluated. To investigate the species-specific responses of plants to inundation, we submerged six cool-season annual plant cultivars in outdoor flow-through tanks and monitored maximum height and density of plant structures over time. Time-to-event analyses and generalized linear models characterized differences in structural persistence between cultivars over time. Plantings degraded rapidly if inundated before plants matured. However, mature plants of Marshall ryegrass Lolium multiflorum and triticale Triticosecale provided dense structure that persisted for 3 months. As Marshall ryegrass degraded, the stem density decreased and produced wide gaps relative to triticale, which remained dense and complex. Differences in plant architecture during the senescence process following submergence may influence fish species and size class use. Our results indicate that cool-season grasses have high potential as habitat enhancers due to long-term persistence, and differences in plant structural characteristics may provide flexibility for managers to attract target fish species.					; Coppola, Giancarlo/AAY-5014-2020; Miranda, Luísa/N-6353-2013	Colvin, Michael/0000-0002-6581-4764; Miranda, Leandro/0000-0002-2138-7924; 													0275-5947	1548-8675				DEC	2019	39	6					1269	1276		10.1002/nafm.10359	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.10359		SEP 2019											WOS:000487624300001

Genetic and maternal effects on tail spine and body length in the invasive spiny water flea (Bythotrephes longimanus)	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS												Interest in the evolution of invasive species has grown in recent years, yet few studies have investigated sources of variation in invasive species traits experiencing natural selection. The spiny water flea, Bythotrephes longimanus, is an invasive zooplankton in the Great Lakes that exhibits seasonal changes in tail spine and body length consistent with natural selection. Evolution of Bythotrephes traits, however, depends on the presence and magnitude of quantitative genetic variation, which could change within or across years. Clonal analysis of wild-captured Bythotrephes indicated that variance components for distal spine length were variable among but not within years. Spine length was always heritable but was not always influenced by maternal effects. In contrast, variance components for body length varied both within and among years, but likewise body length was always heritable and not always influenced by maternal effects. Results indicate that important Bythotrephes traits have heritable variation comparable to native species and other invasive species that would enable an evolutionary response to natural selection. This evolutionary capacity could contribute to the widespread success and dramatic effects of Bythotrephes invasion in systems with diverse biotic and abiotic conditions.

The diatom-inferred paleoclimatic history for northern Lake Victoria closely resembles that inferred from a well-dated pollen record from Pilkington Bay, Spectral analysis of the diatom record reveals strong periodicities including globally distributed similar to 2360-2550, -1400, similar to 1030-1130, and similar to 500 cal-yr cycles. Repeated, rapid shifts between Aulacoseira- and Nitzschia-dominated diatom assemblages suggest that post-1960 changes in the lake's phytoplankton communities have had earlier, climate-driven analogs.

Accessing assimilative capacity through a dual discharge approach	JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT												The historical development of environmental stressors in the watershed of Onondaga Lake (N.Y.) and the adjoining Seneca River is outlined as a prelude to the presentation of a novel approach for accessing assimilative capacity in this water quality-limited system. Proposed efforts to reclaim lost uses in the lake through heroic treatment at a major metropolitan wastewater treatment plant with continued discharge to the lake have been called into question. One option, diversion of the treatment plant effluent to the Seneca River, is complicated by phenomena impacting receiving water oxygen resources. A dual discharge strategy, which takes advantage of seasonal variations in assimilative capacity and the differing response times of the lake-river systems, is proposed as an alternative. In this approach, the effluent is routed to the river except when oxygen standards may be compromised, in which case all or part of the effluent is routed to the lake. Mathematical models demonstrate the feasibility of this option to meet water quality goals for both the lake (phosphorus) and the river (oxygen).

A rapid reverse transcription-PCR assay for F+ RNA coliphages to trace fecal pollution in Table Rock Lake on the Arkansas-Missouri border	WATER RESEARCH												Source determination of fecal contamination is imperative to efficiently reduce the fecal material load to environmental waters. This study developed primer pairs targeting three F+ RNA bacteriophages and a simple filtration sampling method to enumerate and identify coliphages in environmental waters. Water samples were collected seasonally for one year from the watershed of Table Rock Lake on the Arkansas-Missouri border in areas predisposed to fecal contamination. Collected samples were analyzed quantitatively with most probable number and plaque assays and qualitatively with reverse transcription-PCR. We demonstrated the usefulness of F+ RNA coliphages as an indicator of fecal contamination, but were unable to distinguish between human and non-human sources. F+ coliphage numbers in Table Rock Lake showed seasonal variation with the highest level of coliphage presence during the January sampling event. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Despite this, the factors shaping bird numbers and species richness in this habitat have not been studied. This paper examines the bird communities in a set of bogs distributed in two Peruvian localities during the wet (February) and dry (September) season. It evaluates the effects of bog size and some habitat features (grazing intensity, presence of small watercourses, vegetation cover, etc.) on abundance and species richness of bird communities. Location: Two Peruvian localities above 4,000 in (humid mountains near Cusco, and and uplands near Arequipa). Methods: Given that bogs tended to be long and narrow (mean width: 59 in, range 10 - 200 in), birds were counted along three parallel, simultaneous transects covering the full area of bogs. Independent variables evaluated were the size (ha), altitude (in above sea level), slope (0-90 degrees), presence/absence of small permanent watercourses and cover (%) of water, meadows and cushion-like Yareta shrubs in each study bog. Grazing intensity was estimated by counting the number of faecal pellet groups (of alpacas and other livestock) inside a one-metre-wide band transect. Results: Results support the view that bogs operate as local "hotspots" for birds, as they maintain species associated with different habitats, such as rivers and lakes (Anas flavirostris, Anas specularoides. etc). wet meadows (Vanellus resplendens, Chloephaga melanoptera, Cinclodes fuscus, Lessonia oreas, etc.) or bunch-grass steppes (Metriopelia aymara, Thinocorus orbignyianus, etc.). Bird species richness and numbers were positively correlated with bog size and, after controlling for this effect, species richness increased in those and upland bogs crossed by small watercourses during the dry period. This supports the key role of water availability on the bird communities of these steppes. No effect of grazing intensity and other habitat features were recorded. Conclusions: From a conservation perspective, bog size and the presence of permanent watercourses seem to be two focal criteria for prioritizing relevant bogs for protection and can also be used as key guidelines for evaluating the pervasive effects of the reduction and alteration of bogs by public works (roads), agricultural encroachment or draining.

J	Adrian, R; Wickham, SA; Butler, NM				Adrian, R; Wickham, SA; Butler, NM			Trophic interactions between zooplankton and the microbial community in contrasting food webs: the epilimnion and deep chlorophyll maximum of a mesotrophic lake	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Trophic interactions between the mesozooplankton and the microbial web (bacteria, protozoa) were studied in 2 in situ grazing experiments in the epilimnion and the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) of a mesotrophic lake. We combined the Landry-Hassett dilution technique, whereby growth and grazing rates can be determined simultaneously, with the presence or absence of mesozooplanktun and additional nutrients. The epilimnion was cladoceran-dominated, and had relatively high ciliate, and low heterotrophic nanoflagellate (HNF) abundance, while the DCM was rotifer-dominated, with fewer ciliates, but higher HNF abundance. Temperature differed by 13 degreesC (22 degreesC in the epilimnion; 9 degreesC in the DCM). The community differences between the epilimnion and DCM and the experimental manipulations had their greatest effects on ciliates, lesser effects on HNF, and essentially no net effect on bacteria. Bacteria growth rates and grazing losses did not differ between the epilimnion and DCM, despite the large differences in chlorophyll a and abiotic parameters, and were independent of nutrient addition or mesozooplankton removal. In contrast, the experimental manipulations produced relatively moderate changes in HNF growth rates and grazing losses in both the epilimnion and DCM. Although HNF densities were 3 times higher in the DCM than the epilimnion, epilimnetic HNF growth rates were approximately twice the rate found in the DCM. This was consistent with both higher temperature and a release from predation through indirect predatory effects on alternative HNF predators like ciliates. In the DCM, crustacean zooplankton were less abundant and therefore had smaller direct and indirect effects on the HNF, while the metazoan microzooplankton (mainly rotifers) were more important. Ciliate growth rates were lower in the epilimnion than in the DCM, but only in the epilimnion were ciliate growth rates enhanced by the addition of nutrients. The cladoceran-dominated community of the epilimnion was able to reduce ciliate growth rates to negative values, while in the rotifer-dominated DCM, ciliate growth rates were always positive along a predator density gradient. These results demonstrate that while ciliates, and to a lesser extent heterotrophic flagellates, respond quickly to changes in predator community composition, there are so many other direct and indirect pressures on bacteria that changes in the mesozooplankton community composition have no net effect on their adundance.																			0948-3055					MAR 28	2001	24	1					83	97		10.3354/ame024083	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame024083													WOS:000168208300009

Strong seasonal patterns were observed in the delta(15)N of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, different size fractions of particulate organic matter, and zooplankton split into size fractions of 110-210, 210-295, and > 295 mu m. Similar patterns were reflected in the delta(15)N of individual species: Diacyclops thomasi, Bosmina longirostris, Daphnia spp., and calanoid copepods. The seasonal fluctuation of primary producers was a function of the nitrogen enrichment of dissolved inorganic nitrogen during photosynthetic uptake and the delta(15)N of NH4+ and NO3- used by the algae. The large range in delta(15)N of primary producers suggests that recycling of nitrogen is an important determinant of delta(15)N at the base of the food web. The delta(15)N of individual species of zooplankton reflected the known feeding strategies and dietary preferences.

Similarities and differences in the taphonomic features are evaluated with regard to marginal lacustrine sedimentary processes involved in the accumulation of these mammal assemblages. Selective preservation of skeletal-part and taxa in relation to facies have been explored to determine their suitability for palaeoecological analysis. The mortality in Cullar de Baza-1 and Huelago-1 corresponds to a catastrophic pattern, but other taphonomic features of the bones indicate that accumulation processes were diachronic as occurred in Huescar-1. This could be explained by selective-predation and/or seasonal accumulation of bones. Hydraulic sorting and transportation greatly controlled the size and shape of accumulated skeletal elements, and the different preservational circumstances of each environment largely constrained the taxonomic composition of the fossil bone assemblages. Autochthonous fauna only occurs in Huescar-1 corresponding to subaquatic environments. The absence of carnivores among the identifiable remains from Huelago-1 has no plausible taphonomic or sedimentological explanation, Nevertheless, after taking into account the taphonomic factors, the differences in taxonomic composition between these three mammal assemblages reflect differences in the surrounding habitats. The great diversity of ruminant artiodactyls, in particular browsers, is indicative of wooded or bushy areas in the surroundings of Huelago-1 although not in the immediate area of the lake margin. This diversity coincides with that observed in other Villafranchian localities and represents the greatest diversity of artiodactyls known from the Neogene and Quaternary record of Western Europe. In turn, the high diversity of sub-aquatic forms and a smaller variety of artiodactyl species in Huescar-1. reflects an open, sparsely forested environment susceptible to seasonal drought. A similar sparse forested environment has been deduced for Cullar de Baza-1. The climate and environmental conditions in Huescar-1 and Cullar de Baza-1 are consistent with a climatic deterioration at the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene ('Glacial Pleistocene').

Carbohydrate fluxes indicate that phytoplanktonic production is the main organic matter (OM) source whereas the monosaccharides concentrations normalised to OC contents (TCH(2)O) mostly reflect degradation. The abundance of rhamnose in all samples, its increasing fluxes (together with fucose) with increasing water depth, and its strong decrease in the top 5 cm of the bottom sediments mark the intense activity of the microbiota. The almost complete removal of sugars in the water and top sediment indicates very little contribution to the preserved OM stock. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The latter can be green due to cyanobacterial bloom, black due to dissolved organic matter, or crystalline. Over the past two decades, numerous studies in the region have explored the connections between the lake type, the surrounding soils, and water table dynamics. However, these insights emerged from independent studies conducted at multiple sites, making their synthesis challenging and leaving questions about the differences between lake types. Our research focuses on a representative Nhecolandia site, aiming to comprehensively understand soil and lake genesis and dynamics. For each lake type, we conducted detailed toposequence soil studies, assessing particle size distribution, chemistry and mineralogy of the <2 mm fraction of identified horizons. A 49-month temporal study utilizing PlanetScope satellite data examined lake connections to the hydrographic network affected by seasonal flooding. Our findings confirmed the general organization and mineralogy of soils around saline-alkaline lakes. Notably, we identified variations in soil toposequences corresponding to different lake type. Two types of silcrete were observed: one acidic, found at the upper slopes, and the other alkaline, located at the lower slopes. We determined that, for endorheism and lake alkalinization, the presence of a ridge around a lake is insufficient. Instead, deep impermeable horizons in the lower portion of the toposequences are essential. Additionally, crystalline lakes differentiate from black and green ones due to less efficient hydraulic isolation. Our comprehensive dataset from a single site provides a valuable resource for guiding and developing more specific studies on these alkaline systems.

Water and surface sediment samples were collected from different sites of the Mohlapitsi River, South Africa, during the high flow and low flow seasons. The samples were analyzed for As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn levels using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). In the water, only Fe, Mn, and Zn were detected, but the concentrations were below the standard guideline values except for Mn. However, in the sediment, all the metal (loid)s were detected in considerable concentrations. The mean concentrations of the metal (loid)s were higher during high flow than low flow, except for Fe. The enrichment factor (EF) of the heavy metal (loid)s ranged from low enrichment to moderate enrichment. Geo-accumulation index (Igeo) Shows moderate contamination levels with Cr and Mn. The main sources of contamination are attributed to discharges from agricultural fields and grazing areas in the catchment. The results provide baseline information on metal (loid) contamination in the Mohlapitsi River for management purposes.					; , AddoBediako/AAJ-1584-2021	Addo-Bediako, Abraham/0000-0002-5055-8315; 													1230-1485	2083-5906					2024	33	4					3545	3554		10.15244/pjoes/169451	http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/169451													WOS:001264451600005

Considering sub-basins in the spatio-temporal dynamics of lake food webs	AQUATIC SCIENCES												The dynamics of populations in lake food webs are driven by a combination of spatial, environmental, and trophic processes. Differences among taxa in their ability to disperse and respond to the environment impact the food web and will be reflected in their abundances over time at different sites within a lake. The level of synchrony among lake sub-basins (within and across populations in a lake) is critical for determining the importance of spatial resolution when sampling and developing models. Using 7 years of survey data in Lake George, New York State (USA), we provide a high-level overview of changes in the densities of key food web groups over time (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and macroinvertebrates) and the synchrony of their dynamics among sub-basins. Phytoplankton biomass (measured as chlorophyll a) and zooplankton densities showed strong seasonal and multi-year trends that were synchronous across space within each group. Several macroinvertebrate groups showed significant non-linear multi-year trends, but synchrony was lower. For phytoplankton and some macroinvertebrate groups, we found that densities were highest in the South Basin, likely reflecting the gradient of decreasing nutrients in the lake from south to north. Collectively, these results suggest that modeling the food web using sub-basins is a useful scale for better understanding species dynamics in large lakes.

Out of 295 fish samples collected, 202 (68.4%) contained food in the gut. Zooplankton (24.4%), detritus (22.8%), macrophytes (16.2%), phytoplankton (14.8%) and insects (11.8%) were the main diets of C. gariepinus. Zooplankton (46.2%) and phytoplankton (31.1%) were predominant in the diet during the dry season, but during the wet season, detritus (42%), macrophytes (29.7%) and insects (29.5%) were the predominant food items. The frequency of occurrence and the volumetric contribution of diet items varied significantly (p<0.05) between seasons. Schoener's Diet Overlap Index showed a slight ontogenetic shift in the diet of C. gariepinus between different size classes. Insects and nematodes were the main diets of smaller-size classes, while plankton, detritus and macrophytes were dominant in the higher-size classes. In general, C. gariepinus feeds on both plant and animal food and is considered omnivorous in the reservoir.					; Tesema, Dagnew/ABF-2827-2021; Aemro, Degsera/HHS-6998-2022; Mingist, Minwyelet/AGZ-9342-2022	, Degsera/0000-0003-0073-4111; Mequanent Tesema, Dagnew/0000-0002-4985-8310													0970-6011						2024	71	2					37	42		10.21077/ijf.2024.71.2.134268-05	http://dx.doi.org/10.21077/ijf.2024.71.2.134268-05													WOS:001263443500004

Determination of Optimal Water Intake Layer Using Deep Learning-Based Water Quality Monitoring and Prediction	WATER												The effective management of drinking water sources is essential not only for maintaining their water quality but also for the efficient operation of drinking water treatment plants. A decline in water quality in water reservoirs can result in increased operational costs for water treatment and compromise the reliability and safety of treated water. In this study, a deep learning model, the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm, was employed to predict water quality and identify an optimal water intake layer across various seasons and years for Juam Lake, Korea. A comprehensive investigation was conducted to prioritize various water quality parameters and determine suitable intake layers. Based on these priorities, effective methods for optimizing an intake layer were developed to enable more reliable water intake operations. Water quality data from January 2013 to June 2023 were analyzed for the study. This dataset was used for rigorous statistical and correlational analyses to better understand the dynamics affecting water quality parameters. The findings aim to enhance the operational efficiency of water intake and treatment facilities.

Therefore, it is crucial to estimate glacier mass changes over HMA. Though Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) can accurately monitor monthly global mass changes, the low spatial resolution of similar to 300 km limits the ability to reveal detailed spatiotemporal characteristics of mountain glacier changes. In this contribution, we derived a high-resolution (0.5 degrees x0.5 degrees) mascon (mass concentration) solution from April 2002 to August 2023, which is innovatively constrained by multisource prior information from advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer, satellite altimetry, and WaterGAP global hydrology model. Therefore, the developed mascon solution shows higher spatial resolution than the three state-of-the-art global mascon solutions regarding the spatial distribution of mass change trends. Moreover, our mascon solution is highly correlated with in situ measurements at four stations compared to the three mascon solutions in capturing the interannual mass variations with an average correlation coefficient of 0.60. Then, we further investigate the spatiotemporal mass change characteristics in HMA with the developed high-spatial resolution mascon solution. Results show that the Central Himalayas, Western Himalayas, and Nyainqentanglha experienced the most substantial losses from 2002 to 2023, with trends of 5.46 +/- 0.42, 3.92 +/- 0.80, and 3.79 +/- 1.20 Gt/yr, respectively. Additionally, seasonal variations' magnitudes and temporal patterns vary with regions, exhibiting significant spatial heterogeneity. Our high-spatial resolution mascon solution provides valuable records, unveiling mass changes and potential glacier instability hidden in low-spatial resolution solutions. This enhancement strengthens the capabilities of GRACE/GRACE-FO in comprehending the global glacier response to climate change.

J	Yu, GA; Yue, PS; Zhang, CD; Li, ZW; Hou, WP				Yu, Guo-An; Yue, Pengsheng; Zhang, Chendi; Li, Zhiwei; Hou, Weipeng			River hydrology studies in Southeast Xizang: Progress and challenges	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE												Southeast Xizang is one of the areas with the highest precipitation, runoff production, sediment yield, and transport on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau and is also one of the areas most sensitive to climate change. The hydrological processes of the rivers in this area are not only affected by regional climate change. However, they are also closely related to changes in the underlying surface conditions, such as vegetation, glaciers, snow, seasonally frozen ground/permafrost, glacial lakes, and occasional natural geo-hazards, such as landslides and debris flows. An in-depth understanding of regional river hydrological characteristics, runoff production, sediment yield, and transport mechanisms, the main influencing factors, and clarification of runoff/sediment regime changes and future trends in the context of global climate change have important scientific value and practical significance for the rational development and utilization of flow energy and water resources in Southeast Xizang, (hydro-)engineering safety and long-term use, as well as scientific mitigation and control of natural geo-hazards (e.g., debris flow and mountain torrents). Since the 1950s (especially during the past 50 years), comprehensive field scientific investigations, such as the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau scientific expeditions and the unremitting efforts of several generations of scientific researchers, relatively deep explorations, and studies on climate, hydrology, physical geography, geology, and geomorphology in southeastern Xizang have been conducted. This review systematically summarizes the main progress in river hydrology research in Southeast Xizang, including regional climate change and its impact, runoff, sediment characteristics, and changes. It discusses also the main challenges of current research and certain aspects that should be strengthened in the future. Over the past 70 years, the temperature in southeastern Xizang has increased significantly. Although there is no unified conclusion on the interannual variation trend of precipitation, analysis based on the observational data of surface weather stations indicates a weak, increasing trend. The glaciers in southeastern Xizang retreat at an accelerated rate, and the shrinkage is much greater than in other Qinghai-Xizang Plateau areas. The area and number of glacial lakes in this region have increased, increasing the potential risk of glacial lake outbursts. Southeast Xizang has high runoff and sediment production on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau. Approximately 2/3 (similar to 125 billion m(3)) of the runoff and more than 90% of the sediment (suspended sediment similar to 190 million tons) at the Pasighat in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River originate from this area (especially the bend area of the Yarlung Tsangpo Great Canyon centered around the Namcha Barwa and Gyala Peri peaks), the runoff and sediment dynamics in this area hence determine the water and sediment flow in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River to a considerable extent. Runoff in South Xizang is generally dominated by precipitation, but the proportion of meltwater is high (up to similar to 70%) in glacial-intensive watersheds, such as the main tributaries, Parlung Tsangpo and Yigong Tsangpo. Over the past 60 years, runoff in Southeast Xizang has shown an increasing trend but with significant fluctuations. Under future climate change scenarios, the runoff in this region is estimated to show an increasing trend, and sediment production and transport trends are similar but with large uncertainties. The meteorological and hydrological monitoring in Southeast Xizang is still weak, and flow and sediment data are scarce, which is a basic problem that future regional river hydrological research should strive to overcome and solve.

Space-time modeling of 20 years of daily air temperature in the Chicago metropolitan region	ENVIRONMETRICS												We analyze 20 years of daily minimum and maximum air temperature data in the Chicago metropolitan region and propose a parsimonious model that describes their mean function and the space-time covariance structure. The mean function contains a long-term trend, annual and semiannual harmonics, and physical covariates such as latitude, distance to the Lake Michigan, and winds, each interacted with the harmonic terms, thus allowing the effects of physical covariates to vary smoothly over time. The temporal correlation at a given location is described using an APMA(1,2) model. The residuals (innovations) from this models are treated as independent replications of a spatial process with covariance structure in the Matern class. The space-time covariance structure parameters are allowed to vary seasonally. Using the estimated covariance structure, we interpolate the temperature to a fine grid in the Chicago metropolitan region. This procedure borrows information from temporally and spatially adjacent data. The methods presented in this paper should be useful to approach other environmental problems where the data are discrete and regular in time but irregular in space.

S. nigrita is less abundant than S. schall in the river. Both species are euryphagous with their diet containing a wide variety of food items that include various types of plankton, invertebrates and plants. This high diversity of the food composition indicates a wide adaptability to the habitats in which they live. This is an important strategy for survival and an advantage over the fish species competing for a specific food item. Size at maturity differs between species for both males (15 cm TL for S. schall and 21 cm TL for S. nigrita) and females (16 cm and 22 cm, respectively). Fecundity range is higher for S. schall (1841 15076 oocytes) compared to that of S. nigrita (2647 - 9212). Peak values of GSI for males and females in both species occurred from mid- to late July, indicating one season of major spawning activity per year.																			0777-6276	2295-0451				JUL	2006	136	2					193	201																WOS:000243430400009

Using ammonium and dissolved methane as inert tracers, the model was solved, both analytically and numerically, for Lake Kinneret while taking into account sedimentary release, hypolimnetic transport, and the deepening of the thermocline depth. An average seasonal turbulent diffusion coefficient in the hypolymnion of 1.5 +/- 0.5 m(2) d(-1) was confirmed independently by both tracers.

Holocene savanna hydroclimate record from Kinrara Lake, north-east Queensland, Australia	PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY												We present a record of hydroclimatic change over the Holocene from Kinrara Lake, in a seasonally dry savanna location in north-eastern Australia. The record is derived from the oxygen (818O) and carbon stable isotope (813C) composition of endogenic and biogenic (gastropod) carbonate. The stable isotope proxy records are complemented by elemental geochemical (Itrax) and sedimentological proxy data providing a record of hydrologic and climate change, spanning 10.5 ka to the present day. Two main forms of endogenic carbonate occur in the lake sediments; (i) carbonate associated with biofilms during the early-Holocene, under drier-than-modern conditions, (ii) photosynthetic and evaporatively-enriched precipitates in the late-Holocene, associated with enhanced climate variability inducing drought periods. Strong relationships between negative 818O values and increased Ti, Rb, Fe/Mn, inc/coh, are linked with strengthened monsoon conditions, while enhanced periods of dryness are inferred from more positive 818O values, increased Ca/ n-ary sumation Fe, Ti, Al, and subsequent intensifications in lake productivity (higher Si/Ti, S/Ti, Mn/Ti). Three distinct phases can be identified in palaeohydrological history of the lake; (i) a relatively stable drier-than-modern phase during the early-Holocene (10.5 to 8.2 ka), (2) a significantly wetter-than-modern, monsoon-dominated phase through the mid-Holocene into the late-Holocene (8.2-2.8 cal yr BP), and (3) after 2.8 ka, increased intensity of ENSO-related rainfall variability during the late Holocene, continuing into the present.

Analysis of patterns of vertical and temporal distribution of phytoplankton using multifactorial analysis: Acidic Lake Caviahue, Patagonia, Argentina	LIMNOLOGICA												Most existing studies on the algal communities of acid lakes are based on environments that have been caused by anthropogenic disturbances. Such lakes have a different origin compared to the natural acidic lakes and could be expected to differ also in the mechanisms controlling phytoplankton and trophic status. Planktonic community in Lake Caviahue is somewhat diverse in spite of the low pH of the water. Algae have a distinctive vertical distribution: the values of phytoplankton biomass remain constant throughout the water column and at times were highest in the upper end of the hypolimnion, forming a maximum or a layer of chlorophyll a at depth. The goal of this work was to investigate the factors influencing the seasonal and vertical distribution of phytoplankton. The lake was sampled between the years 2004 and 2006. Physical, chemical and biological parameters at different depths throughout the water column were determined. The interrelationships between environmental variables at different sampling dates were analyzed using an integration of multivariate matrices, multiple factor analysis, to analyze any joint partnerships in the samples. We found that phytoplankton biomass is dominated by Keratococcus rhaphidioides. With regard to zooplankton, we found a single species of rotifers (Philodina sp.). The two arms of the lake and the depths have different behaviours showing differences in the arms' conductivity, dissolved oxygen and pH. The more superficial layers were characterized by high values of phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass, organic and inorganic carbon, dissolved oxygen and pH. The deeper layers showed high values of chlorophyll a, ammonium and phosphorus (dissolved and particulate). From the multivariate analysis the relationships of the each algal species with pH, as a possible indicator of the degree of "acidophilia", could be extracted. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Nitorgen cycling in seasonal wetlands in subtropical cattle pastures	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												Understanding the effects of agricultural land use on wetland N cycling is critical in areas such as south-central Florida, where widespread agricultural activities intersect with extensive Wetland systems. We examined annual net N mineralization (N-min) (buried-core method) and denitrification rates (acetylene-block method) in 24 small seasonal wetlands on a cattle ranch in this region, 12 each in intensively managed improved pastures (IP) and less intensively managed semi-native pastures (SNP). Wetlands in IP had less detritus, higher N concentrations, lower C/N ratios (0-15 cm), and higher microbial biomass N than did wetlands in SNP. Cumulative annual net Nmin was lower in IP wetlands (98 +/- 17 kg N ha(-1)) than in SNP wetlands (133 +/- 18 kg N ha(-1)). Nitrification was much lower in IP than in SNP wetlands and dominated net Nmin during the dry season (December-June), but was negligible during the flooded period (July October). Cumulative annual denitrification was lower in IP wetlands (17.7 +/- 3.4 kg N ha(-1)) than in SNP wetlands (34.7 +/- 6.3 kg N ha(-1)). Soil N cycling rates correlated with NO3- and NH4+ concentrations, which correlated with soil C content. Our results show that the more intensive management of improved pastures was associated with declines in wetland soil C content and lower rates of nitrification and denitrification.					; Bohlen, Patrick/HNT-0140-2023	Bohlen, Patrick/0000-0002-3080-6297; 													0361-5995	1435-0661				MAY-JUN	2007	71	3					1058	1065		10.2136/sssaj2005.00217	http://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2005.00217													WOS:000246602500050
J	Nürnberg, GK				Nürnberg, GK			Quantification of oxygen depletion in lakes and reservoirs with the hypoxic factor	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT					Conference of the American-Society-of-Limnology-and-Oceanography (ASLO)	2002	VICTORIA, CANADA	American Soc Limnol Oceaography (ASLO)				The amount of dissolved oxygen (DO) in lake water has biological and chemical implications. There are no easy ways to quantify exeedences of important thresholds of DO in lakes, except the complete lack of DO, quantified as an annual or seasonal anoxic factor (Nurnberg 1995a, b). Here an analogous concept, the "Hypoxic Factor" (HF) is introduced. According to specific water quality standards, certain levels of oxygen depletion can be quantified, e.g., DO concentrations below 5 mg.L-1 or 6.5 mg.L-1. The HF is computed from the duration and extent of hypoxia by using DO profiles and hypsographic data. It is expressed in such a way that a value of 365 d.yr(-1) would mean the whole lake has a DO concentration below the specified level at all times. The application to a TMDL project, where DO standards are to be employed in a large Snake River reservoir, demonstrates the potential usefulness of HE This quantification of hypoxia allows the testing of hypotheses, e.g., the dependency of hypoxia on stage height, flow and nutrients. Significant relationships were found between annual expressions of hypoxia and hydrological variables (seasonal flows, water retention time) and a climatic index.					; Nurnberg, Gertrud/AFM-9725-2022	Nurnberg, Gertrud/0000-0003-1752-6562; 													1040-2381	2151-5530				DEC	2002	18	4					299	306																WOS:000180154500005
J	Squires, MM; Lesack, LFW				Squires, MM; Lesack, LFW			Water transparency and nutrients as controls on phytoplankton along a flood-frequency gradient among lakes of the Mackenzie Delta, western Canadian Arctic	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Relatively low phytoplankton production among lakes of the Mackenzie Delta has been attributed to light limitation in frequently flooded lakes and to nutrient limitation among infrequently flooded lakes; productivity peaks have been attributed to optimal light-nutrient conditions at intermediate flood frequency. We found that the distribution and abundance of phytoplankton among a large number of lakes was explained by optimal light-nutrient conditions but not by nutrient or light limitation. For a subset of lakes, seasonal dynamics of biomass were consistent with light limitation and optimal light-nutrient conditions but not nutrient limitation; photosynthetic rates were consistent with optimal light-nutrient conditions and nutrient limitation but not light limitation. Results of dilution-deletion experiments across a light-nutrient gradient indicated transition from light limitation to optimal light-nutrient conditions to nutrient limitation. Surprisingly, adding river water to lake water did not increase photosynthetic rates; this result and experimental incubations in situ during river inflow and lake outflow suggested that continuous supply of river water may be necessary to increase phytoplankton growth rates. Among infrequently flooded lakes, phytoplankton response to nutrient additions showed that phosphorus (P) limitation was no more likely than nitrogen (N) limitation, co-limitation, or no limitation by N or P.																			0706-652X					AUG	2002	59	8					1339	1349		10.1139/F02-085	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/F02-085													WOS:000178445900010
J	Wurster, CM; Patterson, WP				Wurster, CM; Patterson, WP			Seasonal variation in stable oxygen and carbon isotope values recovered from modern lacustrine freshwater mollusks: Paleoclimatological implications for sub-weekly temperature records	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												A fingernail clam (Sphaerium simile, Sphaeriidae) from Science Lake, a small watershed located in Allegany State Park, New York, USA and a zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha, Dreissenidae) from Keuka Lake, New York, the third largest Finger Lake of central New York, were selected to evaluate the applicability of using delta O-18((CaCO3)) and delta O-13((CaCO3)) values for sub-weekly climate records. Seasonal variation in delta O-18((CaCO3)) values was compared with predicted equilibrium values to test the hypothesis that lacustrine molluscs produce shell aragonite according to environmental variables. For the purpose of comparison, aragonite temperature-fractionation equations determined by Grossman& Ku (1986) and Patterson et al. (1993) were used. Sphaerium simile appears to produce delta O-18((CaCO3)) values predicted by Patterson et al. (1993), while Dreissena polymorpha produces delta O-18((CaCO3)) values in agreement with Grossman & Ku (1986). We attribute the difference to family-specific temperature-fractionation relationships. Because both types of mollusc record climate variables with a high degree of integrity, they should each serve as excellent paleoclimate proxies. The fingernail clam collected from a small watershed exhibits higher variation about the seasonal pattern than did the zebra mussel collected from a large watershed. This is attributed to the increased sensitivity of the small watershed to storm perturbation. Analysis of fossil molluscs from such watersheds might be useful in discerning paleo-storminess.

Lake Fryxell, situated in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, offers the opportunity to study microbial loop processes in the absence of crustacean zooplankton and other higher organisms. This is the first study of Lake Fryxell to provide detailed temporal and vertical variations of microbial loop organisms. 2. Protozoan communities are concentrated around the chemocline (9-10 m) in Lake Fryxell. Phototrophic nanoflagellates (PNAN), heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN) and ciliates formed deep maxima of 14580, 694 and 58 cells mL(-1) respectively. Although abundance and biomass at the chemocline was high, diversity of protozoa was low, Plagiacampa accounting for > 80% of the total ciliate biomass. 3. In the mixolimnion (4.5-8 m), protozoa were less abundant, but more diverse, with 24 ciliate morphotypes being identified within this region of the water column. Interannual variability of protozoan biomass and abundance was greater in the mixolimnion than at the chemocline due to more variable nutrient and prey concentrations. 4. Physicochemical gradients in Lake Fryxell were very stable because the perennial ice cover reduced wind driven currents. As a consequence, ciliate species occurred in distinct depth strata, Monodinium being most abundant directly beneath the ice cover, Askenasia having maximum abundance at 8 m and Plagiocampa dominating ciliate biomass at the chemocline. The lack of vertical mixing reduced seasonal successions of PNAN and ciliate species. Three cryptophyte species dominated the PNAN community at all times (> 79% of total biomass).

J	Buerkert, A; Hiernaux, P				Buerkert, A; Hiernaux, P			Nutrients in the west African Sudano-Sahelian zone: losses, transfers and role of external inputs	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PFLANZENERNAHRUNG UND BODENKUNDE												Crop growth on acid sandy soils of the Sudano-Sahelian zone is primarily limited by the low amounts of organic matter and available mineral nutrients in the topsoil. the shortening of fallow periods with population growth, the exploitation of fire wood, spatial nutrient transfers by wind and water and net nutrient exports with the crop yields in the order of 15 kg nitrogen (N) 2 kg phosphorous (P) and 15 kg potassium (K) ha(-1) yr(-1) for traditional fields planted to pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) in the southern Sahel have exhausted these resources. Large productivity declines in the prevailing agro-pastoral systems are the consequence. Data are presented to show how nutrient exports at the level of individual fields, through grain yields and biomass removal as forage, firewood, construction material, and also through run-off, wind and water erosion, leaching and volatilisation, are either losses for the ecosystem or sources of nutrients transferred within the manured fields through forage intake and excretion and helps to shortcut nutrient cycles, but it is also a net consumer of organic matter and minerals. through the effects of trampling on the soil and of grazing on the vegetation composition and production, livestock also indirectly affects the cycling and transfer of nutrients. Net nutrient inputs by heavy rains causing overland flow, dust deposition and through biological nitrogen fixation, are also unequally distributed and thus aggravate the fertility gradient from large nutrient 'source' areas such as rangelands to small 'sink' areas such as fallows, low lands, temporary lakes and river benches. At a finer resolution, shrubs and trees with their alternating periods of nutrient storing and recycling in leaves and wood, micro-depressions, termite mounts and ant nests become localised points of nutrient concentration and high crop productivity. To balance losses of nutrients in these integrated systems and to obtain sustainable increases in production, external inputs of nutrients are necessary. These may be introduced by two different pathways, either via mineral fertilisers applied to croplands or via externally produced supplements fed to livestock. These pathways are complementary and each one has direct effects on the other. Fertiliser application to croplands affect livestock through the increase in available forage and crop residue feed, whereas feed supplementation affects crop production through higher amounts and better quality of manure. The adoption of either strategy by farmers requires a high nutrient use efficiency at low cost. Data from regional field trials revealed increases in total dry matter (TDM) of cereals with broadcast annual P application at 13 kg ha-1 ranging across three years from 19 to 88% for rockphosphate and from 34 to 102% for single superphosphate (SSP). Still, a low-external input approach seemed more advantageous to farmers. The placement of NPK fertiliser at 4 kg ha(-1) with seed at or shortly after planting caused average TDM increases of 70 % for millet, sorghum, maize, cowpea and groundnut and showed an up to three-fold higher phosphorus use efficiency than broadcast P. On the other hand, late dry season supplementation of grazing steers with millet bran not only decreased animal weight losses but also increased N and P concentrations int eh faeces. The larger nutrient concentrations in the manure increased millet grain yield by 28% and stover yield by 21% on a field manured at a rate of 3 t DM ha(-1). However, even with such approaches the current trends of declining soil productivity can only be reversed, if local policy makers are willing to support agricultural change through better terms of trade for agricultural products.																			0044-3263					AUG	1998	161	4					365	383		10.1002/jpln.1998.3581610405	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.1998.3581610405													WOS:000075580900004
J	Etemad-Shahidi, A; Dorostkar, A; Liu, WC				Etemad-Shahidi, A.; Dorostkar, A.; Liu, Wen-Cheng			Prediction of salinity intrusion in Danshuei estuarine system	HYDROLOGY RESEARCH												The main parameters that affect the flow conditions and intrusion of salt water in an estuary system are tides and the seasonal variation of water discharge. A laterally averaged two-dimensional numerical model called MIKE 11 XZ is used to simulate the hydrodynamics and salinity intrusion of Danshuei River estuarine system. This model can simulate hydrodynamics and water quality in estuaries, reservoirs and lakes. MIKE 11 XZ solves the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations by using Abbott-Ionescu finite difference scheme in a non-dimensional vertical s-coordinate. Vertical eddy diffusivity in the model can be determined by a constant value, a mixing length theory and a k or k - epsilon turbulence closure scheme with Richardson number correction. A series of comprehensive field data obtained from Danshuei estuarine system is used for evaluation, calibration and verification of the model. The friction coefficient was calibrated and verified using water surface elevation and velocity measurements, respectively. Then the vertical eddy diffusivity was calibrated and verified through comparison of salinity measurements in different layers of several stations. Reasonable agreement was obtained between the model results and the observed data using k - epsilon turbulence closure scheme. The model application was investigated with different discharges and the effect of discharge variation on salinity intrusion was determined. The results showed that the fresh water discharge is the main parameter that affects the salinity intrusion in this system. Finally, simple power equations are suggested to predict the salinity intrusion due to the fresh water discharge in different tributaries of the system.

To study the effect of environmental factors and water quality on invertebrate abundances, and the backwash control for minimizing invertebrate abundance. A survey of the invertebrate community of GAC filters was carried out monthly from March 2021 to May 2022. A pilot-scale GAC system established in the laboratory alongside a lake, with a volume of 35.3 L. 45 invertebrate species were detected, and 40 of these were rotifers. Significant variation in abundance was observed among seasons before and after GAC filtration, the average invertebrate abundance in the inlet water was 11.1 times that in the filtrate. The GAC filter contained invertebrates that might be responsible for the large number of organisms in the filtrate. Invertebrate abundance in the GAC filter decreased gradually with the carbon layer depth, which the mean invertebrate abundances were 6,926, 5,232, and 3818 ind./kg in the top layer (TL), middle layer (ML), and bottom layer (BL), respectively. Invertebrate abundance was correlated with water temperature and varied seasonally. Among eight water quality parameters, chlorophyll a (Chla) and the total plate count (TPC) were most significantly correlated with invertebrate abundance. According to the statistical modeling and the optimization process of response surface methodology (RSM). The predicted optimal values were a flow rate of 6.36 L/h, a backwash cycle of 3.26 d, and a backwash intensity of 14.97 L/(m2 & sdot;s) for a minimum invertebrate abundance of 3013 ind./kg in the GAC filter. To maintain invertebrate abundance within an acceptable range, some of these measures might need to be modified depending on the actual conditions.

Nutrients, including NO3 � and PO43-, are transported with surface and seepage waters into rivers, lakes and aquifers and can eventually lead to algal blooms. delta 15N-NO3 �, delta 18O-NO3 �, and delta 11B combined with hydrogeochemical and microbial data for groundwater and surface water samples were inter-preted to evaluate the fate of nutrients in a riverside area around weirs in Daegu, South Korea. Most of the ions showed similar concentrations in the groundwater samples before and after heavy rain while concentrations of major ions in surface water samples were diluted after heavy rain. However, Si, PO43 � , Zn, Ce, La, Pb, Cu and a number of waterborne pathogens increased in surface water after heavy rain. The interpretation of delta 11B, delta 15N-NO3 �, and delta 18O-NO3 � values using a Bayesian mixing model revealed that sewage and synthetic fertilizers were the main sources of contaminants in the groundwater and surface water samples. delta 18O and SiO2 interpreted using the Bayesian mixing model indicated that the groundwater component in the surface water increased from 4.4 % to 17.9 % during the wet season. This is consistent with numerical simulation results indicating that the direct surface runoff and the groundwater baseflow contributions to the river system had also increased 6.4 times during the wet season. The increase in proteobacteria and decrease of actinobacteria in the surface water samples after heavy rain were also consistent with an increase of surface runoff and an increased groundwater component in the surface water. This study suggests that source apportionment based on chemical and multi-isotope data combined with numerical modeling approaches can be useful for identifying main hydrological and geochemical processes in riverside areas around weirs and can inform suggestions of effective methods for water quality management.

We aimed to explore the spatiotemporal beta diversity of macroinvertebrate metacommunities and their underlying drivers in two contrasting freshwater systems: streams and a lake. We observed that spatial beta diversity was higher than temporal beta diversity in both systems. Generalized dissimilarity modeling and dispersal-niche continuum index analyses suggested that this is probably because (i) environmental filtering was stronger in space than in time at least in streams, and (ii) dispersal was stronger in time than in space. The relative importance of spatial and seasonal drivers on metacommunity structures was notably different between stream and lake systems, as they have fundamentally different spatiotemporal structure of abiotic (i.e. environmental and hydrological) and biotic (i.e. aquatic insect diversities and life strategies) conditions. Our results shed light on spatiotemporal patterns in lake and stream metacommunities and may be useful for the management of freshwater ecosystems undergoing environmental changes.

The results showed that: (1) a combined consideration of species frequency of occurrence and relative abundance for defining the dominant index was more appropriate than using solely relative abundance; (2) the dominant taxa Fragilaria capucina var. vaucheriae (Kutzing) Lange-Bertalot and Melosira varians Agardh responded insensitively to the environmental factors, whereas the subordinate species Fragilaria capucina Desmazieres var. capucina, Nitzschia amphibia Grunow, Achnanthidium exiguum (Grunow) Czarnecki and Melosira italica (Ehrenberg) Kutzing showed the potential to be indicators; F. capucina var. radians (Kutzing) Lange-Bertalot increased along the gradient of higher water temperature (WT) and nutrients concentration, however, Fragilaria bidens Heiberg and Cymbella affinis Kutzing were affected in the opposite direction. Our findings revealed that periphytic diatoms varied seasonally and were useful for assessing water quality of different trophic status. Especially the subordinate species showed the potential to be better indicators than the dominant species in Donghu Lake.																			1434-2944	1522-2632				DEC	2016	101	5-6					182	192		10.1002/iroh.201601845	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/iroh.201601845													WOS:000389313900004
J	Munzer, OM; Schaetz, BA; Kurta, A				Munzer, Olivia M.; Schaetz, Brian A.; Kurta, Allen			Diet of a Nearctic species, the evening bat (Nycticeius humeralis), at the northern edge of its range	ACTA CHIROPTEROLOGICA												Evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis) are ubiquitous in the southeastern United States, but only one maternity colony occurs in the Great Lakes region, in Michigan, and it is the northernmost colony known in North America. We hypothesized that diet would vary throughout the season and between years and that diet of evening bats in northern areas would differ from diet of those in more southern parts of the continent. Almost 600 fecal pellets of evening bats were collected and analyzed from May through August 2006-2007. Thirteen orders of insects and two orders of arachnids were found, but Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Hemiptera composed 87% of dietary volume. Lepidoptera, which forms a substantial portion of the diet for most vespertilionids in eastern North America, contributed only 4.7% to the volume. Diet was broadly similar to evening bats in the core of their range, although evening bats in Michigan incorporated substantially more Diptera into their diet. Dietary composition and diversity differed little between years but showed variation among weeks within years. The lack of dietary specialization and similarity in major components in different parts of the range suggest that availability of prey or dietary competition with other species at the ordinal level are not factors limiting the northern distribution of the evening bat.																			1508-1109	1733-5329				DEC	2016	18	2					499	508		10.3161/15081109ACC2016.18.2.016	http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15081109ACC2016.18.2.016													WOS:000389350200016

Ten sampling sites were selected in the Ohrid Lake of Albanian side. This study aimed comparing diatoms and macrophytes indexes as bioindicators of Lake water quality. All two organisms groups showed significant response to eutrophication organic or inorganic pollution gradients. Submerged macrophytes respond to changes in the nutrient concentrations in their environment. In contrast to diatoms e. g., submerged macrophytes are capable of taking up nutrients from sediment and overlying water. Individual species of diatoms have specific preference to habitat and requirement for water chemistry. In this study, more epiphytic and oligotrophic species (such as Cymbella spp., Gomphonema clevei, G. gracile etc.) were appeared while more euplanktonic meso and/or eutrophic species toward sediment surface. Diatoms and macrophytes therefore function as integrators of environmental conditions to which they are subjected and thus can be used as long-term indicators with high spatial resolution. The Shannon Index gave evidence of biodiversity variations over the seasons and some differences between sampling sites. The Saprobic Index oscillated within a small band, indicative for oligo-beta-mesosaprob to beta-mesosaprob conditions. The Trophic Diatom Index TIDIA, Macrophyte Index (MI) and the Saprobic Index (SI) follow similar trends. This indicates that the structures of the communities reflect real environmental changes.

Spatio-Temporal Assessment of Changing Land Surface Temperature and Depleting Water in the Lake Chad Area	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS												Lake Chad is located at the south of the Sahara Desert in an arid region. The lake's water resources are under severe pressure due to the basic needs of the growing population around the lake, global warming, and increasing irrigation demands. Numerous land cover change studies have measured the rate of depletion of the lake's surface water. However, the contribution of the increasing high temperatures in the region which is also a compounding factor has received little attention. In this study, an assessment of the changes in surface water extent of Lake Chad from 1973-2017 was carried out through a land cover analysis. The potential influence of the rising land surface temperatures on the water losses was also studied. The extraction of the land cover was done using maximum likelihood classification. The results show that between 1973 and 1987, the lake lost 12,796.81km(2) of its surface water area. This period coincided with a season of drought and dry seasons reported to have occurred in the lake's area during the 1970s. Between 1987 and 2003, average temperature rise and change in surface water area was +1.54 degrees C and +962.71km(2) respectively. Between 2003 and 2017, average temperature rise and change in surface water area was +3.69 degrees C and -25.17km(2) respectively. These results provide further evidence of the alarming rate of water loss in the lake's environment, and suggest a link between rising land surface temperatures and diminution of the lake's water. The findings inform efforts directed at addressing the ecological problem facing the lake.

Water quality assessment of groundwater in area along Nandesari effluent channel, India	DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT												This study examines groundwater quality along the Nandesari common effluent channel (Vadodara, Gujarat, India) designed for disposal of treated industrial effluents from the Nandesari industrial area. Groundwater samples have been collected from various available groundwater sources like hand pumps, wells, bore wells, lakes, etc. along the channel in both post-monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons and were subjected to analysis for determining physicochemical parameters like pH, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn, Cd, chloride, fluoride, sulfate, phosphate, electrical conductance, chemical oxygen demand, DO, etc. The chemical composition of groundwater of the study area was found to be strongly influenced by effective weathering and leaching action along with anthropogenic activities. The hydrochemical facies infer groundwater samples irrespective of seasons to be of Ca-Mg-SO4-Cl type. Furthermore, salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, percentage of sodium Na (%), residual sodium carbonate, piper trilinear diagrams, and Gibbs ratio suggest that 56.25% of samples were found to be unfit for irrigation.					sudhakar, padmaja/U-9139-2018; Soni, Harnish/J-6355-2013	SONI, HARNISH/0000-0002-8020-8826; Sudhakar, Padmaja/0000-0002-7289-2189													1944-3994	1944-3986				DEC 6	2014	52	40-42					7552	7564		10.1080/19443994.2013.831796	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19443994.2013.831796													WOS:000346576000013

Snails were examined for infections using the light-box technique (exposure to bright fluorescent light). The prevalence of infected snails varied significantly among lakes within a year, between years in a lake, at a site from year to year, and at a site over a collecting season. Overall annual prevalence ranged from 0.54% (1999) to 1.32% (2001) oil Walloon Lake, front 0.56% (2001) to 1.06% (1998) on Higgins Lake, and 0.30% (2001) to 0.89% (2000) on Lake Leelanau. Generally, the peak in prevalence coincided in July oil the lakes. Prevalence was found to increase with snail length in all lakes. A comparison of the light-box technique and crushing snails demonstrated that prevalence varied in magnitude by technique as much as 1.2 and 5.7 times.																			0022-3395					FEB	2006	92	1					10	15		10.1645/GE-3336.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/GE-3336.1								16629307					WOS:000236565900002

Simultaneously, samples of seston and bottom sediments were also collected from the reservoir during early August. There were no differences in FA composition of gut contents, seston and sediments of pebbly bottom. Seston was the main food source of Gammarus but some FAs Gammarus got from sediments. The FA composition of G. lacustris and seston from the Bugach freshwater reservoir were compared with those of the animals from the saltwater Lake Shira (Siberia). While FA composition of the two Gammarus populations differed significantly, those of seston were practically similar: the composition of long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, 20:5omega3, 22:6omega3 and 20:4omega6, were significantly higher in animals from saline Shira Lake, whereas 16:1 and 16:0 were higher in the freshwater populations of amphipods from the Bugach freshwater reservoir. Taking into account the relevant literature data, we hypothesise that this difference in C16 acid might be a distinguishing characteristic of FA composition of freshwater and saltwater crustaceans.

Organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and mercury, 1991-1997	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Eggs of ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) were collected over the period 1991 to 1997 at 111 nests in the Fraser and Columbia River drainage systems of British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. Contents were analyzed for organochlorine (OC) pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and total mercury. Blood samples were taken from nestling ospreys at two time points during the 1992 breeding season on the Thompson River and analyzed for non-ortho PCBs. Concentrations of DDE and related compounds showed high variability among individual eggs within study areas and no significant differences in mean concentrations among study areas. Some eggs contained high concentrations of DDE, up to 20 mg/kg (wet weight), for which there were no evident local sources, suggesting that exposure occurred outside of the breeding grounds. Most other OC pesticides measured in osprey eggs showed a similar distribution, although mean concentrations of chlordane-related compounds were generally, and in some cases significantly, higher in samples collected from the Columbia River sites compared to elsewhere. Significantly greater concentrations of PCBs were found in eggs from the Columbia River basin compared to the Fraser. This was attributed to extensive development of hydroelectric generation and related industries on the Columbia system. Significant differences among sites were also found in the pattern of PCB congeners, e.g., eggs from the lower Columbia River site had proportionally greater concentrations of less chlorinated, Aroclor 1242-type PCBs compared to other sites. In contrast, eggs from upper reaches of the Columbia River had relatively greater amounts of Aroclor 1254 and 1260 congeners. Mercury concentrations in osprey eggs tended to be uniform among sites and comparable to those reported in the literature for ospreys nesting on naturally formed lakes and rivers. There were no significant temporal changes in mean concentrations of any of the measured compounds at sites monitored from 1991 to 1997.																			0090-4341					JAN	2000	38	1					93	106		10.1007/s002449910012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002449910012								10556376					WOS:000083914800012

A continuous record from July 1989 through June 1990 included 210 events that ranged in size from 0.2 to 85 mm (annual total, 2754 mm). The 95 events chemically analyzed during this period (45% of the total) were evenly distributed over all storm sizes. The volume-weighted mean (VWM) of the measured ionic sum was low (36 mu eq l(-1)), and H+ was the most abundant ion (VWM pH = 4.8). Organic acids made substantial contributions to both measured dissolved organic carbon and H+. Small interannual differences are apparent in a comparison with rain data collected from the same study site in 1984. The composition of rain appeared to be derived from a constant source of oceanic and rain-forest aerosols, and was not significantly influenced by local or regional biomass burning.

It was identified in the soft-water lobelian Lake Jelen (North Poland) during 2013 and 2018 phytolittoral surveys. This species is considered critically endangered in various European countries and was previously classified as extinct in Poland. Its occurrence was confirmed using morphological and molecular data (ITS1-18S, ITS2-28S, rDNA, and rbcL). The N. translucens occupied similar to 20% of the lake bottom, at depths of 1.5-6.5 m, water pH 7.5-8.6, conductivity of 59-66 mu S center dot cm(-1), and total nitrogen and phosphorus during growing season in the range of 1.1-1.4 mg center dot L-1 and 0.07-0.1 mg center dot L-1, respectively. It co-occurred mainly with plant species typical for lobelia lakes: Isoetes lacustris, Littorella uniflora, and Myriophyllum alterniflorum, as well as Ceratophyllum demersum and Elodea canadensis, which are characteristic for eutrophicated waters. It appears that N. translucens may thrive in lobelia lakes during their transformation to more eutrophic states.					; Celinski, Konrad/O-6006-2014; Rosinska, Joanna/J-2864-2012; Rzymski, Piotr/I-2240-2012	Piotrowicz, Ryszard/0000-0001-7890-0840; Celinski, Konrad/0000-0002-3888-1646; Rosinska, Joanna/0000-0002-8443-7546; Rzymski, Piotr/0000-0002-4713-0801; Klimaszyk, Piotr/0000-0003-2847-1106; Dabert, Miroslawa/0000-0001-5930-3346													0022-3646	1529-8817				DEC	2019	55	6					1412	1415		10.1111/jpy.12905	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.12905		AUG 2019						31339181					WOS:000483960900001

Our study determined the chemical and mineral composition of salt and water samples collected in mine areas (MA) and natural sites [basin and lakes (BL), Salar de Uyuni (SU)] in the Oruro mining district. The laboratory techniques that we used included X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and total elemental analysis. Results revealed that salt samples in SU sites were dominated by halite, while thenardite, halite and konyaite were observed in BL Sites in MA had >15 species of sulphates, oxides, hydroxides and other minerals. Metals such as Au, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Ni, Pb, Sn, Sc, and Zn were elevated in salt samples in MA sites compared to BL and SU sites. Salts in MA sites had lower pH (3.2) than BL (pH = 9.6) and SU (pH = 8.0). In MA sites, dissolution of minerals during the rainy season may mobilize metals from terrestrial (e.g., tailing deposits) to aquatic environments. We can conclude that mining activities combined with some natural metal mobilization events such as dissolution of salt efflorescence on rainy days and oxidation of pyrites may degrade the quality of water and land in the region.

Lake Sturgeon abundance and distribution have not been assessed above the confluence of the two rivers since this regulation was established. We documented abundance, distribution and movement of the Lake Sturgeon in both rivers from their confluence upstream to the first dam on each river during 2008-2012. Captured with boat-mounted direct current electrofishing and by hook and line, 136 sturgeon ranging from 37cm to 140cm total length were tagged. Annual electrofishing catch was only 6% of the catch during the 1960s on a 32km reach of the Namekagon River. Size structure showed that recruitment was significantly higher during the 1960s in the Namekagon River. Lake Sturgeon movement between rivers was documented during both sampling periods with direct line movements of >80km. While still depressed, the A. fulvescens population below the first dam upstream from the confluence of the Namekagon River and the upper St. Croix River is naturally recruiting and appears to have the potential to restore itself with a closed fishing season.																			0175-8659	1439-0426				DEC	2014	30	6			SI		1387	1392		10.1111/jai.12541	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jai.12541													WOS:000345588500040

MC-LR concentration was based on high-performance liquid chromatography detection and expressed as mu g . g(-1) of total plankton biomass, ng . L(-1) of lake water, and mu g . g(-1) of Microcystis aeruginosa Kuetz. emend. Elenkin. MC-LR was highly variable temporally (differences up to 3 orders of magnitude) within each lake over an individual year, between years in an individual lake, and between lakes in any year. Seasonal (within-year) changes in MC-LR concentration (expressed in the preceding units) were positively correlated to the abundance and biomass of the cyanobacterium M. aeruginosa (r = 0.60-0.77), total and total dissolved phosphorus concentration (r = 0.46-0.59), pH (r = 0.38-0.58), and chlorophyll a (r = 0.25-0.59). Surprisingly, there was no relationship between MC-LR concentration and water temperature (range: 7 degrees-24 degrees C, r = -0.13 to 0.02) and a negative correlation with nitrate concentration (r = -0.27 to -0.34). In two synoptic surveys examining spatial variability, MC-LR concentrations were quite variable (CV of 185 and 36% between sampling sites for Coal and Little Beaver lakes, respectively). Spatial distribution of MC-LR on any one day was correlated with the abundance and biomass of M. aeruginosa. Over a 24-h period, MC-LR concentration in M. aeruginosa decreased more than G-fold at night relative to daytime concentrations. In general, analytical and within-site variation of MC-LR was relatively small (CV < 4 and 9%, respectively) but greatest both within and between years in a lake followed by diel and spatial variation.																			0022-3646					APR	1995	31	2					248	263		10.1111/j.0022-3646.1995.00248.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0022-3646.1995.00248.x													WOS:A1995QW01100009
J	Meng, RL; Chow-Fraser, P				Meng, Reta Lingrui; Chow-Fraser, Patricia			Don't worry, be happy: Habitat selection of Blanding's Turtles (Emydoidea blandingii) living in a reference condition in Georgian Bay	PLOS ONE												Few areas within the Great Lakes basin are currently free from impact of human activities, and it is important to study these reference conditions for comparison with degraded sites in those regions. Here, we use radio telemetry to investigate habitat use, movement, and habitat selection of a population of the endangered (Federally in Canada) Blanding's turtle (Emydoidea blandingii, BLTU) inhabiting a mostly undisturbed archipelago located at the northern shore of Mnidoo gamii (Georgian Bay), Ontario over two active seasons (May to September 2021 and 2022). We found a mean home range of 16.21 ha for females (n = 7) and 15.10 ha for males (n = 7). Of the five habitat classes (Marsh, Open Water, Rock, Peatland, and Forest), females used all except Peatland during the nesting season, and both sexes used all five habitat classes throughout both active seasons in 2021 and 2022. Disproportionate habitat use was detected at the landscape scale but not at the home range scale which was consistent with the hypothesis that adult Blanding's turtles residing in relatively undisturbed sites with abundant habitat types use all habitat types according to their availability. We also observed the use of open, deep water by Blanding's Turtles as travel corridors for nesting and mating. Effective future conservation strategies should prioritize the protection and connectivity of relatively undisturbed wetlands, forests, and rock barrens in this region and use this study as a reference condition to compare BLTU habitat use and movement across disturbance gradients within Georgian Bay.

Twenty species of rodents and four species of insectivores were recorded from the study area. Mastomys natalensis (17.37%), Arvicanthis dembeensis (17.09%), Mastomys erythroleucus (8.90%), Stenocephalemys albipes (8.76%), Arvicanthis niloticus (8.19%), Acomys cahirinus (7.34%), Lemniscomys striatus (6.92%), Gerbilliscus nigricauda (6.21%), Grammomys dolichurus (3.67%), Gerbilliscus robusta (2.12%), Mus proconodon (1.98%), Mus mahomet (1.41), Dendromus melanotis (1.27%), Arvicanthis abyssinicus (1.13%), Mus musculus (0.99%), Praomys fumatus (0.85%), Xerus erythropus (0.85%), Lemniscomys barbarus (0.71%), Mus tenellus (0.71%) and Otomys typus (0.28%) were the rodents and their respective relative abundance in the study area. Crocidura olivieri (1.55%), Crocidura fumosa (0.85%), Crocidura bicolor (0.57%) and Elephantulus rufescens (0.28%) were the insectivores recorded with their respective relative abundance. Mastomys natalensis was the most abundant and O.similar to typus and E.similar to rufescens were the least (two each). Diversity of small mammals ranged from 2.299 to 2.625 with an average of 2.412. The highest small mammal diversity was in grasslands and the lowest was in Lake Chamo shore. Small mammal density varied from 5 to 43 ha-1 and biomass varied from 244 to 2559 g ha-1 with significant changes in relation to seasons and habitats.																			0141-6707	1365-2028				MAR	2012	50	1					102	108		10.1111/j.1365-2028.2011.01303.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2011.01303.x													WOS:000298732800011

Abnormally high levels of mercury were found in human hair from Jacareacanga and Brasilia Legal located near the main goldmining area as well as from Tres Bocas facing the lake in Amapa state, whereas the levels were much lower in Ponta de Pedras, a long way downstream. The values of male samples were about twice as high as females even in the same family. The predominant form of mercury in hair samples was methylmercury (average 90%), while high hair mercury observed in goldminers and workers in goldshops was mostly in the inorganic form. Longitudinal analyses of long hairs from people in fishing villages showed fairly constant and continuous exposure to methylmercury at least over the last few years with seasonal variations. Fish contained relatively high levels of mercury (up to 3.82 ppm) mostly in the form of methylmercury and most of the fish from upstream and some from downstream exceeded the allowable level of 0.5 ppm in Brazil.

Assessment of climatic and anthropogenic effects on flood dynamics in the Cerknisko Polje (SW Slovenia) based on a 70-year observation dataset	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES												Study Region: Cerknisko Polje, (SW Slovenia) - regularly flooded polje with a complex recharge and partly disturbed due to human interventions. Study Focus: We focus on the long-term flooding dynamics on the polje, including analyses of trends over time, seasonal changes and identification of the impact of climate change and human construction activities on the flooding dynamics. For this purpose, we used a 70 years long dataset of continuous hydrological and meteorological measurements, and analysed documents about past human activities on the polje. New Hydrological Insights for the Region: Comprehensive analyses have revealed notable changes in the flood dynamics over past decades which mostly reflect a general drop of the water level. This is linked to both changes in the climate (lower effective precipitation) and human construction activities (regulation of the river beds, construction of dams, widening or reclogging of swallow holes). In the 1970s floods were longer and more extensive due to experimental permanent lake formation but since the partial removal of constructions, floods have become shorter and less extensive, although extreme events are more frequent than in the past. These changing patterns further impact on biodiversity, which is one of the most remarkable elements of the polje.

J	Brick, CM; Moore, JN				Brick, CM; Moore, JN			Diel variation of trace metals in the upper Clark Fork River, Montana	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY												Hourly sampling of an oxic, slightly alkaline river with high concentrations of trace metals stored in bed and flood plain sediments reveals diel cycles in dissolved Mn and Zn and acid-soluble particulate Al, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn. Metal concentrations increase 2-3-fold at night as pH and dissolved oxygen decrease. Dissolved Win and Zn cycles may be the result of redox reactions in river-bed sediments or variations in influx of water from the hyporheic zone as a result of evapotranspiration. Increased particulate metal concentrations result from an increase in total suspended matter at night. Particulate metal concentrations decrease several hours before the decline of dissolved concentrations in the morning. Major elements and ions including Ca, Mg, Na, Si, Cl-, SO42-, and total alkalinity show no evidence of diel variation. The results have implications for monitoring and assessment of reclamation because they show that daytime sampling underestimates the flux of metals in the river.

The reference lakes provide recovery targets and norms of interannual variability. As indicators of damage and recovery, the performance of the univariate metrics was richness = diversity > evenness > abundance. Multivariate metrics were developed by projecting the Sudbury data onto a correspondence analysis of the spatial reference data. Univariate and multivariate approaches were equally sensitive for metrics based on species presence; however, the multivariate metrics incorporating the relative abundances of taxa were the best overall performers. While the two more acidic (pH 4.5) lakes had not recovered 15 years after neutralization, the zooplankton of Nelson Lake, the least acidic (pH 5.7) of the experimental lakes, recovered completely within 10 years of liming. This augurs well for the recovery of zooplankton in thousands of moderately acidic North American lakes, should international reductions in SO2 emissions reverse their acidification.

Innovative coaxial polyethylene pipes (Refla) filled with heat collection fluid are laid horizontally in the sediment layer. This study aims to evaluate the adequacy and possible overuse of this shallow geothermal energy. This entailed a numerical analysis of the heat relations of a "coaxial closed-loop geothermal system (CCGS)" to investigate the thermal behavior of the sediment. The numerical model was developed in Midas GTS NX software with a thermal analysis module. The objective was to understand temperature fluctuation in the sediment, which is influenced not only by geothermal energy exploitation, but also by seasonal weather. The numerical model, due to its design, provided information mainly about changes in sediment temperature due to the geothermal energy exploitation during the different seasons. The results show that in the first third of the total length of the Refla pipes, the sediment environment is significantly affected by energy exploitation's temperature loading. It is advisable to exclude the first third from an analysis of total geothermal energy reserves. The remaining twothirds of the length shows potential to provide sustainable, long-term geothermal energy (GE) exploitation at the current rate.					; Mäkiranta, Anne/AAD-9870-2021; Hrubesova, Eva/V-2708-2017; Mohyla, Marek/S-2215-2016; Martinkauppi, Birgitta/H-5377-2012	Martinkauppi, Birgitta/0000-0001-9779-6284; Hrubesova, Eva/0000-0003-0981-8354; 													0960-1481	1879-0682				FEB	2024	221								119770	10.1016/j.renene.2023.119770	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2023.119770		DEC 2023											WOS:001133110100001

Here, we describe an experiment in which cysts of A. franciscana from the San Francisco Bay (SFB), California, U.S.A., were inoculated into experimental ponds in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam where water temperatures are much higher than the SFB. Cysts produced in each of three successive growing seasons (1996-1998) were collected and examined in the laboratory for resistance to high temperature and relative contents of three stress proteins (Hsp-70, artemin and p26). Thermal adaptation took place rapidly, during the first growing season. The increase in thermal tolerance was reflected in an overall increase in stress protein content, compared to SFB cysts used for the initial inoculation. Also examined were cysts of A. tibetiana collected from a lake on the high plateau of Tibet, PR China, almost 4.5 km above sea level. These cysts were very sensitive to high temperatures, and contained much lower levels of all stress proteins examined, compared to A. franciscana cysts from SFB and Vietnam. Cysts of A. sinica, collected from a hypersaline lake in Inner Mongolia, PR China, were examined in the same fashion and found to be similar to SFB cysts in terms of thermal resistance and stress protein content. The harsh environments in which Artemia are found, and the great diversity of its habitats, world-wide, provide excellent opportunities to relate the ecological setting of an organism to the underlying physiological and biochemical processes enabling its survival.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				DEC	2001	466	1-3					221	229		10.1023/A:1014580612237	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1014580612237													WOS:000174354200020

Ecological niche modeling of diploid flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus L.) in the United States	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus L.) is an invasive perennial monocot found along the United States (U.S.).-Canadian border which can grow into large monotypic mats that can cause water use issues. Currently, there are two known cytotypes, diploid and triploid, within the invaded range; however, basic ecological research is lacking on the diploid cytotype. Ecological niche modelling (ENM) was done on three known populations of the diploid cytotype, alongside a global site model, to determine site-specific abiotic influences and potential suitability within the U.S. The ENM was constructed using climatic and soil variables from public sources with resultant models compared to currently known populations of flowering rush throughout the U.S. Diploid flowering rush populations and the global site models were highly reliant on precipitation in the driest month (27-39% model contribution) and one site was highly reliant on precipitation seasonality (38% model contribution). Diploid flowering rush populations in this study displayed different responses towards abiotic factors; however, seasonal signaling of precipitation patterns are highly important. Furthermore, diploid flowering rush is predicted to invade numerous areas with less than suitable habitat which should warrant further monitoring to prevent further spread.

Impacts of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum on water quality and the algal community in catfish aquaculture ponds	AQUACULTURE												Catfish aquaculture ponds are at high risk of experiencing excessive algal growth, especially cyanobacteria, that can lead to negative water quality issues due to their consistent input through regular feedings and internal cycling of nutrients. Conventional algaecides used in aquaculture, such as copper sulfate, may be effective in the short-term but can potentially lead to developed resistance in phytoplankton over time or harmf u l effects on non-target species. An alternative nutrient management strategy, which has traditionally been used in land-based agriculture, is via flue gas desulfurization (FGD) gypsum, a form of calciu m sulfate that is created as a by-product of carbon-based energy sources. A six-month fiel d experiment was conducted on active catfish aqua-culture ponds at a farm in west Alabama to test the effects of FGD gypsu m on water quality, including its abilit y to manage excessive algal blooms throughout the growing season . In stark contrast to previous results from FGD gypsum application in eutrophic waters, it was discovered that FGD gypsum-treated ponds experienced a large increase in soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) that led to a spike in phytoplankton abundance, specifically cyanobacteria. Supplementary microcosm experiments aided in determining that FGD gypsu m could extract legacy phosphorus out of the nutrient-rich flocculant sediment found in aquaculture ponds. While these results were unexpected and ultimately undesired, we did discover that the use of FGD gypsu m at the 500 mg/L con-centration does not produce any trace metal contamination in the water column or in the fish tissue. Overall, this experiment discovered new results that FGD gypsu m could produce when used in hypereutrophic waters with nutrient-rich sediments and provides the foundation for futu r e research directions to determine the specific mechanisms behind the interaction of FGD gypsum with the sediment.					; Wang, Dengjun/AAP-4679-2021; Torbert, Henry/AAE-5909-2021	Hennessey, Ashley/0009-0008-9028-5738; McDonald, Michael/0000-0002-8656-7977; 													0044-8486	1873-5622				FEB 25	2024	581								740406	10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.740406	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.740406		DEC 2023											WOS:001137267200001

Carbon limitation and aluminium toxicity prevents dominance of Crassula helmsii on weakly buffered soils	AQUATIC BOTANY												Invasions of the aquatic weed Crassula helmsii pose a serious threat to native vegetation of soft water lakes, which increases the need for understanding the factors that regulate the success or failure of C. helmsii. Creating favorable conditions for native species seems promising to control C. helmsii, as previous research indicated that C. helmsii is a poor (root) competitor. We studied the development of C. helmsii growing together with the native Littorella uniflora (biomass, cover, tissue nutrient composition) at two different calcareous poor soil types (organic/acid, mineral/buffered) and under two different water tables (not inundated, submerged) in a greenhouse experiment. We found that when growing under submerged conditions, C. helmsii coexisted with L. uniflora and other native species without becoming dominant due to carbon limitation in the water layer. In contrast, we found that C. helmsii can easily become dominant over L. uniflora when growing on desiccated buffered fen soils with moderate nutrient availability. On the acidic/organic soils, C. helmsii development was poor and die-off was observed under both water level treatments, probably induced due to aluminum toxicity under a low acidity. These results indicate that creating oligotrophic and carbon-poor conditions are required for controlling C. helmsii. Restoration measures can preferably be taken before the onset of the rainy season and/or be followed by maintenance of a temporal artificial high water table to stimulate carbon limitation. Liming more or less organic shores could alleviate aluminum toxicity under acidic conditions which can potentially stimulate the development of C. helmsii.					; Smolders, Alfons/H-2583-2012; Lucassen, Esther/H-8992-2012	van Doorn, Jelmer/0000-0002-4966-1593; 													0304-3770	1879-1522				MAR	2024	191								103737	10.1016/j.aquabot.2023.103737	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2023.103737		DEC 2023											WOS:001134896700001
J	Lindström, ES				Lindström, ES			Bacterioplankton community composition in a boreal forest lake	FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY												The composition of the dominating populations within a bacterioplankton community was investigated in a mesotrophic, boreal forest lake. Composite samples were collected monthly throughout the lake for two years. The community composition was determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified part of 16S rDNA, extracted from organisms smaller than 1 mu m. Temporal patterns of occurrence in the lake differed among populations. There was no clear seasonal pattern of variation, but there was a gradual change. The results suggest that variation in the amount of water flowing into the lake could explain some of the changes in the bacterioplankton community.

J	Roden, DB; Mattson, WJ				Roden, David B.; Mattson, William J.			Rapid induced resistance and host species effects on gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.):: Implications for outbreaks on three tree species in the boreal forest	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Field pupal weight. development time, and survival of gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), larvae on three defoliated (50%) and undefoliated tree species that are common to the forest of the Great Lakes basin were compared for one season in 1988. Host species and defoliation affected female pupal weight; male pupal weight was affected only by host species. The smallest and largest pupae of both sexes, from both defoliated and undefoliated trees. came from larvae that fed on red oak, Quercus rubra L., and trembling aspen, Populus tremuloides Michx., respectively; pupal weight of larvae that fed on white birch, Betula papyrifera Marsh., were intermediate. Development time was affected only by tree species; the shortest and longest development occurred on trembling aspen and red oak, respectively; development time on white birch was medial. Gypsy moth survival was not affected by defoliation or host species. Superficially, these data obviously suggest that both defoliated and undefoliated trembling aspen and white birch are more nutritious, and will support higher gypsy moth fitness than its traditional hosts like red oak. However, we argue that outbreaks of gypsy moth will not occur in aspen and birch stands because its tri-trophic fitness is lower there due in part to the higher efficacy of certain gypsy moth natural enemies. We hypothesize that outbreaks on these two tree species will be limited by the nuclear polyhedrosis virus, Entomophagus maimaiga, and key physical features (e.g. light trunk color) of the host that deter larval host-seeking/accepting behavior. More than 20 years of gypsy moth outbreak records in North America support this hypothesis. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The watersheds of Laguna Viscachani (16 degrees 12'S, 68 degrees 07'W, 3780 m) and Lago Taypi Chaka Kkota (16 degrees 13'S, 68 degrees 21'W, 4300 m), located on the eastern and western slopes of the Cordillera Real, respectively, contain small cirque glaciers, A high-resolution chronology of the lake sediments is provided by 23 AMS C-14 dates of discrete macrofossils. Late Pleistocene glaciers retreated rapidly, exposing the lake basins between 10,700 and 9700 C-14 yr B.P. The sedimentary facies suggest that after 8900 C-14 Yr B.P. glaciers were absent from the watersheds and remained so during the middle Holocene. An increase in the precipitation-evaporation balance is indicated above unconformities dated to similar to 2300 C-14 yr B.P. in both Lago Taypi Chaka Kkota and Laguna Viscachani. An abrupt increase in sediment accumulation rates after 1400 C-14 yr B.P. signals the onset of Neoglaciation. A possible link exists between the observed millennial-scale shifts in the regional precipitation-evaporation balance and seasonal shifts in tropical insolation.

Since ancient times, it has inspired numerous myths and legends due to the occurrence of singular phenomena, such as coloring events. Only recently has an explanation been found for them, i.e., the recurring color change over time is due to the alternation of cyanobacterial blooms that are a consequence of natural nutrient inputs as well as pollution resulting from human activities. This current report specifically describes the red coloring event that occurred on Lake Avernus in March 2022, the springtime season in this region of Italy. Our innovative multidisciplinary approach, the 'Fast Detection Strategy' (FDS), was devised to monitor cyanobacterial blooms and their toxins. It integrates remote sensing data from satellites and drones, on-site sampling, and analytical/bioinformatics analyses into a cohesive information flow. Thanks to FDS, we determined that the red color was attributable to a bloom of Planktothrix rubescens, a toxin-producing cyanobacterium. Here, we report the detection and identification of 14 anabenopeptins from this P. rubescens strain, seven of which are known and seven are newly reported herein. Moreover, we explored the mechanisms and causes behind this cyclic phenomenon, confirming cyanobacteria's role as reliable indicators of environmental changes. This investigation further validates FDS's effectiveness in detecting and characterizing cyanobacterial blooms and their associated toxins, expanding its potential applications.					; Costantino, Valeria/AAN-1960-2020; Lega, Massimiliano/C-8407-2011; Glukhov, Evgenia/ABB-2769-2020; Esposito, Germana/ABF-6241-2020; Teta, Roberta/C-8359-2011	Gerwick, William/0000-0003-1403-4458; Costantino, Valeria/0000-0001-8723-9505; Glukhov, Evgenia/0000-0001-6513-9909; Lega, Massimiliano/0000-0002-4842-6049; ESPOSITO, Germana/0000-0001-9619-7511; 														2072-6651				DEC	2023	15	12							698	10.3390/toxins15120698	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/toxins15120698								38133202					WOS:001130643800001
J	Fang, KY; Wu, CY; Chen, HD				Fang, Keyue; Wu, Chengyou; Chen, Hongdu			The Influences and Effect Mechanism of Low Temperature Curing on the Performances of Basic Magnesium Sulfate Cement	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED CONCRETE TECHNOLOGY												Due to lightweight, high-strength, and high toughness properties, Basic magnesium sulfate cement (BMSC) can be widely used in producing various structural and decorative products. Most current research only focuses on the performance of BMSC under room temperature. However, low temperature environments may have a serious impact on the performance of BMSC, such as during cold seasons or in salt lake cold regions with abundant magnesium resources, so the performance of BMSC in low temperature environment needs to be explored to expand its application. This study investigated the influence of different low temperatures (-5 to 20 degrees C) on the compressive strength and water resistance of BMSC cement. The phase composition, microstructure and pore structure of BMSC has been analyzed using XRD, QXRD, TG/DTA, SEM, BSEM/EDS Mapping and MIP. The Results indicate that the low hydration rate, precipitation of magnesium sulfate, increase in porosity and decrease in 517 phase content are the main reasons for the low strength of BMSC under low temperature curing. Although hardened BMSCs cured at low temperatures can continue to hydrate in water to form strength phases, corrosion and cracking may occur. Replacing light burned magnesite with high active magnesium oxide can significantly improve the mechanical properties of low temperature cured BMSC. However, low temperatures reduced the crystallinity of the 517 phase, thereby increasing its water solubility and lead to poor water resistance of BMSC.																			1346-8014	1347-3913				DEC	2023	21	12					995	1007		10.3151/jact.21.995	http://dx.doi.org/10.3151/jact.21.995													WOS:001137158000001

Salinity Tolerance and Seasonal and Multiyear Dynamics of Biting Midges (Diptera, Ceratopogonidae) in Macrozoobenthos Communities of Saline Rivers (the Lake Elton Basin, Russia)	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												The results of long-term studies of biting midges (Diptera, Ceratopogonidae) in macrozoobenthos communities of five saline rivers of the hyperhaline Lake Elton basin are presented. The fauna of Ceratopogonidae includes five halophilic and euryhaline species, among which representatives of the tribe Sphaeromiini predominate. The taxonomic composition of the family differs in rivers with different levels of salinity. Species Sphaeromias miricornis and Culicoides riethi are widely distributed in the mesohaline Khara, Lantsug, and Bolshaya Samoroda rivers, and Palpomyia schmidti is widely distributed in the polyhaline Chernavka and Solyanka rivers. Two generations of S. miricornis and three generations of P. schmidti are recorded. The emergence of the first generation of P. schmidti occurs in mid-May; S. miricornis emerges in late May to early June. There is an increase in the mean annual abundance and biomass of biting midges in polyhaline rivers when compared with mesohaline rivers.																			1995-0829	1995-0837				DEC	2023	16	6					1088	1097		10.1134/S199508292306010X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S199508292306010X													WOS:001126976700011

Phytoplankton Diversity and Blooms in Ephemeral Saline Lakes of Cyprus	DIVERSITY-BASEL												The ephemeral saline lakes of Cyprus in the Mediterranean, situated in close proximity to each other, demonstrate pronounced seasonal and interannual fluctuations in their environmental conditions. Despite their extreme saline conditions, these lakes support phytoplankton diversity and bloom-forming species. Anthropogenic activities, particularly urban and artificial land uses within their catchments, contribute to eutrophication, warranting conservation attention within the context of European legislation. Over two years (2018-2019), we examined phytoplankton abundance and diversity alongside salinity in six lakes, with samples collected every three weeks. Chlorophytes were the dominant and most diverse group, followed by cyanobacteria and diatoms. Increasing salinity correlated with reduced compositional diversity and species richness. The proximity of lakes to each other suggested airborne microbe colonization from one lake to another as a significant factor in shaping these communities, while similar land use within each lake's catchment impacted bloom formation. The highly halotolerant chlorophyte Dunaliella frequently dominated phytoplankton blooms, occasionally coexisting with other taxa in less saline lakes. Our findings provide insight into the phytoplankton community dynamics in temporal saline lakes, essential for developing effective conservation strategies and sustainable management practices.

The objective of this work was to study the influence of the discharge of sewage effluents from Chascomus city on the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the Girado stream and its connection with Chascomus lake and analyze the impact on fish biodiversity. Four sites were selected to measure DO and temperature weekly for one year: discharge of sewage effluent, union of the sewage effluent with the Girado stream, Girado stream and Chascomus lake. Also, ichthyological samplings were carried out in a presumed hypoxic zone and a normoxic zone of the Girado stream. The results showed that there were two hypoxic zones corresponding to the sewage effluent and the union of the effluent with the Girado stream (similar to 3 mg l-(1)). Also, two normoxic zones were identified, the course of the Girado stream and the union with Chascomus lake (similar to 8 mg l(-1)). In these areas the water temperature varied according to the seasonality of the region (from 10 to 30 degrees C) without differences between zones. It is important to note that these areas received a constant flow of sewage effluent from Chascomus city (similar to 885,600 l per day). In the fish sampling carried out in the 4 seasons of the year, 14 typical species of the Pampas lakes were captured with species more tolerant to low DO. Pejerrey were captured in a small number in both sites but with no signs of abnormalities in the gonads.

Spatial and Temporal Variation in the Fish Diversity in Dianchi Lake and the Influencing Factors	WATER												The survey of fish diversity is an important part of the protection of the ecological health of rivers and lakes. Environmental DNA technology is a new tool to improve the accuracy of traditional morphological surveys of biodiversity and to monitor the amount of diversity. At present, there are few studies on monitoring fish diversity in lake inlets using eDNA technology. In this study, we used various types of estuaries in the Dianchi basin as the research object, used environmental DNA technology to monitor the fish diversity in typical estuaries, and analyzed the temporal and spatial changes and the relationship between environmental factors and fish diversity. In the Dianchi basin, we identified a total of 63 fish species belonging to 8 different orders, 21 families, and 51 genera across two seasons. The Carpidae family had the highest number of species, with Carassius auratus being the most prevalent species. The Shannon index analysis yielded a p-value of 0.0018 (<0.05), suggesting significant seasonal variations in the fish community structure within the typical estuaries of the Dianchi basin. Furthermore, the beta-diversity accounted for 59.6% and 57% of the variations in fish communities among the various estuary types in March and July, respectively. Fish species varied considerably between estuaries, with Carassius auratus, Cyprinus carpio, Rhodeus sinensis, Acheilognathus chankaensis, and Coilia nasus all occurring at various points. The agricultural estuary differed substantially from the urban, suburban, and lake areas. Redundancy analysis revealed that the fish community structure during the dry period was primarily influenced by total phosphorus, pH, total nitrogen (TN), and chlorophyll. Conversely, during the rich period, the fish community structure was mainly influenced by dissolved oxygen and TN. This study demonstrated the utilization of environmental DNA technology in assessing the ecological health of rivers and lakes, specifically highlighting its effectiveness in exposing the ecological condition of a representative Dianchi estuary.

Grain size, geochemistry and organic pollutants in modern fluvial deposits in eastern Moravia (Czech Republic)	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES												Modern fluvial deposits from both small and large rivers were studied at 14 monitoring sites over 2 years (4 successive sampling seasons) in the area of eastern Moravia (Czech Republic). Grain size, geochemistry, content of persistent organic pollutants (PAHs, PCBs, HCHs, DDTs, HCBs and PeCB) and TOC were examined with the aim to understand their mutual relations and seasonal variations in sediment character and pollutant content. Sand and silt fraction predominate and the clay content is relatively low. Differences in provenance for various river systems were recognised. Both regional and seasonal variations in terms of content of persistent organic pollutants were documented. The content of TOC and mud was shown to play an important role in the accumulation of chlorinated persistent organic pollutants PCBs, HCHs, DDTs and HCB.

The model relies upon a contaminant mass balance budget for each biological species. Biological processes determine the extent of bioaccumulation: respiration and feeding rates control the uptake of contaminants whereas excretion, spawning, and growth act on the chemicals removal. A step-by-step modelling approach was followed. A first version was a steady-state model validated for the bioaccumulation processes. In the second version seasonal variation was taken into account, and finally in the third version, the model was coupled with a population dynamics model to describe PCB contamination in each age class.

J	Guimaraes, JRD; Meili, M; Malm, O; Brito, EMD				Guimaraes, JRD; Meili, M; Malm, O; Brito, EMD			Hg methylation in sediments and floating meadows of a tropical lake in the Pantanal floodplain, Brazil	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Potential net Hg-203 methylation was assayed in different substrates and conditions in Fazenda Ipiranga Lake, 30 km downstream from gold mining fields near Pocone, Pantanal, Brazil, during the dry season. Samples and acidified controls of surface sediments and roots of dominant floating macrophytes (Eichhornia azurea Salvinia sp.) were incubated in situ for 3 days with approx 43 ng Hg.g(-1) (dry weight), added as (HgCl2)-Hg-203. Methylmercury ((MeHg)-Hg-203) was extracted in toluene and measured by beta counting. Net methylation was about 1% in sediments under floating macrophytes, both at an open lake site and at a littoral site. Parallel incubations of sulphate or molybdate amended samples suggest that sulphate reducing bacteria may be important Hg methylators at both sites, and that their activity is sulphate-limited in particular at the littoral site. In laboratory experiments, net methylation in the same sediments was highest at temperatures in the 33-45 degrees C range but was completely inhibited at 55 degrees C. NaCl addition had a strong inhibiting effect on net methylation. In an intact open-lake sediment core, spiked with Hg-203 in the overlying water and incubated for 3 days, total Hg-203 was detectable down to a depth of 14-16 cm, coinciding with the depth reached by the galleries of chironomid larvae present in the core. Swimming insects caused Hg-203 penetration down to 4 cm. (MeHg)-Hg-203 was detected only in the upper layers (0-2 cm) of the sediment, with concentrations reaching 0.47-0.75% of total Hg. This suggests an important role for bioturbation in the exchange of Hg and MeHg between sediment and water. Methylation was up to nine times more intense in floating macrophyte roots than in the underlying surface sediments: an average of 10.4% of added Hg was methylated in samples of Salvinia sp. roots during the 3-day incubation, and 6.5% in E. azurea roots. This adds to previous findings on the role of such macrophyte stands, a distinctive feature of tropical rivers and lakes, as potentially important sites for the production of highly available MeHg.

In 1993-94, mean total Hg concentration (mug/g, wet weight) in 39 wild mink and 12 river otter carcasses was greatest in fur/hair samples (30.1 and 20.7 mug/g, respectively) and least in brain samples (0.96 and 0.8 mug/g, respectively) with liver, kidney, and muscle samples showing intermediate values. Pooling data from the 1993-94 and 1994-95 trapping seasons revealed mean (SD) liver total Hg concentrations of 3.71 mug/g (3.91) in 316 wild mink carcasses and 4.05 mug/g (3.41) in 153 river otter carcasses. Log liver total Hg concentration increased with age in wild mink but not in river otter. Log liver total Hg concentration in each species was greatest in areas with moraine deposits and least in areas with rich clay deposits, but the effect of soil deposits could be confounded by uneven deposition of anthropogenic Hg. Controlling for type of soil deposits, log liver total Hg concentration decreased with increasing distance from local industrial centers in each species but varied little with changes in distance from hydroelectric reservoirs. In a subsample of carcasses from the moraine sector, log liver total Hg concentration was higher in wild mink than in river otter. Spatial variation in log liver total Hg concentration in relation to soil deposit type and proximity to industrial centers suggests that the two wild furbearer species could be useful indicators of environmental contamination.

J	Ridal, J; Brownlee, B; McKenna, G; Levac, N				Ridal, J; Brownlee, B; McKenna, G; Levac, N			Removal of taste and odour compounds by conventional granular activated carbon filtration	WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA												In recent years, musty-earthy tastes in drinking water have become a seasonal problem (September to November) for communities that draw their water from the upper St. Lawrence River. The source of the problem is attributed to the presence of geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) at concentrations ranging from 5 to 60 ng/L. In 1997 and 1998, the Cornwall Water Purification Plant added granular activated carbon (GAG) to conventional gravity filters to control taste and odour compounds. We report on a study to test the efficiency of these conventional GAG-capped filters to reduce geosmin and MIB concentrations in finished water as a function of filter age, initial chlorine residual and contact time. GAG-capped filters removed on average 60% of the MIB and 80% of the geosmin from the source water after 2 and 12 months of filter operation. However, testing after 24 months operation showed reduced efficiency. Amounts removed ranged between 13 and 20% (15% average) for MIB and 50 to 57% (54% average) for geosmin in these filters. Testing also suggested that filter efficiency was greater with longer contact times and with higher chlorine residuals (in the range 0.1 to 0.6 mg free Cl-2/L). In addition to carbon age, chlorine residual and contact time, flow channelization and slow release of the taste and odour compound load (particularly MIB) from the GAC bed may affect apparent filter efficiency.																			1201-3080						2001	36	1					43	54		10.2166/wqrj.2001.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wqrj.2001.003													WOS:000166952900003

The relationship between algae growth and environmental factors is analyzed. This relationship has practical significance and guiding value for Nansi Lake, it helps to prevent the outbreaks of water bloom effectively and ensure the stable development of economy, society and environment in the regions covered with the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. It is established that the use of the new channel of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal causes the following variations in the lake water: water temperature increases, while the values of pH, TP, and TN decrease. Besides, the content of Fe2+ in water depends on regional and seasonal peculiarities; the trend towards the stabilization of SiO32 is observed. The new channel construction led to variations in chlorophyll-a content mainly due to changed water temperature and pH. Besides, riverbed digging and intense ship traffic also affect water characteristics.					; GAO, YUAN/W-9920-2019	Gao, Yuan/0000-0001-8018-058X; 													1068-3739	1934-8096				NOV	2016	41	11-12					822	827		10.3103/S106837391611011X	http://dx.doi.org/10.3103/S106837391611011X													WOS:000397339100011

It appears to have formed as a cryptodepression on karstified carbonate rocks, and is filled with fresh water. It is classified as an oligotrophic hydrosystem and serves as a natural water supply reservoir (max. depth 74.5 m; surface area 5.5 km(2); water volume 220 x 10(6) m(3)). The aim of this study was to assess the influence of seasonally and spatially varying ecological conditions (i.e., thermal stratification, dissolved oxygen, orthophosphate and chlorophyll a concentrations) on the vertical distribution of the rotifer plankton community in this geomorphologically and hydrologically specific coastal lake. The rotifer community was surveyed monthly over a one year period. During the study period, a total of 21 rotifer taxa were identified. Among them Ascomorpha spp. (including A. ecaudis, A. ovalis and A. saltans), Filinia terminalis, Keratella cochlearis, Synchaeta gr. tremula-oblonga and Polyarthra vulgaris prevailed, representing 92% of the total rotifer abundance. Measured seasonal and spatial patterns of the rotifer assemblage along a vertical profile of Vrana Lake were considerably affected by temperature, food availability and biotic (competition, predation) interactions in the zooplankton community.					; Spoljar, Maria/AAZ-8174-2020	Spoljar, Maria/0000-0003-1006-8300; Sertic Peric, Mirela/0000-0002-4744-7884													0006-3088	1336-9563				FEB	2011	66	1					130	137		10.2478/s11756-010-0144-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-010-0144-1													WOS:000285924600017

Despite suggesting small differences (similar to0.5 to 1parts per thousand) in the delta(15)N of different phytoplankton taxa on one occasion, the size fractionation procedure generally proved inadequate in separating major taxonomic groups composing seston. This circumstance, and phase-shifts in the transmission of rapid changes ( >2parts per thousand) in seston delta(15)N to mesozooplankton complicate the calculation of mesozooplankton trophic levels.																			0142-7873					APR	2004	26	4					495	500		10.1093/plankt/fbh048	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/fbh048													WOS:000220897300010

It features a maar known as Laguna Fragatas, which is classified as a meromictic thalassohaline lake. The constant deposition of guano in this maar results in increased levels of phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon. The aim of this study was to utilize high-quality genomes from the genus Halomonas found in specialized databases as a reference for genome mining of moderately halophilic bacteria isolated from Laguna Fragatas. This research involved genomic comparisons employing phylogenetic, pangenomic, and metabolic-inference approaches.Results The Halomonas genus exhibited a large open pangenome, but several genes associated with salt metabolism and homeostatic regulation (ectABC and betABC), nitrogen intake through nitrate and nitrite transporters (nasA, and narGI), and phosphorus uptake (pstABCS) were shared among the Halomonas isolates.Conclusions The isolated bacteria demonstrate consistent adaptation to high salt concentrations, and their nitrogen and phosphorus uptake mechanisms are highly optimized. This optimization is expected in an extremophile environment characterized by minimal disturbances or abrupt seasonal variations. The primary significance of this study lies in the dearth of genomic information available for this saline and low-disturbance environment. This makes it important for ecosystem conservation and enabling an exploration of its biotechnological potential. Additionally, the study presents the first two draft genomes of H. janggokensis.

Sea level variations in El-Burullus new harbour, Egypt	ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES												El-Burullus new harbour is one of the newly established harbours in the Nile Delta region along the Egyptian Mediterranean coast. It has been mainly developed to serve the fishermen community in El-Burullus region. The Harbour lies within the territory of Lake Burullus in the Nile Delta, which is one of the well-known low-elevated coastal zones in the Mediterranean basin. The present work provides a comprehensive sea level analysis including different terms and useful information, which can be used for the mitigation plans and protection measures in the vicinity of the Harbour, and contribute in our understanding of the nature of the sea level variations in front of the Nile Delta. The study is based on hourly data of sea level over 6 years from January 2003 to December 2008. The results revealed that tides in El-Burullus new harbour region are of semidiurnal type, the sea level variations are of seasonal behaviour, and the mean annual level is of increasing trend. The impact of the meteorological factors on the observed sea level in the Harbour is almost twice that of the astronomical factors. No extreme sea level year appeared at El-Burullus new harbour during the study period. The return periods and the design lifetime risk were calculated; in order to reasonably mitigate and secure coastal structures in the territory of the Harbour. Over the study period, the highest probabilities of occurrence were concentrated in the levels between 0.40 and 0.85 m, while the lowest were above the level of 0.90 m. While the return periods for the 0.45 m and 0.50 m were similar to 64 and 20 years, respectively, they were 11, 29 and similar to 78 years for the 0.80 m, 0.85 m and 0.90 m levels, respectively.

In this work, we exploit the potentials of both radar and optical images for satellite-based quick detection and extent mapping of inundations/water raising events over Shkoder area, which occurred in the two last years (2017-2018). For instance, in March 2018 the Shkoder district (North Albania) was affected twice by the overflow of the Drin and Buna (Bojana) Rivers and by the Shkoder lake plain inundation. Sentinel-1 radar data allowed a rapid mapping of seasonal fluctuations and provided flood extent maps by discriminating water surfaces (permanent water and flood areas) from land/non-flood areas over all the informal zones of Shkoder city. By means of Sentinel-2 data, two color composites maps were produced and the Normalized Difference Water Index was estimated, in order to further distinguish water/moisturized soil surfaces from built-up and vegetated areas. The obtained remote sensing-based maps were combined and discussed with the urban planning framework in order to support a sustainable urban and environmental management. The provided multi-temporal analysis could be easily exploited by the local authorities for flood prevention and management purposes in the inherited territorial context. The proposed approach outputs were validated by comparing them with official Copernicus EMS (Emergency Management Service) maps available for one of the chosen events. The comparison shows good accordance results. As for a further enhancement in the future perspective, it is worth to highlight that a more accurate result could be obtained by performing a post-processing edit to further refine the flooded areas, such as water mask application and supervised classification to filter out isolated flood elements, to remove possible water-lookalikes and weed out false positives.

We assessed re-infection after a single dose of triclabendazole with fascioliasis in cattle in a mobile pastoralist setting towards the end of the dry season. Within the cattle herds of 14 groups of mobile pastoralists, 375 cattle were randomly selected. A faecal sample was obtained from each animal to determine the prevalence of F. gigantica. Animals were administered a single oral dose of triclabendazole (12 mg/kg). A second faecal sample was obtained 6-month post-treatment after cattle had returned from the annual migration cycle. Faecal samples were fixed in sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin (SAF), and examined for F. gigantica using the sedimentation technique. From the 375 cattle enrolled at baseline, 198 animals (53%) in 12 groups of mobile pastoralists were re-sampled at the 6-month follow-up. Baseline prevalence did not differ noteworthy between animals lost to follow-up and those re-examined. At baseline, bovine fascioliasis prevalence in cattle with follow-up data was 41.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 35.2-48.9%). At the 6-month post-treatment follow-up, the prevalence was 46.0% (95% CI 39.2-52.9%), ranging between 0% and 75% at the herd level. The mean faecal egg counts at the unit of the herd were higher at follow-up compared to baseline. The observed persistent high prevalence of F. gigantica infection in cattle shows that a single pre-rainy season treatment does not prevent rapid re-infection despite the partial migration away from the high-risk areas at Lake Chad into drier areas. A locally adapted strategic control package for fascioliasis in cattle in the Lake Chad area ought to integrate targeted triclabendazole treatment and seasonal transhumance practices.

Two varve time-series from freeze cores taken in the deepest part (66 m) of Baldeggersee have been analysed for annual and seasonal layers. The varve time-series covers the period of 1885 to 1993. The two freeze-cores from Baldeggersee can be accurately correlated by means of distinct lay ers (e.g. marker varves, turbidites), lithological units, and varve measurements. The Baldeggersee varve chronology has been checked by independent high-resolution Cs-137 dating. Mobility of cesium has not been detected in Baldeggersee. A highly positive correlation between phosphorus concentration in the lake water and median grain size of calcite crystals has been observed and allows, together with the results of geochemical analyses, to hindcast the trophic state in Baldeggersee for periods where no limnological data are available. The main features of the Baldeggersee varve time-series can be summarized as follows: before 1885 there are packets of 5-10 varves interrupted by massive, homogeneous marl beds, indicating oscillating hypolimnetic oxygen levels until the lake ultimately became anoxic in 1885. Between 1885 and 1905 varves are thin, with a high carbonate content. Between 1905 and 1910 the thickness of varves increased steadily, and an increase in calcite grain size suggests a major step in eutrophication. Median grain size values increase again at the end of the 1940s, whereas the thickness of the seasonal lavers decreased between the early 1940s and the early 1960s. At the onset of the 1960s, during the time of highest epilimnetic phosphorus concentrations in Baldeggersee, the total phosphorus concentrations in the sediments as well as the varve thickness and the total accumulation rates all increased. At the beginning of the 1980s the median grain size decreased substantially as a result of lower phosphorus concentrations in Baldeggersee.

Understanding hydrology and ecology of the lake and its tributaries is particularly important for the conservation of the Park's floodplain habitats and its biodiversity. There are concerns that hydrological boundary conditions and ecology of Lake Urema have changed in recent years. Possible causes for this change include climatic and land use changes as well as tectonic and geomorphological processes. In this study, a multi-temporal and multi-disciplinary approach was applied to investigate the dynamics and control mechanisms of Lake Urema. Principal methods comprised remote sensing analyses of time series of Landsat and ASTER data, geomorphological interpretations of a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) as well as field investigations such as analyses of water quality and sediment composition. The waters of Lake Urema have a low mineralization and pH values approximately neutral. The spatially dominant sediment type has a pure clay texture consisting of kaolinite and smectite. The sandy type consists of quartz, kali felspar, and plagioclase. The results of the supervised classifications for the satellite images from 1979 to 2000 showed that the lake's extent ranged between 17 km(2) (09/1995) and 25 km(2) (08/1979). Above average rainfall was responsible for the extreme lake size in May 1997 (104 km(2)). The interpretations of the Digital Terrain Model demonstrated that alluvial fans limit the Urema basin from all sides and make Lake Urema a form of "reservoir lake". The control mechanisms of the hydrological regime of Lake Urema, such as the contribution of groundwater, are not yet fully understood. The lake's condition during the rainy season was not investigated. In the future, investigations of the sources and amounts of sediment input into the lake should be conducted. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Results obtained in 1999 were compared with the first study period, of 1978. In the first period, 100 phytoplankton taxa were found and diatoms were the largest group of species (29% of all taxa), while in the second period 117 phytoplankton taxa were recorded and green algae dominated (50%). The mean phytoplankton biomass increased nearly 2-fold over the two decades and the trophic state index was higher in 1999.

J	Thomas, MF				Thomas, MF			Late Quaternary environmental changes and the alluvial record in humid tropical environments	QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL					1st Symposium on South American Paleohydrology	1997	CURITIBA, BRAZIL					Ice core and ocean-drilling records now confirm the evidence from lakes, rivers and mires, concerning temperature depression in the humid tropics during the LGM by at least 5 degrees C on land and this accords with the recent CCM1 model output. There is less agreement about fluctuation in precipitation amount, intensity and seasonality during the late Quaternary. Pollen records remain indeterminate because of the absence of sites in lowland rainforest locations and a widespread hiatus in sedimentation spanning the LGM. Alluvial sediments have often been ignored by specialists from other disciplines, bur they also provide a Valuable source of palaeoenvironmental information that reflects catchment-wide conditions. Current evidence shows that prolonged sedimentation took place in Stage 3 at sites in S America and SE Asia, and this was followed by incision. For up to 9 ka, spanning the LGM streams either produced little sediment or were characterised by braided channels and sometimes fan deposits, until the transition towards an interglacial mode took place after 12,700 BP (C-14). In many places, this transition was marked by large floods, incision and deposition of coarse sediment. But as the Holocene climates stabilised and fluctuations of runoff reduced in amplitude, so meandering rivers developed floodplains with thick overbank silts and clays. These changes have regional and intercontinental patterns, not everywhere identical in bracketing dates, but demonstrating major changes to the fluvial systems as a result of profound changes to the hydrology of forested tropics during the last 60 ka.

Spatial distributions of phytoplankton were simulated on two occasions: the first, when the population was dominated by dinoflagellates; and the second, when the population was dominated by cyanobacteria. Vertical motility of the dinoflagellate Ceratium hirundinella and buoyancy of the cyanobacteria Microcystis ssp. were estimated as functions of irradiance. Water velocity fields were estimated through solving the 3-D Navier-Stokes equations on a finite-volume, unstructured nonorthogonal grid. Simulated circulation patterns of water and phytoplankton were similar to those obtained through field observations. Near-surface drift currents were initiated by wind stress, which then generated return currents along the seasonal thermocline. Aggregations of motile Ceratium that existed near the thermocline were pushed upwind by the deep return currents and accumulated at upwelling areas. In contrast, near-surface aggregations of Microcystis were pushed downwind by the surface currents and accumulated at downwelling areas. Horizontal and vertical phytoplankton distributions resulted from the interaction between the vertical motility of the phytoplankton ( dependent upon the light environment) and the velocity vectors at the depths at which the phytoplankton accumulated ( dependent upon wind stress and morphometry). Modelling showed that phytoplankton motility and buoyancy greatly affect phytoplankton spatial distributions.

Population genomics of resource exploitation: insights from gene expression profiles of two Daphnia ecotypes fed alternate resources	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Consumer-resource interactions are a central issue in evolutionary and community ecology because they play important roles in selection and population regulation. Most consumers encounter resource variation at multiple scales, and respond through phenotypic plasticity in the short term or evolutionary divergence in the long term. The key traits for these responses may influence resource acquisition, assimilation, and/or allocation. To identify relevant candidate genes, we experimentally assayed genome-wide gene expression in pond and lake Daphnia ecotypes exposed to alternate resource environments. One was a simple, high-quality laboratory diet, Ankistrodesmus falcatus. The other was the complex natural seston from a large lake. In temporary ponds, Daphnia generally experience high-quality, abundant resources, whereas lakes provide low-quality, seasonally shifting resources that are chronically limiting. For both ecotypes, we used replicate clones drawn from a number of separate populations. Fourteen genes were differentially regulated with respect to resources, including genes involved in gut processes, resource allocation, and activities with no obvious connection to resource exploitation. Three genes were differentially regulated in both ecotypes; the others may play a role in ecological divergence. Genes clearly linked to gut processes include two peritrophic matrix proteins, a Niemann-Pick type C2 gene, and a chymotrypsin. A pancreatic lipase, an epoxide hydrolase, a neuroparsin, and an UDP-dependent glucuronyltransferase are potentially involved in resource allocation through effects on energy processing and storage or hormone pathways. We performed quantitative rt-PCR for eight genes in independent samples of three clones of each of the two ecotypes. Though these largely confirmed observed differential regulation, some genes' expression was highly variable among clones. Our results demonstrate the value of matching the level of biological replication in genome-wide assays to the question, as it gave us insight into ecotype-level responses at ecological and evolutionary scales despite substantial variation within ecotypes.

We compare observed consumption and growth rates with maximum consumption and growth rates to study the extent of resource limitation in young-of-the-year (YOY) roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis). Diet, habitat use, consumption rate and growth rate were measured under varying YOY fish densities over 2 years in four lakes. In the first year, YOY roach and perch were studied under allopatric conditions. Experimental addition of perch roe in the second year also allowed study of YOY of the two species under sympatric conditions in two of the lakes. The diet of YOY roach was dominated by cladoceran zooplankton and YOY roach habitat use was restricted to the shore region in both years. This restricted habitat use did not involve any cost in foraging gain in the first year as consumption and growth rates were very close to maximum rates. During the second year, when the two species coexisted, resources were limited in late season, more so in the littoral than in the pelagic habitat in one lake while the reverse was the case in the other lake. The diet of YOY perch was also dominated by zooplankton, and with increasing perch size the proportion of macroinvertebrate prey in the diet increased. After hatching, YOY perch first utilized the pelagic habitat restricting their habitat use to the shore after 1 to several weeks in the pelagic zone. During the larval period, perch were not resource limited whereas juvenile perch were resource limited in both years. The fact that YOY perch were more resource limited than YOY roach was related to the higher handling capacity and lower attack rate of perch relative to roach, rendering perch more prone to resource limitation. Estimates of resource limitation based on consumption rates and growth rates yielded similar results. This supports the adequacy of our approach to measure resource limitation and suggests that this method is useful for studying resource limitation in organisms with indeterminate growth. Our results support the view that density-dependent growth is rare in larval stages. We suggest that density-dependent growth was absent because larval perch and roach were feeding at maximum levels over a wide range of larvae densities.

The ubiquitous distribution of Campylobacter spp. in animal reservoirs and food products derived thereof make such vehicles primary risk factors in contracting campylobacteriosis. The contamination rates, identification of common pathogenic serotypes and extended survival of Campylobacter in surface waters illustrates the potential, but yet to be quantified, campylobacteriosis risk associated with untreated water. The existence and potential pathogenicity of viable but nonculturable forms of Campylobacter remains a contentious subject. Furthermore. the role of such forms in the epidemiology of Campylobacter related disease and their involvement in the large number of waterborne gastroenteritis outbreaks from which a disease agent cannot be isolated remains to be fully clarified. This article presents a survey of current perspectives with regard to the survival and epidemiology of Campylobacter spp. in natural water systems.

Gametogenesis and dynamics of the reproduction of Anodontites trapesialis (Lamarck) (Unionoida, Mycetopodidae) from baia do polo lake at the cuiaba river wetland, mato grosso, Brazil	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ZOOLOGIA												The reproductive cycle of Anodontites trapesialis was studied from May 1998 to April 1999. Quantitative analysis of the sexual cycle revealed that the species is exclusively hermaphrodite with separate male and female follicles. Gametogenesis is continuous with peaks of maturation and elimination of gametes during dry season. The period of maximum maturation of the oogenesis was in April and May, when mature oocytes were observed filling the follicles and gonoducts. Spermatogenesis was recognized by a proliferation phase with developing cells with period of maturation since April to July. These cells started to differentiate giving origin to spermatic morulae and free spermatozoa organizing the radial spermatic series. During the period of discharge of the gamets, the majority of follicles presented aggregates of spermatozoa forming the spermballs, which characterize the species as spermatozeugmata.

J	Gibson, JJ				Gibson, JJ			Forest-tundra water balance signals traced by isotopic enrichment in lakes	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												Enrichment of oxygen-18 and deuterium in surface waters is shown to be a useful indicator of water balance variations in remote, permafrost regions of northern Canada where hydroclimate monitoring networks are limited. Necessarily, such indicators must be applied with care as isotopic signals in each lake trace water balance and atmospheric conditions integrated over different time-periods and spatial areas, as determined by take water-residence time and catchment drainage area. Isotopic enrichment in large takes is found to be relatively stable in time, and. as interpreted in the context of steady-state models. will yield information more representative of regional climatological-scale processes. In contrast, seasonal isotopic enrichment in shallow takes, which occurs due to extreme seasonality of the northern climate and short water residence times, may be useful for estimating short-term 'point' evaporation rates.

The strength of water column stratification varies regionally, with a more stratified north and an upwelling-driven, biologically more productive south. Only little is known about whether such regional hydrodynamic regimes induce ecological or genetic differences among populations of highly mobile, pelagic fish inhabiting these different areas. Here, we examine whether the regional contrasts leave distinct isotopic imprints in the pelagic fish of Lake Tanganyika, which may reveal differences in diet or lipid content. We conducted two lake-wide campaigns during different seasons and collected physical, nutrient, chlorophyll, phytoplankton and zooplankton data. Additionally, we analyzed the pelagic fish-the clupeids Stolothrissa tanganicae, Limnothrissa miodon and four Lates species-for their isotopic and elemental carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) compositions. The delta 13C values were significantly higher in the productive south after the upwelling/mixing period across all trophic levels, implying that the fish have regional foraging grounds, and thus record these latitudinal isotope gradients. By combining our isotope data with previous genetic results showing little geographic structure, we demonstrate that the fish reside in a region for a season or longer. Between specimens from the north and south we found no strong evidence for varying trophic levels or lipid contents, based on their bulk delta 15N and C:N ratios. We suggest that the development of regional trophic or physiological differences may be inhibited by the lake-wide gene flow on the long term. Overall, our findings show that the pelagic fish species, despite not showing evidence for genetic structure at the basin scale, form regional stocks at the seasonal timescales. This implies that sustainable management strategies may consider adopting regional fishing quotas.

Lake Boeuf is a popular recreational fishing lake from which the following sunfish are caught and consumed: bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus); largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides); and black crappie (Poxomis nigromaculatus), Metals were extracted from the fish and sediment samples using microwave digestion techniques. The metal concentrations were quantified using standard flame atomic absorption spectroscopic methods. The concentrations of trace metals in fish did not vary significantly between species or weight of fish; however, a seasonal trend in metal concentration was observed. Concentrations of Cr varied from 2 to 15 mu g/g, Cu from 0.2 to 4 mu g/g, Pb from 0.5 to 9 mu g/g, and Zn from 10 to 20 mu g/g. Concentrations of the studied metals in the core samples did nor vary with depth in the core, suggesting that no pollutant metals have been input to the lake.

J	Letcher, PM; Powell, MJ				Letcher, PM; Powell, MJ			Distribution of zoosporic fungi in forest soils of the Blue Ridge and Appalachian Mountains of Virginia	MYCOLOGIA												Although uniflagellate zoosporic fungi and protists (here defined as Chytridiomycota and Hyphochytriomycota) are common in soil, little is known about the spatial scale and factors which correlate with distributional differences. We focused our study on soil uniflagellate zoosporic fungi and protists or their parasites, which were epibiotic degraders of pollen. To determine if similar, but separate forest habitats varied in species composition and frequency, we inventoried four sites, two in the Blue Ridge Mountains and two in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia. We devised a reliable sampling protocol, identifying numbers of samples and duration of sampling as parameters required to detect the maximum species diversity. Because we were seeking to recognize distributional patterns, we sampled species composition and frequency at all four sites over a 6-mo period to detect site specific differences. To find if more extensive sampling would reveal additional species diversity and potential annual frequency patterns, we sampled species composition over a 12-mo period at the site with the greatest species diversity. In these mountainous habitats, similar species composition was found in all four sites, even though the sites were separated by distance and/or a valley. total of 15 epibiotic, monocentric zoosporic fungi and protists were isolated, of which 11 were present at all 4 sites. Based on their frequency at individual sites, 5-7 species were ubiquitous, while the rest were common to rare. Mycographs based on species frequency from collections (pooled samples) portrayed general site similarity. Mycographs based on species frequency from individual samples best showed heterogeneity among the sites, and suggested differences in the pattern of distribution of species on a microscale. Sampling over 12-mo indicated that the common species were present regardless of seasonal changes. Our study demonstrated that the study sites were rich in species diversity. In addition, multiple samples from a site and repeated sampling through a 6-mo period were necessary to detect the maximum number of species. This study provides baseline data for future comparative studies of zoosporic fungal distribution from forest habitats.																			0027-5514	1557-2536				NOV-DEC	2001	93	6					1029	1041		10.2307/3761665	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3761665													WOS:000172558700001

Invasion of Bythotrephes longimanus and Cercopagis pengoi in Lake Champlain: Impacts on the Native Zooplankton Community	DIVERSITY-BASEL												The zooplankton community of Lake Champlain has been altered over the past decade due to the introduction of two predatory zooplankton species. Bythotrephes longimanus Leydig, 1860 was first detected in Lake Champlain in August 2014, and Cercopagis pengoi (Ostroumov, 1891) was detected in August 2018. Monitoring for both invasive species at 15 lake sites using whole water tow sampling has been ongoing since 2010 with no detection of either species until 2014. Utilizing data from the Lake Champlain long-term monitoring program, we assessed pre- and post-invasion population dynamics of both invasive species on the native zooplankton community. Our results showed shifts in community structure following invasion, including a reduction in Diacyclops thomasi (Forbes, 1882) populations by both invaders and a reduction in Daphnia retrocurva Forbes, 1882 following the introduction of B. longimanus. Other cyclopoids, bosminids, and rotifers were also reduced, corresponding to both introduced species. The native large-bodied plankton predator Leptodora kindtii (Focke, 1844) appears to be unable to coexist with either invasive predatory cladoceran, displaying seasonal partitioning between L. kindtii and the Cercopagidae. These findings suggest that the invasion of both large predators in Lake Champlain have impacted pelagic zooplankton community structure.

Habitat loss and change due to a lack of water threaten the biodiversity of shorebirds, with impacts likely to be most pronounced in arid lands. We collected the data of 144 nesting sites and 10 ecological factors during the breeding season from April to July each year in 2019 and 2020 in nine river districts in Xinjiang. The MaxEnt model was applied to assess the suitability of nesting habitats for Kentish plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus) in the study area to examine the main factors affecting their nesting habitat. The most suitable nesting habitats are mostly distributed in plain reservoirs in the middle part of the Northern Slope of the Tianshan Mountains, Ebinur Lake and its eastern position in the southwestern Junggar Basin, near Ulungur Lake of the Ulungur river area and the southern Irtysh river area. The distance from water, normalized difference vegetation index, mean temperature of the breeding season, slope, and land use were the main factors affecting the nesting habitat selection of Kentish plovers. It was found that the proportion of suitable nesting habitat protected for the Kentish plovers in the study area was low (851.66 km(2)), accounting for only 11.02% of the total suitable nesting habitat area. In view of the scarcity and importance of water bodies in arid lands and the lack of protection for Kentish plovers at present, it is suggested to strengthen the conservation and management of the regional shorebirds and their habitats by regulating and optimizing the allocation of water resources.

J	Wixson, TP; Cooley, D				Wixson, Troy P.; Cooley, Daniel			Attribution of Seasonal Wildfire Risk to Changes in Climate: A Statistical Extremes Approach	JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY												Wildfire risk is greatest during high winds after sustained periods of dry and hot conditions. This paper is a statistical extreme-event risk attribution study that aims to answer whether extreme wildfire seasons are more likely now than under past climate. This requires modeling temporal dependence at extreme levels. We propose the use of transformed-linear time series models, which are constructed similarly to traditional autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) models while having a dependence structure that is tied to a widely used framework for extremes (regular variation). We fit the models to the extreme values of the seasonally adjusted fire weather index (FWI) time series to capture the dependence in the upper tail for past and present climate. We simulate 10 000 fire seasons from each fitted model and compare the proportion of simulated high-risk fire seasons to quantify the increase in risk. Our method suggests that the risk of experiencing an extreme wildfire season in Grand Lake, Colorado, under current climate has increased dramatically relative to the risk under the climate of the mid-twentieth century. Our method also finds some evidence of increased risk of extreme wildfire seasons in Quincy, California, but large uncertainties do not allow us to reject a null hypothesis of no change.

J	Baastrup-Spohr, L; Staehr, PA				Baastrup-Spohr, Lars; Staehr, Peter Anton			Surface microlayers on temperate lowland lakes	HYDROBIOLOGIA												At the air-water interface material, organisms accumulate and form a thin layer of organic and inorganic material called the surface microlayer (SML). In order to investigate the development, composition, and metabolism of SML on lakes, samples were collected using a screen sampler along with subsurface water (SSW) in an eutrophic and a mesotrophic lake from April to September 2007. Wind, solar irradiance, and lake temperature were followed continuously. Samples were analyzed for organic and inorganic compounds as well as for photosynthesis and respiration. Most compounds were enriched in the SML relative to the SSW. Enrichment was small, however, probably because sampling was performed on nonslick areas. Most compounds correlated closely between the SML and the SSW, confirming the hypothesis that most SML material originates from the bulk water. Correlations were strongest in the eutrophic lake, probably because external sources had a greater effect on SML concentrations in the mesotrophic lake. Enrichment of compounds and metabolic rates in the SML had similar seasonality and dependency of climatic conditions in the two lakes, suggesting common regulating mechanisms of enrichment and production. Enrichment factors of several compounds were higher at low bulk water concentrations, suggesting that atmospheric deposition then contributed relatively more to concentrations in the SML. Increasing temperature significantly decreased SML enrichment of TOC (total organic carbon), related to changes in TOC composition and higher heterotrophic activity, while wind and solar irradiance had no pronounced enrichment effect on any compound. Net photosynthesis was significantly lower in the SML, experiencing photoinhibition in one-third of the samples. In contrast, respiration was much elevated in the SML. Nonetheless, respiration in the SML never contributed by more than 0.3% of water column respiration, but the combination of enhanced degradation rates of organic carbon in the SML and strong interaction with water below suggests that the SML, nonetheless, may play an important role in degradation of refractory organic carbon. Combining these results, we found that the SML of nonslicked areas on lakes are enriched in organic and inorganic pools and constitute a strong heterotrophic environment, albeit of minor importance for whole lake pelagic metabolism.

Microcystin-LR in Brazilian Aquaculture Production Systems	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The growth of aquaculture production systems, mostly the sport-fishing kind, coupled with a lack of control, brings about concerns on the quality of water and food produced. The current paper determines which factors may trigger the growth of cyanobacteria, with subsequent concentrations of microcystins in collected water samples, at the surface and in the water column, from 10 aquaculture systems, during the dry and rainy seasons. The above is undertaken by measurements of biotic (counting of Chlorophyceae, cyanobacteria, and microcystin-LR [MC-LR]) and abiotic (total nitrogen and total phosphorus) factors. Because the water from the 10 aquaculture production systems had MC-LR concentrations that were highly correlated with Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) biomass, most MC-LR microcystins were produced by this species. The MC-LR concentrations and M. aeruginosa counting were positively correlated with nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios and suggest that parameters may affect not only the M. aeruginosa biomass, but also MC-LR concentrations.

Hydrogeochemistry of sand pit lakes at Sepetiba basin, Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil	WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION												Four sand pit lakes, at the Rio de Janeiro Sand Mining District, were monitored from November 2003 to November 2005, in order to characterize their hydrogeochemistry aiming to provide information to their possible use as fishponds at the end of mining activities. The results show diluted waters (low electrical conductivity) with low pH (< 4) and relatively high sulfate and aluminum concentrations. The major water components (in particular Fe, Mn, SiO2, Al and SO4) are related to water acidity, since it controls solubility of aluminum silicate minerals and Mn and Fe oxides. Fe, Mn and Al availability in these waters are probably associated to organic colloids formation. On the other hand, the SiO2 content, as well as the decrease of sand mining in rainy season, may partially control Al availability by the formation of hydroxi-aluminum silicates. These geochemical processes together with the interruption of sand mining in the rainy season and the dilution of sand pit lakes water by rainwater can support the use of these pit lakes as fishpond for aquaculture.

The fish specimens were captured in the Futatsugawa river, northwestern Kyushu Island, Japan, between February 2007 and January 2008, and their gut contents were examined under a stereomicroscope. The gut contents of this exotic species comprised various prey animals, mainly fishes in most, of the seasons. The empty gut ratio was approximately 80% in several seasons and 100% during February and March. This exotic species showed high selectivity for Zacco spp., Pseudorasbora parva, Tanakia spp., and Rhodeus spp., which had large populations at the study sites. In contrast, this exotic species showed no selectivity for Carassius spp. that also had a large population. Acheilognathus spp. that had a small population at this study site showed high selectivity as prey by this exotic species. A. tabira, nakamurae, a native species, is listed as threatened in the Japanese Red Data Book. Native species with a small population and high prey selectivity were estimated to be the most negatively effected species by the internal invasion of the study site by this exotic species.																			0023-6152					OCT	2008	53	2					429	433																WOS:000261391100011
J	Waiser, MJ; Robarts, RD				Waiser, MJ; Robarts, RD			Net heterotrophy in productive prairie wetlands with high DOC concentrations	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Millions of productive wetlands dot the North American Great Plains. Although these wetlands are key ecological features of the Canadian prairies, their microbial food webs remain relatively unstudied. Over 3 yr, pelagic primary (PP) and bacterial production (BP) and biomass were monitored in 2 wetlands in Central Saskatchewan, Canada. PP ranged from 8.8 to 3911.0 mg C m-(3) d(-1) (x = 612.0 mg C m(-3) d(-1)), while rates of BP ranged from 8.2 to 678.0 mg C m(-3) d(-1) (x = 140.0 mg C m(-3) d(-1)). Nutrients, light and temperature did not appear as major factors influencing these rates. Seasonal mean ratios of PP:BP revealed that both wetlands were net autotrophic (xPP:BP = 7.4; range 0.08 to 42.6), which was not surprising given their eutrophic status. On a smaller temporal scale, these wetlands were, on average, net heterotrophic (PP:BP < 1) on 33% of the sampling dates. High pelagic bacterial carbon demand (greater than twice the phytoplankton carbon production) indicated that bacterial metabolism was not dependent on autochthonous carbon sources. Biological availability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was low in both wetlands (x = 3.8 %). But this percentage of high ambient concentrations was enough to satisfy bacterial carbon demand. Based on seasonal averages, BP and bacterial numbers decreased across increasing trophic gradients (as chl a or total phosphorus). This phenomenon could also be observed across a seasonal gradient of changing chl a concentrations. Prairie wetlands not only experience periods of net heterotrophy, but bacterial carbon demand and production per unit biomass are high, suggesting an important role for bacteria in the metabolism of these eutrophic ecosystems.																			0948-3055					MAR 9	2004	34	3					279	290		10.3354/ame034279	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame034279													WOS:000220502400007

Significantly lower (P<0.01) estimates of resting egg densities were obtained by monitoring emergence from incubated sediments than from egg counts, However, incubation of sediments did not require the ability to recognise species on the basis of egg morphology as did egg counts. Significantly higher (P < 0.01) densities of resting eggs were found in sediments from eutrophic Lake Okaro than from oligo-mesotrophic Lake Tikitapu. Incubation of sediments did not result in the emergence of all species found in the plankton during an earlier thirteen-month seasonal survey, including some common species. This currently limits the use of this method as a tool for rapid assessment of community composition. However, the method is likely to provide advantages over some traditional methods, such as vertical net hauls, by providing more complete species lists if only a single visit to a site is possible.

J	Basu, BK; Pick, FR				Basu, BK; Pick, FR			Phytoplankton and zooplankton development in a lowland, temperate river	JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH												The longitudinal and seasonal patterns of plankton development were examined over 2 years in a lowland, temperate river: the Rideau River (Ontario, Canada). Following an initial decrease in phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass as water flowed from the headwaters into the Rideau River proper, there was an increase in chlorophyll a (chi a) and zooplankton biomass with downstream travel. At approximately river km 60, both phytoplankton and zooplankton reached their maximum biomass of 27 mu g l(-1) (chi a) and 470 mu g l(-1) (dry mass), respectively. Downstream of river km 60, the biomass of both planktonic communities declined significantly despite increasing nutrient concentrations and favorable light conditions. These downstream declines may be due to the feeding activity of the exotic zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) which was at high density in downstream reaches (>1000 individuals m(-2)). There was no evidence for longitudinal phasing of phytoplankton and zooplankton, as increases and decreases in chi a and zooplankton biomass appeared to coincide. Overall, chi a was best predicted by total phosphorus (R(2) = 0.43), whereas zooplankton biomass was best predicted by chi a (R(2) = 0.20). There was no evidence for significant grazing effects of zooplankton on phytoplankton biomass.

We then used this estimate and age distribution data from Lake Etela-Konnevesi to illustrate how the sex ratio (females per one male) might decrease as the average age of spawners increases during a several-year-long period of recruitment failure.Methods: We estimated mortalities first from sex-specific age-ln(catch) curves and second from the average age-specific proportions of different sexes.Result: The estimate of the additional mortality of males was around 0.2-0.4, depending on the method of estimation, and assumed true proportions in the population at age 1 (two growing seasons), when Vendace reaches sexual maturity. When using the additional mortality estimate and age distribution data from Lake Etela-Konnevesi, the hypothetical sex ratio in the most extreme year was even as skewed as four females per one male.Conclusion: If the lack of males per female spawner during a population decline reduces the per capita recruitment success of females, this is a depensatory density-dependent effect, the Allee effect. This phenomenon may partly explain the rapid population collapses and contribute to 2-year cyclicity typical of the dynamics of Vendace populations.					; Karjalainen, Juha/B-4079-2015	Marjomaki, Timo J./0000-0002-0563-3099; Karjalainen, Juha/0000-0001-9302-1174													0002-8487	1548-8659				NOV	2023	152	6					711	725		10.1002/tafs.10435	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tafs.10435		OCT 2023											WOS:001089446300001
J	Fox, AD; Stipniece, A				Fox, Anthony D.; Stipniece, Antra			Interactions between stoneworts (Charales) and waterbirds	BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS												Stoneworts (Charales) are green algae that represent an important food resource for many waterbird species in Europe and elsewhere. Browsing avian herbivores (e.g. swan, goose, duck and coot species) consume Charales plant vegetative parts, by head-dipping, up-ending or diving. A lower fibre content and longer growing season may make Charales as attractive to such herbivores as sympatric submerged higher plant species in some circumstances. Charales respond to environmental stress (e.g. drought) by producing abundant diaspores, in the form of oospores (sexual) and bulbils (asexual), both rich in starch, generating abundant food for waterbirds at critical stages in their annual migratory cycles. Waterbirds feed on these by diving (e.g. common pochard Aythya ferina and red-crested pochard Netta rufina) or by filtering from the water column (e.g. dabbling duck species), ensuring dispersal of sexually produced and vegetative diaspores locally (because of predator swamping) and remotely (through endo- and ectozoochorous dispersal by long-distance migratory waterbirds). Greater invertebrate density and diversity associated with Charales canopies enhances their attractiveness over other submerged macrophyte beds to diving predators [e.g. tufted duck Aythya fuligula, common pochard and Eurasian coot Fulica atra (hereafter coot)]. Fish fry preying on these invertebrates use such vegetation as predator cover, in turn providing prey for avian piscivores such as grebes and cormorants. Abundant Charales contribute to maintaining a transparent water column due to canopy density, nutrient effects, dampening of sedimentation/remobilisation of suspended matter and nutrients and allelopathic effects on other plants (especially phytoplankton). Shallow, relatively eutrophic waters can flip between clear-water high-biodiversity (where Charales thrive) and turbid species-poor depauperate stable states (lacking Charales). Shifts between turbid conditions and rich submerged Charales beds have profound elevating effects on aquatic diversity, to which waterbirds show rapid aggregative responses, making them ideal indicator species of ecological change; in the case of Charales specialists (such as red-crested and common pochard), indicators of the presence and abundance of these plants. Large-bodied colonial nesting birds (e.g. cormorants, gulls, heron and egrets) aggregating along lake shores contribute high N and P loadings to water bodies sensitive to such external and internal inputs and can cause local eutrophication and potential loss of Charales. Despite variation from complete seasonal removal of Charales biomass to undetectable grazing effects by herbivorous birds, evidence suggests little effect of avian grazing on biomass accumulation or the stability of community composition (under otherwise stable conditions), but we urge more research on this under-researched topic. We also lack investigations of the relative foraging profitability of different Charales organs to waterbirds and the degree of viability of gyrogonites (fertilised and calcified oospores), vegetative bulbils and plant fragments after passage through the guts of waterbirds. We especially need to understand better how much the carbonate armour of these organs affects their viability/dispersal via waterbirds and urge more research on these neglected plants and their relationships and interactions with other organisms in the aquatic biota.

SARAL/AltiKa Altimetry Data for Monitoring of Inland Water Body: a Case Study of Mayurakshi Reservoir, India	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING												Present study aims at monitoring of water levels for Mayurakshi reservoir (similar to 68 sq. km) located in the Jharkhand state, India using Geophysical Data Records (GDR) data from SARAL/AltiKa launched in February, 2013. Reservoir water levels for the period April, 2013 to December 2014 were derived from space using SARAL/AltiKa data. The absolute average difference, standard deviation and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between altimetric data and gauge readings were 0.49, 0.29 and 0.56 m respectively. The accuracy of the relative water levels ranges between 0.008 and 0.8 m with a mean of 0.34 m, standard deviation of 0.27 m and RMSE of 0.44 m. Resulting time series of relative height changes and the amplitude variations are identical for most of the study period except during low stage, linked to the fact that some reservoir waveforms are season dependent. The results highlight the applicability of the SARAL/AltiKa data for monitoring small to medium reservoirs having surface area less than 100 sq. km.					; Dadhwal, Vinay/F-9825-2010	Krishnaveni, Sai/0000-0003-2318-401X; 													0255-660X	0974-3006				OCT	2016	44	5					797	802		10.1007/s12524-015-0535-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12524-015-0535-4													WOS:000382664900012

Morphologically different forms of calcretes in the Golbasi Basin include powdery, nodular, fracture infill, laminar and hardpan types. Calcite is the dominant mineral of calcrete compositions; the diagnostic features of dessication cracks, random fractures, MnO linings and dense sparitic infillings are observed. Chemical analyses show arid conditions with mean annual precipitation of <50 mm. delta C-13 compositions of the calcretes range from - 6.77 parts per thousand to -9.32 parts per thousand PDB, typical for most pedogenic calcretes, reflecting the development under seasonally arid climates and C3-dominated vegetation cover. delta O-18 values are between -5.57 parts per thousand and -7.80 parts per thousand PDB, indicating the formation from meteoric water in a vadose zone environment. The results suggest that the Middle Pleistocene was arider and warmer, favouring the formation of palygorskite in association with the different forms of calcrete occurrences; whereas the Late Pleistocene was dryer and cooler, supporting the development of calcretes.					; Küçükuysal, Ceren/HJA-8285-2022	Kucukuysal, Ceren/0000-0002-4108-3522; 													1674-487X	1867-111X				OCT	2016	27	5					874	882		10.1007/s12583-016-0900-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12583-016-0900-4													WOS:000384708700014

Influence of Weather, Wetland Availability, and Mallard Abundance on Productivity of Great Lakes Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos)	WETLANDS												Waterfowl rely on breeding habitat availability for successful reproduction. Breeding habitat availability likely changes throughout the season and among years as weather patterns change and thus productivity rates are likely susceptible to these changes. We used data from 1961 to 2011 to investigate effects of weather, breeding habitat availability and abundance of breeding mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) on productivity rates of mallards breeding in the Great Lake states (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin; hereafter GLS). We hypothesized that productivity rates would increase with wetter and warmer conditions however, extreme temperatures may have a negative impact and that high breeding density may negatively impact productivity rates. Specifically, we looked at the effects of average June and July temperature and precipitation, the Palmer Hydrological Drought Index (hereafter PHDI), and wetland counts to model productivity rates across the three states for the time series. We used a reduced time series model set to evaluate the impacts of wetland counts on productivity. We found that in general, wetter conditions, as indexed by high positive PHDI values and relationships with pond abundance, positively affected productivity. We believe that breeding habitat availability is likely a reasonable predictor of mallard productivity rates in the GLS.																			0277-5212	1943-6246				OCT	2016	36	5					969	978		10.1007/s13157-016-0812-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-016-0812-1													WOS:000385162100017

It was aimed to investigate the biomass of phytoplankton of large and shallow Lake Beysehir. The lake was sampled monthly from four selected stations and surface, mid and deep layers between March and December 2007. The phytoplankton biomass was estimated from counted cell size. A total of 119 phytoplankton species from Bacillariophyta (42), Chlorophyta (48), Chrysophyta (1), Cryptophyta (4), Cyanobacteria (9), Pyrrophyta (5) and Euglenophyta (10) were identified. Total phytoplankton biomass consisted of Bacillariophyta (53%), Chlorophyta (27%), Chrysophyta (3%), Cryptophyta (2%), Cyanobacteria (10%), Pyrrophyta (4%) and Euglenophyta (2%). Mean values of chlorophyll a, total phosphorus and Secchi depth were measured as 8.24 +/- 2.08 mg/m(3), 10.46+/-6.20 mg/m(3) and 1.08+/-0.35 m, respectively. Dissolved oxygen was measured between 6.36+/-0.06 and 11.63+/-0.06 mg/l. varied between 7.80+/-0.01 and 8.92+/-0.01. Water temperature changed between 5.3 degrees C and 27.8 degrees C. In the study period, phytoplankton biomass of Lake Beysehir varied between 0.40+/-0.11 and 6.43+/-1.00 mg/L. The mean phytoplankton biomass (1.98+/-1.18 mg/L) of the lake pointed out mesotrophy and good ecological quality class.

Fishes were collected in bimonthly samples conducted at ten lakes along a year. The present study showed that the composition of native fish assemblages is significantly related to the presence and type of non-native species. Fish species distribution among lakes can be explained by differences in species body size: smaller native species are less concentrated in lakes with invasive piscivores, which is in accordance with the hypothesis that they have greater susceptibility to predation by invaders. Another probable cause for this correlation is the proximity of lakes to the drainage system, which could explain both the non-native incidence and the turnover of native species composition. Furthermore, temporal variability in species composition was significantly higher in invaded lakes. This last factor may be linked to seasonal flood pulses, which carry immigrant fishes from streams in the vicinity. The metacommunity framework can bring insights for future studies in such spatially structured systems, and the approach should improve our understanding of processes underlying species composition as well as help direct conservation-focused management plans.

The data is obtained from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG-2) satellite. model inputs are TIR cloud top temperatures at 15-min intervals and observations of pressure, temperature, and dew point temperatures from ground-based stations at 30-min intervals. The sensitivity of the parsimonious cloud model to its parameters is evaluated by a regional sensitivity analysis (RSA) which suggests that model performance is sensitive to few parameters. The model was calibrated and tested for four convective events that were observed during the wet season in the source basin of the Upper Blue Nile River. The difference between the simulated and the observed depth of the selected rain events varies between 0.2 and 1.8 mm with a root mean square error of smaller than 0.5 mm for each event. It is shown that the updraft velocity characteristic can provide relevant information for rainfall forecasting. The simulation results suggest the effectiveness of the model approach as evaluated by selected performance measures. The various characteristics of the rainfall events as simulated generally match to observed counter parts when ground-based and remote sensing observations are combined. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Somaweera, R; Crossland, MR; Shine, R				Somaweera, Ruchira; Crossland, Michael R.; Shine, Richard			Assessing the potential impact of invasive cane toads on a commercial freshwater fishery in tropical Australia	WILDLIFE RESEARCH												Context. The toxins produced by cane toads (Rhinella marina) are fatal to many Australian predators that ingest these invasive anurans. To date, the potential economic impact of the cane toad invasion has attracted little attention. Toads have recently arrived at a large impoundment (Lake Argyle) in north-eastern Western Australia, that supports a commercial fishery for silver cobbler (shovel-nosed catfish, Arius midgleyi), raising concern that the toads may inflict significant economic damage by killing fish. Aims. Our research aimed to clarify the vulnerability of silver cobblers to the eggs and larvae of cane toads by determining (a) whether catfish are adversely affected if they prey on toad eggs or tadpoles, and (b) whether surviving catfish learn to avoid cane toad eggs and tadpoles in subsequent encounters. Methods. We conducted laboratory feeding trials to examine feeding responses of catfish to cane toad eggs and tadpoles in early and late developmental stages. Fish that survived exposure to toad eggs and/or tadpoles were re-tested with potential prey of the same sizes and developmental stages four days later. Key results. Our laboratory trials confirmed that some catfish eat toad eggs and die; but most catfish avoided the eggs. Catfish readily consumed toad tadpoles at both early and late developmental stages, but without experiencing mortality; and soon learned not to consume this toxic new prey type. Conclusions and implications. Despite potential frequent episodes of mortality of small numbers of catfish during the wet season, the overall impacts of cane toads on the Lake Argyle fishery likely will be minimal.

Of the 202 specimens collected, 42.6 % were infected with third-stage larvae of Contracaecurn sp. in the body cavity. The intensity of the infection was 1-7 worms per fish (mean intensity = 2.2). Seasonal variation in the prevalence of the parasite was not obvious and there was no significant difference in the prevalence of infection between males and females (chi(2) = 2.228; P > 0.05). No significant relationship between host size and prevalence was established. There was also no significant relationship between intensity and the body condition factor (r = 0.11; P > 0.05). The low parasite prevalence may have been caused by the disruption of the infection cycle since piscivorous birds, which are the final hosts of the parasite, do not feed on C. gariepinus in Lake Chivero.

Littoral sediment arsenic concentrations predict arsenic trophic transfer and human health risk in contaminated lakes	PLOS ONE												Lake sediments store metal contaminants from historic pesticide and herbicide use and mining operations. Historical regional smelter operations in the Puget Sound lowlands have resulted in arsenic concentrations exceeding 200 mu g As g-1 in urban lake sediments. Prior research has elucidated how sediment oxygen demand, warmer sediment temperatures, and alternating stratification and convective mixing in shallow lakes results in higher concentrations of arsenic in aquatic organisms when compared to deeper, seasonally stratified lakes with similar levels of arsenic pollution in profundal sediments. In this study we examine the trophic pathways for arsenic transfer through the aquatic food web of urban lakes in the Puget Sound lowlands, measuring C and N isotopes-to determine resource usage and trophic level-and total and inorganic arsenic in primary producers and primary and secondary consumers. Our results show higher levels of arsenic in periphyton than in other primary producers, and higher concentrations in snails than zooplankton or insect macroinvertebrates. In shallow lakes arsenic concentrations in littoral sediment are similar to deep profundal sediments due to arsenic remobilization, mixing, and redeposition, resulting in direct arsenic exposure to littoral benthic organisms such as periphyton and snails. The influence of littoral sediment on determining arsenic trophic transfer is evidenced by our results which show significant correlations between total arsenic in littoral sediment and total arsenic in periphyton, phytoplankton, zooplankton, snails, and fish across multiple lakes. We also found a consistent relationship between percent inorganic arsenic and trophic level (determined by delta 15N) in lakes with different depths and mixing regimes. Cumulatively, these results combine to provide a strong empirical relationship between littoral sediment arsenic levels and inorganic arsenic in edible species that can be used to screen lakes for potential human health risk using an easy, inexpensive sampling and analysis method.					; Olden, Julian/A-8535-2010	Neumann, Rebecca B/0000-0003-3464-9046; Gawel, James/0000-0002-1595-3678													1932-6203					OCT 19	2023	18	10							e0293214	10.1371/journal.pone.0293214	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0293214								37856511					WOS:001099265800084

Modeling the Biotic Energy Flow in the Plankton Community of the Lake Type Ecosystem with the Involvement of Microorganisms	INLAND WATER BIOLOGY												A mass-balance model simulating a biotic energy flow in the plankton community with the participation of microbial organisms has been designed for a lake-type ecosystem. The input abiotic parameters of the model are latitude, mean depth, water color, and total phosphorus content in water. The model was constructed on the basis of the data published for the Rybinsk Reservoir and Mongolian lakes. An analysis of the model indicated that the addition of the microbial loop to the traditional linear trophic chain resulted in a twofold decrease in the biomass and production of metazoan plankton and planktivorous fish. The value of the final ecosystem production (fish production) is suggested to be closely associated with the degree of development of the microbial loop during the growing season.

THE BAIKALIAN AMPHIPOD, GMELINOIDES FASCIATUS (AMPHIPODA, CRUSTACEA), IN THE DIET OF PERCH IN THE LITHORAL ZONE OF LAKE ONEGO: AGE AND SEASONAL ASPECTS	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												This paper focuses on the role of the invasive amphipod, Gmelinoides fasciatus in the food web of Lake Onego, the northern range limit of the amphipod in the European part of Russia. Its significance as food is evaluated for the European perch, Perca fluviatilis (L.), a popular fish species which is the most common in the littoral zone of the lake. This invader is established to have become dominant in the diet of perch throughout the year. Its occurrence in the perch diet at the age of 1+-3+ averages about 80%, decreasing at older fish ages and being replaced by other representatives of the benthos, as well as by young fish. As to biomass, the role of the invader in the feeding of young perch (1-7+) averages 50% (up to 79% - 1-2 +) during the year. The percentage of invaders in the perch diet is decreased down to 3-10% with distance off the shore (at depths of more than 1.5 m). The introduction of G. fasciatus to Lake Onego is regarded to be positive, as it has increased the potential productivity of fish in the lake.					; Georgiev, Andrew/AAE-2391-2020; Sidorova, Anastasiiy/AAD-4548-2022	Sidorova, Anastasia/0000-0002-3466-4062; 													0044-5134					JUL	2019	98	7					749	757		10.1134/S0044513419070055	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0044513419070055													WOS:000479017200003

Two types of laboratory grazing experiments were carried out To quantify zooplankton grazing on bacteria and phytoplankton. Species-specific and community filtering rates were measured in the feeding experiments with representative fluorescent microspheres (FM): 0.75 mu m EM fur bacteria and 10 mu m FM for phytoplankton. CIRs were measured using natural bacterial and phytoplankton communities in the zooplankton density manipulation experiments. Bacterial carbon was considerably lower (average +/- SD: 36 +/- 24 mu g C l(-1), n = 25) than phytoplankton carbon (383 +/- 274 mu g C l(-1), n = 25). Total zooplankton carbon (236 +/- 520 mu g C l(-1)) was usually dominated (>65%) by the MICZ fraction. Rotifers were the dominant taxonomic group. Bacterial carbon was positively related to both MICZ and MACZ carbon (P < 0.05) seasonally, but phytoplankton carbon was not. The community filtering rates (CFRs; ml l(-1) day(-1)) and biomass grazing rate (G; % day(-1)) of MICZ, on both bacteria and phytoplankton, were always higher than those measured for MACZ. MICZ CIRs on bacteria (average 5.3 +/- 5.5 mu g C l(-1) day(-1)) and phytoplankton (<35 mu m in size) (average 63 +/- 28 mu g C l(-1) day(-1)) were -twofold higher than MACZ CIRs. On average, MICZ accounted for 70 and 83% of total zooplankton grazing on bacteria and phytoplankton, respectively. Considering the total zooplankton community, MICZ generally were more important than MACZ as grazers of bacteria and phytoplankton. Rotifers, in particular, played an important role in transferring both bacterial and phytoplankton carbon to higher trophic levels in the lower Nakdong River ecosystem.

A detailed stratigraphic and taphonomic reassessment of the late Paleozoic fossil flora from Promontory Butte, Arizona	REVIEW OF PALAEOBOTANY AND PALYNOLOGY												A late Paleozoic, likely early Late Pennsylvanian (Missourian/early Virgilian), flora from Promontory Butte, Arizona, USA is the westernmost assemblage of this age yet described from northern Pangea. The palynological species pool is similar to that typical of more central parts of the supercontinent; in contrast, the macroflora differs by facies, reflective of original habitat differentiation. The flora is preserved in a succession that includes sandstone, siltstone, shale, and conglomerate in an upward-fining series of beds. A break between the siltstone and shale is marked by an organic-shale bed, previously described as a coal, and its underclay/paleosol. This stratigraphic unit is interpreted as an active channel fill terminating in a lake. A detailed bed-by-bed facies analysis of the macroflora, focusing on the relationship between sedimentological features and fossil-plant composition reveals that the wetland floral elements are concentrated in the upper, fine-grained beds of the fill, including the organic shale and overlying mudrock, whereas the drought-tolerant, xeromorphic plants are concentrated in siltstones and sandy siltstones below the organic-shale/underclay couplet. Palynology, in contrast, suggests a uniform flora throughout the interval, indicating that macrofloral changes within the channel-fill sequence reflect microhabitat differences resulting from local changes in soil moisture conditions rather than climate change. The palynoflora is dominated by tree ferns and compositionally suggests a Mis-sourian (Kasimovian) age, possibly early Virgilian; rare lycospore grains, characteristic of the Middle Pennsyl-vanian, are likely reworked from older sediments. Earlier collecting at this site did not sort the fossils by microstratigraphy and facies types, combining all floral levels into one assemblage that indicated possible co -occurrence of wetland plants and plants tolerant of seasonal moisture stress. Furthermore, a Pennsylvanian -Permian boundary age was inferred due to the abundance of xeromorphic, drought-tolerant taxa. In light of this investigation, a late Missourian age is inferred as most likely.					; DiMichele, William/K-4301-2012	DiMichele, William/0000-0002-7270-220X; 													0034-6667	1879-0615				JAN	2024	320								105004	10.1016/j.revpalbo.2023.105004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2023.105004		OCT 2023											WOS:001106390400001

Diatoms are one of the most important assemblages and useful tools for assessing the state of the environment due to their advantages over other organisms such as short life span and rapid reaction to environmental changes in aquatic systems. In this study, our objective was to investigate marine benthic diatoms and compare them using three different methods: light microscopy (LM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and molecular metabarcoding (MB). LM observations were supported by SEM; in addition, 18S rRNA metabarcoding was used to reveal the diatom flora. The results showed that the highest number of genera was observed with LM (49), followed by SEM (27) and MB (21). Eight genera were found to be common by all three methods. Although MB identified a small number of genera, it verified the presence of common taxa through a rigorous analysis. However, all the methods used gave consistent results in confirming that the diatom assemblages found along the coasts of Istanbul in the Sea of Marmara exhibited low diversity. Our results suggest that the morphological approach to the study of marine benthic diatoms can be complemented by the metabarcoding approach, which showed encouraging results, and that both approaches can be mutually supportive.

Dependence of element composition of bile of freshwater and marine fishes on some abiotic and biotic factors	FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE												IntroductionThe elemental composition and physical properties of fish bile is a very important marker for ecotoxicological and physiological studies as bile is able to accumulate elements from environmental compartments. In the present study we focused on the effects of long term (seasons and years) and spatial distance (different water bodies) as well as other biotic (feeding habits, fish species, gut morphology) and abiotic (water salinity) factors on element composition of bile of 429 individuals belonging to 22 forms/species of fishes.MethodsElement composition was determined using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The fishes were analyzed from one marine (the Kandalaksha Gulf of the White Sea), two freshwater oligotrophic (Teletskoye and Baunt lakes), and one freshwater eutrophic water body (Chany Lake). In parallel, we have estimated the volume and density of bile from the same fishes using an automatic pipette and electronic balance.Results and discussionBased on fish bile density and volume data, we hypothesize that gastric fish species (those fishes that have a stomach) require a low volume of bile, but with higher density if compared to agastric fish species (those lacking a stomach) that mainly possessed large volumes of bile, but with a lower density. We have found that the concentrations of the following Na, K, Ca, Mg, S, P (major elements) and Al, Cu, Fe, Sr, Zn (trace elements) were the highest among the 28 elements studied. There were significant findings to contribute to a better understanding of the physiology of bile. First, we have determined the conditions formed in a water body in a given year (season) are more important for element composition of fish bile rather than other tested factors (feeding habits, gut morphology, etc.). Second, the feeding habits of fishes (carnivorous compared to non-carnivorous) had a significant effect based on differences among several elements. Third, the clear distinction between marine and freshwater fishes was found only for K and Na. Understanding which elements are produced as part of waste elimination and those that are present as a consequence of vital biological functions could improve the ecotoxicological study of bile as a marker of heavy metal contamination.

J	Moore, DJ; Morris, RD				Moore, DJ; Morris, RD			The production of second clutches in the common tern: Proximate effects of timing and food supply	WATERBIRDS												The Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) rarely produces more than one brood per breeding cycle. In 1996, 18 of 365 pairs (5%) of Common Terns nesting at a Lake Ontario colony laid second clutches while caring for first-brood nestlings; no second clutches were recorded during four previous breeding seasons at this location. Second clutches were smaller than first clutches of the same pairs (2 versus 3 eggs), and were initiated when first broods contained 1-3 nestlings that ranged in age from 12-22 d. Success of second clutches was low. Only two nestlings, from one second clutch, survived for > 18 d; all remaining second clutches were abandoned or predated prior to (N = 16) or just after (N = 1) hatching. Three proximate factors were examined, within and among years, related to the production of second clutches: 1) earlier initiation of first broods, 2) reduced parental effort toward first broods, and 3) foraging conditions during rearing of first broods. Second clutches were not related to earlier breeding or reduced parental effort: clutch initiation dates, clutch sizes, and egg volumes of first clutches were similar among years, and first-clutch size and initiation date did not differ between pairs producing one versus two clutches. Conversely, parental care patterns in 1996 had several Unusual characteristics compared to other years, including: (1) shorter provisioning trips, (2) higher provisioning rates, and (3) reduced rates of kleptoparasitism. These characteristics suggest that an abundant food supply close to the colony in 1996 was the likely proximate explanation for second-clutching.

Cores spanning the last 27.5 kyr of sedimentation in the lake show large oscillations in delta-C-13(org) PDB and delta-N-15(org) Air. The late Pleistocene record is particularly detailed, showing changes of ca. 20 parts per thousand in carbon and ca. 10 parts per thousand in nitrogen isotopic compositions. These variations are of complex origin. Although different in magnitude, major isotopic excursions in the two records are generally in phase and reveal the occurrence of two major dry intervals at and immediately following the Last Glacial Maximum. The Allerod-Younger Dryas period also seems to have been marked by generally dry conditions in this part of tropical West Africa. Nitrogen isotopic evidence suggests that during the period 9.2-3.2 kyr the lake had an extremely stable water column, probably due to the absence of a windy or cool, dry season. or both. Regular circulation of the water column recommenced during the late Holocene and has persisted until the present day.																			0012-821X	1385-013X				MAY	1992	110	1-4					23	37		10.1016/0012-821X(92)90036-U	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0012-821X(92)90036-U													WOS:A1992HZ34600003
J	Gliwicz, ZM; Jawinski, A; Pawlowicz, M				Gliwicz, ZM; Jawinski, A; Pawlowicz, M			Cladoceran densities, day-to-day variability in food selection by smelt, and the birth-rate-compensation hypothesis	HYDROBIOLOGIA					6th International Symposium on Cladocera	AUG 19-23, 2002	Wierzba, POLAND					Late-evening gut inspection of a dominant planktivore ( smelt) and evaluation of densities, fecundities, and body-size distributions in dominant zooplankton prey (cladocerans) were made in day-to-day sequences in June - July ( 24 days in 1999 and 24 days in 2000). This was conducted as a field test of the hypothesis that species-specific population densities in cladocerans result from size-selective predation by a dominant fish assumed to be a general predator, switching from one prey to another as relative abundance changes. Little of the expected coincidence has been revealed between population density declines and increased numbers of a given prey in smelt diet. However, the data were consistent with the notion that fish would switch from one prey to another depending on the prey relative abundance ( the number of prey a fish would see in its reaction field volume). Each cladoceran population fluctuated around its species-specific density level, lower or higher, depending on individual susceptibility to smelt predation, from 0.2 ind. l(-1) in large-bodied Daphnia hyalina and Leptodora kindtii, to 30.0 ind. l(-1) in small-bodied Daphnia cucullata and Bosmina thersites. In spite of high fish-to-fish and day-to-day variability in both smelt diet and smelt selectivity for different prey, all cladocerans ( also copepods and midge larvae) were equally persistent in smelt diet, and smelt selectivity was similar for small- and large-bodied prey categories, but lower for elongated- ( Daphnia, Diaphanosoma) than for compact-body ( Bosmina, Chydorus) species, when integrated for the entire sampling time. Closer examination of D. cucullata and B. thersites revealed strong smelt selection for later instars and females with greater clutches, showing that size distribution in a cladoceran population might be structured by fish predation in a similar way to that a cladoceran community ( species relative abundance) is structured in a lake habitat. The 'birth-rate-compensation hypothesis' is offered to explain why the value of food selectivity index in a planktivorous fish would remain the same for alternate prey categories with similar life-history traits, unless they differ in susceptibility to predation before the time of first reproduction.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				SEP	2004	526	1			SI		171	186																WOS:000223915900018

Measuring stations were divided into two groups: those located on the surface of the lake water and those situated at the depth of 2 m and 6 m. The mean value equality test verified that at either of the two depths the values of the water quality parameters mea-sured during blooms of diatoms, cyanobacteria and green algae were different from the values of these parameters measured over the period without blooms. When water samples were taken from the surface of the lake, significant differences in the values measured during blooms and the lack thereof were observed with ammonia nitrogen, nitrites and nitrates. The water quality parameters examined exhibited significant differences in their seasonal patterns, except ammonia nitrogen and nitrites, which did not show any significant seasonal variations. The study revealed that phytoplankton bloom affected the correlation between the water quality parameters tested. In many instances, Spearman correlation coefficient values that were insignificant in the absence of blooms became significant when blooms were present.

Spatial and temporal comparisons of double-crested cormorant diets following the establishment of alewife in Lake Champlain, USA	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Increasing numbers of double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) on Lake Champlain have caused concerns related to potential impacts on the yellow perch (Perca flavescens) population. However, with the establishment of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) in 2003, cormorant foraging may have changed. We examined cormorant diets from four areas of Lake Champlain to assess past, current, and potential future impacts of cormorants on the changing fish community. During the breeding seasons of 2001-2002 and 2008-2009, we observed spatial and temporal differences in cormorant diets. Yellow perch dominated diet composition during 2001-2002 at Young Island (73% and 90% yearly weight totals) during all reproductive periods. Four Brothers Islands diet composition in 2002 varied according to reproductive period. In 2008 and 2009, alewife were predominant in diets at Four Brothers Islands (56% and 71%) and the South site (65% and 62%), with yellow perch comprising a high proportion of diets at Young Island (44% and 56%). Results from a MANOVA confirmed differences among sites, reproductive period, and the interaction of these factors (P<0.0001) when describing diet compositions for the post-alewife years. PCA results denoted a general shift in cormorant diets from 2001-2002 to 2008-2009. Our study demonstrated that the diet of piscivorous birds may shift with a new forage species and may vary significantly within a single large water body. Accordingly, efforts to manage piscivorous birds with the intent to decrease mortality of specific fish species should be site specific when possible.

J	Hanson, D; Austin, D				Hanson, David; Austin, David			Multiyear destratification study of an urban, temperate climate, eutrophic lake	LAKE AND RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT												An aeration system for destratification has been in operation since 1973 at Sweeney Lake, an urban, eutrophic lake near Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. Water quality data are available for 19 of the 39 years, 1972-2010. Growing season (Apr-Oct) aeration was turned off in 2007-2008 to evaluate the effect of destratification on water quality. Aeration never achieved the Lorenzen and Fast (LF) complete destratification airflow criterion of 9.2 m(3)/min/km(2). When aeration was at 51% LF, hypoxia (DO < 2.0 mg/L) occurred June-August at the lake bottom. When airflow increased to 65% LF, bottom water hypoxia was restricted to 4 weeks in late July-August. There were no systematically significant differences (p > 0.05) in median Secchi disk depths, chlorophyll a concentrations, or surface total phosphorus (TP) concentrations between destratified and stratified lake conditions, but interannual variability linked to other influences, including partial stratification and stormwater inputs, limits statistical power. The median April-October lake TP mass of 67 kg in 2007-2008 (stratified conditions) was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than the 44 kg median mass in 1998-2005 and 2009 (destratified conditions). Destratification can suppress internal phosphorus loading when properly applied.																			1040-2381	2151-5530					2012	28	2					107	119		10.1080/07438141.2012.671229	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2012.671229													WOS:000305515400001

The results indicated that during the icebound season, the concentrations of nutrients in the ice layer were about one-third of those in water, and the concentration of the chlorophyll-a was about one-fifth. The majority of nitrogen in the water was inorganic; the descending order of the species being NH4+, NO3-, NO2-, and the phosphorus was mostly soluble in water. We also discovered that the concentration of chlorophyll-a increased slowly throughout the icebound season and that the concentrations of NH4+ and TP in the deep water were higher than those in the shallow water. Moreover, part of the experiment was simulated. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The lakes perform diverse functions and are characterized by a different degree of anthropogenic pressure. Speciation of arsenic and chromium was carried out using an HPLC chromatograph coupled with an ICP-MS detector. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the speciation of inorganic chromium and arsenic forms in lake water and bottom sediments detected significant differences in the concentrations of these analytes at various states of oxidation. The concentrations of arsenic and chromium forms were found to range from limits of detection up to several tens mg/m(3). The results of the study have revealed marked differences in the content of these forms of chromium and arsenic between the water samples and the bottom sediment samples, depending on the season of the year, extent of oxygenation and nature of the reservoir.

BIOMASS DISTRIBUTION AND DYNAMICS AND FOOD WEB RELATIONS IN PSAMMON COMMUNITY OF AN EUTROPHIC LAKE	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Organisms living in submerged sand along the shore and below the water's edge in freshwater lake beaches create community called hydropsammon (see Fig. 1 in Preface). Trophic relations between psammon food web components are essential in energy flow, nutrient cycling and functioning of aquatic environments. The seasonal changes in algal, bacterial, nanoflagellate, ciliate, rotifer and crustacean biomass were investigated in hydroarenal (submerged sand) of the eutrophic Lake Mikolajskie (Poland). Sampling cores were taken once or twice a month since April till October 2005 from three layers: adjacent water layer (AWL), layer of water and sand from the transitory level (EPIH - epihydroarenal) and slice of sand (ENDOH - endohydroarenal). The mean annual phytopsammon biomass was extremely high in all microlayers. Bacterial biomass was the highest in the ENDOH. Biomass of nanoflagellates was 4 to 8 times lower than that of bacteria and was the highest in the AWL. The highest mean annual biomass of ciliates was recorded in the EPIH, whereas rotifers dominated in the ENDOH. In contrast, average biomass of Crustacea was the highest in the AWL. Crustaceans dominated heterotrophic biomass in the AWL and EPIH (92 and 54% of the total biomass, respectively) whereas bacteria definitely prevailed in the ENDOH (57%). The ratios of autotrophic to heterotrophic biomass and prey to predator biomass as well as trophic relations between the studied groups of psammon organisms differed clearly among microlayers. The AWL was characterised by the lowest autotrophic/heterotrophic and predator/prey biomass ratios (about 2) and significant positive correlations between nanoflagellates and ciliates as well as between protists and both rotifers and copepods. The highest autotrophic/heterotrophic and predator/prey biomass ratio (14 and 40, respectively) and lack of correlations was found in the ENDOH. These results may suggest that the pressure of consumers was weaker in the hydroarenal layers than in the AWL. In addition, it seems that psammon ciliates, rotifers and crustaceans inhabiting the ENDOH were probably limited by factors other than food availability. In contrast to the pelagic ecosystems, autotrophic biomass exceeded heterotrophic biomass, especially in the ENDOH.					; Kalinowska, Krystyna/S-8299-2018; Rybak, Ján/AAE-6000-2019	Kalinowska, Krystyna/0000-0002-5099-5371; 													1505-2249						2012	60	3					443	453																WOS:000309251900002

Differences in Paddlefish Populations among Impoundments of the Arkansas River, Arkansas	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Most large rivers within the range of paddlefish Polyodon spathula are fragmented by dams. However, little research has been done to determine if population characteristics (e.g., growth, mortality, density) vary among impoundments within river systems and how this may influence the risk of overfishing. Population characteristics and the potential for commercial overfishing were assessed for paddlefish in three impoundments of the Arkansas River, Arkansas (Pool 13, Ozark Lake, and Lake Dardanelle). Paddlefish (n = 751) were collected with gill nets from November 2003 to March 2005. Paddlefish from the most lentic and most heavily fished pool, Lake Dardanelle, had the lowest catch rate, grew fastest, and had the highest mean condition factor, weight, fecundity, and total annual mortality (67%). In contrast, paddlefish from the most lotic impoundment that was less intensively fished, Pool 13, had the highest catch rate, slowest growth, and the lowest mean condition, weight, fecundity, and total annual mortality (53%). The Lake Dardanelle paddlefish fishery appeared to show signs of commercial overfishing when managed with a 914-mm eye fork length minimum length limit and a 151-d season. Beverton-Holt population simulations modeled by impoundment indicated Lake Dardanelle was more sensitive to overfishing than the other pools. Although there was limited movement among pools, results of this study indicate that population characteristics vary among the three adjacent impoundments on the Arkansas River and that they should be managed as separate management units.																			0275-5947	1548-8675					2012	32	4					731	744		10.1080/02755947.2012.686956	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2012.686956													WOS:000308797200005

Offshore gill netting and night trawling were compared in terms of catch per unit of effort, size distribution, sampling precision, and bycatch. In total, 90 gill net-trawl pairs of catches were compared, which collected more than 80,000 threadfin shad. Gill-net and trawl catches were not correlated in either number or biomass. Coefficients of variation were greater in gill-net sampling (0.761 for numbers, 0.747 for biomass) than in trawl sampling (0.433 and 0.465, respectively) and were not dependent on reservoir, sampling season, reservoir section, or any combination of these factors for any gear. There was no correspondence in size distributions between gill-net and trawl catches. Gill nets collected threadfin shad in the range of 23-169 mm total length (TL) and displayed strong mesh size selectivity, causing distinct unrealistic peaks in size distribution. Gill nets underestimated threadfin shad smaller than 35 mm TL and overestimated shad bigger than 90 mm TL. The size range of threadfin shad collected via trawl was 10-108 mm TL, and trawls did not appear to be as size selective for fish up to 80 mm TL. Trawling was found to be the superior sampling technique for shad populations in pelagic habitats of Puerto Rican reservoirs, which consisted mainly of fish up to 80 mm TL. Trawling provided a more realistic picture of size distributions, collected far less bycatch, was less affected by the schooling of shad, and was less laborious and more cost-effective than gill nets.

Effect of aquatic macrophyte cover and fetch on spatial variability in the biomass and growth of littoral fishes in bays of Prince Edward County, Lake Ontario	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Biomass and growth of Pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus), Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens) and cohabiting species varied among different bays of Prince Edward County in eastern Lake Ontario. Biomass (B) and a calculated fish production (P) index of fishes, estimated as the product of average seasonal biomass and P/B, was about 6x higher at the electrofishing transects with medium to high macrophyte cover and low fetch than at sites where macrophytes were absent or sparse and fetch was high. The production index -aquatic plant relationship was species-dependent. The biomass component of fish production was related to macrophyte cover but the growth component and P/B (determined by allometry with body size) was not. Biomass and inferred production could be predicted from fetch, macrophyte abundance and water temperature, but with low precision. Results were consistent with index trawling in showing that changes in aquatic vegetation following Dreissena colonization in the Bay of Quinte and vicinity have affected the abundance of phytophilic fishes in this region of eastern Lake Ontario.

Importance of topography and topsoil selection and storage in successfully rehabilitating post-closure sand mines featuring pit lakes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTIONS OF MINING AND METALLURGY SECTION A-MINING TECHNOLOGY												Rehabilitation at a silica sand mine on the Swan Coastal Plain of Western Australia, where the post-mine landscape consists of small pit lakes (dredge ponds) with surrounding battered slopes, and where a range of ecological restoration techniques have been applied, was monitored for several years to gauge success or otherwise of these techniques. Results clearly showed the benefits of using fresh topsoil for restoration over topsoil that has been stockpiled for several years. Most topsoil used in restoration was from seasonal wetlands and consequently restoration was most successful in the riparian zone from the edge of pit lakes to similar to 2 m vertically above the water table. Rehabilitated areas above this level remained poor in plant species and cover with remedial actions largely unsuccessful. We believe that matching topsoil to site and development of topographic profiles similar to natural wetlands of the region are the keys to optimising rehabilitation success around pit lakes formed by sand mining in areas with shallow groundwater.					van Etten, Eddie/AAC-2612-2020; Lund, Mark/AFL-7151-2022	Lund, Mark/0000-0002-2047-3476; van Etten, Eddie/0000-0002-7311-1794													0371-7844	1743-2863					2012	121	3					139	150		10.1179/1743286312Y.0000000017	http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/1743286312Y.0000000017													WOS:000212696000005

So the clustering method is required to have the capability of dealing with multi-dimensions, time series and clustering validity. A dynamic fuzzy C-means clustering method (simplified as DFCCM) with clustering validity function based time series was developed in the paper. The real coding based accelerating genetic algorithm (simplified as RAGA) is used for solving DFCCM, which is very effective and can overcome the initial value sensitivity from the regular iterative optimal method generally used for the fuzzy C-means clustering. The newly developed method was applied in the Taihu lake basin in China for the division of the basin flood season, and 11 schemes were designed for removing the uncertainty from the initial value of flood season, which could exert influence on the results of the flood seasons division. Application results show that the method is very effective and the division conclusion of flood season in the Taihu Lake Basin is also reasonable. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Shuter, BJ; Ing, KK				Shuter, BJ; Ing, KK			Factors affecting the production of zooplankton in lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Multiple regression analysis and analysis of covariance were used to assess the degree to which observed variation in rates of production among 108 lake zooplankton populations could be accounted for by variation in physical and biological factors. Seventy-six percent of the observed variation in growing season weight-specific production rates could be accounted for by differences in temperature, length of growing season, and taxonomic group (Rotifera, Chydoroidea, Cyclopoida, Calanoida, ordered from highest rate to lowest). Within taxonomic groups, effects of population biomass density, individual body size, and food availability were not detected. Fifty-eight percent of the observed variation in growing season population biomass density could be accounted for by differences in individual body size, mean chlorophyll concentration, and lake mean depth. Twenty-four percent of the observed variation in growing season length could be accounted for by differences in mean chlorophyll concentration and taxonomic group. Our findings suggest a simple model of the seasonal production cycle for limnetic zooplankton in which weight-specific rates of biomass production are largely set by temperature, and levels of biomass accumulation are largely set by food resource availability and individual body size. We briefly discuss the implications of this model for predicting the effects of climate change on lake productivity.

The elemental composition within a given species showed little seasonal variation, and experimental starvation or feeding did not cause any significant changes in the P content. C constituted 48 +/- 1% of dry weight with only minor variation among species. The mean C:N:P atomic ratios reflected large interspecific differences in P and N content and ranged from 212:39:1 in Acanthodiaptomus denticornis to 85:14:1 in Daphnia longispina. Comparisons with published measurements indicate that this pattern is quite general and probably constitutional. These findings suggest that the species composition of the zooplankton community can have strong influence on the N:P ratio of recycled nutrients and thereby affect resource competition between phytoplankton species.

The experiment was conducted from September to November 2007 and February to April 2008. In each period, 21 litter bags were used, each containing 10 g of dried leaves. Three bags were removed after 2, 5, 8, 12, 25, 45, and 65 days of colonization. The decomposition rate of the E. azurea leaves was rapid in both seasons, with no significant difference between them. The Chironomidae showed higher density than the other invertebrates. Goeldichironomus, Tanytarsus, and Corynoneura were the most abundant genera of Chironomidae. The invertebrate density increased during the experiment, differing within days but not between seasons. The faunal composition differed between the decomposition phases (initial and final), but did not differ between the seasons (dry and wet). The taxa Ablabesmyia, Caladomyia, Chironomus, Goeldichironomus, and Parachironomus were the most closely related to the final days of the experiment. Litter was the main food item found in the gut contents of the organisms of all the genera analyzed, both at the beginning and end of the decomposition. We believe that the feeding activity combined with the high larval density is an important factor contributing to the rapid decomposition of the E. azurea leaves. In conclusion, the succession process along the detritus chain of E. azurea was more important in structuring the assemblage of Chironomidae larvae than seasonal variations.

Implications for formation of deposits of economic interest	JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES												The Kathmandu Valley is an intermontane basin in the center of a large syncline of the Lesser Himalayas. The sedimentary basin fill comprises three units of Plio-Pleistocene to Holocene age. The study aimed at modeling the paleogeographic evolution of the basin, with emphasis on sedimentary series of fossil fuels and non-metallic deposits. The lithological setting of the basin and the tectonic framework were instrumental to basin subsidence. Alluvial through lacustrine sedimentation during incipient stages is a direct response to uplift in the hinge zone of the synclinorium. Axial parallel sediment dispersal gave way to fluviodeltaic sedimentation mainly from the limbs of the synclinorium. Ongoing compression and renewed uplift in the core zone of the synclinorium. drove the uplift of a NW-SE running divide and a subdivision of the mono-lake into two basins. This ridge blocked the flow of transverse rivers and the northern subbasin became gradually choked. Ongoing uplift of the entire basin during the recent geological history caused a reorganization of the drainage pattern and triggered linear erosion in the southern mountain range. Step-by-step the remaining lacustrine basins disappeared. Fan aggradation coincide with cold dry or warm seasons, fluvial dissection and discharge increased during warmer and more humid periods. High lake levels exist during phases of increased humidity. The results of this basin analysis may be used predictively in the exploration for coal, natural gas, diatomaceous earths and quarrying for sand or clay. The gas potential is at its maximum in the lacustrine facies, sand and clay for construction purposes may be quarried economically from various fluvial and deltaic deposits. Diatomaceous earths predominantly accumulated in marginal parts of the lake and some landslide-dammed ponds. Lignitic brown coal can be mined together with combustible shales from poorly drained swamps. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Scale-dependent tradeoffs between habitat and time in explaining Alligator Gar (Atractosteus spatula) movement	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												Ecological theory predicts that movement by riverine fishes at the population level is characterized by both stationary and mobile individuals together creating a leptokurtic distribution of movement distances. However, studies testing this theory typically ignore spatial heterogeneity in riverscapes, and the theory has not been tested using Alligator Gar (Atractosteus spatula), a species of growing interest among anglers and fisheries managers alike. We characterized movements and habitat associations of Alligator Gar in the Brazos River, Texas, at fine (every 2 h for 24 h) and coarse (every month for 16 months) spatiotemporal scales. We tested for the presence of leptokurtosis and relationships between movement distance, habitat dissimilarity, and time-at-large using multivariate and univariate statistical approaches. Dispersal by Alligator Gar revealed leptokurtosis at the coarse scale but not the fine scale. At the fine scale, mixed effects quantile regression revealed there was no relationship between habitat dissimilarity and dispersal distance, but dispersal was positively correlated with time. At the coarse scale, dispersal was positively correlated with increased habitat dissimilarity and time, but only for the most mobile individuals. Our work suggests that short-term movements by riverine Alligator Gar during warm seasons and at base flows increased with time but were unrelated to habitat, and long-term movements over an annual cycle during warm season flow pulses revealed highly mobile members of the population accessed distant and novel floodplain environments.					; Roberts, Hayden/JYQ-5889-2024; Acre, Matthew/KFQ-2331-2024	Ellard, Johnathan/0009-0003-6235-7734; Roberts, Hayden/0000-0003-2673-2106; Acre, Matthew/0000-0002-5417-9523													0378-1909	1573-5133				DEC	2024	107	12			SI		1457	1473		10.1007/s10641-023-01473-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-023-01473-3		OCT 2023											WOS:001078156900001

The emphasis was put on diet segregation, while data on microhabitat segregation were mainly used to determine potential competitors for food. Diet and microhabitat segregation were demonstrated in all four assemblages. In one of the assemblages we observed little partitioning of resources among two filamentous algae feeders. The role of competition for food is discussed on the basis of fluctuations in diet overlap in relation to seasonal changes in food supply. Diet overlap proved to be highest in periods of food abundance. This is in concordance with the hypothesis that competition decreases in case of food abundance. Furthermore, we compared fish densities between assemblages, because competition would regulate density. We found that diets were most diverse in the assemblage with lowest fish density, while interspecific differences in diet were smallest. Food seems not to be limiting in this particular assemblage, and factors other than competition for food are probably more important in regulating density here.

Acidity-alkalinity were most closely related to peatland type and were the most useful parameters for characterizing peatlands. Potassium, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations were more related to season, year, or peatland-year interactions and cannot be used to categorize the bog-fen gradient. Hydrogen ion, ammonium, alkalinity, and corrected conductivity were relatively constant throughout the ice-free season, while total metal ions (Al, Fe, Mn, and Zn), base cations (Ca2+ Mg2+, Na+, K+), nitrate, and components of phosphorus fluctuated seasonally. Nitrate remained constant with depth in all peatland types, whereas ammonium increased with depth. Relationships of surface water chemistry to pH for all sites showed three patterns: a positive and highly significant correlation with little seasonal variation within peatland types (base cations, alkalinity, and corrected conductivity); less significant correlation with strong seasonal variation within peatland types (N and P); and a general negative and highly significant correlation with some seasonal variation in peatland types (metals and S).

During the present study, the Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) and Water Quality Index (WQI) were used to determine the ecological status of a transboundary river, the Sari-Goyain River in Bangladesh. Samplings were carried out from upstream to downstream river sites in wet and dry seasons to observe the seasonal dynamics. The benthic diatom composition and physicochemical parameters showed seasonal variation in ecological water quality assessment. In the River, 42 different diatom species from 19 genera were recorded. The mean TDI values indicated an oligotrophic condition of the river in both seasons. But, the WQI values showed excellent and good water quality in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. So, the WQI was helpful in assessing seasonal variation of ecological water quality status in the Sari-Goyain River. For the long-term monitoring of the ecological status of the river, seasonal variation and WQI-based assessment should be considered.

On the daily time scale various phenomena seem to repeat with a sort of regularity, leaving a trace in the further trend of oxygen dynamics. These are the wind calm of nocturnal and early morning hours, the advent of the afternoon breezes, the micro- and macro-algae diurnal production, the chemical and biochemical processes. On the larger seasonal scale, dissolved oxygen shows an almost periodical trend. In this case, a greater dependency on the climatic events leads to the colder and windy season, while the warm and hot period is closely related to the vegetable production, which frees remarkable amounts of oxygen in the water through photosynthesis. Result of experimental measurements of dissolved oxygen, acquired with an automatic equipment on a very short time scale (30 s), are shown and discussed. The experiments were run to detect oscillating phenomena characterized by a period which is shorter than the daily occurrence, as well as stochastic phenomena, led by almost periodical drifts, which contribute substantially to the oxygen dynamics on the longer time scale. To determine these pseudo-periodicities, or time variation for the oscillation period, the analysis of the temporal distances between local maxima of oxygen concentrations has been performed. This kind of analysis is based on the hypothesis that we are dealing with a dissipative dynamical system whose evolution is similar to the behavior of some non linear oscillating systems with a control, where the control can be represented by a simple function of the temporal interval between two consecutive peaks. The result of the analysis suggests the existence of dynamics on a 6-8 h time scale. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Preferential dreissenid mussel grazing on small plankton can favor cyanobacteria: Experimental evidence from western Lake Erie	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												Herein we provide experimental evidence for the effects invasive mussels (Dreissena) grazing can exert on a natural assemblage of plankton that included both hetero- and photo-trophic components in western Lake Erie. Five mussel feeding experiments were performed seasonally in 2018 (May, June, July August, October). Pre- and post-grazing samples were collected from seven 20-L mesocosms (3 control, 4 mussel), and analyzed using microscope cell counts. Results from our experiments showed that Dreissena were active grazers of plankton on all dates, with significant correspondence between mussel clearance rates measured using microscopy versus size-specific chlorophyll and FluoroProbe based estimates (Spearman rank correlation, r=0.45, and r=0.48, respectively, p<0.05). Clearance rates (ml mg(-1) h(-1)) were variable among taxonomic groups and seemed to track the abundance of ambient plankton assemblage (range 1.70 to 25.00, mean +/- SE 11.70 +/- 1.33). Dreissena grazed consistently on nano-sized hetero- and phototrophic plankton that constituted key trophic linkages in the Lake Erie foodweb. The most actively grazed plankton were phototrophic cryptophytes (Rhodomonas minuta, Cryptomonas spp.), centric diatoms (Cyclotella sp. and Discotella spp.), and non-pigmented chrysomonads (Chromulina sp., Ochromonas sp.). Conversely, clearance rates were low for cyanobacteria (e.g. Microcystis), dinoflagellates (Gymnodinium varians), and some colonial chlorophytes (Desmodesmus, Pediastrum); these plankton groups occurred during specific temporal windows (one-way ANOVA, p<0.05). Our results indicate the potential mussel grazing can suppress typical, non-harmful plankton species in the nanoplankton size range, thereby favoring the occurrence of less-edible, larger cyanobacteria and chlorophyte species in western Lake Erie.

It consists of terrestrial topography (topography) and underwater topography (bathymetry). One of the problems related to topography is the availability of detailed and up-to-date topographic and bathymetry data. This research proposes the latest bathymetry and topography extraction modeling with multi-source geospatial data including PlanetScope, Sentinel -1, Landsat images, and in-situ field data. The study area is located in Lake Ledulu, Rote Island, Indonesia. Bathymetry and topography were extracted using PlanetScope imagery and in-situ field data using the least squares adjustment computation approach. The mathematical design model uses the latest DTM method, which correlated with in-situ data. Time-series Landsat and PlanetScope are used to extract the lake bank boundaries with water using the harmonic method. DEM integration method is used to integrate bathymetry and topography. The updated topography and bathymetry are performed by adding the true vertical deformation extracted from Sentinel-1 imagery using the D-InSAR method. The results obtained are the latest bathymetry and topography of Lake Ledulu in 2022 or so-called DTM (2022). Then DTM (2022) is tested for profile checking and vertical accuracy at the confidence level of 95 % according to the ASPRS 2014. The DTM (2022) of Lake Ledulu has a vertical accuracy of + 61.54 cm or according to 1:5000 - 1:10000 scale mapping. DTM ((2022)) is also used to determine the dynamics of the volume of Lake Ledulu and its changes from 1985 to 2022. In 2022 (dry season) Lake Ledulu has a surface area (0.0946 km(2)), volume (701,688.45 m(3)), and perimeter (1.868 km). In 2022 (wet season), Lake Ledulu has a surface area (0.1555 km(2)), volume (1,116,525.9 m(3)), and perimeter (2.612 km). In 1985 (wet season) Lake Ledulu have surface area (0.3079 km2), volume (4,772,567.2 m(3)), and perimeter (3.477 km). The change in the surface area of Lake Ledulu from 1985-2022 was 0.1525 km(2) (decrease of 49.53%). The volume of Lake Ledulu from 1985-2022 was 3,656,041.3 m(3) (decrease of 75.61%). Change in the perimeter of Lake Ledulu 1985-2022 was 0.862 km (shrinkage of 24.79%).

However, their existence could be potentially threatened by human activities (primarily, upstream water abstraction and planned hydropower structures) coupled with climate change. For their protection, it is essential to know their distribution, ecology, and status of the ecosystems that they inhabit. Publications that record taxa from the Delta at species level are scarce, particularly aquatic macroinvertebrates. Identifying organisms to species level can provide more accurate information for environmental monitoring and conservation programmes but requires significant training and expertise. Here, we present a comprehensive taxonomical review of 2204 freshwater species from the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami, with additional 355 species found in other areas of Botswana that are likely to be present in the study region. We also compare the diversity of the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami with two other tropical wetlands: the Pantanal (Brazil) and the Kakadu Region (Australia). We show that biodiversity in the Okavango Delta and Lake Ngami is higher than in previous estimates, with recorded species richness dominated by phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates. Most species are widespread across the system and southern Africa. The resulting database includes new records (Bryozoa, Porifera), information on species conservation status, habitat, ecology, distribution in continental Africa, site details and taxonomical notes. This will be an essential resource for researchers, conservation managers, policy makers and consultants investigating freshwater biodiversity in tropical wetlands in the region.

However, the CH4 emission contribution to the total emission in the littoral zones of lakes, especially emergent macrophytes (e.g., lotus), is poorly known. Lotus has been cultivated in almost all provinces in China; it is not only an aquatic plant, but also a kind of vegetable. In this study, two sampling zones (lotus plant and open water) were established in the lake of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The CH4 emission was measured using a floating opaque chamber and gas chromatography between April and December in the years 2021 and 2022. The results indicated that the flux of CH4 emissions ranged from 0.10 to 59.75 mg m(-2) h(-1), with an average value of 5.61 mg m(-2) h(-1), in the open water, while ranging from 0.19 to 57.32 mg m(-2) h(-1), with an average value of 17.14 mg m(-2) h(-1), in the lotus plant zone. The maximal CH4 emissions occurred in July and August for the open water, which was highly related to the air and water temperature, whereas it happened in September for the lotus plant zone, possibly due to the high vegetation biomass, indirectly enhancing the high soil organic carbon content, plant-mediated CH4 emission, as well as the lower dissolved oxygen concentration, thus strengthening the production and emissions of CH4. Considering the carbon emissions (both CH4 and CO2) and plant productivity, although greater CH4 emission occurred in the lotus plant zone, it could still represent a potential carbon sink (213 g m(-2) yr(-1)) compared to the open water.

Geochemical reactivity of surficial and core sediment of a tropical mangrove ecosystem	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Sediments from the surface, core waterwaand vegetation of tropical mangroves were collected from tropical mangroves, India. Total phosphorus, total nitrogen, organic carbon, protein, carbohydrate and tannin and lignin in these samples were estimated. The C/N and C/P of the leaves present in Mangalavanam, Vypeen, and Nettoor are in good agreement with that of the sediment and this -result indicated that the main source of the sediment organic matter is the plant remains.. The profile of C/N ratios shows a decrease towards the depth, but lies within that of the oligotrophic lakes and plant tissues and peat. The decay rate of C and N indicated that the main reactivity is in the first 5cm of the sediment, which is subjected to re-suspension and significant bio-turbation. But there existed a uniform decay pattern at 10 cm and 15 cm. In the case of monsoon season and post monsoon season a random character was observed at 15 cm depth, which can be attributed to the effective release of organic matter from that depth zone. To assess the reactivity of the systems, the classic one G model with slight modifications to suit to the system was employed.																			1735-6865	2008-2304				FAL	2008	2	4					329	342																WOS:000259709700002

In the PRM, the ratios of the simulated monthly evapotranspiration relative to the observed potential evaporation were close to or exceeded 1.0 in both of the test subcatchments in the full ponding period with plentiful irrigation water, corresponding to many previous observations of evapotranspiraion rates from paddy fields. Whereas the original HSPF could not consider the backwater effect of the water level in the mainstream, the daily discharge from the lakes simulated by the LDM was dependent on the water level in the mainstream and corresponded to the observed data at the hydrologic stations on the channels connecting each lake with the mainstream, as shown by the daily R-2 (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient) values for Dongting Lake (0.89 in the calibration period, 0.90 in the verification period) and for Poyang Lake (0.84 in the calibration period). For the runoff response from the whole basin simulated by the integrated model, the deviations of runoff volume and values of R-2 were -4.2% and 0.95 in the calibration and verification periods and 1.6% and 0.93, respectively, at Datong hydrologic station, which shows the good applicability of this model as a tool for management of water resources in the Changjiang basin.

Harton (Musa AAB) under different soil water conditions in a humid tropical region	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE												The seasonal effect of soil water availability on leaf gas exchange of plantain plants cv. Harton growing on two different texture soils (loamy and clayey) were evaluated. Soil water deficits corresponded to 48, 24 and 4 days without precipitation. Daily measurements of leaf gas exchange and microclimatic conditions were carried out at 2 h intervals in a humid tropical environment south of Maracaibo Lake, Venezuela. The results show that cv. Harton is sensitive to conditions of low water deficit on loamy and to a much greater degree on clayey soils. A marked reduction in leaf conductance (g(s)) was observed under severe as well as moderate deficit (below 50 mmol m(-2) s(-1)) on clayey soils. Under low deficit g(s) increases to values between 60 and 100 mmol m(-2) s(-1). The same trend was observed in plants on loamy soils but higher gs for all conditions were obtained compared with plants on clayey soil. Stomatal closure produced a reduction of 85 and 55% of total assimilation (A(tot)) for severe and moderate deficit in plants on clayey soils, respectively. While plants on loamy soil exhibited a 65 and 35% reduction, respectively. Water use efficiency (WUE) consistently decreased as available soil water decreased on both soil types. Independently of soil water conditions, higher WUE were always obtained for loamy soils. This suggests that cv. Harton does not have the ability to adjust the CO2 assimilation to transpiration ratio in order to optimize gas exchange. This evidences the importance of maintaining high conditions of available soil water in order to avoid lower assimilation rates that probably influence negatively on yield and fruit quality.

Significant levels of angling-induced brood loss can cause a population-level decrease in reproductive success. If that decrease in reproductive success translates into a decrease in recruitment, the population density and/or size structure of the bass population may be affected negatively. To avoid these potential problems, managers in some parts of North America have implemented regulations designed to protect nesting male bass while they are spawning and guarding their young. The purpose of this study-was to determine if Voluntary Bass Conservation Zones (areas within a lake that are closed voluntarily to all angling until the bass spawning season is over) could be used to protect these highly vulnerable bass from angling. Our results demonstrate first that with sufficient levels of advertisement and community enforcement, a Voluntary Bass Conservation Zone can both reduce levels of angling for nesting bass and increase the reproductive success of the bass population within the zone. They demonstrate second, however, that a Voluntary Bass Conservation Zone that is not properly enforced can actually decrease bass reproductive success by attracting unscrupulous anglers to bass spawning areas, thereby increasing levels of angling for nesting bass.																			0892-2284		1-888569-38-7				2002	31						371	378																WOS:000180817600029

While the isotopic composition of precipitation showed large seasonal variations (2H from140 to+13 parts per thousand and 18O from19.3 to+7.6 parts per thousand), the lake waters were variously affected by evaporation (2H from44 to21 parts per thousand and 18O from5.2 to1.7 parts per thousand) and the groundwater showed varying contribution from mixing with surface water (2H from75 to39 parts per thousand and 18O from10.4 to4.8 parts per thousand). The lake water budget was estimated using a CraigGordon model and isotopic mass balance constraint, which enabled us to identify various water sources and to quantify inflow and outflow for each lake. Moreover, we documented that a variable recharge of lake water into the Tertiary aquifer was dependent on mining drainage intensity. A comparison of coupled 2H18O data with hydrogeological results indicated better precision of the 2H-based calculations.

Two types of combined pond-wetland systems were constructed to store and treat the initial urban surface runoff together with the combined sewer overflow in rainy season and the diluted municipal wastewater or the Moshui Lake water in dry season. After one year, the deposition pond-landscape pond-vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW)-horizontal flow subsurface constructed wetland (HFCW) system was more effective than the deposition pond-HFCW system in removing chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphorous (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and suspended solids (SS). After being treated by the deposition pond-landscape pond-VFCW-HFCW system, the initial influent containing COD 161.0 +/- 28.4mg L-1, TP 2.65 +/- 0.27mg L-1, TN 23.21 +/- 2.04mg L-1, and SS 531.2 +/- 56.2mg L-1 was purified to have the COD, TP, TN, and SS concentrations of 28.1, 0.3, 1.54, and 18.1mg L-1 in the effluent. In the combined pond-wetland system, the main function of the multipond system was storage and pretreatment of the initial urban surface runoff, improvement of landscape aesthetics, and SS removal to prevent the subsequent constructed wetlands from clogging. Moreover, a hybrid system composed of VFCW and the subsequent HFCW presented higher TN removal rate because of the nitrification and the subsequent denitrification process induced by the difference of oxygen transfer capacity in VFCW and HFCW, whereas P removal was mainly influenced by wetland substrates. The aim of this work was to combine the deposition pond-landscape pond system with VFCW-HFCW system to effectively purify the initial urban surface runoff together with the combined sewer overflow and diluted municipal wastewater or Moshui Lake water on an ecoengineering scale.																			1092-8758	1557-9018				DEC	2010	27	12					1027	1034		10.1089/ees.2010.0028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ees.2010.0028													WOS:000285093800005

However, without rehabilitation, these voids represent a potential environmental risk. The aim of the present work was to assess, for the first time, the water quality, i.e., physicochemical characteristics, metal and metalloid (MM) content, and ecotoxicity of the waters of the El Cobre Blue Lagoon, a pit lake formed in an open-pit copper mine in Cuba. Potential effects of rainy season vs. dry season and spatial location (different depths) on water characteristics were considered. Results revealed that water contained was moderately acidic (pH=4.6 +/- 0.2), with high electrical conductivity (EC=3.02 +/- 0.03mScm(-1)), whatever the season. Dissolved oxygen (DO=9.9 +/- 2.0mgL(-1)), total dissolved solid (TDS=7003 +/- 245mgL(-1)), and sulfate concentration (6556 +/- 1410mgL(-1)) in the El Cobre Blue Lagoon water were above acceptable limits for sources of surface water as recommended by Cuban standard (NC 1021:2014). High copper (43.6 +/- 1.7mgL(-1)) and manganese (24.1 +/- 1.1mgL(-1)) contents were detected. Except for EC, sulfates, chlorides, TDS, nitrates, and phosphates, other physicochemical parameters were stable between dry and rainy seasons (p<0.05). El Cobre Blue Lagoon waters showed an ecotoxicological impact on Vibrio fischeri. No significant differences were detected between all sampling points in the lake for each parameter monitored for a given time. These first results show the spatial homogeneity but poor quality of waters from El Cobre Blue Lagoon. Remediation processes need to be implemented in order to lessen the human and environmental health risk and favor potential water reuse. We suggest the use of constructed wetlands for water treatment. This preliminary research work can serve to alert Cuban local public authorities to the need to rehabilitate such sites.

J	Lapen, DR; Hayhoe, HN				Lapen, DR; Hayhoe, HN			Spatial analysis of seasonal and annual temperature and precipitation normals in southern Ontario, Canada	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												This study presents some univariate and multivariate low-pass filtering methodologies (ordinary kriging, ordinary cokriging, modified residual kriging, inverse distance weighting) to spatially model seasonal temperature and precipitation normals in an environment where climate patterns are variably modified by regional water bodies and physiography. Cross-validation and maps of modeled climate patterns are used as a criteria to assess particular climate realizations. The results of the exercise show how an agro-climatologist might use these methods to assess spatial representations of the modeled phenomena, the relevance of covariates, and the shortcomings and strengths of different techniques to characterize lake-physiography-climate interactions on a seasonal basis. The methods are also useful for evaluating station networks for capturing important Great Lakes climate patterns.																			0380-1330						2003	29	4					529	544		10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70457-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0380-1330(03)70457-2													WOS:000187946400001

This study investigates the effect of this gradient on physiological characteristics [tissue nitrogen content, maximal photosynthetic efficiency (F-v/F-m), glutathione levels and redox ratio, absorbance and absorption spectra] of the green macroalga Ulva spp. Mats were sampled during the build-up (June), stationary (July), and decomposing (September) phases of a macroalgal bloom in the Veerse Meer, a eutrophic brackish (salinity 15-20 psu) lake in the southwest Netherlands. Water samples were taken for nutrient analyses. At all three sampling dates, the mats were composed almost entirely of Ulva spp.; in September the mats were in decay and covered with silt and epiphytes. In June and July, total dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration (DIN) of the water within the mat was significantly higher than outside the mat. Pronounced vertical differences were found in tissue N, F-v/F-m values, total glutathione levels, glutathione redox ratios, and absorbance. In June and July, tissue N decreased from over 2.2% dry weight (DW; N-sufficient) in the bottom layers to around 1% DW (minimum level for survival) in the top layers. Wide-band absorption increased with depth in the mat and throughout the season, probably due to higher Chl a and b and lutein contents. The shape of the absorption spectrum was similar for all layers. The absorption of the silt/epiphyte film on the top Ulva layer was highest; its absorption spectrum (high absorption in the 500-560 nm range) indicates that the film on the top layers of the macroalgal mats mainly consisted of diatoms. In June, F-v/F-m and the glutathione redox ratio of the algae increased with depth in the layer, while total glutathione decreased. Low F-v/F-m values in the bottom and middle layers in September reflect the bad condition of the algae; the mats were largely decaying. It is concluded that multiple growth-limiting gradients occur in macroalgal mats: upper layers suffer from nitrogen limitation and photoinhibition while bottom layers are light limited. The algae in the mat acclimatize to low light conditions by increasing their absorption through increased pigment contents and by higher photosynthetic efficiency during the build-up and stationary period. This study qualifies the glutathione redox ratio as a promising candidate for stress indicator in macroalgae and provides suggestions for its further development.					; Malta, Erik-jan/AAK-5662-2020; KROMKAMP, JACCO/A-7319-2013	Malta, Erik-jan/0000-0002-3934-3807; 													0025-3162	1432-1793				NOV	2003	143	5					1029	1038		10.1007/s00227-003-1134-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-003-1134-4													WOS:000186463800021
J	Fischer, JM; Klug, JL; Ives, AR; Frost, TM				Fischer, JM; Klug, JL; Ives, AR; Frost, TM			Ecological history affects zooplankton community responses to acidification	ECOLOGY												The effects of ecological history are frequently ignored in attempts to predict community responses to environmental change. In this study, we explored the, possibility that ecological history can cause differences in community responses to perturbation using parallel acidification experiments in three sites with different PH histories in the Northern Highland Lake District of Wisconsin, USA. In Trout Lake, high acid neutralizing capacity had historically buffered changes in pH. In contrast, the two basins of Little Rock Lake (Little Rock-Reference and Little Rock-Treatment) had experienced seasonal fluctuations in pH. Furthermore, the two lake basins were separated with a curtain and Little Rock-Treatment was experimentally acidified in the late 1980s. In each site, we conducted mesocosm experiments to compare zooplankton community dynamics in control (ambient pH) and acidified (pH 4.7) treatments. Zooplankton community responses were strongest in Trout Lake and weakest in Little Rock-Treatment suggesting that ecological history affected responses to acidification. In part, variation in community sensitivity to acidification was driven by differences in species composition. However, the results of a reciprocal transplant experiment indicated that changes in the acid tolerance of populations during past acidification events may make zooplankton communities less sensitive to subsequent pH stress. Our study highlights the role that ecological history may play in community-level responses to environmental change.

One hundred and twenty species of fish, belonging to 26 families and nine different orders were recorded. Compared to previous studies (1936-1976), only 53 % of families, 32 % of genera and 54 % of species were collected by professional fishing lot. This important loss in biodiversity could have several causes: bias of sampling procedures between professional fishing and research sampling, overfishing, modification of the floodplain by deforestation, etc. The professional fishing data showed that Cypriniformes accounted for 41.6 % of the total number of individuals caught, the Cyprinidae family alone represented 40 species. Siluriformes made up 21.6 %, Perciformes 13.3 %, with six other orders represented by smaller numbers. Eighty-seven percent of the recorded species occur in both habitats depending on the season. Migration takes place from the Mekong river to the Gnat Lake through the Tonle Sap river at the beginning of the rainy season (May-October), and in the reverse direction at the start of the dry season (November-February). The majority of the species reproduce at the start of the rainy season (May-June) in the hooded plain and the forest floodplain of the Great Lake: the period, the place and the means of reproduction have not been closely studied, particularly for the Belontiformes, Clupeiformes, Synbranchiformes, Pleuronectiformes and Tetraodontiformes. Multivariate analysis of fishing data (November-February) shows three distinct communities: that of the lake (Perciformes and Siluriformes), of the river (Pleuronectiformes, Cypriniformes, Clupeiformes and Siluriformes), and of the transitional zone formed from the principal channel, the old river channel and the oxbow lakes (Cypriniformes, Siluriformes and Osteoglossiformes).

Sensitivity of the Parameterizations of Vertical Mixing and Radiative Heat Fluxes on the Seasonal Evolution of the Thermal Structure of Lake Erie	ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN												A sensitivity analysis of the parameterizations of vertical mixing and radiative fluxes on the seasonal evolution of Lake Erie's thermal structure is performed using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) and the General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM). The models have the same horizontal resolution and are forced with observed meteorological data from April to October of 2002 and 2008. For turbid waters like Lake Erie, the three-band model for the parameterization of downward shortwave radiation produces more accurate temperatures in the thermocline and less error in simulating the mixed-layer depths than the widely used two-band model. Although the two models differ in vertical and horizontal mixing, numerical methods, and vertical discretization, they produced qualitatively comparable results. Comparison with observations shows that the models can reproduce the time evolution of the lake temperature reasonably well. The MITgcm and the GETM with the Mellor-Yamada level 2.5 (MY2.5) closure produce a deeper mixed layer than observed at a station located in the eastern basin, causing large errors in simulating the temperature in the thermocline while the GETM, using a turbulence scheme called gen, reproduces a mixed layer in better agreement with observations. The mixed-layer obtained with the k-epsilon closure is between those obtained with gen and MY2.5. The error in simulating the mixed-layer depths and the thermocline temperature at a station located in the central basin using the gen closure and the GETM was about 2 degrees C lower than that obtained by the K-Profile Parameterization mixing scheme of the MITgcm. The models simulated a lake-wide anticyclonic circulation occupying the southwest part of the central basin but showed distinct differences in simulating gyres in the northwestern part of the central basin and in the eastern basin of the lake. The signature of a basin-scale Poincare wave observed in the current data is also well represented by the two models. Resume[Traduit par la redaction] Nous effectuons une analyse de sensibilite des parametrisations du melange vertical et des flux radiatifs sur l'evolution saisonniere de la structure thermique du lac Erie a l'aide du modele de circulation generale du Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MITgcm) et du General Estuarine Transport Model (GETM). Les modeles ont la meme resolution horizontale et sont forces par des donnees meteorologiques observees entre avril et octobre de 2002 a 2008. Pour des eaux troubles comme celles du lac Erie, le modele a trois bandes pour la parametrisation du rayonnement descendant de courtes longueurs d'onde produit des temperatures plus precise dans la thermocline et moins d'erreur dans la simulation des epaisseurs de la couche de melange que le modele a deux bandes largement utilise. Meme si les deux modeles different dans le melange vertical et horizontal, dans les methodes numeriques et dans la discretisation verticale, ils produisent des resultats qualitativement comparables. La comparaison aux observations montre que les modeles peuvent reproduire assez bien l'evolution temporelle de la temperature du lac. Le MITgcm et le GETM avec la fermeture Mellor-Yamada niveau 2.5 (MY2. 5) produisent une couche de melange plus epaisse que celle observee a une station situee dans le bassin est, ce qui cause de grosses erreurs de simulation de la temperature dans la thermocline, mais quand le GETM utilise un schema de turbulence appele << gen >>, il reproduit une couche de melange qui correspond mieux aux observations. La couche de melange obtenue a l'aide de la fermeture k-epsilon est entre celles obtenues avec la gen et la MY2.5. L'erreur dans la simulation des epaisseurs de la couche de melange et de la temperature de la thermocline a une station situee dans le bassin central en utilisant la fermeture gen et le GETM etait d'environ 2 degrees C plus basse que celle obtenue au moyen du schema de melange de la parametrisation K-Profile du MITgcm. Les modeles ont simule, pour l'ensemble du lac, une circulation anticyclonique occupant la partie sud-ouest du bassin central mais ont affiche des differences notables dans la simulation des tourbillons dans la partie nord-ouest du bassin central et dans le bassin est du lac. La signature d'une onde de Poincare a l'echelle du bassin observee dans les donnees sur les courants est egalement bien representee par les deux modeles.

J	Schmidt-Mumm, U; Janauer, G				Schmidt-Mumm, Udo; Janauer, Georg			Seasonal dynamics of the shoreline vegetation in the Zapatosa floodplain lake complex, Colombia	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Floodplain lakes and associated wetlands in tropical dry climates are controlled by pronounced and severe seasonal hydrologic fluctuations. We examined the plant community response to a bimodal flooding pattern in the Zapatosa Floodplain Lake Complex (ZFLC), Northern Colombia. We measured floristic and quantitative change in four sampling periods emphasizing seasonal differences in plant abundance and life-form structure. Of 79 species identified in the lake complex, 52 were used to characterize eight community types via classification and ordination procedures. Results showed that community structure does not change significantly during the flooding/receding stages. But maximum drawdown phase significantly disrupts the aquatic community structure and the exposed shorelines become colonized by ruderal terrestrial plants. Early rainfalls at the beginning of the wet season are emphasized as an important feature of plant regeneration and community development. The general strategy of the ZFLC vegetation can be framed into the flood pulse concept of river-floodplain systems. Thus, plant communities are mainly responding to disturbances and destruction events imposed by extreme water level fluctuations.

A shift from turbid water with sparse macrophyte cover (Potamogeton perfoliatus, Potamogeton pectinatus) towards clear water with a dense cover of submerged vegetation (Chara spp.) has been observed in the lakes over the past 10 years. Relatively large Chara meadows (300-500 ha) have recently developed in both lakes. The composition of macroinvertebrate fauna was determined at sites varying in cover and dominant vegetation type by sampling sediment and water during 1992 and 1994. Macrophyte biomass, sampling year and vegetation type were the major determinants of macroinvertebrate community composition. Valvata piscinalis, Bithynia tentaculata, Gammarus tigrinus and Chironomus sp. characterized the sites with high charophyte biomass, whereas Potamopyrgus antipodarum, Cladotanytarsus sp., Stictochironomus sp. dominated the samples with low charophyte biomass. Chara vegetation was different from Potamogeton sp. by showing lower densities of the midge larvae Einfeldia dissidens and Cricotopus gr. sylvestris. Seasonal variations in densities of the dominant mollusc species (V. piscinalis, P. antipodarum) were closely related to the development of Chara biomass as well as to periphyton cover on charophytes. Thus, changes of the light climate in both lakes, which have led to an increase in colonization by submerged vegetation (particular Chara meadows), indirectly had a large impact on macroinvertebrate communities.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JAN 17	1997	342						143	150		10.1023/A:1017094013491	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1017094013491													WOS:A1997WZ13900017
J	ZOLTAI, SC; VITT, DH				ZOLTAI, SC; VITT, DH			CANADIAN WETLANDS - ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS AND CLASSIFICATION	VEGETATIO					IV International Wetlands Conference on Wetlands - Old World and New World	1992	COLUMBUS, OH					The Canadian Wetland Classification System is based on manifestations of ecological processes in natural wetland ecosystems. It is hierarchical in structure and designed to allow identification at the broadest levels (class, form, type) by non-experts in different disciplines. The various levels are based on broad physiognomy and hydrology (classes); surface morphology (forms); and vegetation physiognomy (types). For more detailed studies, appropriate characterization and subdivisions can be applied. For ecological studies the wetlands can be further characterized by their chemical environment, each with distinctive indicator species, acidity, alkalinity, and base cation content. For peatlands, both chemical and vegetational differences indicate that the primary division should be acidic, Sphagnum-dominated bogs and poor fens on one hand and circumneutral to alkaline, brown moss-dominated rich fens on the other. Non peat-forming wetlands (marshes, swamps) lack the well developed bryophyte ground layer of the fens and bogs, and are subject to severe seasonal water level fluctuations. The Canadian Wetland Classification System has been successfully used in Arctic, Subarctic, Boreal and Temperate regions of Canada.																			0042-3106					JUN	1995	118	1-2					131	137		10.1007/BF00045195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00045195													WOS:A1995RW03600011

Increasing dissimilarity of water chemical compositions in a warmer climate	GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES												Understanding variability patterns of biogeochemical conditions in water is a key issue for water management strategies. Here a unique homogeneous data set of 1041 Swedish boreal lakes, sampled during three lake inventories along an 8 degrees latitudinal temperature gradient, revealed a systematic increase in the variability of the water chemical composition between lakes with increasing temperatures. The variability pattern was consistent on a spatial and temporal scale and became especially apparent for water chemical variables showing an in-lake biological process-driven seasonality, such as nitrogen, pH, silica, and organic carbon. The degree of dissimilarity in the chemical composition between lakes was well related to the duration of the main growing and runoff season (D-T > 0), both on a spatial scale (R-2 = 0.57-0.79, P < 0.05) and a temporal scale (R-2 = 0.99, P < 0.05). It is suggested that D-T > 0 is a very suitable proxy to explain biogeochemical variability patterns between lakes. According to this study, a further temperature increase will result in an increased biogeochemical dissimilarity between lakes.

MULTIPLE CAUSES OF SEEDLING RARITY IN SCRUB PLUM, PRUNUS GENICULATA (ROSACEAE), AN ENDANGERED SHRUB OF THE FLORIDA SCRUB	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Conservation of an imperiled plant often requires an understanding of its reproductive ecology. Scrub plum (Prunus geniculata) is an endangered Florida shrub endemic to pyrogenic xeric uplands. Although plants are long-lived and may flower profusely, particularly after burning, fruit yield is sparse and seedlings are rare. We investigated potential causes of seedling rarity in scrub plum by studying its floral sex and breeding systems, fruit development, and germination ecology. We also developed a flow chart based on two time-since-fire scenarios to illustrate the cumulative impact of these factors on seedling recruitment. Breeding system experiments suggested partial gametophytic self-incompatibility in this functionally andromonoecious species, with inbreeding depression in self-compatible individuals. Predispersal seed predation, the major constraint on seedling recruitment, was lower in the first postburn season. In two field experiments, seed germination was <11% irrespective of treatment. These results indicate that seedling recruitment in scrub plum may be limited by multiple factors, including sexual reproductive failure, high predispersal seed predation, and low seed germination. The chance of a bisexual flower producing a seedling ranges from 5 in 1000 to 5 in 100000, depending on the time since fire. Restoration of scrub plum's historical fire regime may mitigate some of these factors.

Contribution of Caridina nilotica (Roux) in the dagaa fishery in Lake Victoria, Tanzania	AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT												The contribution of Caridina nilotica in the Rastrineobola argentea (dagaa) fishery was assessed at nine beaches in the Tanzanian part of Lake Victoria from May, 2001 to April, 2002. Additional data on dagaa and Caridina catches from Sweya beach between October, 2000 and April, 2001 were also included. Two main methods are used to catch R. argentea and Caridina in the Tanzanian waters of Lake Victoria: mosquito seine nets (5 mm and 10 mm mesh sizes) and catamaran lift nets (8 mm mesh sizes). The majority of the beaches used mosquito seine nets as the main gear; lift net fishing was dominant at Igombe and Busekera beaches. Between May, 2001 and April, 2002, 157,390 t of dagaa were harvested in the Tanzanian waters of Lake Victoria; mosquito seine nets harvested 139,674 t (89%) compared with 17,716 t by lift nets (11%). CPUE was 244 and 337 kg boat(-1) day(-1) respectively for lift nets and mosquito seine nets. A total of 17,326 t of Caridina was harvested in the Tanzanian waters of Lake Victoria during the same period. More Caridina was harvested by mosquito seine nets (95%) than by lift nets (5%). Catch-per-unit-effort ( CPUE; kg boat(-1) day(-1)) for Caridina ranged between 1.87 and 45 kg boat(-1) day(-1), and varied with respect to location, time and fishing method. Sweya beach exhibited the highest CPUE and the lowest was at Nyangombe beach. High CPUEs for Caridina were found during the rainy season at Sweya, Igombe, Kome and Busekera beaches. The rest of the beaches exhibited high CPUE during the dry season. CPUE of Caridina in lift nets was greater than in mosquito seines at Igombe and Busekera beaches. However, CPUE for dagaa at Igombe was higher for mosquito seines than lift nets. Reasons for these differences are unknown but probably relate to the location of fishing, particularly between inshore and offshore locations. Haplochromine cichlids were also abundant in the R. argentea catches at Igombe beach. The highest CPUE for haplochromines was at Igombe in January, 2002 and the lowest in June, 2001 (average CPUE for haplochromine cichlids at Igombe was 736 +/- 746 kg boat(-1) day(-1) for lift nets). The total haplochromine catch for the region was estimated at 53,446 t. The carapace length (mm CL) distribution of Caridina in R. argentea commercial catches ranged between 1.5 mm CL and 8 mm CL depending on the gear used.

Finding source of salinization could help devise appropriate measures for solving the problem. The present study was taken up to investigate the source of salinity in an area (1229 ha) lying between the Sile and Elgo rivers near Chamo Lake. The area has remained uncultivated since 2012 and is showing signs of salinity in the form of white deposit on the soil surface. Surface water, groundwater, and soil samples were obtained based on the research area's proximity to potential influencing sources of salinity and fertility decline during the dry and wet seasons. Groundwater samples were taken from seven piezometric stations and eight hand-dug wells while surface water samples were taken from two river sites and four wetland points. The soil samples were taken from four locations. The laboratory results of the groundwater samples in piper diagrams revealed a salt dominance of Ca+2, Mg+2, and Na+ with SO4-2 and Cl-. According to the Arc GIS 10.4.1 flow direction analysis tool, the flow direction of the regional water table towards the lake was northwest to south and southeast. The correlation analysis in Python revealed that Na+ and K+, as well as SO4-2 and Cl-, were the most common salt types. Gibbs' theories typically highlighted continuous rock weathering as a significant source of salts in the soils.

The degradation in biodiversity due to the invasive and non-native species could raise ecological, economic, and socio-cultural problems for the community. In Lake Batur, there are several fish introduction activities since 1935. Many introduced fish species have turned invasive and could alter the structure of fish communities. It is important to have a solid understanding of how invasive species affect an ecosystem and its biodiversity. Despite numerous studies on fish diversity in Lake Batur, the accurate information on fish diversity and the presence of non-native species in Lake Batur is still not completely known. This paper aims to investigate the diversity of fish in Lake Batur to provide accurate information about the composition of fish species and the presence of existing non-native and invasive fish in Lake Batur. We collected fish samples during the dry season from 30 August-5 September 2022. We used experimental gillnets (30 x 2 m, with mesh size of 16 mm; 25 mm; 37.5 mm; 50 mm; 62.5 mm; and 75 mm), fish nets from the fishing communities (mesh size of 50-75 mm), fishing rods, and scoops. Direct identifications were conducted for the fish samples in the location. For unidentified fish, we preserved the fish sample for further identification. A total of 1104 fish samples from lakes and floating net cages with five different stations were collected. In contrast to the others station, station 4 Abangsongan has all fish species. We obtained 17 species distributed among 8 families. Cichlidae is the most dominant fish family, including the non-native species Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and Midas cichlids (Amphilophus citrinellus). Furthermore, Midas cichlid has become invasive with a very rapid increase during the last 10 years in Lake Batur.

Systems modeling can replicate the interactions but extensive parameterization, high complexity, and long development cycles present barriers to widespread adoption. To address these challenges, we develop the Machine Learning Water Systems Model (ML-WSM) - a novel application of data-driven modeling for MWS management. We apply the ML-WSM framework to the Salt Lake City, Utah water system, where we benchmark prediction performance on the seasonal response of reservoir levels, groundwater withdrawal, and imported water requests to climate anomalies at a daily resolution against an existing systems model. The MLWSM accurately predicts the seasonal dynamics of all components; especially during supply-limiting conditions (KGE > 0.88, PBias < +/- 3%). Extreme wet conditions challenged model skill but the ML-WSM communicated the appropriate seasonal trends and relationships to component thresholds (e.g., reservoir dead pool). The model correctly classified nearly all instances of vulnerability (83%) and peak severity (100%), encouraging its use as a guidance tool that complements systems models for evaluating the influences of climate on MWS performance.

However, while the final disappearance of the LIS during the Holocene is rather well constrained, the response of sea ice during the resulting meltwater events is not fully understood. Here, we present reconstructions of paleoceanographic changes over the past 9.3 Kyr BP on the northwestern Labrador Shelf, with a special focus on the interaction between the final meltwater event around 8.2 Kyr BP and sea ice and phytoplankton productivity (e.g., IP25, HBI III (Z), brassicasterol, dinosterol, biogenic opal, total organic carbon). Our records indicate low sea-ice cover and high phytoplankton productivity on the Labrador Shelf prior to 8.9 Kyr BP, sea-ice formation was favored by decreased surface salinities due to the meltwater events from Lake Agassiz-Ojibway and the Hudson Bay Ice Saddle from 8.55 Kyr BP onwards. For the past ca. 7.5 Kyr BP sea ice is mainly transported to the study area by local ocean currents such as the inner Labrador and Baffin Current. Our findings provide new insights into the response of sea ice to increased meltwater discharge as well as shifts in atmospheric and oceanic circulation.					; Doering, Kristin/ABD-4916-2020	Hamann, Christian/0000-0001-7638-8230; Doering, Kristin/0000-0002-7900-2169; Stein, Ruediger/0000-0002-4453-9564													2572-4517	2572-4525				SEP	2023	38	9							e2022PA004578	10.1029/2022PA004578	http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2022PA004578													WOS:001065874400001
J	Xie, T; Ma, YJ				Xie, Ting; Ma, Yu-Jun			Simulation of Soil Temperature under Plateau Zokor's (Eospalax baileyi) Disturbance in the Qinghai Lake Watershed, Northeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau	ANIMALS												Simple Summary: The plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi) is one of the main native soil mammals on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and plays a key role in the terrestrial ecosystem there. Its disturbance will alter the soil properties and vegetation characteristics, and further, distinctly affect soil temperature. This study analyzed the soil temperature variation in three land surface types (grassland, mound, and bald patch) under the plateau zokor's disturbance from October 2018 to July 2020, and investigated the effect of environmental parameters on soil temperature change in the Qinghai Lake watershed. The results showed that: (1) The daily range of soil temperature was mound > bald patch > grassland, which became smaller as the depth increased. The appearance time of the maximum and minimum soil temperature at most depths showed the following order: mound, bald patch, then grassland. (2) The SHAW (simultaneous heat and water) model was applicable for the simulation of soil temperature under the plateau zokor's disturbance, especially during the growing season. (3) The influence of vegetation characteristics on soil temperature change was relatively smaller compared with soil properties after the disturbance of plateau zokor. The soil temperature is a key factor affecting the fragile terrestrial ecosystems on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and has been remarkably altered by the soil mammal's disturbance. This study first analyzed the soil temperature variation in grassland, mound, and bald patch under the disturbance of plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi) from October 2018 to July 2020 in the Qinghai Lake watershed. Then, the SHAW (simultaneous heat and water) model was used to simulate the soil temperature change of three land surface types, and the sensitivity of soil temperature to environmental parameters before and after the disturbance was explored. The results showed the following: (1) The daily range of soil temperature was mound > bald patch > grassland, which became smaller as the depth increased, due to the co-influence of vegetation coverage and soil bulk density. There was an obvious hysteresis of soil heat transfer for grassland, as compared with mound and bald patch, especially at 5 and 15 cm depths. (2) The SHAW model was applicable for the simulation of soil temperature under the plateau zokor's disturbance, especially during the growing season, and had better simulation accuracy for deep soil. (3) Air-entry potential and pore-size distribution index obviously affected soil temperature change, because of the change in root system and soil pores under the plateau zokor's disturbance. With the evolution of disturbance process, the response of soil temperature to the leaf area index weakened gradually, owing to the different duration of disturbance and restoration. In general, the plateau zokor's disturbance alters the soil properties and vegetation characteristics, and further, distinctly affects heat transfer and soil temperature.																			2076-2615					SEP	2023	13	17							2703	10.3390/ani13172703	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani13172703								37684967					WOS:001064037800001

Preferred crystal orientation in fresh water ice	COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Crystal orientations in lake ice have been the subject of considerable attention due to their influence on albedo and stability during the melt season. It has been reported in the literature that ice sheets on freshwater bodies develop preferred crystal orientations. In some ice sheets c-axis vertical crystals become dominant, in others, c-axis horizontal dominate. However, the reasons for these differences are unclear, and it has been suggested that the preferred orientation depends either on the thermal characteristics of the water body or on whether the ice is seeded. The experiments presented here confirm that in seeded fresh water ice sheets the favored c-axis orientation is horizontal, regardless of the bulk temperature gradient in the water column. However, these experiments also suggest that the temperature gradient close to the interface is influenced by seeding. We propose that the partial melting of seeds prior to freezing of seeded ice sheets creates conditions favorable to the growth of c-axis horizontal crystals. Alternatively unseeded ice sheets, grown under the same conditions, develop a preference for c-axis vertical crystals. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Performance of this system was evaluated by both bench-scale and pilot-scale experiments. The system showed relatively good removal efficiency of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and suspended solids, but removal efficiencies of total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) were not so impressive. Correlated regression models provided good estimates of the nutrient removal performance in this system. Hydraulic retention time (HRT) had a positive effect on nutrient removal. Ambient temperature had no obvious relationship with the suspended solids (SS) and TP removal in the system. By contrast, ambient temperature had a significant effect on COD removal (p<0.05). Furthermore, the nutrients were hard to remove in cold seasons. During the operation period, this system showed high treatment capacity for rural domestic wastewater treatment with good landscape integration. Results demonstrated that this IST+CMFB system could be a practical technology for onsite domestic wastewater treatment in rural areas.					张, 亮/AGR-2540-2022; Mao, Xuhui/H-1552-2013	Wen, Cheng/0000-0003-3546-9813; Mao, Xuhui/0000-0003-1720-255X; zhang, liang/0000-0002-9074-1034													1092-8758	1557-9018				APR	2009	26	4					775	782		10.1089/ees.2008.0099	http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ees.2008.0099													WOS:000264564900010

The biodiversity of Salt Lake Acigol (Turkey), an internationally recognized ecosystem, is presently endangered by management plans. This study aims to analyse the ostracod community to establish its ecological status as a base for future paleoecological studies using ostracods to reconstruct the recent evolution of this wetland. Samples were collected seasonally and 13 species were recorded. Multivariate classification and ordination statistical methods revealed a major difference between assemblages related to the relative abundance of species tolerant of desiccation vs. species preferring permanent waters. Cyprideis torosa, mainly found in saline, low diversity sites, is a euryhaline species regarded as an indicator of future lake conditions if inappropriate water resource management continues.					; Mesquita-Joanes, Francesc/F-3200-2011	Altinsacli, Selcuk/0000-0002-0059-0448; Mesquita-Joanes, Francesc/0000-0001-7168-1980													0022-2933						2008	42	13-14					7013	1025		10.1080/00222930701851735	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222930701851735													WOS:000256965100002

During the ice-free period of Lago Paione Superiore (LPS, Italian Central Alps) we measured species-specific direct uptake of fluorescently labelled bacteria (FLB) by MxFl and D. longispina. Bacterial production of DNA and protein and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were also measured. Between ice melt and September, the most common groups of MxFl in the lake were Gymnodinium spp., Dinobryon sertulaiia, Chromulina spp. and Ochromonas sp. On average they ingested 2.9, 3.7, 9.3 and 14.6 bacterial cells ind.(-1) h(-1), respectively, whereas D. longispina ingested 1.9 x 10(6) bacterial cells ind.(-1)h(-1). The MxFl community ingestion rate was always higher than the rate of D. longispina, except in mid August when the D. longispina population ingested 2.4 times more bacteria than MxFl. Rates of MxFI and D. longispina grazing did not show any significant correlation with bacterial abundance and biomass (p Spearman, p > 0.05), but a significant correlation was found between MxFI grazing and thymidine uptake at 9 m (p Spearman = 0.821, p < 0.014, xy pairs = 7). It appears that D. longispina actively feeds on bacteria when it first appears in the lake, but that overall the D. longispina population had a lesser impact on bacteria than did MxFl.

Captive American kestrels (Falco sparverius), fed PCB-spiked (Aroclor((R)) 1248:1254:1260) food (7 mg/kg body weight/d) prior to and during the first breeding season only (100 d) laid eggs with environmentally relevant levels of total PCBs (34.0 mug/g whole egg wet wt vs 0 mug/g for controls). Reproduction changed during, not after, PCB exposure in this two-year study. The PCB-exposed pairs laid smaller clutches later in the season and laid more totally infertile clutches. Hatching success was reduced in PCB-exposed pairs, and 50% of PCB nestlings died within 3 d of hatching, Nearly 60% of PCB-exposed pairs with hatchlings failed to produce fledglings. Higher levels of total PCB residues and congeners were associated with later clutch initiation and fewer fertile eggs, hatchlings, and fledglings. We suggest that nonpersistent PCB congeners have a greater influence on reproduction than do persistent congeners.					; Fernie, Kim/NPJ-3036-2025; Smits, Judit/E-8225-2012	Smits, Judit/0000-0001-5341-4088; Fernie, Kim/0000-0003-3073-3208													0730-7268	1552-8618				APR	2001	20	4					776	781		10.1002/etc.5620200412	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620200412								11345453					WOS:000170165700012

J	Brendonck, L; Riddoch, BJ				Brendonck, L; Riddoch, BJ			Egg bank dynamics in anostracan desert rock pool populations (Crustacea: Branchiopoda)	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Egg densities were monitored in the dry sediment of four desert rock pool populations of the fairy shrimp Branchipodopsis wolfi over different years/seasons. Egg densities varied according to pool and season/year between about 1,000 and 220,000 eggs per m(2). This converts to population sizes of between about 200 and 500,000 viable diapausing eggs per pool. Egg densities are within the range of 10(3) to 10(5) eggs per m(2) usually measured for other zooplankton species with egg banks. Egg densities were associated but not significantly correlated with chances for successful recruitment in each of the pools as estimated from direct observations of pool hydrocycles and from pool morphometry. Egg bank densities were also not significantly linked with maturation rate and average brood size of the respective populations. Egg densities fluctuate in a partially asynchronosus way among the pools suggesting that factors other than chances for recruitment are also important in controlling egg bank dynamics. The large variance (CV greater than or equal to 80 %) in egg densities over the seasons in unvegetated pools with loose and sparse sediment in comparison with vegetated pools (CV <40 %) with compact sediment holding the eggs, is suggestive of the overriding importance of stochastic passive dispersal by wind or overflows. Earlier reproduction and larger average broods in the short-lived pools also weaken a positive correlation between habitat suitability and egg bank density. The relatively high egg densities of B. wolfi egg banks illustrate the effectiveness of the reproductive and hatching characteristics of this species to successfully persist in this extreme type of temporary habitat. This is the first study on egg bank dynamics in large branchiopods.						Brendonck, Luc/0000-0001-5383-1420													0003-9136					APR	2000	148	1					71	84																WOS:000086710000006
J	Stager, JC; Johnson, TC				Stager, JC; Johnson, TC			A 12,400 14C yr offshore diatom record from east central Lake Victoria, East Africa	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY												The diatom record of V95-2P, a 7.6 m long sediment core collected from 67 m depth, is the first from the east central portion of Lake Victoria. A soil horizon developed at the coring site shortly before 12,400 C-14 yr BP due to a lakewide desiccation event. The radiocarbon chronology of the older half of this core is problematic, but if our estimated chronology is correct, then aridity and evaporative concentration of the lake are indicated by the presence of Thalassiosira rudolfi from > 12,400 BP to about 10,000 BP. Abundant Aulacoseira and generally rising biogenic silica concentrations may reflect enhanced water column mixing and rising precipitation:evaporation ratios ca. 10,000-8400 BP. A lakewide reorganization of diatom assemblages occurred around 7200 BP, when Aulacoseira nyassensis largely replaced A. granulata and after which rainfall and wind-driven mixing became more seasonally restricted. Pronounced reductions in offshore diatom deposition, from about 8300-5800 BP and after 3500 BP, may have been related to declines in the duration and/or intensity of wind-driven mixing. Increased aridity, and possibly deforestation in the lake basin, is indicated after 1400 BP.

Chao Lake has received N loadings, primarily from the agroecosystem that surrounds it. Based on 10 years of field monitoring and experiment, this study used optimum fertilizer rates (30% N reduction) to evaluate nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and N export in the Chao Lake watershed of paddy rice-wheat rotational farming.Methods: Five treatments were tested, namely, the Blank Treatment (CK), Conventional Fertilization Treatment (CFT), High Fertilization Treatment (HFT), Reduced Fertilization Treatment (CFT), Reduced Fertilization Treatment plus Straw addition (RFTS). The parameters employed to measure NUE were 1) by calculating NUE indicators; Agronomic efficiency (kg kg(-1)), recovery efficiency (%), and partial factor productivity (kg kg(-1)) 2) using the European Union NUE framework as a comparison tool. N export was measured using N export parameters, namely, nitrogen loading (kg ha(-1)yr(-1)), nitrogen runoff loss ratio (%), and net nitrogen runoff loss ratio (%).Results and discussion: Results revealed that optimum N fertilizer input levels maintained high crop and biomass yields. The empirical model of y = y(0) + a * exp (-0.5 * (x-x(0))/b(2)) explains the relationships between input N fertilizer and corresponding yield returns. Low yield responses to increased N input beyond certain limits were observed, which may lead to N accumulations. N export was much lower from the reduced fertilization treatments than other treatments. N export increased in 10 years for both paddy rice and wheat seasons. Runoff volume influenced N export more than any other environmental factor studied.Conclusion: Overall, optimal fertilizer levels produced high NUE, maintained high economic yield, and produced lesser N exports; NUE was in the order of reduced > high > conventional fertilization treatments, while it decreased in 10 years (2008-2018) across all treatments. Such strategies that further reduce fertilizer levels by accounting for excess supplies are vital for consolidating effective N control measures.

The signs specifically prohibit vehicle use of roads in proximity to lakes with remote (i.e., floatplane accessible) tourism during the first 2 weeks of the regular (i.e., rifles, shotguns, and muzzle-loaders) moose (Alces alces) hunting season. Vehicle use in restricted areas was measured by counts from traffic monitoring devices during the first 4 weeks of the hunting season (2 weeks during and 2 weeks after the restriction) at 14 sites with signs and another 14 sites without signs. The results suggest that these signs limit some, but not all, traffic in areas during the first 2 weeks of moose hunting.

The lakes have level variations of at least 50 m over yearly cycles. Seasonal variations of SP associated with lake-level variations are observed on five points of the array. For three points located on the banks of the lakes, a positive correlation to the lake-level variations is observed with a maximal amplitude of about 180 mV, corresponding to an average response of 2.4 mV per meter of water. For two points located on the bottom of each lake, the correlation is negative, with a maximal magnitude of about 50 mV, corresponding to an average response of -1.1 mV per meter of water. Two independent temporary electrical arrays located on the banks of each lake confirm these measurements and allow a better spatial characterization of the sources associated with the observed SP variations. In particular, near the Roselend lake, the electrical response to lake-level variations is increasing for decreasing altitude. The measured SP variations are proposed to result from the electrokinetic coupling associated with a vertical groundwater flow connecting a constant pore pressure source to the bottom of the lakes. Numerical modeling indicates that the spatial variation of the response and the nonlinear response observed at one point can be explained by leakage currents in the conductive lake water. The values of the streaming potential coefficient (SPC), measured in the laboratory with crushed rock samples from the site, range from 14 to 50 mV/0.1 MPa for an electrolyte resistivity of 40 Omega m and are compatible, to first order, with the magnitude of the observed seasonal SP variations. A detailed quantitative electrokinetic modeling is currently limited mainly by the poor knowledge on the contribution of electrical leakage currents and the local variability of the SPC. This experiment indicates that spatial and temporal variations of the electric potential are promising tools to characterize and monitor shallow groundwater flow and provide practical data for the investigation of groundwater flow associated with volcanic or tectonic activity.

However, ephippia are known to be produced by Daphnia within a relatively short time window. Moreover, d(13)C(Daphnia) value may vary considerably over the annual cycle of lakes due to seasonal variations in the availability of the different carbon sources for pelagic consumers, such as phytoplankton or methanogenic carbon, under the effect of stratification and turnover mechanisms. As a result, the information provided by d(13)C(ephippia) can mainly depend on the timing of ephippia production with respect to the timing of lake autumnal turnover. Nevertheless, there is still limited information in the literature about the timing of ephippia production in relation to the seasonal variability of d(13)C(Daphnia). However, it may have important implications for the use of carbon isotopic signature of ephippia as a paleoecological proxy of pelagic carbon transfers in stratified lakes. In this study, we combine a limnological survey on nine French lakes with a paleolimnological approach on three sediment cores to identify the factors controlling the integration period of d(13)C(ephippia) and to assess the relevance of using d(13)C(ephippia) as a proxy for pelagic carbon transfers in paleolimnological studies. Our limnological survey of nine lakes suggests that d(13)C(ephippia) depends mainly on the timing of autumnal turnover. Lakes with the earliest turnover had lower ephippia d(13)C due to methanogenic carbon transfer in the pelagic food web after autumnal turnover, whereas lakes with later autumnal turnover had higher d(13)C(ephippia), mainly reflecting phytoplankton consumption by Daphnia during stratification period. Consequently, potential shifts over time in lake turnover timing relative to ephippia production period may lead to the misinterpretation of d(13)C(ephippia) variations in sediment records. Our paleolimnological study on three lakes shows that complementary d(13)C analysis of other Daphnia remains like claws, reflecting a time-integrated average isotopic signature of the Daphnia source population, can help to identify potential changes in the integration period of d(13)C(ephippia) and avoid misinterpretation of stratigraphic and temporal d(13)C(ephippia) trends regarding carbon sources fuelling pelagic consumers.					; Millet, Laurent/F-8730-2014; Masclaux, Helene/S-1265-2017	Millet, Jules/0009-0002-6674-5534; Essert, Valentin/0000-0002-3197-7397; Masclaux, Helene/0000-0002-5869-8419													0921-2728	1573-0417				DEC	2023	70	4					331	345		10.1007/s10933-023-00297-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10933-023-00297-6		AUG 2023											WOS:001063573200001
J	BEHLING, H				BEHLING, H			A HIGH-RESOLUTION HOLOCENE POLLEN RECORD FROM LAGO DO PIRES, SE BRAZIL - VEGETATION, CLIMATE AND FIRE HISTORY	JOURNAL OF PALEOLIMNOLOGY					1994 Meeting of the American-Quaternary-Association	JUN 19-22, 1994	UNIV MINNESOTA, MINNEAPOLIS, MN	Amer Quaternary Assoc	UNIV MINNESOTA			Lago do Pires (17 degrees 57' S, 42 degrees 13' W) is situated at 390 m a.s.l. in the foothills of the Serra do Espinhaco, 250 km from the Brazilian Atlantic coast. The original vegetation of the study area has been almost destroyed by pastoral activity. Relicts of a dense 20-30 m tall tropical semideciduous forest are present only on a few hill tops. The dry season of the Lago do Fires region lasts for 4 months and the annual precipitation is 1250 mm. A high resolution pollen record from a 16 m long sediment core, composed of 77 samples, subdivided in 7 zones and 4 subzones, allows a reconstruction of Holocene paleoenvironments. For the early Holocene (9720-8810 B.P.), the results indicate that the region surrounding the lake was dominated by a herb savanna (campo cerrado) with Curatella americana (cerrado tree) and high fire frequency. Species of Cecropia, Urticales and a few others, form small gallery forests along the water courses. This vegetation pattern is consistent with a long dry season (perhaps 6 months) and a low annual precipitation. Between 8810 and 7500 years B.P. gallery forests expanded in the valleys and suggest a period of higher rainfall with shortened dry season (perhaps 5 months). Fire was less frequent. Reduction of gallery forests followed (7500-5530 B.P.), probably related to a return of drier climatic conditions (5-6 months dry season, lower precipitation). Fires were more frequent. Between 5530 and 2780 years B.P. in the vallyes were forests and on the hills still an open cerrado. The dry season probably was about 5 months and the rainfall was higher than in the previous period. Later (2780-970 B.P.) the more open cerrado on the hills changed to more closed cerrado. A dense and closed semideciduous forest existed in the region only in the latest Holocene period (since 970 B.P.) under the current climatic conditions. The vegetation was no longer influenced by fire. A very strong human impact by deforestation and use of fire occurred in the last decades. Today cerrado vegetation is generally restricted to central Brazil and exists in several small isolated 'Islands' (Hueck, 1956) in the area of semideciduous forest in SE Brazil which were more widespread during the drier periods of the Holocene. The wettest period of Holocene occurs in the present millenium.																			0921-2728					NOV	1995	14	3					253	268		10.1007/BF00682427	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00682427													WOS:A1995TD95100004
J	Bao, Y; Tian, QJ; Chen, M; Lü, CG				Bao Ying; Tian Qing-jiu; Chen Min; Lu Chun-guang			Analysis on Diurnal Variation of Chlorophyll-a Concentration of Taihu Lake Based on Optical Classification with GOCI Data	SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS												Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is one of the most important parameters for the analysis of inland water quality. Remote sensing data with the advantages of wide spatial area and multi-temporal monitoring has been applied as a reliable source of Chl-a concentration. However, as optical characteristics of inland water bodies are complex with high spatial and temporal (diurnal) variations, there are still limitations to estimate Chl-a concentration with traditional remote sensing data and single model. In the proposed solution, the first geostationary ocean color satellite sensor, Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) which provides an image per hour (eight images per day from 8:16 to 15:16), was used as a data source of Taihu Lake. Based on hierarchical clustering method, water types were identified from in situ normalized spectral reflectance collected in Taihu Lake (216 samples in different seasons from 2010 to 2012). Then eight GOCI images which were obtained on May 6th, 2012 were classified separately according to different water types by calculating spectral angle distance between each spectrum in GOCI images and the classified spectra. According to the classified remote sensing images and the spectral bands of GOCI data, classed based models were subsequently developed for the estimation of Chl-a concentration. The results indicated that four water types (Type 1 to Type 4) were identified based on the in situ normalized spectral reflectance in Taihu Lake. The spectra of Type 1 mainly represented the characteristics of floating algae. This type had little significance to in estimating Chl-a concentration because sensors could only receive signal of floating algae. Then Type 1 was usually used as the evidence of algal blooms. Meanwhile, two-band semi-analytical algorithms were established for Type 2 Type 4 waters which were separately dominated by Chl-a concentration, high suspended solid, low Chl-a and low suspended solid. Comparing with the two-band algorithms, band 7 and band 6 combination was more suitable for Type 2 and Type 3 while the correlation between Chl-a concentration and b7/b5 was higher than that between b7/b6 for Type 4. The accuracies of classification models (Type 2 Type 4) were higher than that of the overall model, with the reduced average relative errors of 7%, 12.3% and 15.9%, respectively. Moreover, the inversion results of GOCI data not only reflected the spatial distribution of Chl-a, but also showed the diurnal variation of the Chl-a concentration of Taihu Lake. This study has demonstrated great potential for dynamic monitoring of eutrophication pollution with GOCI data. In addition, the results suggested that optical classification algorithm can improve the accuracy of Chl-a concentration and the application performance of semi-analytical model. GOCI data and the class-based algorithm provide a basis for accurate estimation of diurnal and spatial variation of Chl-a concentration.

This model provides a more accurate fitting of the coastline. A comparison with a curvilinear orthogonal model shows that the non-orthogonal transformation model provided a better simulation of the current jet in the near-shore region. Accurate fitting of both bathymetry and irregular coastlines plays an essential role in capturing the magnitude of the Keweenaw Current and cross-shelf structure of the thermal bar near the coast. The formation of the Keweenaw Current and thermal front was directly driven by a westerly or southwesterly wind and seasonal development of stratification over steep bottom topography. Under a condition with accurate fitting of steep bathymetry, failure to resolve the irregular geometry of the coastline can result in an underestimation of the magnitude of the Keweenaw Current by about 20 cm/s.

J	Hunter, RD; Simons, KA				Hunter, RD; Simons, KA			Dreissenids in Lake St. Clair in 2001: Evidence for population regulation	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha [Pallas]) density was surveyed at 12 stations in Lake St. Clair in September 2001. Lake-wide mean density was 1,824 individuals/m(2); whole wet biomass was 148 g/m(2); and dry tissue biomass was 1.23 g/m(2). Compared to historical data, density did not change significantly, whereas biomass showed a significant downward trend. Our data support the assertion that the zebra mussel population in Lake St. Clair has undergone important changes since the mid-1990s. Some areas of the lake are now juvenile-dominated, others are adult-dominated, and some have a balanced size distribution. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that zebra mussels have changed the lake ecosystem in two ways that have contributed to their own population limits in a density-dependent manner. First is the reduction of adult microhabitat due to the elimination of native mussels from the lake proper. Second is the massive redirection of larval settlement onto a greatly expanded aquatic macrophyte community which senesces and dies at the end of each season, thus decreasing survivorship of juvenile D. polymorpha. If sustained, these recent changes, especially biomass reduction, suggest that the impact of dreissenids on the Lake St. Clair ecosystem will be more moderate in the future.																			0380-1330						2004	30	4					528	537																WOS:000226952000006

Stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon were analyzed in samples and used to establish trophic structure of the food web and to determine the importance of atmospheric versus sedimentary sources in delivering PCBs to the food web. Nitrogen isotopes were confounded by multiple variables in this system, particularly seasonal variation, and did not display a simple pattern of enrichment among trophic levels. However, delta C-13 displayed little seasonal variation and was positively correlated with PCB concentrations among food web members (r(2) = 0.69). Plots of delta C-13 vs PCBs separate food web members into three distinct groupings comprised of invertebrates, primary forage fish, and predatory fish. Stable isotope values of the primary organic sources indicate that the atmosphere, and not the sediment, is the most likely source of PCBs to the food web of Lake Michigan. Additionally, we suggest that seston may be important in delivering PCBs to pelagic food web members and species that receive a majority of their nutrition through pelagic sources. In contrast, settling particles are implicated in delivering PCBs to benthic organisms and Mysis relicta.

J	Håkanson, L; Boulion, VV				Håkanson, L; Boulion, VV			A general dynamic model to predict biomass and production of phytoplankton in lakes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												This work presents a dynamic model to predict phytoplankton biomass and production. The model has been developed as an integral part within the framework of a more comprehensive lake ecosystem model, LakeWeb, which also accounts for production and biomass of bacterioplankton, two types of zooplankton (herbivorous and predatory), two types of fish (prey and predatory), as well as zoobenthos, macrophytes and benthic algae. The LakeWeb-model is based on ordinary differential equations (the ecosystem perspective) and gives seasonal variations (the calculation time, dt, is 1 week and Euler's integration method has been applied). The sub-model for phytoplankton presented in this work is meant to account for all fundamental abiotic/biotic interactions and feedbacks (including predation by herbivorous zooplankton) for lakes in general. The model has not been tested in the traditional way using data from a few well investigated lakes. Instead, it has been tested using empirical regressions based on data from many lakes. The basic aim of this dynamic model is that it should capture typical functional and structural patterns in many lakes. It accounts for how variations in (1) lake phosphorus concentrations, (2) water clarity, (3) lake morphometry, (4) water temperature, (5) lake pH and (6) predation by herbivorous zooplankton influence production and biomass of phytoplankton. An important demand for this model is that it should be driven by variables easily accessed from standard monitoring programs and maps (the driving variables are: total phosphorus, colour, pH, lake mean depth, lake area, and epilimnetic temperatures). We have demonstrated that the new model gives predictions that agree well with the values given by the empirical regressions, and also expected and requested divergences from these regression lines when they do not provide sufficient resolution. The model has been tested in a very wide limnological domain: TP values from 3 to 300 mug/l, which covers ultraoligotrophic to hypertrophic conditions, colour values from 3 to 300 mg Pt/l, which covers ultraoligohumic to highly dystrophic conditions, pH from 3 to 11, which covers the entire natural range, and lake areas from 0.1 to 100 km(2).

Network analysis to inform invasive species spread among lakes	JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY												Often facilitated by human-mediated pathways, aquatic invasive species are a threat to the health and biodiversity of global ecosystems. We present a novel approach incorporating survey data of watercraft movement in a social network analysis to reconstruct potential pathways of aquatic invasive species spread between lakes. As an example, we use the green alga Nitellopsis obtusa, also known as starry stonewort, an aquatic invasive species affecting the Great Lakes region in the United States and Canada. The movement of algal fragments via human-mediated pathways (i.e., watercraft) has been hypothesized as the primary driver of starry stonewort invasion. We used survey data collected at boat ramps during the 2013 and 2014 open-water seasons to describe the flow of watercraft from Lake Koronis, where N. obtusa was first detected in Minnesota, to other lakes in the state. Our results suggest that the risk of N. obtusa expansion is not highly constrained by geographic proximity and management efforts should consider highly connected lakes. Estimating human movement via network analysis may help to explain past and future mutes of aquatic invasive species infestation between lakes and can improve evidence-based prevention and control efforts.					; Escobar, Luis/I-2204-2019; Larkin, Daniel/IVV-7477-2023; Romero-Alvarez, Daniel/K-2270-2019	Larkin, Daniel/0000-0001-6378-0495; Phelps, Nicholas/0000-0003-3116-860X													2096-5508	2523-3521				MAY	2019	37	3			SI		1037	1041		10.1007/s00343-019-7208-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-019-7208-z													WOS:000469401600026

Distribution patterns of adults and young-of-the-year (YOY) fish were predicted using a model based on observed distribution of different age groups as a function of temperature and light profiles simulated on a daily basis. Mortality rates averaged over the growing season were calculated as a function of fish densities and overlap between adults and YOY. Survival of YOY rainbow smelt and alewife depended on which predator was most abundant. Rainbow smelt YOY mortality rates are highest when rainbow smelt adults are abundant, and alewife YOY mortality rates are highest when alewife adults are abundant, potentially allowing coexistence. August and September mortality rates were higher in the climate change scenario because of increased overlap of adults and YOY of both species. These results indicate that accounting for spatiotemporal fish distribution patterns can be important when forecasting the interacting effects of climate change and aquatic invasive species on fish recruitment.																			0706-652X	1205-7533				MAY	2019	76	5					806	814		10.1139/cjfas-2017-0571	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-0571													WOS:000465934500011

The Park consists of miombo woodland habitat and two seasonal lakes. Mammalian biomass was extremely high due primarily to large numbers of buffalo. The highest mammal densities were found around Lake Chada to the southeast of the Park. Contrary to earlier reports, species' densities did not differ significantly between dry, wet and intermediate seasons, suggesting that, aside from elephant and warthog, mammals did not enter or leave the Park in large numbers. Similarly, aside from zebra and waterbuck, sightings of species in different vegetation types did not change markedly between seasons. Thus, seasonal lakes in Katavi National Park support very high local concentrations rather than acting as dry season refuges for mammals outside the Park.																			0141-6707					SEP	1999	37	3					305	313		10.1046/j.1365-2028.1999.00181.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2028.1999.00181.x													WOS:000082671000006

The mean bacterial consumption was 2.53 x 10(6) bacteria l(-1) h(-1) at 1 m and 0.97 x 10(6) bacteria l(-1) h(-1) at 7 m. The main consumers over the whole study period were the cladocerans Daphnia longispina and Ceriodaphnia quadrangula, accounting on average for 72% of the potential total predation of bacteria at 1 m and 56% at 7 m, especially during the months of May-June and August. Heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), which accounted for 12% estimated total predation of bacteria at 1 m and 13% at 7 m, only exerted a limited predation, mainly by a Monas-type cell. Ciliates, dominated in terms of abundance by Pelagohalteria viridis, accounted for 4% of total predation in the epilimnion (0.00-0.42 x 10(6) bacteria l(-1) h(-1)). In a newly hooded reservoir, metazoan zooplankton appear to be the main consumers of bacteria. Predation of ciliates and HNF by zooplanktonic crustaceans could account for the low contribution of components of the microbial loop to bacterial consumption.																			0142-7873	1464-3774				SEP	1999	21	9					1659	1679		10.1093/plankt/21.9.1659	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plankt/21.9.1659													WOS:000082691600005
J	Herb, WR; Stefan, HG				Herb, WR; Stefan, HG			Integral growth of submersed macrophytes in varying light regimes	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												The coverage, density, and species diversity of macrophytes in the shallow portion of lakes have important effects on water quality, ecosystem health, and sediment deposition, and are important factors in lake use for fishing, boating, swimming, and as water-fowl habitat. This significance and the complex requirements for macrophyte growth have stimulated the development of growth models to predict macrophyte biomass, oxygen production, nutrient cycling, etc. However, there is a lack of relationships that characterize the response of macrophyte growth to varying physical conditions. The growth model developed in this study relates the rate of production of rooted aquatic macrophytes to basic physiological parameters (growth and respiration rates) and controlling physical parameters (incident irradiance, water temperature, light attenuation by water and phytoplankton). The model is developed to be general, rather than specific to a particular plant species, with the intention of broadly characterizing macrophyte growth behavior as a function of a few key parameters. The growth equations are solved analytically using the assumption of uniform temperature and biomass over depth. Expressions for instantaneous rate of growth, daily production, and equilibrium biomass are found. A set of dimensionless parameters are defined and used to characterize four growth regimes. Model results are given in terms of the governing dimensionless parameters and then related to real world, dimensional parameters. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Black, AR; Werritty, A				Black, AR; Werritty, A			Seasonality of flooding: A case study of North Britain	JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY												The seasonality of river flooding in North Britain displays considerable spatial variation. This paper identifies the geographical patterns of flood seasonality, using a database of events exceeding modest flood-flow thresholds at each of 156 gauging stations, and seeks to explain them in terms of climatological and catchment characteristics. Floods are found to occur at all times of year, but most rivers register at least 78% of events in the October-March half-year, and these generally occur later in the year with distance from west to east. However, notable exceptions are superimposed upon this general pattern and, in particular, two areas of less pronounced seasonality occur on north-facing parts of the east coast, Seasonality is characterized using three complementary methods, including a four-fold seasonal classification which summarises the patterns found. In order to explain these patterns, reference is made to the seasonality of storm rainfall, soil moisture deficits, catchment size and lake storage. Seasonality class is correctly explained by reference to these catchment characteristics in 74% of cases using discriminant analysis. The work is presented as an advance in the understanding of flood generation and, ultimately, in the assessment of flood risk.

Fish samples were taken seasonally from December 2002 until October 2004. The samples were collected with the use of a seine net at eleven points. The specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and stored in 70% ethanol. Black spot disease showed a low frequency in the Guaiba lake basin (2.07%) and no specificity to the species Astyanax aff. fasciatus was observed. A high prevalence among the individuals and high intensity of infection levels was found in the ventral and dorsal regions in relation to other body parts (e.g., pectoral, pelvic and anal regions). Among the sampling points studied, we observed a higher prevalence on samples collected at points Gasometro, Saco da Alemoa and Sinos, located in open areas with less occurrence of mollusks.																			1519-6984	1678-4375				AUG	2014	74	3		S			127	134		10.1590/1519-6984.08312	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1519-6984.08312								25627375					WOS:000348215400017

A bathymetric map of each lake was obtained and morphometric parameters were calculated. Physical and chemical parameters ( temperature, transparency, nutrients, pH, conductivity, cations) and chlorophyll a were measured for three periods: the cold season ( January), the dry season ( May), and the rainy season ( October) of 2000. The trophic state of each lake was determined using Carlson's indices for transparency and chlorophyll a. The lakes studied have the morphometric characteristics of maar-type volcanic lakes. Majahual, Chalchoapan, and Manantiales are the deepest lakes with elliptical basins and are classified as warm monomictic systems; Verde and Mogo are shallow lakes with conic basins and are warm polymictic. Majahual and Chalchoapan had an anoxic hypolimnion, while at Manantiales a metalimnetic oxygen maximum was measured. Sodium was the dominant cation in the five lakes, while bicarbonate was the dominant anion. Nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations, transparency, and trophic indices suggest that Chalchoapan, Verde, and Mogo are eutrophic lakes with tendencies toward hypereutrophy; Manantiales and Majahual, in contrast, can be classified as mesotrophic lakes. The trophic state of lakes was indirectly related to deforestation and to the use of agricultural fertilizer in Los Tuxtlas as well as to certain morphometric characteristics.

J	Brivio, PA; Giardino, C; Zilioli, E				Brivio, PA; Giardino, C; Zilioli, E			Validation of satellite data for quality assurance in lake monitoring applications	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The operational application of remote sensing technologies to lake water quality monitoring requires products derived from remote sensing to be quantitatively self-consistent and have a certified accuracy. Fundamental elements in this quality assurance framework are sensor radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction models, which are briefly discussed in the paper. In order to evaluate the accuracy of present operational techniques to retrieve basic parameters from satellite data, such as water-leaving radiance and reflectance, an experiment was organised in the frame of SAtellite remote sensing for Lake MONitoring (SALMON), a European Union co-funded research project. A series of ship-based radiometric and atmospheric measuring campaigns were conducted on Lake Iseo and Lake Garda (Italy) together with limnological sampling. Four Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes were acquired during different seasons and simultaneous in situ measurements were made. After the radiometric calibration procedure, satellite digital images were processed by applying two entirely image-based atmospheric correction models. These models account for the effects of both additive scattering and multiplicative transmittance effects in the atmosphere on the at-satellite measured signal. The results achieved using these procedures were evaluated by comparing satellite-based estimates with in situ measurements of water reflectance. The root mean square difference between Landsat TM-derived reflectance values and ground measurements was close to 0.010 reflectance for each TM spectral band. Such image-based correction models, requiring no in situ field measurements during the satellite overpass, constitute a valid method of lake water monitoring. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Fabbro, LD; Duivenvoorden, LJ				Fabbro, LD; Duivenvoorden, LJ			A two-part model linking multidimensional environmental gradients and seasonal succession of phytoplankton assemblages	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Algal assemblages and their respective niches are analysed for a large riverine impoundment in semi-arid Australia. The extreme variability of the flow regime and the extensive period of low or no flow produced conditions including prolonged stratification akin to those of a lake during the dry season. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering of phytoplankton data and comparison with a principal component analysis of corresponding environmental data are used to demonstrate the linkage between steep environmental gradients and variations in the phytoplankton assemblages. The factor score plots separate the algal assemblages according to key environmental parameters including increasing clarity of the water column, temperature and modification of water chemistry. Assemblages normally contained cyanoprokaryotes (Oscillatoriales), euglenophytes or non-flagellated chlorophytes during flows followed by flagellated chlorophytes and cyanoprokaryotes (Nostocales) during the dry season. Species present during the period of reduced flow occupied conditions similar to those presented in the literature for temperate and/or tropical lakes. Common species included Pandorina morum, Eudorina elegans, Anabaena circinalis, Aphanizomenon issatschenkoi, Aphanizomenon aphanizomenioides and Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. A two-part model is proposed which predicts the most likely genera of phytoplankton with respect to multidimensional environmental gradients.

The new concept takes into account the hydrological impacts of wetlands and other topographic components of the landscape (lakes, depressions, ditches, etc.) while that of the sponge effect only takes into account the hydrological impacts of wetlands. With regard to spatial variability, the area of wetlands and other water bodies is the variable best correlated negatively with the magnitude but positively with the duration of flows. As for the temporal variability, the application of the long-term trend tests revealed a significant increase in the magnitude and, to a lesser extent, the duration of the flows occurring in the watersheds of the north shore characterized by a greater area of wetlands and other water bodies (>5%). This increase is explained by the fact that the storage capacity of these land types, which remains unchanged over time, does not make it possible to store the surplus runoff water brought by the increase in rainfall during the snowmelt season.					zeroual, Ayoub/V-4262-2018; Kinnard, Christophe/AAI-2468-2020														2040-2244	2408-9354				AUG	2023	14	8					2543	2563		10.2166/wcc.2023.429	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2023.429		AUG 2023											WOS:001046781800001

The hydraulic loading rate of the wastewater was varied between 436 and 1226 m(3) per day and various operational parameters were tested, The biomass was mechanically harvested from the noway at one or two week intervals depending upon the season, This paper will present the results for phosphorus removal and productivity of the algal turf. Phosphorus removal from the secondary wastewater was measured twice a week during four, 8 week quarters corresponding to the solar seasons. The phosphorus content of the harvested solids was also measured during these periods, Based on the mean percentage of P (2.1%) in the harvested solids and the mean productivity (35 g m(-2)d(-1)), th, yearly mean removal of phosphorus was 0.73 +/- 0.2 g m(-2)d(-1). An inverse relationship was found between reduction in hydraulic loading rate and increase in pH, phosphorus removal and hardness reduction by the ATS. This indicated that pH mediated precipitation probably accounts for much of the phosphorus removal by the ATS and for the high mean phosphorus content of the harvested solids, Measurement of nutrient concentrations in influent and effluent of the ATS over 24 hours showed that at night phosphorus removal declined, These results indicate the potential of the ATS for phosphorus removal from wastewaters and suggest that removal may be easily controlled by altering the hydraulic loading rate.

The total nematode density (9-411 ind./10 cm(2) per pond), and especially the number of species (4-12 species per pond) was especially low in these ponds. In total, 17 genera of free-living benthic nematodes, belonging to 15 families, are identified. Tobrilus gracilis and Eumonhystera filiformis were the most common species and were found in 13 and 12 of the 14 sampled ponds, respectively. The genera Tobrilus and Eumonhystera jointly comprise 77% of the total nematofauna. Consequently, the investigated water bodies were dominated by deposit feeding Monhysteridae and/or by chewing Tobrilidae. Diplogasteridae and Rhabditidae, normally related with eutrophic habitats, were almost absent. In order to explain the variation of total density, diversity, feeding-types composition and the individual density of the six most important species within ponds as well, sets of environmental variables were statistically selected. It was demonstrated that morphologically very similar species can show highly different ecological properties. The presence of a substantial mud layer and of an overall high level of eutrophication as well as the presence of possibly associated anaerobic conditions are put forward as the main factors explaining the observed low density and diversity. Total phosphate concentration and sediment characteristics seem to be the most important variables to explain the nematode community structure. However, a clear pattern of environmental variables, agricultural land use and nematode assemblages was not observed.

J	Güsewell, S; Pohl, M; Gander, A; Strehler, C				Guesewell, Sabine; Pohl, Mandy; Gander, Antoine; Strehler, Catherine			Temporal changes in grazing intensity and herbage quality within a Swiss fen meadow	BOTANICA HELVETICA												Grazing is a possible tool for conservation management in wetlands, but a frequent problem is spatial variation in grazing intensity, which may promote the degradation of the vegetation. Temporal changes in grazing patterns may reduce this problem by leading to a more homogeneous overall use of the area. In a lakeshore wetland (2.8 ha) grazed by Scottish Highland cattle from May till September, we studied how the grazing of nine vegetation types changes seasonally and between years, and how this is related to the quantity and quality of the herbage. We observed cattle activity weekly throughout two grazing periods, determined the biomass and nutrient concentrations of the vegetation, analysed dung samples, and carried out clipping experiments to assess shoot regeneration after grazing. The annual grazing intensity varied seven-fold among vegetation types, and this pattern was closely similar in both years. In several vegetation types, however, grazing intensity changed seasonally. Cattle first grazed tall grass-dominated vegetation (Phragmition, Phalaridion), which had the most digestible and nutrient-rich herbage, but the poor regeneration of dominant species forced the cattle to then graze small-sedge dominated, nutrient-poor fen vegetation (Caricion davallianae). These temporal changes in grazing patterns slightly reduced the spatial variation in grazing intensity. To take advantage of this effect, relatively long grazing seasons are preferable to shorter ones. Four years of grazing reduced the above-ground biomass production and nutrient concentrations of several vegetation types. Therefore, years without grazing may be needed to prevent a degradation of palatable plant communities with low grazing tolerance.																			0253-1453	1420-9063				JUN	2007	117	1					57	73		10.1007/s00035-007-0798-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00035-007-0798-7													WOS:000248182000005

We focus on six large endorheic basins and develop variability attribution diagnostics against independent precipitation and evapotranspiration (hereafter P and E) datasets. Methods: We generate a flux-inferred storage (FIS), representing the integral of the component flux anomalies into and out of a region, enabling a comparison between the P and E contributions to GRACE water storage anomalies on seasonal to interannual timescales. Additionally, a monthly budget closure approach is applied, giving self-consistent coupled water and energy exchanges from 2002 to 2020. Results: On seasonal timescales, P and E data show insufficient cancellation, implying over-large seasonal variations in surface storage. In most basins, P drives the seasonal storage cycle with E dampening storage amplitudes, although in the Caspian Basin, seasonal storage is driven by E, with P remaining seasonally constant when integrated over the whole drainage basin. Budget closure mostly adjusts E, which has larger uncertainties, in fitting the GRACE data. On year-to-year and multi-year timescales, there is a strong correlation between P-driven storage and the observed GRACE variability, which ranges between 0.55 and 0.88 across all basins, and this is maintained after budget closure. However, storage changes driven by P alone from GPCP are too large compared to GRACE, with E data from FLUXCOM generally having only very weakly compensating interannual variations. After budget closure, interannual E variability is substantially increased. Closed energy budgets often show interannual amplitudes, partly driven by radiation and partly by water budget variation through shared latent heat losses, although these have not been independently verified. Discussion: Although water flux trends cannot be detected with significance due to the large interannual variability, the strong agreement between multi-annual GRACE storage and precipitation variations, especially over the Caspian basin, lends no support to the suggestion that E changes driven by climate change are responsible for water storage trends seen by GRACE.

Despite the importance of the permanent ice cover, there have been no studies that have examined specific couplings between changes in the geophysical properties of the ice covers and dynamic ecological processes within the underlying water column. Herein we present seasonal irradiance and primary production data from Lake Bonney, Taylor Valley, and we show that the phenomena of "ice whitening" is caused by changes in the scattering properties within the upper meter of the ice column and that the timing and extent of this phenomena exerts a predominant constraint on primary production and overall phytoplankton dynamics.																			0024-3590					MAR	1999	44	2					447	454		10.4319/lo.1999.44.2.0447	http://dx.doi.org/10.4319/lo.1999.44.2.0447													WOS:000079309300021
J	Huangfu, CH; Wang, BB; Hu, WQ				Huangfu, Chaohe; Wang, Beibei; Hu, Wuqiong			Mycorrhizal colonization had little effect on growth of Carex thunbergii but inhibited its nitrogen uptake under deficit water supply	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Plant nitrogen (N) acquisition via arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) serves as a dominant pathway in the N nutrition of many plants, but the functional impact of AMF in acquisition of N by wetland plants has not been well quantified. Subtropical lake-wetland ecosystems are characterized by seasonal changes in the water table and low N availability in soil. Yet, it is unclear whether and how AMF alters the N acquisition pattern of plants for various forms of N and how this process is influenced by soil water conditions. Methods We performed a pot study with Carex thunbergii that were either colonized by AMF or not colonized and also subjected to different water conditions. We used N-15 labelling to track plant N uptake. Key Results Colonization by AMF had little effect on the biomass components of C. thunbergii but did significantly affect the plant functional traits and N acquisition in ways that were dependent on the soil water conditions. The N uptake rate of AMF-colonized plants was significantly lower than that of the non-colonized plants in conditions of low soil water. A decreased NO3- uptake rate in AMF-colonized plants reduced the N:P ratio of the plants. Although C. thunbergii predominantly took up N in the form of NO3-, higher water availability increased the proportion of N taken up as NH4+, irrespective of the inoculation status. Conclusions These results emphasize the importance of AMF colonization in controlling the N uptake strategies of plants and can improve predictions of N budget under the changing water table conditions in this subtropical wetland ecosystem.

The purpose of the present study was to describe phytoplankton seasonal changes in a freshwater system and their relation to water quality. Methods The recreational fishing lake is located in the southern area of the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Water samples were collected in three previously selected sites in the lake throughout a year and analyzed regarding floristic composition and physical and chemical parameters. Results The phytoplankton qualitative analysis revealed 91 taxa distributed among eight classes: Chlorophyceae, Cyanophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Zygnemaphyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Xantophyceae, Dinophyceae, and Chrysophyceae. Some physical and chemical parameters seemed to influence phytoplankton community behavior. Chlorophyceae development was favored by local conditions. Among the species of cyanobacteria identified, Microcystis paniformis, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, and Anabaena species were the most important due to their ability to produce toxins, posing a high risk to public health. Conclusions Some physical and chemical parameters had an impact on the structure of phytoplankton community. The presence of Microcystis paniformis, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and Anabaena species indicates toxic potential and likelihood of public health problems unless there is constant monitoring. Further studies are recommended to prevent hazardous effects to the environment and public health.

Thirty collections of A promelas were made in southeastern Nebraska along 3 converging tributaries: Elk Creek (40.88534 degrees N, 96.83366 degrees W), West Oak Creek (40.9082 degrees N, 96.81432 degrees W), and Oak Creek (40.91402 degrees N, 96.770583 degrees W), Lancaster County, Nebraska. In all, 103 P. promelas were collected from Elk Creek, 115 from West Oak Creek, and 78 from Oak Creek and examined for gill monogenes. Among the A promelas collected, 93.5% were infected with up to 3 species of Dactylogyrus, including Dactylogyrus simplex Mizelle, 1937, Dactylogyrus hychowskyi Mizelle, 1937, and Dactylogyrus pectenatus Mayes, 1977. Mean intensities at Elk Creek, West Oak Creek, and Oak Creek were 17.6, 22.8, and 25.1, and prevalences 88, 95, and 97%, respectively. At these 3 sites: (1) P. promelas does not share Dactylogyrus species with Semotilus atromaculatus (Creek chub) or Notropis stramineus (Sand shiner); (2) fish size and sex are not predictive of Dactylogyrus infection; (3) Dactylogyrus spp. vary (not always predictably) in their seasonal occurrence; (4) populations of Dactylogyrus spp. respond to environmental differences among sites; and (5) the community structure of Dactylogyrus spp. (order of abundance) is independent of environment.																			0022-3395	1937-2345				DEC	2009	95	6					1295	1305		10.1645/GE-2166.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1645/GE-2166.1								19642810					WOS:000274068400008
J	Tavera, R; Díez, B				Tavera, Rosaluz; Diez, Beatriz			Multifaceted approach for the analysis of the phototrophic microbial community in a freshwater recreational area of Xochimilco, M,xico	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The freshwater microbial community in a recreational area of Xochimilco, M,xico was investigated and compared based on spatial (three different sites) and temporal (dry and rainy seasons) environmental variables. Many of the 16S- and 18S rRNA gene sequences recovered by DGGE fingerprinting analysis were related to phototrophic microbial phylotypes of known identity. Our genetic and morphological analysis indicated the ubiquitous presence of the microeukaryotic green algae Desmodesmus-Scenedesmus spp. and of the unicellular cyanobacteria Cyanobium spp. as the most representative populations in the samples. While 18S rRNA-DGGE fingerprinting analysis revealed a homogeneous community composition across sites and seasons, the 16S rRNA showed significant differences between localities and seasons. None of the cyanobacteria species with potential to produce toxins were identified across the investigated samples. Correlations between biotic and abiotic variables evidenced an important difference between the dry and the rainy season, with a greater consistency in data from the rainy season. According to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a strong relation between inorganic nitrogen, species richness, and subaquatic irradiance determines environmental variability in Xochimilco. Complementary and relevant data in results obtained from microscopy, fingerprinting, and statistical analysis applied in ecology indicate that a multifaceted approach to the study of microbial communities is necessary to accomplish a comprehensive scientific framework and to generate proper management strategies.

Although the study lakes demonstrated a notable inter-annual and seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations, water transparency was the only variable that was consistently more variable in LH than LN. The reason for the greater temporal variability in water transparency of LH is its major susceptibility to wind and rain events. The impact of wind events in this lake is favored by its shallowness and by its silty surface sediment; the high ratio of catchment area to lake area is responsible for the relatively higher susceptibility of LH to rain events than LN. By contrast, in the younger and deeper LN, ground-water discharge buffers certain water chemistry parameters such as conductivity, turbidity, and alkalinity. Interestingly, differences in turbidity and ground-water discharge do not seem to affect the variability in nutrient concentrations, which was similar between the lakes, although these factors may explain differences between the lakes in nutrient concentrations. This paper reveals that the unpredictability and frequency of events in Mediterranean aquatic ecosystems makes it necessary to increase data collection frequency to obtain more accurate simulations in water quality models.					de Vicente, Inmaculada/S-2067-2016; Rueda Valdivia, Francisco Jose/N-3145-2016; Rueda, Francisco/N-3145-2016; De Vicente Alvarez Manzaneda, Inmaculada/S-2067-2016; Moreno-Ostos, Enrique/R-6782-2019; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis/H-5318-2015	Moreno Ostos, Enrique/0000-0001-9471-3922; Rueda Valdivia, Francisco Jose/0000-0002-2803-3440; De Vicente Alvarez Manzaneda, Inmaculada/0000-0002-1449-5740; Cruz-Pizarro, Luis/0000-0003-0687-0704													0277-5212	1943-6246				DEC	2006	26	4					928	938		10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[928:LPITDO]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[928:LPITDO]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000243370000004

Kutz during the growing season in Lake Yogo, we examined the cellular ratios of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in the populations of M. aeruginosa from August to December 2001. We also measured cellular C, N, and P ratios of M. aeruginosa under batch culture conditions. The cellular levels of N and P of M. aeruginosa in natural population changed more than twofold. The atomic N : C ratio of natural populations of Microcystis fluctuated from 0.11 to 0.26. The atomic P : C ratio fluctuated from 0.0080 to 0.024. The N : C, P : C, and N : P ratios of exponentially growing M. aeruginosa in N- and P-rich medium were 0.19,0.013, and 15 on average. The growth of M. aeruginosa was suppressed below the N : C ratio of 0.13 under the N-free condition and below the P : C ratio of 0.0026 in the P-free condition. In the natural population, the N: C ratio was low on August 1-2 (0.11) and the P : C ratio was low (less than 0.011) until September. The Microcystis population on August 1-2 was N limited, judging from the results of the culture experiment. In other periods, the population seemed to be supplied with a sufficient amount of N. Although the P : C ratio was low (approximately 0.01) during August and September, it was several times larger than the value of the reduction of growth rate that occurred in culture. P limitation did not occur during the study period. N became more of a limiting factor than P for the formation of blooms of Microcystis. No blooms were observed in August and September, in spite of the increase of cellular levels of N. The formation of Microcystis blooms in Lake Yogo seems to be affected by artificial manipulations such as pumping from Lake Biwa and outflow.																			1439-8621					DEC	2006	7	3					185	192		10.1007/s10201-006-0188-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-006-0188-7													WOS:000242770900006
J	Buckley, BM; Cook, ER; Peterson, MJ; Barbetti, M				Buckley, BM; Cook, ER; Peterson, MJ; Barbetti, M			A changing temperature response with elevation for Lagarostrobos franklinii in Tasmania, Australia	CLIMATIC CHANGE												A network of seven Huon pine ring-width chronologies is constructed from sites ranging in elevation from 200 to 950 metres above sea level in western Tasmania. The chronologies are analysed individually and collectively to explore Huon pine's response to climate as a function of elevation. Three chronologies from greater than 700 metres in elevation exhibit a strong, direct response to temperature for most growing season months (p < 0.05), while three from below 700 metres exhibit a weaker, direct response to growing-season temperature, and a strong, inverse relationship with temperature of the prior season of growth, also significant at the 0.05 level. Moisture availability at these temperate rainforest sites is less growth-limiting than temperature, and significant correlations for January (inverse) and April (direct) of the year of growth largely reflect the inter-relationships between temperature, precipitation and cloudiness, and their combined influence on photosynthesis, particularly at higher-elevation sites. A rotated Principal Component Analysis reveals a clear grouping of the high and low-elevation chronologies, represented by the first and second eigenvectors, respectively. The 700 metre Lake Marilyn Low chronology is revealed to be a transitional site between the two groupings, and likely reflects an important climatic ecotone where both temperature and photosynthetically-active radiation drop below optimum levels for the species, and begin to directly inhibit growth. Tasmania's west coast climate has been shown to exhibit a distinct vertical structure, exemplified by a subsidence-inversion layer above 900 metres. Temperature increases slightly with altitude above 930 metres (the elevation at which a peak in daily minimum and maximum humidity levels is observed) before decreasing again. A dense, orographically-generated cloud-zone of reduced light and temperature has a mean altitude between 700 and 900 metres, with the steepest drop in both air and soil temperature exhibited between 850 and 930 metres. This structure can account for Huon pine's changing response to climate with elevation as described in this paper, and reinforces the importance of careful site selection for dendroclimatic research. In the case of reconstructing warm-season temperature from Tasmanian Huon pine, the desired signal might be maximised through sampling at the few rare, subalpine stands which have been located in western Tasmania. The great length afforded by the low-elevation Huon pine resource may ultimately yield a far more detailed reconstruction of regional climate throughout the Holocene, with respect to a vertical profile, following the development of more sound, mechanistically-based response models.

J	Ren, J; Han, GL; Liu, XL				Ren, Jie; Han, Guilin; Liu, Xiaolong			Controlling processes and key factors of nitrogen efflux at the sediment-water interface in a mesotrophic artificial reservoir	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS												PurposeThe purpose of this study was to clarify the influx/efflux of nitrogen and the dominant influencing factors of nitrogen transformation at the sediment-water interface (SWI).Materials and methodsTwo intact sediment cores were collected from Dongfeng Reservoir (DFR) in the Wujiang River basin in December 2018 and July 2019. The cores were immediately sliced upon collection. Pore water samples were obtained by centrifugation. Different forms of inorganic nitrogen were exacted and measured by an analytical continuous flow analyzer (SEAL Analytical Limited, Germany). Particulate organic nitrogen (PON) samples were obtained after the removal of inorganic carbon and inorganic nitrogen. Stable isotopes (& delta;N-15-PON) and the ratios of C/N were measured by a stable isotopic mass spectrometer (MAT-253) and an elemental analyzer (Elementar, Rhine main, Germany). The estimation of mineralization and diffusion flux was conducted using a first-order kinetic model and Fick's first law, respectively.Results and discussionSignificant seasonal variations in the concentration of nitrogen species in the pore waters of the sediment indicated that dissolved oxygen (DO) was the primary environmental factor controlling nitrogen transformation and transportation at the SWI. Mineralization and nitrification were identified as the dominant processes in the sediment profile and SWI of the DFR. The & delta;N-15-PON and C/N ratios provided insights into the sources of PON in the sediment, with soil organic matter and livestock waste being identified as the primary contributors. The estimated endogenous diffusion fluxes of NH4+-N from sediment were 34.69 mg m(-2) d(-1) and 29.21 mg m(-2) d(-1) in the stratified period (SP) and non-stratified period (NSP), respectively. These fluxes were notably higher than those observed in most eutrophic aquatic systems, suggesting that the role of sedimentary nitrogen reservoirs in nitrogen accumulation in oligotrophic/mesotrophic environments may have been significantly underestimated.ConclusionsMineralization of PON and nitrification were the main processes of nitrogen transformation at the SWI in DFR. As a dominant component of inorganic nitrogen, NH4+-N exhibits high levels of endogenous release.

J	Marie, SJ; Jean-Marie, DD; Bertrand, NG				Marie, Sieliechi Joseph; Jean-Marie, Dangwang Dikdim; Bertrand, Noumi Guy			Speciation of phosphorus in the sediments of Lake Bini (Ngaoundere-Cameroon)	ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY												In this study, spatial and seasonal variations of phosphorus fractions in Lake Bini sediments were evaluated using a sequential extraction method. The sampling of water and sediments (surface and coring) was carried out at seven sites around the lake during the dry season and the rainy season. The results showed that phosphorus is mainly in the inorganic form (L-P+Ca-P+Fe-P) in the sediments whatever the season may be. The rank order of phosphorus extracts obtained was Fe-P>Ca-P>OM-P>L-P>Res-P. The maximum values of phosphorus (sum of each fraction) were obtained in the rainy season at the sites D6 (298.12 +/- 12.37 mu gP/g) and D4 (244.93 +/- 11.06 mu gP/g) located beside water source 2 and farmland 2, respectively. The average values of the phosphorus content vary from 05.29 +/- 1.05 mu gP/g to 102.58 +/- 4.62 mu gP/g for the upper layer (0-5cm depth); 04.67 +/- 0.66 mu gP/g to 70.06 +/- 2.82 mu gP/g for the medium layer (5-10cm depth) and finally 04.63 +/- 0.98 mu gP/g to 55.24 +/- 5.17 mu gP/g for the deep layer (10-15cm depth). The results of principal component analysis showed that processes which enhance Ca-P and Fe-P accumulation are probably related to the same factor and the origin of P depends on the source of pollution. The nature of the season plays a significant role in the geochemical composition of the sediments in phosphorus and on the eutrophication level of Lake Bini.																			0959-3330	1479-487X				JUL 18	2014	35	14					1831	1839		10.1080/09593330.2014.884171	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2014.884171								24956776					WOS:000334661900015

Research note: Scheduling trips during the slack season - an aspect of the economics of seasonal tourism	TOURISM ECONOMICS												The trip-scheduling problem faced by firms providing transport to tourists visiting a specific location in the slack season has received scant theoretical attention in the tourism literature. The author therefore conducts a stochastic analysis of the problem of trip scheduling during the slack season. He describes first a general model that accounts for the common features of sightseeing trips to city attractions and to locations such as fjords and lakes. Second, he determines the long-run fraction of time for which the transport-providing firm is unable to satisfy the demand for trips. Third, he ascertains the long-run fraction of demand that is lost to the transport-providing firm. Finally, he generalizes the analysis and considers the case in which a key, exogenously given variable is random and not constant.

Larval Fish Transport and Retention and the Importance of Location for Juvenile Fish Recruitment in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												In the Upper Klamath Lake basin of Oregon, we applied the member-vagrant hypothesis to larval lake fishes, documented marsh and hydrographic retention for larval shortnose suckers Chasmistes brevirostris and Lost River suckers Deltistes luxatus, and examined the effect of larval retention on the shoreline abundance of the juveniles of five species of fish in August. Emigration of larval suckers was highest from natal rivers, and immigration was highest in nonnatal areas downstream of the lake. Lake retention was facilitated by a wind-generated gyre and advection by an eastern boundary current. Marshes and other shoreline irregularities acted as traps that slowed river and eastern boundary current advection and retained larvae, especially for shortnose suckers, for up to 3 weeks. The interaction of behavior, seasonal spawning, and seasonal system dynamics appears to drive retention patterns. For both species of suckers and three minnow species (fathead minnow Pimephales promelas. blue chub Gila coerulea, and tui chub G. bicolor), the abundance of juveniles along the shoreline increased with distance from the lake outlet and was weakly related to lake elevation, a surrogate for available habitat. For these five species, 45.5% of the variation in August juvenile abundance was determined by distance from the lake outlet. This work suggests that the nonbehavioral component of freshwater retention is complex and depends on hydrographic features, the boundary conditions of hydrographic features. and shoreline habitat.

J	Ichikawa, T; Aizaki, M; Takeshita, M				Ichikawa, Tetsuya; Aizaki, Morihiro; Takeshita, Mikio			Numerical study on amelioration of water quality in Lakes Shinji and Nakaumi: a coastal brackish lagoon system	LIMNOLOGY												Aiming at estimating the effect of an amelioration scheme for water quality in a highly eutrophicated and strongly enclosed estuary, especially placing emphasis on the alleviation of a oxygen-depleted water body, a three-dimensional (3-D) time-dependent coupled physical and ecological model was applied to Lakes Shinji and Nakaumi, a typical coastal brackish lagoon system in Japan. First, the model was run to reproduce the seasonal variation in water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and other ecological constituents during the period from April 1998 to March 1999. The daily change regimes of the observed sea surface winds, tidal elevation at the open boundary, river discharges, and meteorological parameters were incorporated into the forcing variables of the ecosystem model. Next, as a numerical experiment, a scenario simulation was carried out under four premises to alleviate the oxygen-depleted water body. The model results agreed fairly well with the field measurements obtained through the regular environmental monitoring in the lagoon system. It was found that an oxygen-depleted water body appears in the eastern part of Lake Nakaumi in early May and develops to cover the whole lagoon in midsummer to leave it almost anoxic. The scenario simulation revealed that each amelioration scheme has a considerable effect in alleviating this hypoxic water body. It was found from the model results and the additional flux analyses that the oxygen concentration will improve as a result of (1) change in the flow field by cutting the dikes built up during lake reclamation and (2) decrease in benthic oxygen consumption by filling up deep holes once created by dredging activities.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				DEC	2007	8	3					281	294		10.1007/s10201-007-0222-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-007-0222-4													WOS:000251677800010
C	Rahel, FJ		McGinn, NA		Rahel, FJ			Using current biogeographic limits to predict fish distributions following climate change	FISHERIES IN A CHANGING CLIMATE	AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY SYMPOSIUM				Symposium on Fisheries in a Changing Climate	AUG 20-21, 2001	PHOENIX, AZ	Amer Fisheries Soc				There is a long history in fisheries biology of relating biogeographic distribution patterns of fish to thermal conditions. The association of distribution boundaries with thermal limits reflects the fact that temperature has a major influence on the physiology, growth, and behavior of ectothermic animals such as fish. Approaches used to relate species distributions to thermal limits can be grouped into four categories: air temperatures, surface water temperatures, groundwater temperatures, and correlates of temperature such as agricultural growing season. Air temperature limits typically focus on mean daily air temperature for the warmest month of the year and are based on the assumption that air and water temperatures are correlated. Water temperatures limits include measures of daily mean as well as daily maximum temperature, both averaged over periods of weeks to a month. Groundwater temperature limits are based on the observation that groundwater, integrates annual temperature conditions and is usually within 1-2degreesC of the mean annual air temperature. Correlates of air or water temperature include measures of the agricultural growing season or elevation. Biogeographic limits can be used to infer thermal limits that can be used to model fish distribution changes following climate change. The assumption is that fish populations will migrate pole-ward or up in elevation to remain within suitable thermal envelopes. Several studies that have used this approach predict a substantial loss of habitat for coldwater fishes due to climate warming. When using biogeographic limits to model species responses to climate change, researchers should ensure that distribution patterns reflect thermal limits rather than other limiting factors and should recognize that changes in other factors, especially hydrological regime, also may alter fish distribution patterns in the future.																			0892-2284		1-888569-40-9				2002	32						99	109																WOS:000178304200008
J	Yu, ZC; Ito, E; Engstrom, DR; Fritz, SC				Yu, ZC; Ito, E; Engstrom, DR; Fritz, SC			A 2100-year trace-element and stable-isotope record at decadal resolution from Rice Lake in the Northern Great Plains, USA	HOLOCENE												A 2100-year multiple proxy record at decadal resolution from a topographically closed (but hydrologically open) lake basin was used to reconstruct changes in lake salinity and evaporative intensity and to evaluate the reliability of different proxies for inferring climatic change in the glaciated Northern Great Plains (NGP). At Rice Lake, North Dakota, the ostracode-Mg/Ca ratios show good correlation with other ostracode, diatom and aeolian proxy records from other sites in the NGP. All of these records show significant century-scale periodicities, which have been related to solar variability as inferred from atmospheric radiocarbon records. This coherent and consistent pattern suggests that these sites record climatic variability at regional scales. The interval of the Mediaeval Climatic Anomaly from similar to900 to 550 cal. yr BP contains two pronounced dry periods. During the following 'Little Ice Age', a single period of frequent drought that peaked at similar to300 cal. yr BP was bracketed by wet periods before and after. In contrast, the ostracode-Sr/Ca ratios and ostracode- and mollusc-records from Rice Lake have different patterns and do not correlate well with each other or with the same proxies at other sites. This lack of consistent pattern within a site and among several regional sites suggests seasonal and/or site-specific influences on these proxies. Variable contributions of groundwater, with low delta(18)O values because of selective recharge from snowmelt, may have played an important role in determining the isotopic composition of the lake. The poor correlation of Sr/Ca with other proxies is caused by mediation of inorganic carbonate mineralogy, owing to active uptake of Sr in the formation of inorganic aragonite. Thus, our sediment data along with present-day lakewater chemistry suggest that carbonate-delta(18)O records in the NGP cannot be interpreted simply in terms of climate because of significant local groundwater influences. Ostracode-Mg/Ca ratios tend to be a better indicator of past salinity because of the conservative nature of Mg in oligosaline waters (<10 parts per thousand salinity).					; Yu, Zicheng/D-4108-2012	Yu, Zicheng/0000-0003-2358-2712; Engstrom, Daniel/0000-0002-8066-029X; Ito, Emi/0000-0001-9401-243X; 													0959-6836	1477-0911					2002	12	5					605	617		10.1191/0959683602hl571rp	http://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683602hl571rp													WOS:000177949100009

Two biodegradation experiments were conducted in two contrasting seasons in two oligotrophic and one ultraoligotrophic temperate lakes, which comprise a natural gradient of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and quality (including lakes of < 83.33 & mu;M). We examined associations between biodegradation and bacterial cytometric descriptors (i.e. abundance, DNA relative content, etc.) and with different DOM characteristics. The biolabile DOC (BDOC) was higher in shallow oligotrophic lakes, which displayed higher DOC concentration than the deep ultraoligotrophic one. The BDOC was mainly relatable not only to DOC concentration but also with DOM quality [fluorescent terrestrial-humic component normalized by DOC (C2:DOC), lignin content (a*350) and biological index]. We found a positive association between biodegradation process and high nucleic acid-content bacterial group. The bacterioplankton cytometric features were shaped by DOM concentration and quality along the biodegradation process. We concluded that in oligotrophic lakes, DOC concentration was the main driver of BDOC, whereas in ultraoligotrophic lakes, DOM quality played a more central role. This study contributes to better understand the biodegradation process in pristine low-DOC lakes with natural variation in allochthonous DOM inputs and with implications in the biogeochemical cycles.

Chloride and phosphorus retention and release in soils surrounding a salt-contaminated lake in West Michigan	JOURNAL OF FRESHWATER ECOLOGY												Salinization in freshwater ecosystems has become an increasingly prevalent issue. Past studies indicate that increased salinity levels in lakes can impact biota, stimulate internal nutrient loading, and prevent seasonal turnover, potentially resulting in impairment to the lake ecosystem. Salt retention in soils and groundwater causes elevated salt concentrations in fresh water long after road salt was applied. We examined salt retention and release in soils collected near the tributaries flowing into and out of a salt-impacted urban lake. We distributed each soil sample into plastic trays and exposed them to three treatments, conducted in series: (1) non salt-contaminated water as a conditioning rinse; (2) salt-contaminated water to mimic salt de-icer runoff; and (3) non salt-contaminated water to determine salt release. We measured retention of chloride from each soil sample based on how much chloride was measured in water draining the soil (effluent). We observed considerable variability among sites presumably because of soil heterogeneity, although overall the soils in our study area retained a modest amount of chloride (mean of & SIM;29 mg/L) from simulated salt runoff events, even at short exposure times (<30 min). In addition, some soils released chloride following a relatively salt-free rinsing event. There was an overall positive relationship between percent soil organic matter and Cl- retention. We also measured the impact of chloride on bioavailable phosphorus concentration in the effluent, which was relatively modest and variable. Soil total phosphorus had a strong positive correlation with %SOM. Our results suggest that in addition to direct runoff of salt de-icers from roads to lakes, soil retention can also serve as a chloride source that can be released over time, resulting in a delayed impact to aquatic ecosystems.

Due to acidification, crustacean zooplankton were absent in all but one lake. In terms of carbon flow, microorganisms were thus almost exclusive players in the pelagic food webs. Variety of extremely long (> 100 mum) heterotrophic filaments occurred in the lakes. The filaments usually accounted for > 50% of total heterotrophic microbial biomass in the pelagic zone (medians of the total biomass: 82-108 mug C l(-1)), except for anoxic bottom layers and for episodic appearance of Daphnia longispina in one lake. Seasonal filament formation was mainly induced and maintained by grazing of mixotrophic flagellates (Dinobryon spp.) on small unicellular bacteria in the absence of cladoceran filtration. The filaments were less active than unicellular suspended bacteria. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation revealed that usually < 50% of total bacteria were targeted with oligonucleotide probes for Eubacteria. (C) 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Seasonal occurrence, distribution and diversity of phytoplankton in the Douala Estuary, Cameroon	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The occurrence and abundance of phytoplankton in the Wouri and Dibamba rivers and the Douala Estuary and their relationships to physico-chemical conditions were studied during the wet and dry seasons of 2008. One-hundred-and-sixty-eight species belonging to 67 genera were identified. Ninety-two and 127 species were identified in the wet and dry seasons, respectively, including 51 common species. In the rivers, species richness decreased with increasing salinity, but in the estuary it increased up to salinity levels of 20.43 and thereafter decreased. The Bacillariophyta, including 101 species, was the most prominent division, whilst Euglena anabaena (24.98%) was the most abundant species. Cyclotella bodanica, C. ocellata, C. comta, Navicula sp., Gomphonema sp., Nitzschia sp. and Denticula sp. were present in all samples. Nitrate ranged from 107.5 to 129.9 mg l(-1) in the wet season and from 31 to 44 mg l(-1) in the dry season. Phosphate ranged from 0.04 to 0.38 mg l(-1) in the wet season and from 0.03 to 0.04 mg l(-1) in the dry season. Conductivity, temperature, total dissolved solids, and ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), phosphate (PO43-) and calcium (Ca2+) ions, were factors that influenced species diversity in both seasons. Species saprobity was in the ratio eutrophic (39.9%) > oligotrophic (30.4%) > mesotrophic (7.1%). The saprobic index was 0.15, and thus the water was eutrophic.

Temporal variations in the food habits of some fish species in Lake Nokoue, Benin	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Stomach contents of the 12 most abundant fish species in Lake Nokoue, Benin, collected between 2003 and 2005, were analysed for temporal variations in their diet. Several species showed seasonal shifts in their diets based on benthic prey abundance and biomass variation, which are influenced by physico-chemical environmental changes. Five trophic guilds were identified: detritivorous, microbenthivorous, macrobenthivorous, zooplanktivorous and piscivorous. Trophic guilds in 2003-2005, compared to 1961, showed a decrease of benthivorous species, which illustrates the vulnerability of this group whose prey are particularly exposed to organic pollution.

The methods of in situ measurements of production are time consuming, rather complicated, and very expensive. Bio-optical model calculations provide a good alternative here. A semi-empirical model for estimating phytoplankton primary production (Arst et al., 2008, Aquatic Biology, Vol. 3, No. 1, pp. 19-30) allows calculating the vertical profiles and areal (integrated over water column) values of primary production using chlorophyll a concentration, incident irradiance, and light attenuation coefficient in the water. In the present study this model was developed further by elaborating its automated version. It enables performing rapid and greatly replicated estimations of the circumstantial variability of phytoplankton primary production at hourly intervals from morning to evening and as daily and monthly sums based on a table of initial parameters and depths. For demonstrating the practical application of the model we calculated primary production in two large eutrophic North-European lakes (Vortsjarv and Peipsi), using a database collected during four warm months in 2009 (123 days in both lakes).

Lake Brienz is oligotrophic and fully oxic while Lake Zug is eutrophic and partially anoxic. The community composition of the particle-associated (>5 mu m) and free-living (>0.2, <5 mu m) bacteria was analyzed by automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA). Cluster analysis showed that the lakes comprised distinct BCs. However, the BCs of both lakes were structured with depth. Although particulate amino compounds appeared to impact the number of ARISA-operational taxonomic units of the particle-associated BCs throughout the lake water columns, the compositional dynamics of this bacterial fraction were affected more strongly by the sampling date and physico-chemical parameters, such as pH. For the free-living BCs, the chlorin index (CI), an indicator for the degradation state of primary produced POM, appeared to significantly impact the vertical community shifts. The vertical changes of the total bacterial cell abundance were also significantly determined by the CI and by shifts in particulate amino compounds. The present study shows that not only bulk environmental parameters but also POM composition and degradation state shape the abundance and composition of lacustrine BCs.

Its acceptance along ocean coasts has resulted in the development of several commercially available systems and a planned nationwide coastal network to routinely measure coastal currents. Because HF radiation is known to propagate less efficiently over fresh water than seawater, it has been largely overlooked as a viable tool for freshwater application. However, its potential utility in freshwater was clearly demonstrated by a deployment along Lake Michigan as part of the 1999-2001 Episodic Events Great Lakes Experiment. As part of this experiment, the University of Michigan Multi-frequency Coastal Radar consistently produced reliable near surface current measurements to a range of approximately 25 km offshore showing strong correlation with both in-situ measurements and numerical hind-casts. This paper provides background on HF radar technology, a summary of the current state of the art with respect to freshwater and describes the results of a recent experiment to measure the propagation of HF radar signal over freshwater using CODAR Ocean Sensors SeaSondes, operating at 5 and 42 MHz with 21 W and 90 W average radiated powers, respectively. The effective offshore range for these radars was found to be 18 km at 5 MHz and 4-5 km at 42 MHz. These findings are consistent with currently available models for the prediction of propagation loss, verifying that they can reliably be used to estimate ranges in freshwater settings.

J	Oliver, RG; Wallace, DF; Earll, M				Oliver, Robin G.; Wallace, Derek F.; Earll, Mark			Variation in chlorotoluron photodegradation rates as a result of seasonal changes in the composition of natural waters	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE												BACKGROUND: It is important to understand the degradation of organic molecules in surface waters to ensure that risk assessments, intended to prevent adverse effects on human health and the environment, are robust. One important degradation mechanism in surface waters is photodegradation. This process is generally studied in laboratory test systems, and the significance of the results is then extrapolated to the field. The aim of this work was to assess how fluctuations in the composition of surface water influence the photodegradation rate of chlorotoluron. RESULTS: Photodegradation DT50 values in the lake (mean = 26.0 days) and pond (mean = 26.0 days) were significantly slower than in the river (mean = 6.8 days) and stream (mean = 7.3 days) samples. The DT50 values in the pond and lake samples were similar to the direct photolysis value (mean = 28.6 days). Photodegradation was significantly faster in the stream and river samples, suggesting that indirect photolysis was significant in those waters. Principal component analysis indicated a strong inverse correlation between nitrate concentration and degradation rate. CONCLUSIONS: Nitrate concentration had a strong influence on the rate of photodegradation, with increasing nitrate concentrations sharply reducing the DT50. However, this effect was restricted to a narrow concentration range and levelled off quite quickly, such that further increases in the nitrate concentration had no significant effect on the rate of degradation. Extrapolating photodegradation rates of chlorotoluron from the laboratory to the field should be relatively straightforward, provided the nitrate concentrations in the waters are known.

There are about 200-250 species, with a cosmopolitan distribution but often scarce to rare. Isoetes genus members often grow in extremely sensitive aquatic environments such as temporary ponds, streams and lakes. They are therefore good indicators of environmental quality. Isoetes anatolica Prada & Rolleri is an endemic plant grows on calcareous sediment/soil on the edges of seasonal ponds located in a mountainous area near the southern coast of the Black Sea at 1400 m above sea level at Bolu, Turkey. In this study, mineral element uptake statuses of I. anatolica populations were studied on the background of plant-sediment/soil-water interactions. The study materials were collected from the place where this narrow endemic species only lives in the world (Abant Region, Bolu/Turkey) by using standard methods and plant and sediment/soil mineral element measurements (Al, B, Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni and Zn) were done. ICP-OES was employed for the measurements during the study. Interrelations between mineral element contents in the sediment/soil, water and plant were discussed. The data revealed that I. anatolica is capable of accumulating considerable amounts of certain mineral elements (B, Ca, Mn and Na).

Water quality degradation in the region is mainly attributable-to: anthropogenic activities, communities' socio-economic conditions and natural sources. Surface and groundwater contamination by organic matters, Escherichia coli, nitrates, phosphates, pesticides, hydrocarbons, heavy metals and fluorine ions are reported. In cash crop production areas, the large quantities of pesticides and fertilizers used explain residues in the ground and surface water in many countries. Unsafe domestic wastes are an important source of water pollution in capital cities due to overcrowding, poverty, and low sanitation in precarious neighbourhood areas. Eutrophication is seasonally observed in lakes or lagoons with high concentrations of nitrates in urban areas. The challenges to overcome are a promotion of strategic research with a high diffusion level, pollution prevention measures which include the behaviours of all communities through the application of laws and respect of norms, an allocation of financial support for water analysis and treatment, and suitable sanitation for health preservation. To face the pollution of freshwater by pesticides residues, fluorine and arsenic ions, intensive research based on local natural materials for cheap and easy water purification technologies is a priority.																			0144-7815		978-1-907161-39-1				2013	361						87	95																WOS:000323627500009

The variation trend of evaporation of Dongping Lake was analyzed, and the influences that caused changes in lake evaporation were also discussed. The results show that (1) the total annual evaporation in Dongping Lake increased at 18.24 mm/a during 2003-2010. The major climatic factors accounting for this increase are the rising net radiation and the rising air temperature; (2) the total annual evaporation in a particular hour (13:10-14: 10) in Dongping Lake increased at 4.55 mm/a during 2003-2010-the major climate factors that accounted for this increase are rising net radiation, followed by air temperature, wind velocity, and air humidity; (3) against the background of global warming, the climate of Dongping Lake tended to be dry during 2003-2010; the largest contribution to this comes from air temperature, followed by wind velocity and relative humidity; and (4) the monthly evaporation in Dongping Lake has seasonal variability.					duan, zheng/D-6409-2011; Su, Hongbo/Z-3572-2019														1687-9309	1687-9317					2013	2013								789290	10.1155/2013/789290	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2013/789290													WOS:000325896400001

Ability of Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) to Recover from Early Season Nitrogen Deficiency	JOURNAL OF COTTON SCIENCE												Nitrogen (N) is important for cotton production but if poorly managed it can lead to reduced lint yield and low N use efficiency. This study was conducted to evaluate cotton's ability to recover from early season N deficiency and determine if a sensor-based N rate calculator (SBNRC) can be used to make mid-season N recommendations in cotton. The effect of sidedress N fertilizer (0, 33, 67, 101, and 134 kg N ha-1) applied at early pinhead square (EPHS), first white flower (FWF), 30 d after first white flower (30 DAFWF), and four levels of preplant N (0, 33, 67, and 101 kg ha(-1)), on cotton lint yield was investigated at two locations in Oklahoma. The results indicated that at 0 and 33 kg ha(-1) preplant N applications, cotton yield was significantly impacted by the timing of sidedress N. However, at Altus in 2009 and Lake Carl Blackwell (LCB) in 2010, cotton recovered from early season N deficiency and attained near maximum lint yield when sidedress N fertilizer was applied at EPHS or FWF. At Altus in 2010, cotton recovered when sidedress N was applied at EPHS and reduced when sidedress N was delayed until FWF. Yields were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced when application was delayed to 30 DAFWF at all sites. The results indicate normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) could be used to make sidedress N recommendation for cotton at EPHS or FWF stage. This research validates the use of the SBNRC to improve in-season N recommendations in cotton production.

Spatial and seasonal patterns in fish assemblage in Corrego Rico, upper Parana River basin	NEOTROPICAL ICHTHYOLOGY												The upper Parana River basin drains areas of intensive industry and agriculture, suffering negative impacts. The Corrego Rico flows through sugar cane fields and receives urban wastewater. The aim of this work is to describe and to compare the fish assemblage structure in Corrego Rico. Six standardized bimonthly samples were collected between August 2008 and June 2009 in seven different stretches of Corrego Rico. Fishes were collected with an experimental seine and sieves, euthanized, fixed in formalin and preserved in ethanol for counting and identification. Data were recorded for water parameters, instream habitat and riparian features within each stretch. Non-metric multidimensional scaling, species richness and diversity analysis were performed to examine spatial and seasonal variation in assemblage structure. Fish assemblage structure was correlated with instream habitat and water parameters. The fish assemblage was divided in three groups: upper, middle and lower reaches. High values of richness and diversity were observed in the upper and lower stretches due to connectivity with a small lake and Mogi Guacu River, respectively. Middle stretches showed low values of richness and diversity suggesting that a small dam in the middle stretch negatively impacts the fish assemblage. Seasonal differences in fish assemblage structure were observed only in the lower stretches.

The predominant phytoplankton species in the pond were classified as Oscillatoria tenuis, Synedra ulna, Chlamydomonas cingulata and Cyclotella kutzingiana, with dominant species of Melosira italica, Synechococcus sp. and Cryptomonas ovata. The most important limiting factor for filament length and cell size of most of the phytoplankton community was temperature. Availability of most nutrients had profound effects on the phytoplankton growth as nonlimiting factors. Based on our results, it is suggested that cell cycle progression was also temporally regulated by a multiplicity of external factors such as temperature, nutrients, dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH. At high pH and high temperature, consistent increase of cell division of some phytoplanketers such as Synedra, Cyclotella, Chlamydomonas and Melosira occurs, and there also may be species-specific responses for other species of phytoplankters. In addition, the cell divisions of phytoplankters are differentially regulated in different phytoplankton species. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The analysis based on in-situ samples upstream to downstream (Puhekou, Jiajia'an, Yanziyu Panjiakou and Baqian) showed that three harmful algae species of Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta and Bacillariophyta prevail in the reservoir. The variations in algal concentrations presented a seasonal cycle with high values in the flood season and low values in the drought season and a spatial concentration in main water storage area of the reservoir. Compared with the environmental factors of pH value, permanganate index, ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen, water temperature, dissolved oxygen content and total phosphorus were significant related to algae concentrations with correlation coefficients of 0.76, 0.62 and 0.85, respectively. The impact analysis of three factors on prevailing algae species indicated that Chlorophyta was the main contributor to the algal photosynthesis of the Panjiakou Reservoir. An extremely high value of algal concentrations with little variety in August 2013 revealed that pollution carried by tremendous runoff may induce algae blooms later.					chen, boyu/KCY-0814-2024; Lichuan, Wang/LCE-3228-2024; Zhou, Yuyan/H-9007-2016														0097-8078	1608-344X				JUL	2016	43	4					690	698		10.1134/S0097807816040096	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0097807816040096													WOS:000384142500012

Chlorophyll-a amounts of benthic algal communities per unit area of the sandy sediments rapidly increased from late April to June. Increases in biomass of the benthic algal communities are considered to result from the propagation of filamentous green algae Oedogonium sp. and Spirogyra sp. The cell numbers of filamentous green algae and chlorophyll-a amounts of benthic algal communities at depths of 30 and 50cm at a station protected by a breakwater in May were significantly higher than those of a station exposed directly to wave activity. Thus, the biomass accumulation of the benthic algal communities seems to be regulated strongly by wave disturbance. The development of filamentous green algae may contribute to the increase in biomass of the benthic algal community and to the changes in seasonal patterns of biomass in the sand-beach zone of Lake Biwa. We consider that the development of the filamentous green algal community in the littoral zone of Lake Biwa is the result of eutrophication.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				DEC	2003	4	3					161	165		10.1007/s10201-003-0104-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-003-0104-3													WOS:000187075200006
J	Mazumder, A; Havens, KE				Mazumder, A; Havens, KE			Nutrient-chlorophyll-Secchi relationships under contrasting grazer communities of temperate versus subtropical lakes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES												Published data for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), chlorophyll (Chl), and water transparency (Secchi depth) for 420 lake-years in temperate North America and Europe and subtropical Florida were analyzed to test the hypothesis that subtropical and temperate lakes produce similar nutrient-Chl-Secchi relationships regardless of regional contrasts in seasonal, physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. We also tested the hypothesis that similarities in nutrient-Chl-Secchi relationships between temperate and subtropical lakes are expected only when the size or community structure of zooplankton remains constant. TP-Chl relationships were not significantly different for small zooplankton dominated temperate and subtropical lakes, but large herbivore (LH) dominated temperate lakes exhibited significantly lower Chi yield to TP than either subtropical small herbivore (SH) or temperate SH lakes. Although both nitrogen and phosphorus were important in determining the patterns and strengths of nutrient-Chl relationships in subtropical and temperate lakes, no particularly different role of TN or TP in determining Chl yield in the subtropical versus temperate lakes was observed. Unlike the nutrient-Chl relationships, Secchi depth seemed to decline as a function of both Chl and TP from subtropical SK to temperate SH to temperate LH lakes. Overall, the subtropical and temperate lakes seemed to produce similar general patterns of nutrient-Chl-transparency relationships, although mostly under the dominance of small zooplankton communities.																			0706-652X					JUL	1998	55	7					1652	1662		10.1139/cjfas-55-7-1652	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-55-7-1652													WOS:000076176300011

Fish were collected monthly between June of 2015 and June of 2016 using gill nets. In the laboratory, 600 individuals were weighed, measured, and eviscerated to obtain biometric data and data for the microscopic and macroscopic analyses of the maturation stages of the gonads. These analyses allowed the determination of the reproductive period using biological indicators such as the gonadosomatic index and hepatosomatic index, condition factor, stomach repletion index, and spawning season. Abiotic variables were measured in situ during the samplig: temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and electrical conductivity. In addition, local rainfall data was also obtained. The results showed that the total body length of individuals varied from 151 to 211 mm in males, and from 142 to 239 mm in females. The sex ratio showed a predominance of females over males, and the species showed negative allometric growth. The annual variation of reproductive indicators and the frequency of individuals in advanced stages of gonadal maturation suggest that the reproductive cycle of the species occurs between November and January, with a reproductive peak in January. This reproductive peak coincides with the beginning of the region's rainy season. Although we did not do the fertility analysis, our results suggest that the species presents partitioned spawning. In conclusion, this results demonstrates that the reproduction of the investigated specie is influenced by associations between environmental variables on a seasonal scale and can be contribute to improve the understanding of the dynamics of the physiological reproductive process in lentic environments.

Annual variation in water column structure and its implications for the behaviour of Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM) in a stratified tropical lake	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												The occurrence and dynamics of Deep Chlorophyll Maxima (DCM) in stratified water bodies has implications for aquatic productivity, biogeochemistry, and energy flow. Attributes of the DCM related to structure and function have been well studied in temperate systems but substantial knowledge gaps exist in tropical lakes due to limited studies. We investigated the seasonal and annual patterns of vertical chlorophyll distribution and behaviour of DCM along the water column of a tropical lake by monitoring Chl-a vertical profile biweekly over a two-year period. The aim was to understand the factors controlling seasonal variability of DCM and the functional relationship between DCM and epilimnetic Chl-a and changes in the physicochemical environment influencing these dynamic relationships. We found remarkable persistence of the DCM all year round with high average Chl-a and was not dissipated by lake mixing despite precipitous seasonal decline in euphotic depth. The persistence of DCM was linked with prolonged thermal stratification and high nutrient enrichment below the thermocline. DCM and epilimnetic algal chlorophyll were controlled by differing regulating mechanisms affected by stratification, mixing and restratification cycles of the lake. The euphotic depth and TP were the strongest predictors of DCM dynamics. Doubling of euphotic depth during thermal stratification increased DCM chlorophyll by 85 % above epilimnetic chlorophyll. These limnological patterns could be predicted from year to year to a high degree of certainty.

Effects of Wintertime Stocking of Rainbow Trout on the Forage Community of an Oklahoma Impoundment	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss are sometimes stocked to create put-and-take fisheries in small impoundments. Information about the effects of these stockings on existing piscivores is poorly understood. Therefore, we performed a study to evaluate the forage consumption by Rainbow Trout stocked in Lake Carl Etling, Oklahoma. A creel survey during the 2014-2015 trout season determined that angling pressure was low, which left the majority of stocked trout in the lake until their thermal maximum was exceeded in late May-June. Rainbow Trout stomach contents were collected monthly from November through April annually (2015-2018) via gastric lavage. Gizzard Shad Dorosoma cepedianum were consumed during most months, but their occurrence in Rainbow Trout stomachs was highest in January and December. A sharp decline in Gizzard Shad consumption was followed by an increase in detritus consumption each year. Using either Gizzard Shad numbers observed in monthly Rainbow Trout diets or the estimated monthly abundance of Rainbow Trout, we postulated that Rainbow Trout substantially affected age-0 Gizzard Shad biomass (reducing it by 66.7 or 54.6 kg/ha, respectively), potentially negatively affecting growth rates of other piscivores in the system. This study demonstrates the unintended consequences of stocking an additional predatory fish into small impoundments and the importance of evaluating angler harvest of these stocking programs to ensure the stocked species receives sufficient angler harvest to match stocking rates and prevent negative impacts on the fish community (both forage and other piscivorous species).

Irrespective of the season, the upper layer of the anaerobic zone of this lake had a specific species composition of sulfur phototrophic bacteria, which were dominated by the brown-colored green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium phaeovibrioides. The maximum number of sulfur phototrophic bacteria was observed in June 1999 at a depth of 9 m, which corresponded to a concentration of bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl) a equal to 4.6 mg/l. In September 2001, the maximum concentration of this pigment (3.4 mg/1) was found at a depth of 10 m. In both seasons, the concentration of Bchl a did not exceed 3 mu g/l. Purple sulfur bacteria were low in number, which can be explained by their poor adaptation to the hydrochemical and optical conditions of the Lake Mogilnoe water. In June 1999, the water contained a considerable number of Pelodictyon phaeum microcolonies and Prosthecochloris phaeoasteroides cell chains, which was not the case in September 2001. A 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic analysis of pure cultures of phototrophic bacteria isolated from the lake water confirmed that the bacterial community is dominated by Chl. phaeovibrioides and showed the presence of three minor species, Thiocystis gelatinosa, Thiocapsa sp., and Thiorhodococcus sp., the last of which is specific to Lake Mogilnoe.

J	Weisenborn, BN; Schaetzl, RJ				Weisenborn, BN; Schaetzl, RJ			Range of fragipan expression in some Michigan soils: II. A model for fragipan evolution	SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL												The evolution of fragipans in the Great Lakes region is poorly understood despite the common occurrence of fragipans in the region. To help resolve this problem, three soils with fragipans in northern Michigan were studied to evaluate the pedogenic pathways for fragipan evolution, and the results extended to soils forming under similar conditions. Soil characterizations were made via field, physical, chemical, and micromorphological observations and analyses and were evaluated in terms of the major models of fragipan genesis. Because it appears that a combination of pedogenic models best explains many of the fragipan properties of our soils, while also allowing for their variable expression, we developed a new model - one that integrates and synthesizes existing models and our findings - to explain fragipan evolution for many soils in Michigan and the Great Lakes region. The Michigan Model of Fragipan Evolution (MMFE) is therefore a synthesizing model that involves the self-weight collapse of a wet soil or parent material, followed by physical ripening of the collapsed zone. Ripening helps to retain the closely packed fabric and intergrain bridging in the collapsed zone, creating a protofragipan. Later, amorphous bonding agents precipitate in the protofragipan due to its position near a weathering-front discontinuity. The resulting fragipan develops progressively and becomes better expressed with further pedogenesis. Fragipan degradation is eventually initiated by an increasingly prominent, perched zone of saturation that forms seasonally above the fragipan. With time, processes associated with fragipan degradation and translocation of materials to lower parts of the profile exceed processes associated with progressive development, and the fragipan is destroyed.																			0361-5995					JAN-FEB	2005	69	1					178	187																WOS:000226598100020

Special attention was paid to the changes in these processes related to depth, spatial distribution of sampling points, different periods of planktonic succession and to the taxon-specific bacterivory of ciliates. Bacterial production (BP) in both reservoirs was, on average, reaching similar values (ranging from 1.2 x 10(6) to 4 x 10(6) bacteria ml(-1) d(-1)). In Rimov (mesoeutrophic, mean retention time 100 days), when seasonally averaged, total protistan grazing accounted for 35% of BP and was consistantly lower in the layer R (layer with the same temperature and conductivity as the river inflow). On the contrary, the seasonal average for the Orlik reservoir (eutrophic, mean retention time of 23 days) showed roughly two times higher proportion of BP (70% of the total) removed by protists. In both reservoirs, there was little or no difference in contribution of ciliates and HNF to total protistan bacterivory. Overall, oligotrichous ciliates were recognized as the major ciliate bacterivores (accounting for 67% and 48% of total ciliate bacterivory in Rimov and Orlik, respectively) followed by peritrichous ciliates that contributed to total ciliate bacterivory from 23% (Rimov) to 28% (Orlik). A small omnivorous oligotrichous ciliate Halteria cf. grandinella was the major bacterivore within the whole ciliate community in both reservoirs, contributing as much as 48 and 34% to the total ciliate bacterivory, in the Rimov and Orlik reservoirs, respectively.

J	Postius, C; Ernst, A				Postius, C; Ernst, A			Mechanisms of dominance: coexistence of picocyanobacterial genotypes in a freshwater ecosystem	ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY												The autotrophic picoplankton of the pelagic zone of the mesotrophic Lake Constance is dominated by phycoerythrin-rich unicellular cyanobacteria phylogenetically related to the marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus cluster. In Lake Constance, the abundance of picocyanobacteria shows a recurrent pattern of seasonal variations. Evidence of diverse subpopulations was obtained by electron-microscopic examination of natural water samples and isolated strains that unveiled different surface structures of picocyanobacteria. Further evidence was obtained by DNA analysis of 26 clonal isolates representing 12 different genotypes. Variations in light and nutrient supply revealed distinct abilities of the genetically different strains to cope with these stress situations. Furthermore, cultured heterotrophic nanoflagellates exhibited differential feeding preferences for certain Synechococcus strains. The findings imply that growth and loss rates of the natural cyanobacterial community may be influenced by its genetic composition. Phylogenetic analyses of isolated strains indicated that the physiological diversification of pelagic Synechococcus spp. has occurred during a recent adaptive radiation. An example for genetic mechanisms underlying physiological diversification is indicated by mobile DNA elements found in a Synechocystis strain also isolated from the pelagic zone of Lake Constance. The observations suggest that dominance of Synechococcus spp. was achieved by evolutionary adaptation and coexistence of numerous genotypes generating a physiologically highly diversified population.																			0302-8933	1432-072X				AUG	1999	172	2					69	75		10.1007/s002030050742	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002030050742								10415167					WOS:000081873100001

Correlation Analysis of the Seasonality of Adenovirus Gene Detection and Water Quality Parameters Based on Yearly Monitoring	WATER QUALITY EXPOSURE AND HEALTH												The goal of this study was tomonitor the presence of adenovirus in rivers and lakes used for recreation and as a source for the public water supply in the city of Goiania, Brazil, in addition to carrying out a correlation analysis of the seasonality of adenovirus gene detection and water quality parameters based on yearly monitoring. We collected 54 water samples from two lakes and two rivers. The samples were concentrated by using a positively-charged membrane, and DNA was extracted by a phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol method, followed by PCR. Adenovirus was detected in 44.4% (24 of 54) of the samples collected. Physicochemical and bacteriological tests were carried out according to water quality monitoring standard procedures. Significant differences over the study period were observed for the presence of adenovirus in water and the values for nitrites, phosphates and fixed and total solids. The occurrence of adenovirus showed a seasonal trend, and significant differences with bacteriological tests were not observed. This is the first study to monitor adenovirus in water sources in the Midwestern Region of Brazil. The results may be useful to gen-erate an eco-epidemiological profile of adenoviruses or even to identify the transmission routes of some neglected diseases, showing the importance in monitoring adenoviruses.					; Delleon Silva, Hugo/A-2139-2013	Silveira-Lacerda, Elisangela/0000-0002-4143-9007; Delleon Silva, Hugo/0000-0002-1778-0299													1876-1658	1876-1666				OCT	2011	3	2					101	107		10.1007/s12403-011-0047-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12403-011-0047-6													WOS:000209141200004

Temporal profiles of walleye angling effort, harvest rate, and harvest in northern Wisconsin lakes	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												In regions where water resources are abundant, broad-scale fisheries management requires quantifying fishery trends on a representative sample of lakes and then using these data to evaluate management actions and assess fishery status. Therefore, we quantified regional fishery profiles of the average number of complete-trip interviews, effort per acre, the number of walleyes Sander Owens harvested per angler-hour, and the number of walleyes harvested per acre among hours, seasons, and years from 1991 to 2002 in northern Wisconsin lakes. The average number of interviews within days was similar between weekday and weekend day types but differed between open-water and ice-fishing seasons, peaking at midday and late afternoon during open water and midday during ice fishing. The average harvest rate within days was similar between day types and seasons and was highest in the morning and afternoon. The average angler effort during the angling season differed between day types and peaked in July on weekdays and in May on weekends. The average harvest rate during the angling season differed between day types and peaked in May on weekdays but also December on weekends. The average harvest per acre during the angling season was similar between day types and declined from May to February. The cumulative average angler effort was higher on weekdays than on weekends during 1991-2002, but the harvest rate and liar-vest per acre were similar between day types. Angler effort, harvest rate, and harvest per acre did not change significantly among years. Angler use and success changed systematically within days and among seasons but not among years, which suggests that walleye populations and the associated fishery were stable. The regional fishery profiles for each estimate were similar to the results from smaller-scale studies, suggesting that regional profiles can accurately depict patterns on a smaller scale.

Nutrient concentrations showed a descending gradient with distance, while chlorophyll concentrations showed an ascending gradient with the distance from the Sigirci Inlet to the Karadere Outlet. Higher nutrient concentrations did always not coincide with higher chlorophyll concentrations. The results showed that regression models developed using seasonal data were more accurate in predicting chlorophyll concentrations than those developed using the pooled data from whole year ( based on R-2 and the difference between the measured and predicted values). The findings also revealed that within a single large shallow lake, chlorophyll-nutrient relationships might show significant variations spatially. The objective of this study was to determine the seasonal and spatial variations in the relationships between chlorophyll, nitrate, phosphate and ammonium in the shallow hypertrophic Lake Manyas, Turkey.

These methods range from the simple egg-ratio method, to mathematically complex models based on partial differential equations and numerically complex individual-based Daphnia population models. The usefulness of these models in unraveling the population dynamics and demography of Daphnia under natural conditions is discussed. Next to this, an extended version of an existing individual-based Daphnia model is documented (Cladosim) and its application to a typical field data set collected in 1995 in Lake Volkerak is shown. To answer the question which factor was limiting Daphnia numbers during the course of the season food level and temperature in the model were varied and results were compared with those obtained for the observed food level and temperature. These analysis showed that in April temperature was limiting while during May - July and September - October food was limiting. In August neither temperature nor food was limiting. Analysis with a set of size- selective mortality scenarios showed that on average the Daphnia population in Lake Volkerak experienced a mild positive size-selective mortality during the year that was analyzed. Birth rates derived with the detailed individual-based model were compared with those derived with the much simpler egg-ratio method. For the conditions as observed in Lake Volkerak in 1995, both methods gave very comparable results, despite sampling intervals of up to four weeks. The same holds under the environmental scenarios. Using the size- selective mortality scenarios it could be shown, however, that under strong mortality of the smaller daphnids, the egg-ratio method severely underestimates the birth rate. The vices and virtues of the new model and potential extensions are discussed.

J	Bonnet, MP; Poulin, M; Devaux, J				Bonnet, MP; Poulin, M; Devaux, J			Numerical modeling of thermal stratification in a lake reservoir. Methodology and case study	AQUATIC SCIENCES												A numerical model of the hydrodynamic and thermal structure of an artificial lake was designed and developed as a basis for an ecological water-quality model. It allows the quantification of the vertical mixing processes that govern not only the thermal structure but also the nutrient exchanges, and more generally the distribution of dissolved and particulate matter between the different parts of the lake. The vertical temperature profiles were calculated by solving the one-dimensional heat transfer equation that takes into account the internal heat sources and sinks, advection due to inflow and outflow and the molecular and eddy diffusions. A finite-difference discretization of first-order in time and second-order in space was chosen. The numerical time-step was three hours and layers were one-meter in thickness. These time- and space-scales are well-suited to perform a precise simulation of the different processes occurring over a seasonal period. Moreover, this simulation requires only a reasonable amount of computer time. This model was used to study an artificial lake, (i.e. a reservoir), located in the high Loire valley (Roanne, France). To precisely identify the physical processes followed with an accurate numerical modeling, on-site data were acquired intensively over three years. Temperatures were monitored hourly at 11 different levels in the three main reaches of the reservoir to study the lake hydrodynamics and thermal behaviour. Meterological measurements were made every 20 minutes. One-year data were used for calibration, whereas the model was validated using the data collected over the other two years.

The use of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) can be an effective and economical control for aquatic vegetation such as hydrilla. Early stocking rates (24 to 74 grass carp per hectare of lake area) resulted in grass carp consumption rates that vastly exceeded the growth rates of the aquatic plants and often resulted in the total loss of all submersed vegetation. This study looked at 38 Florida lakes that had been stocked with grass carp for 3 to 10 years with stocking rates ranging from < 1 to 59 grass carp per hectare of lake and 1 to 207 grass carp per hectare of vegetation to determine the long term effects of grass carp on aquatic macrophyte communities. The median PAC (percent area coverage) value of aquatic macrophytes for the study lakes after they were stocked with grass carp was 14% and the median PVI (percent volume infested) value of aquatic macrophytes was 2%. Only lakes stocked with less than 25 to 30 fish per hectare of vegetation tended to have higher than median PAC and PVI values. When grass carp are stocked at levels of > 25 to 30 fish per hectare of vegetation the complete control of aquatic vegetation can be achieved, with the exception of a few species of plants that grass carp have extreme difficulty consuming. If the management goal for a lake is to control some of the problem aquatic plants while maintaining a small population of predominately unpalatable aquatic plants, grass carp carl be stocked at approximately 25 to 30 fish per hectare of vegetation.																			0146-6623					JAN	2000	38						48	54																WOS:000166874300007

Storms and pH of dam releases affect downstream phosphorus cycling in an arid regulated river	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Reservoirs often bury phosphorus (P), leading to seasonal or persistent reductions in P supply to downstream rivers. Here we ask if observed variation in the chemistry of dam release waters stimulates downstream sediment P release and biological activity in an arid, oligotrophic system, the Colorado River below Lake Powell, Arizona, USA. We use bottle incubations to simulate a range of observed pH (6-8.8) and oxygen (0-9.4 mg L-1) levels, with the hypothesis that either oxygen concentrations or pH regulates P release from sediments to the water column. We found support for pH-mediated P release from calcite across the three sites we sampled. The magnitude of this effect was lower in bottles filled with tailwater sediment, but at downriver sites low pH resulted in declining water column dissolved inorganic nitrogen:soluble reactive P (DIN:SRP) ratios, which dropped below the Redfield ratio of 16:1, increasing water column total protein production, and down-regulating alkaline phosphatase production. Additional 7-day incubations showed that tributary storm inputs can temporarily elevate riverine P availability from < 1.5 & mu;g L-1 total dissolved P (TDP) pre-storm to 6.7 & mu;g L-1 TDP post storm. Taken together, our lab incubation and long-term observational results highlight the importance of pH, and ultimately reservoir management and storm dynamics, in regulating P availability and biological processes both now and into the future.

The samples have been collected seasonally for a period of one year. Solid-phase extraction followed by gas-chromatographic techniques with electron-capture detection was used for the determination of the compounds. The compounds detected were HCB, lindane, beta-HCH, heptachlor, methoxychlor, alpha-endosulphan, and 2,4-DDT, while alpha-HCH, aldrin, heptachlorperoxide, 4,4-DDE, dieldrin, endrin, 4,4-DDD, beta-endosulphan,and 4,4-DDT could not be observed ( detection limits >= 1 ng L-1). The frequencies of the compounds detected in the samples varied between 10 and 83% and between 6 and 88% in the water and sediment samples, respectively. Among the 16 OCPs pesticides monitored, only 2,4-DDT and methoxychlor were found in detectable concentrations in sediments throughout the whole sampling period. The water-sediment distribution pattern of the detected compounds reflects the great capacity of the lake sediments to adsorb and accumulate such compounds.

Seasonal development of the species structure and depth distribution of biomass, as well as chlorophyll-a concentrations, and chemical characteristics of the lake water were examined. The phytoplankton was made up of a low number of nanoplanktonic unicellular species, mainly flagellates from Cryptophyceae and Chrysophyceae. Plagioselmis lacustris, Cryptomonas cf. erosa and Ochromonas spp. were the most important with regards to both abundance and biomass. The phytoplankton showed a marked seasonal development. During most of the ice-covered period, abundances of phytoplankton remained very low. In regard to the vertical distribution, both species composition and total biomass were clearly stratified during most sampling dates. The amount of chlorophyll-a per unit biovolume varied considerably, and significantly higher values were found on sampling dates with complete or partial ice cover. Our data on pH and phytoplankton were compared with a previous study in 1990-1991 in order to evaluate possible changes associated with the decrease of acid deposition. The extent of episodic acidification of the lake water has diminished both in time and space, and lake water pH has slightly increased. We observed a shift in species composition, and an important increase of total phytoplankton abundance. This could be considered as a first sign of biological response to changing chemical conditions.

J	Soos, C; Wobeser, G				Soos, C; Wobeser, G			Identification of primary substrate in the initiation of avian botulism outbreaks	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT												The source of substrate for initial proliferation and toxigenesis of Clostridium botulinum prior to outbreaks of avian botulism is typically unknown. We investigated factors involved in the initiation of avian botulism outbreaks at Eyebrow Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada, and focused on the role of Franklin's gull (Larus pipixcan) mortality as a source of initial substrate for C. botulinum. From 1999 to 2001, hatch-year Franklin's gull carcasses were the predominant source of toxin-laden maggots found prior to outbreaks of avian botulism in waterfowl. Peak carcass density of gulls occurred 1-2 weeks prior to the onset of botulism outbreaks in waterfowl. Nest density at the beginning of the breeding season was a significant predictor of juvenile gull-carcass density. Both the proportion of gull carcasses developing maggots and the proportion of maggot samples containing toxin increased as the season progressed, and carcasses were 22.7 times more likely to develop toxin-laden maggots at mean daily water temperatures >= 20 degrees C than at temperatures < 20 degrees C. This was primarily a result of carcasses being 22.2 times more likely to become maggot-laden at temperatures >= 20 degrees C, whereas there was no difference in the occurrence of toxin within maggots developing below or above 20 degrees C. With increasing water temperature, carcasses developed maggots significantly more rapidly and were available for a shorter time period. High density of toxic material from hatch-year Franklin's gull carcasses prior to the onset of botulism coincided with high densities of susceptible birds; hence, gull mortality had the potential to be a major initiating factor for botulism outbreaks at Eyebrow Lake. If management is deemed necessary on lakes enzootic for botulism, intensive surveillance should begin well before the anticipated onset of outbreaks to identify and remove sources of primary substrate. Managers might also consider developing and evaluating strategies to prevent the occurrence of high carcass density, particularly in areas of high nest density of species that may generate high juvenile carcass densities.

Previous works nearby have demonstrated that sediments preserved in lake basins hold the potential to serve as valuable archives of paleoseismicity. Correspondingly, a high-resolution chirp seismic reflection survey was conducted in Lac Simard, with results showing four acoustic facies (Af-1 to Af-4) within two stratigraphic successions (SS-1 and SS-2). The lowermost SS-1 is dominated by high-amplitude, laminated Af-2, interpreted as lateglacial varves deposited by suspension from primarily overflows and interflows during glacial lake ponding following deglaciation. Suspension deposition of Af-2 was episodically interrupted by stacked, chaotically bedded, weakly graded to opaque, channelled Af-3 interpreted as either debris flows or high-density turbidity currents. Presence of silt-clast breccias in Af-3 also suggests downslope collapse and reworking of varves from basin sidewalls. The overlying SS-2 is dominated by weakly reflective, laminated, high-frequency varved Af-4, suggesting a continuing seasonal control on postglacial sedimentation but with relative sediment starvation. A basin-wide erosional unconformity separating SS-1 and postglacial SS-2 records the abrupt drainage of glacial Lake Barlow-Ojibway around 8 000 years ago. Considering the history of lake floor disturbance in the region, mass flow facies Af-3 may be seismogenic, and thus, have regional tectonic significance. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of mass flows triggered by abrupt inflows of meltwater and sediment from a highly dynamic retreating Laurentide Ice Sheet prone to surging.

Responses of periphyton to artificial nutrient enrichment in freshwater kettle ponds of Cape Cod National Seashore	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Nutrient enrichment bioassays, in conjunction with sampling and analysis of surface water chemistry, were conducted in freshwater lakes (kettle ponds) of Cape Cod National Seashore (Massachusetts, USA) to ascertain the importance of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in regulating the growth of periphyton. Arrays of nutrient diffusing substrata (NDS) were suspended 0.5 m below the water surface in a total of 12 ponds in July and August 2005. Algal biomass developing on each NDS after similar to 3 weeks of exposure in each month was assessed by quantifying chlorophyll a + phaeophyton pigments. In both July and August, strong responses to N + P and N enrichments were observed in the majority of ponds, while P had no stimulatory effect. These responses correspond well with low atomic ratios (1-18) of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to total phosphorus (TP) in ambient surface waters. The results suggest that conditions in the kettle ponds develop whereby nitrogen is the primary limiting nutrient to periphyton growth. While this may be a seasonal phenomenon, it has implications for nutrient management in individual ponds and within the larger watershed.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				NOV	2006	571						201	211		10.1007/s10750-006-0239-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-006-0239-4													WOS:000240308500016

Simulated mechanical control of Nitellopsis obtusa under mesocosm conditions	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Management efforts to control starry stonewort [Nitellopsis obtusa (Desvaux in Loiseleur) J. Groves] have been limited to stressing the thalli and have not been able to directly target the reproductive bulbils. Smaller-scale efforts such as the use of hand pulling can be employed, but hand pulling is not realistic for larger infestations. This research was conducted to test the effects of clipping stress on N. obtusa to provide a baseline for the effect of stress on the production of bulbils and the regrowth of thalli. Mesocosms were set up under greenhouse conditions to test the effects on N. obtusa of simulated mechanical harvesting once, twice, and four times per growing season. Different seasonal timing and frequency of clipping treatments will remove different amounts of thalli biomass. The four-clipping treatment always reduced thalli biomass in this study at both 16 and 52 wk after treatment (WAT) compared with the nontreated reference, but there was no difference among clipping treatments at 52 WAT. At 16 WAT, one clipping reduced bulbil density by 44% (Trial 1) to 50% (Trial 2), two clippings reduced bulbil density by 28% (Trial 2) to 52% (Trial 1), and four clippings reduced bulbil density by 22% (Trial 2) to 88% (Trial 1). At 52 WAT, bulbil densities were 69% and 93% lower than those of the nontreated reference Trials 2 and 1, respectively. Results from this study indicate that clipping may be effective for N. obtusa control and could impact bulbil production.						, Alyssa/0000-0002-8794-2353; Wersal, Ryan/0000-0002-4014-5138													1939-7291	1939-747X				SEP	2023	16	3					191	195	PII S1939729123000184	10.1017/inp.2023.18	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/inp.2023.18		JUL 2023											WOS:001046536200001

Plumes can influence calving rates, marine biogeochemistry and fjord circulation. However, little is known about how their dynamics will evolve in a warmer, wetter Arctic with increasing melt rates and retreating glacier margins. To determine the temporal magnitude and frequency evolution of sediment-laden meltwater plumes, we manually delineated plume outlines in every available Sentinel-2 image at Blomstrandbreen, Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, between 2016 and 2021. While the frequency of plumes upwelling on the fjord surface remained stable in each melt season, their surface area increased significantly by almost an order of magnitude between the beginning and end of the study period, owing primarily to glacial runoff. This significant change was a result of several large plumes (>2 km(2)) mapped in 2020 and 2021. The rate of glacier terminus change throughout the study period has little-to-no influence on plume surface area. However, a notable event concerning the terminus retreating into an overdeepening between 2017 and 2018 may have impacted plume magnitude, allowing for larger plume migration across the calving front after 2018. Seasonal supraglacial lakes on Blomstrandbreen are found to be small in both area and volume which have limited influence on plumes surfacing between 2016-2021. Our findings suggest with increased runoff, plumes upwelling at the glacier terminus may increase in size, transporting greater volumes of sediment into the surrounding local marine environment. These changes could be exacerbated by projected increases in glacier mass loss and retreat expected to occur across Svalbard throughout this century and beyond, making the study of plumes and their impacts key to constraining the transport of water and sediment from a terrestrial to a marine environment as demonstrated at Blomstrandbreen.					; Shiggins, Connor/HTQ-8515-2023	Hodgkins, Richard/0000-0001-6946-9788; Shiggins, Connor/0000-0001-8249-921X; Tallentire, Guy/0000-0002-0389-6581; Rawlins, Lauren/0000-0001-7538-7228; 													0143-1161	1366-5901				JUL 3	2023	44	13					3972	3992		10.1080/01431161.2023.2229492	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2023.2229492													WOS:001025150900001

Although well known for its toxicity, several aspects of As accumulation and biological transformation by field species are still little explored. In this study, the bioaccumulation and speciation of As in phytoplankton and zooplankton from five soda lakes in the Brazilian Pantanal wetland were studied. Such lakes exhibited contrasting biogeochemical characteristics along an environmental gradient. Additionally, the influence of contrasting climatic events was assessed by collecting samples during an exceptional drought in 2017 and a flood in 2018. Total As (AsTot) content and speciation were determined using spectrometric techniques, while a suspect screening of organoarsenicals in plankton samples was carried out by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Results showed that AsTot content ranged from 16.9 to 62.0 mg kg-1 during the dry period and from 2.4 to 12.3 mg kg-1 during the wet period. The bioconcentration and bioaccumulation factors (BCF and BAF) in phytoplankton and zooplankton were found to be highly dependent on the lake typology, which is influenced by an ongoing evapoconcentration process in the region. Eutrophic and As-enriched lakes exhibited the lowest BCF and BAF values, possibly due to the formation of non-labile As complexes with organic matter or limited uptake of As by plankton caused by high salinity stress. The season played a decisive role in the results, as significantly higher BCF and BAF values were observed during the flooding event when the concentration of dissolved As in water was low. The diversity of As species was found to be dependent on the lake typology and on the resident biological community, cyanobacteria being responsible for a significant portion of As metabolism. Arsenosugars and their degradation products were detected in both phytoplankton and zooplankton, providing evidence for previously reported detoxification pathways. Although no biomagnification pattern was observed, the diet seemed to be an important exposure pathway for zooplankton.					; Sussulini, Alessandra/B-1700-2009; Rezende, Alessandro/AAS-6817-2020; Fiore, Marli F./C-1436-2012; FOSTIER, ANNE/D-3108-2017; BARBIERO, Laurent/D-4168-2009; Barbiero, Laurent/D-4168-2009; Fiore, Marli/C-1436-2012; Pellegrinetti, Thierry/HLV-7560-2023; Viana, José Lucas Martins/AAB-8354-2019	Hechavarria Hernandez, Amauris/0000-0001-8985-2135; Fiore, Marli F./0000-0003-2555-7967; Viana, Jose Lucas Martins/0000-0002-4030-9905; BARBIERO, Laurent/0000-0002-7285-4270; Pellegrinetti, Thierry/0000-0001-9386-6273; 													0048-9697	1879-1026				OCT 15	2023	895								165189	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165189	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165189		JUL 2023						37391131					WOS:001037732500001

The conventional water quality parameters are frequently measured to evaluate the effectiveness of phytoremediation. However, the concentration of microcystin-leucine-arginine (MC-LR) in different vegetated water still remains uncertain. In this study, the contents of MC-LR in four macrophyte-vegetated lagoons were determined by solid phase extraction and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry technology. Results indicated that MC-LR was found in Nymphaea tetragona lagoon (lagoon-S), Vallisneria spiralis lagoon (lagoon-B) and another Vallisneria spiralis lagoon (lagoon-J). Only in lagoon dominated by Pistia stradotes L. (lagoon-D), MC-LR concentration was undiscovered regardless of seasonal variation. The levels of varied seasonally and were affected by the different vegetated aquatic macrophytes. The results suggest that in addition to conventional physicochemical parameters and indicators of water quality, MC-LR levels should be taken into consideration when the effectiveness of phytoremediation is assessed.

J	Saturday, A; Kangume, S; Bamwerinde, W				Saturday, Alex; Kangume, Susan; Bamwerinde, Wilson			Content and dynamics of nutrients in the surface water of shallow Lake Mulehe in Kisoro District, South-western Uganda	APPLIED WATER SCIENCE												The purpose of this study was to investigate the content and dynamics of nutrients in the shallow (max. 6 m) Lake Mulehe. We collected 54 water samples from nine sampling stations between the wet season (March-May 2020 and dry season (June-August 2020). Nutrients; ammonia-nitrogen (NH4-N), nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), nitrite-nitrogen (NO2-N), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were investigated in accordance with APHA 2017 standard procedures. Besides, physical parameters: Temperature, pH, turbidity, electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen were measured in situ. The water quality index (WQI) was used to determine the water quality of Lake Muhele using drinking water quality standards developed by the Uganda National Bureau of Standards and the World Health Organization. Results indicated that nutrients (TN, NO3-N, TP, NH4-N, NO2-N and SRP) did not differ substantially between study stations (p > 0.05) but did reveal significant differences (p < 0.05) across study months. Besides, nutrient levels differed significantly between seasons (p < 0.05) except for SRP and NH4-N. The WQI values varied from 36.0 to 74.5, with a mean of 58.69. The recorded overall WQI value places Lake Mulehe's water quality into the 'poor' category in terms of worthiness for human consumption. The study, therefore, recommends continuous pollution monitoring and enforcement of local regulations to reduce pollution in the lake as a result of anthropogenic activities.

In this study, we used a combination of short-interval sampling and spatial data analysis to investigate the distribution patterns of pelagic phyto- and zooplankton in Lake Pyhaselka, a moderately large (263 km(2)) mesotrophic and humic lake in eastern Finland. The general goal of this work was to improve our understanding of pelagic plankton interactions and dynamics in large lakes. The specific objective was to reveal and verify the short-interval day-to-day temporal and spatial distribution patterns of pelagic plankton in 2005 in Lake Pyhaselka. We can conclude from our results that phytoplankton and zooplankton exhibit seasonally and spatially heterogeneous distribution; the most obvious differences in phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance and biomass, and in the water quality parameters, were seasonal ones, and these were statistically highly significant; there were obvious small-scale, short-interval day-to-day variations in temperature and the horizontal and vertical distribution of phytoplankton and zooplankton; and the validity of a comparative inter-lake approach and long term monitoring of one lake would greatly depend on the question of whether the samples had been taken in the same month, at the same place and at comparable points in the vertical water column.																			1239-6095					OCT 30	2009	14	5					903	913																WOS:000271670800007
J	Ramos-Jiliberto, R; Aránguiz-Acuña, A				Ramos-Jiliberto, Rodrigo; Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana			Between-species differences in demographic responses to temperature of coexisting cladocerans	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												In this work we report on the seasonal trends of abundances in terms of temperature exposure for four coexisting cladoceran species (Daphnia ambigua (Daphniidae), Ceriodaphnia dubia (Daphniidae), Diaphanosoma chilense (Sididae) and Moina micrura (Moinidae)) from a Chilean temperate lake. In order to compare the demographic response to temperature, we used life table experiments to parameterize matrix models for the four species at four fixed temperatures. From these life table response experiments we assessed the effects of temperature, species and their interaction on the variation in growth rate, as well as the contribution of juvenile survival, adult survival, fertility and age at first reproduction to the changes in growth rate. Our results showed interspecific differences in the effect of temperature on the growth rate. Species that present higher field abundance at lower temperature also exhibited, under controlled experiments, higher growth rates at low temperature and lower growth rates at high temperature, relative to the additive model. Conversely, species with higher abundances during the warmer seasons exhibited higher growth rates at higher experimental temperatures and lower growth rates at lower temperatures, relative to the additive model. The vital rates that most contributed to the variation in growth rate were age at first reproduction and fertility. Our growth rate estimates matched predictions of the metabolic ecology model.					; Ramos-Jiliberto, Rodrigo/F-3160-2013	Ramos-Jiliberto, Rodrigo/0000-0002-0108-7502; Aranguiz-Acuna, Adriana/0000-0002-9409-1147; 													1442-9985	1442-9993				NOV	2007	32	7					766	774		10.1111/j.1442-9993.2007.01758.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2007.01758.x													WOS:000250144400005

Twenty-five eggs were placed in a laboratory incubator, of which 18 hatched; chicks were sacrificed within 24 h. Hatching success was not significantly different between eggs taken from pulp mill sites and reference sites. A hepatic cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) cross-reactive protein was induced nearly sixfold in chicks from near a pulp mill at Powell River compared to those from a reference site (p < 0.05). Hepatic ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylase (BROD) activities were also significantly elevated in chicks from nests located near pulp mills compared to reference sites (p < 0.0005 and p < 0.02, respectively). A hepatic CYP2B cross-reactive protein was threefold higher in chicks from pulp mill versus reference sites, but the difference was not significant. Residual yolk sacs of eggs collected near pulp mill sites contained greater concentrations of 2,3,7,8-substituted polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) compared to reference areas. No significant differences in concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), non-ortho congeners, and organochlorine pesticides occurred among sites. Regressions showed that the hepatic CYP1A cross-reactive protein and EROD and BROD activities were positively correlated with 2,3,7,8-TCDD, 2,3,7,8-TCDE and toxic equivalents (TEQs(WHO)-World Health Organization toxic equivalence factors) in yolk sacs. No significant concentration-related effects were found for morphological, physiological, or histological parameters, such as chick growth, edema, or density of thymic lymphocytes. Using hepatic CYP1A induction as a biomarker, a no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) of 100 ng/kg and a lowest-observed-effect-level (LOEL) of 210 ng/kg TEQs(WHO) on a whole egg (wet weight basis) are suggested for bald eagle chicks.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				MAY	1996	15	5					782	793		10.1002/etc.5620150526	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620150526													WOS:A1996UH98600026

These small-bodied herbivorous and cathemeral primates are endemic to the reed and papyrus beds around Lac Alaotra in Madagascar. They live in small groups in small, defended territories. Data were collected during the rainy seasons in 1996, 1997, and 1999, and include 99 individuals from 22 neighboring social groups and an additional 30 animals from other areas representing most of the geographic range. Animals were located by researchers canoeing in the marshes bordering the lake. After a group's size was determined by direct observation, all individuals were captured, marked, and released. During handling each individual was weighed and sexed, and hair samples for DNA extraction were collected. A 342 bp mtDNA control region sequence and 10 nuclear microsatellite loci provided multilocus genotypes that were used to assess pedigree relations and population structure. Alaotran gentle lemurs were found in groups of two to nine individuals (mean: 4.3), comprising one or two breeding females, their offspring, and one reproducing male. Solitary individuals of both sexes were encountered rarely. Breeding females were the permanent core of the social groups, whereas intergroup transfer of reproductive males was relatively frequent. Forty percent of all reproducing groups contained two breeding females, which were related to each other as closely as mother-daughter or full sisters. Parentage assessment revealed a variable mating system ranging from serial monogamy to polygyny within social groups. At least 8% of paternities involved extragroup males. Additional data on life history and reproduction are presented, and the social system of the Alaotran gentle lemur is discussed in the light of the new genetic findings.

The seasonal dynamics of the infestation of young tilapia was traced in 1997-1998. First appearing in May, it became maximal in June-August, decreased in October and was not detectable in November. Outbreak of the infestation and subsequent mortality of young fish was registered at the Sea at a water temperature and salinity of 40 degrees C and 46 ppt, respectively. Some aspects of the ultrastructure of parasitic trophonts of A. ocellatum and their location on the fish from different size groups are considered. The interactions of parasitological and environmental factors and their combined effect upon fish from the Salton Sea are discussed.																			0177-5103	1616-1580				DEC 22	1999	39	1					65	73		10.3354/dao039065	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/dao039065								11407406					WOS:000085287800008
J	Abhijna, UG				Abhijna, U. G.			Monitoring and assessment of a eutrophicated coastal lake using multivariate approaches	GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM												Multivariate statistical techniques such as cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling and principal component analysis were applied to evaluate the temporal and spatial variations in water quality data set generated for two years (2008-2010) from six monitoring stations of Veli-Akkulam Lake and compared with a regional reference lake Vellayani of south India. Seasonal variations of 14 different physicochemical parameters analyzed were as follows: pH (6.42-7.48), water temperature (26.0-31.28 degrees C), salinity (0.50-26.81 ppt), electrical conductivity (47-20656.31 mu s/cm), dissolved oxygen (0.078-7.65 mg/L), free carbon-dioxide (3.8-51.8 mg/L), total hardness (27.20-2166.6 mg/L), total dissolved solids (84.66-4195 mg/L), biochemical oxygen demand (1.57-25.78 mg/L), chemical oxygen demand (5.35-71.14 mg/L), nitrate (0.012-0.321 mu g/ml), nitrite (0.24-0.79 mu g/ml), phosphate (0.04-5.88 mg/L), and sulfate (0.27-27.8 mg/L). Cluster analysis showed four clusters based on the similarity of water quality characteristics among sampling stations during three different seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon). Multidimensional scaling in conjunction with cluster analysis identified four distinct groups of sites with varied water quality conditions such as upstream, transitional and downstream conditions in Veli-Akkulam Lake and a reference condition at Vellayani Lake. Principal Component Analysis showed that Veli-Akkulam Lake was seriously deteriorated in water quality while acceptable water quality conditions were observed at reference lake Vellayani. Thus the present study could estimate the effectiveness of multivariate statistical approaches for assessing water quality conditions in lakes.																			2383-3572					SUM	2016	2	3					275	288		10.7508/gjesm.2016.03.007	http://dx.doi.org/10.7508/gjesm.2016.03.007													WOS:000375865700007

This record was compared to local weather data as well as larger scale weather patterns. The lake has been in a state of decline interrupted by major flood events since the beginning of the satellite record. From 1973 to 1997, the lake area was between 0.97 km(2) and 4.28 km(2). Lake extent abruptly increased to 13.86 km(2) in 1998, when a co-occurrence of El Nino and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole led to extensive flooding. It is hypothesized that local agricultural practices leading to soil erosion and subsequent basin sedimentation have most likely increased the sensitivity of Lake Basotu to climatic fluctuations.

J	Kar, S; Kar, D				Kar, Sulata; Kar, Devashish			Zooplankton diversity of a Freshwater wetland of Assam	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED BIOTECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH												Zooplankton are passively drifting microscopic organism in an aquatic waterbody which occupy a central position between the autotrophs and heterotrophs in an aquatic ecosystem. They are good bio-indicator of environmental pollution as they response quickly to any changes in water quality. Zooplankton are also known as staple food item of fishes especially the larvae of fishes. For success in an aquaculture activity they are known to play very important role indicating the presence or absence of certain species of fishes or the determining the population densities of an aquatic farm. The present work was undertaken in Madhura anua, an oxbow lake in Cachar, Assam which is mainly used by people residing in the catchment area for aquacultural program and also household activities. The study was carried out for a period of one year (September 2014 to August 2015) to study the diversity of zooplankton in the freshwater ecosystem. The present analysis reveals presence of good diversity of zooplankton in the lake. In this oxbow lake, three major groups of zooplankton were reported namely, Cladocera, Copepoda and Rotifera. Among the three groups, rotifers are found to dominate the lake ecosystem. Among the 37 taxa reported, 20 were from rotifera group followed by that of cladocera with 13 taxa and 4 taxa from copepoda. On quantitative analysis of zooplankton in the oxbow wetland, shows higher abundance percentage of 58% by rotifera which is reported to be much more higher than that of cladocera and copepod. Higher presence of rotifera in the lake is an indication of its pollution leading to eutrophication in near future. Present investigation may help in conservation of the oxbow lake.																			0976-2612	2278-599X				JUN	2016	7	2					614	620																WOS:000384745800006
J	Rychert, K				Rychert, Krzysztof			Growth rates of common pelagic ciliates in a highly eutrophic lake measured with a modified dilution method	OCEANOLOGICAL AND HYDROBIOLOGICAL STUDIES												The growth rates of ciliates estimated under natural conditions with the widely used size fractionation method are much lower than those observed in cultures. However, recent studies performed with a modified dilution method demonstrated that the size fractionation method underestimates the ciliate growth, because it does not remove predators ofthe same size as the organisms studied. Thus, it is still unresolved whether ciliates are food -limited in different systems and whether their growth rates are indeed lower than those in cultures. This study was conducted in highly eutrophic Lake Gardno using a modified dilution method. Each time, two dilution experiments were performed (around noon and around midnight). Four small, common ciliates from the genera Rimostrombidium, Tintinnidium, Cyclidium, and Urotricha were studied. The first three ciliates demonstrated very high mean diel growth rates exceeding 0.1 h(-1), which corresponded well to the highest values reported in the literature for the ciliate growth in cultures at similar temperatures. Tintinnidium sp. demonstrated a diel growth rhythm. Urotricha sp. was sensitive to the experimental procedure, and measurements of its growth were unsuccessful. Concentrations of food particles were analyzed to check whether organisms studied were food satiated.

After smoothing and interpolating the backscatter coefficients for both bands, we achieve the 5'x5' grid data and the time series of backscatter coefficients in 12 years. The spatial distribution of sigma0 over typical areas (wetland, desert, mountainous area, agriculture base, etc.) of Chinese territory is analyzed and discussed. The fast Fourier transformation (FFT) is used to detect the cycles of seasonal variations of sigma0 time series and gives that the annual period is the major cycle. Meanwhile a semiannual period is also found in some places. We use the least squares method on both periods and find that the amplitude of annual period is obviously greater than that of semi-annual period. The relationship among the anomalousness of time series, variations of environment and climate change, and the serious natural calamity (flood, drought) is also discussed. Data of topography slope extracted from SRTM are used to do correlation analysis with the backscatter coefficients in parts of China to quantify the impact of slope on backscatter coefficients in Ku and C bands, and the results show that they all have a negative correlation but the magnitudes are different in different places with different coverages. Such as the area of Liaoning and Jilin has the maximum correlation -0.56, the Taklimakan Desert has the minimum correlation -0.11, and the other places commonly have correlations in (-0.3, -0.5).						guo, jinyun/0000-0003-1817-1505													1674-7313	1869-1897				DEC	2012	55	12					2068	2083		10.1007/s11430-012-4524-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11430-012-4524-y													WOS:000312346200014
J	Kadye, WT; Chakona, A				Kadye, Wilbert T.; Chakona, Albert			Spatial and temporal variation of fish assemblage in two intermittent streams in north-western Zimbabwe	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												This study examined the spatial and temporal variation in fish assemblage composition within two intermittent streams in north-western Zimbabwe. Eight sites were sampled during three different periods of flow. Twenty-five species in eight families, dominated by cichlids and cyprinids, were collected. Redundancy analysis (RDA) was used to explore the relationship between species and their environmental correlates. According to variation partition, 68.1% of assemblage variation was explained by both habitat and temporal variables. Most species were associated with large pools, whereas small species were associated with habitats that had gravel and boulders. The temporal aspect suggested a pattern associated with high catch per unit effort (CPUE) for the mormyrids, Clarias gariepinus and Labeo altivelis, during the early rain period. By comparison, the late rain period was associated with high CPUE for Labeo cylindricus, Labeobarbus marequensis, Chiloglanis neumanni and Oreochromis mortimeri, whereas the rest of the species had high CPUE during both the late rain and dry periods. The assemblage composition was more diverse during the late rain period. Refuge availability during the dry period appeared to be essential for the assemblage of the intermittent streams. Protection of these temporal habitats is therefore important in conserving fish assemblages within intermittent streams of the Lake Kariba area.

We analyzed the horizontal distributions of steelhead Oncorhynchus mykiss in Lake Michigan from 1992 to 1997 and related these distributions to mean surface temperature and temperature variation. We used angler catch rate data from Lake Michigan natural resources agencies to index the spatial and temporal distributions of steelhead and obtained surface water temperature data from advanced very-high-resolution radiometer satellite imagery through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's CoastWatch Program. During most months, steelhead catch rates were negatively related to surface temperature and were highest in areas of high temperature variation (i.e., vertical thermal fronts and upwelling zones) where thermal conditions and prey densities may have been optimal for growth. Our results demonstrate how remotely sensed and creel survey data can be integrated to allow for more effective exploitation and management of lakewide fish stocks while enabling researchers to generate and test hypotheses regarding the spatial distributions of fish populations.					; Schwab, David/B-7498-2012	Hook, Tomas/0000-0001-9185-6741; Rutherford, Edward/0000-0002-7282-6667													0275-5947					FEB	2004	24	1					211	221		10.1577/M02-159	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M02-159													WOS:000220169400022
J	Wilhelm, FM; Schindler, DW				Wilhelm, FM; Schindler, DW			Reproductive strategies of Gammarus lacustris (Crustacea: Amphipoda) along an elevation gradient	FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY												1. The number of eggs, their size, mass and development time, and the starvation time of newly hatched young, was examined in four populations of Gammarus lacustris along an elevation gradient from prairie to alpine lakes (730 m to > 2300 m above sea level). Water temperature and ice-free season decreased with increasing altitude. 2. Females in the alpine lake produced fewer but larger and heavier eggs than females in the prairie lake. Eggs produced by females in montane and subalpine lakes were intermediate in size, mass and number. Within populations, egg size was not related to the number of eggs or female size. 3. The development time of eggs declined with an increase in incubation temperature. At all incubation temperatures, large eggs had a longer incubation time than small eggs. All eggs incubated at 4 degrees C failed to produce young. Young from large eggs were larger in size than young from small eggs. 4. The starvation time of newly hatched young increased with decreasing temperature. However, slopes of regressions relating starvation time to temperature differed among populations. At 4 degrees C young from large eggs survived longer than young from small eggs. 5. The high phenotypic plasticity in reproductive traits contributes to the success of G. lacustris in a wide range of aquatic habitats. It is predicted that in response to climate-induced warming, populations in currently cold montane and alpine lakes would shift their reproduction to produce more eggs of smaller size. However, the accurate prediction of the fate of populations between ecoregions will require knowledge of the extent to which these traits are under genetic control.

We evaluated whether environmental (such as lake connectivity, subsystem and seasonality) and biological factors (occurrence and richness of non-native and native fish species) affect beta-diversity components (total, richness and replacement) of fish communities living in the Upper Parana River floodplain in Brazil. For this, a distance-based redundancy analysis was performed for both taxonomic (BDtax) and functional (BDfunc) approaches. In order to see which variables influence the local contribution to BDtax and BDfunc (LCBD), mixed effects regression models were fitted. In our research, environmental factors influenced the replacement component for both taxonomic and functional beta-diversity, while biotic factors (occurrence and richness of non-native species) influenced the richness component. The richness of native and non-native species, the occurrence of non-native species and seasonality showed an influence on LCBD values. Although in our study the occurrence and richness of non-native species are positively related to beta-diversity, some studies have found that, in the long term, these species can cause a decrease in functional and taxonomic beta-diversity, altering the ecological multifunctionality of the environment.

Autochthonous Bacteriophages in the Microbial Loop Structure of Different Biotopes of Lake Baikal	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												This article presents the results of research into autochthonous bacteriophages, a previously unknown element in the structure of the microbial loop in the ecosystem of deep oligotrophic Lake Baikal. Transmission electron microscopy was used to study the morphological diversity of phages in the water column, surface microlayer, and benthic biofilms formed at the interface between water and geological rocks (marble, granite, mica, quartz, amphibolite, gabbro, and urtite). This article presents data on the dimensional structure of autochthonous bacteriophages, as well as their quantity, seasonal dynamics, and vertical distribution from the surface to the maximum depth (1200 m) when compared with the content of bacteria. Several morphotypes of Baikal autochthonous bacteriophages affecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been isolated and characterized by molecular-genetic methods. The complete genomes of giant phage PaBG from the Myoviridae family and phage MD8 from the Siphoviridae family have been determined.

The Uso River and the Hino River, the main contaminated rivers among the inflow rivers, were selected as daily and hourly monitoring sites to provide data on the seasonal trends in the concentration and load of herbicides and to determine the effect of rainfall events on load. The monitoring was also performed four times in 15 inflow rivers. The total input to the lake was calculated from the loads during fine weather conditions and additional loads during rainfall events. The former based on the lumped load from the two rivers and by prorating for the 15 rivers, and the latter was estimated from the relation between precipitation and increased load rate. The annual losses of herbicide from the basin to Lake Biwa were estimated to be 14.5% for bromobutide, 3.0% for pretilachlor, 5.2% for molinate, and 8.8% for simetryn. The loads caused by rainfall events accounted for 9%-18% of the total annual loads.																			1439-8621	1439-863X				AUG	2005	6	2					91	99		10.1007/s10201-005-0145-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-005-0145-x													WOS:000231200000004
J	Musselman, RC; Slauson, WL				Musselman, RC; Slauson, WL			Water chemistry of high elevation Colorado wilderness lakes	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												High elevation alpine and subalpine Rocky Mountain lakes in Colorado and southeastern Wyoming were examined to determine regional variability in water chemistry and their sensitivity to atmospheric deposition. Acid neutralizing capacity, pH, conductivity and concentrations of major anions and cations were compared. Regional differences in water chemistry are evident. The south-eastern most lakes have significantly higher pH, conductivity, ANC, and sums of acid and base concentrations than lakes in the other regions of the state. In contrast the northwestern most lakes are significantly more dilute than those from other regions. Despite these two regional differences, most regions are similar in having a wide range of variability in potential sensitivity of their lakes to acidification and nitrogen export. Many wilderness areas in western and eastern regions contains lakes that are extremely sensitive and other lakes not susceptible to deposition. Overall, 70% of the Colorado lakes are sensitive to acidification and 15% are extremely sensitive to acidification. All of the regions had lakes that are classified as susceptible or sensitive to acidification, with 12 of the 17 areas having all of their sampled lakes susceptible or sensitive. Generally NO31- concentration in surface waters decreased from mid-season to late season; yet a large number of the lakes export NO31- late in the season, suggesting nitrogen saturation. The results confirm the sensitivity of high elevation wilderness aquatic ecosystems in all regions of Colorado to acidification and nitrogen deposition.																			0168-2563	1573-515X				DEC	2004	71	3					387	414		10.1007/s10533-004-0369-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-004-0369-6													WOS:000226667200007

Its typical throughput and seasonal variation characteristics have attracted much attention. Research on the long-term hydrological variation of Poyang Lake needs to be enriched. Using remote sensing images from 1986 to 2020 and combining them with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), this study extracts the water area of Poyang Lake and analyzes its variation characteristics. The results show that the water area of Poyang Lake has a consistent periodic variation with meteorological factors. Both the water area and meteorological factors have a main period of 18 m (months). Water area change points occurred in 2003, 2010, and 2016. In different research periods, there is a significant correlation between the water area and meteorological factor changes. Furthermore, the correlation between water vapor pressure and precipitation with the water area change is the strongest.																			2040-2244	2408-9354				AUG	2023	14	8					2706	2718		10.2166/wcc.2023.044	http://dx.doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2023.044		JUN 2023											WOS:001011389700001

HYDROBIOLOGIA												In boreal lakes, temperature and photoperiod are important environmental cues affecting reproduction, growth and feeding rates of benthic invertebrates; however, how invertebrates cope with seasonal changes in the availability of their food sources has rarely been addressed. In this study, where temperature and light conditions were controlled, we aimed at assessing whether Hyalella azteca amphipods from the littoral zone of boreal lakes adjust their feeding rates in response to the dynamics of their food sources and their population structure. Using a gravimetric approach, we compared the ingestion and absorption rates of amphipods from a natural population collected periodically during the ice-free season. Amphipods were fed in the laboratory with conditioned leaf detritus. Feeding rates increased regardless of seasonal variations of temperature and photoperiod in the lake. Field data suggest this increase could be linked to seasonal changes in the population structure or in the diet of amphipods. This suggests that H. azteca amphipods adjusted their feeding rates with their energy and nutrient requirements and/or developed a compensatory feeding trade-off to cope with the dynamics of their different food sources in lakes.																			0018-8158	1573-5117				JUN	2014	730	1					167	177		10.1007/s10750-014-1834-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-014-1834-4													WOS:000334423200012

Effect of Nutrients on Bioaccumulation of Heavy Metals in a Tropical Urban Coastal Lacustrine System	WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH												The study on bioaccumulation of heavy metals in a lake reveals that during the nonrainy season, accumulation of cadmium in plankton is high in the upstream of the lake where anoxic freshwater condition exists resulting from inflow of urban wastes. Stern action is required to stop the bypass of sewage from the old sewer system especially in the commercial areas of Thiruvananthapuram city, either by augmenting the sewerage system or by treating sewage at the source. During monsoon season, the accumulation of heavy metals-namely lead and nickel, followed by cadmium and chromium-is high in phytoplankton resulting from high nitrate content caused by heavy rainfall. During postmonsoon, lead and nickel accumulation is high. The study emphasizes the need for stormwater management practices for the removal of lead in urban runoff from roads caused by vehicular exhaust, tire wear, and wastes from service stations and workshops.

J	Umaña-Villalobos, G				Umana-Villalobos, Gerardo			Phytoplankton variability in Lake Fraijanes, Costa Rica, in response to local weather variation	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Phytoplankton species show a variety in morphology which is the result of adaptations to pelagic life including responses to fluctuations in water column dynamics driven by weather conditions. This has been reported in the oceans and in Northern temperate lakes. In order to observe whether tropical freshwater phytoplankton responds to seasonal variation in weather, the weekly variation in temperature of the water column and phytoplankton composition was studied in Lake Fraijanes, Costa Rica, a shallow (6.2m) lake at 1 640m above sea level. A chain of data loggers for temperature was placed in the deepest point in the lake to register temperature every hour at four different depths, and phytoplankton samples were retrieved every week for a year. Additional monthly samples for nutrients were taken at two depths. Notwithstanding its shallowness, the lake developed a thermal gradient which kept the water column stratified for several months during dry season. Whole lake overturns occurred during cold spells with intense precipitation. Phytoplankton changed throughout the year mainly through a shift in dominant taxa. From September to February the lake was frequently mixed by rain storms and windy weather. At this time, phytoplankton was dominated by Chlorococcal green algae. From March to June, the lake was stratified and warmer. Phytoplankton became dominated by Cyanobateria, mainly colonial Chroococcales. The rainy season started again in May 2009. During June and July the lake started to mix intermittently during rain events and phytoplankton showed a brief increase in the contribution of Chlorococcales. These changes fitted well to a general model of phytoplanIcton succession based on functional groups identified according to their morphology and adaptations.																			0034-7744	2215-2075				JUN	2014	62	2					483	494		10.15517/rbt.v62i2.11689	http://dx.doi.org/10.15517/rbt.v62i2.11689								25102633					WOS:000339301800006

Reprint of: The ecology of the zooplankton in Mexican inland waters: What we know so far	LIMNOLOGICA												The varied physiography and climate of the Mexican territory have produced a large mosaic of inland aquatic ecosystems. However, zooplankton ecology has been studied mainly from the water bodies of Central (Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt), eastern (the Yucat'an Peninsula), and southern Mexico. In contrast, the zooplankton from the Mesa Central water bodies has been insufficiently investigated. After a long history of zooplankton taxonomic studies, the first contributions to the zooplankton ecology dated to the 1990 s, rapidly increasing afterward. Most ecological information arises from field investigations and experiments under laboratory conditions, lacking mesocosms and whole-lake experiments. In the same way, the studies have been carried out in lentic, natural, and artificial water bodies, primarily eutrophic. Differently, the zooplankton ecology of lotic ecosystems is largely unknown. Here we summarized the progress made in the study of the zooplankton ecology of Mexican inland waters, revealing the most important research topics developed so far.

Cascading nutrient limitation of the cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in a Sahelian lake (North Senegal)	AQUATIC MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Bioassays in natural water-based batch cultures were performed to identify factors that could control the development of the toxic heterocystous cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in Lake Guiers (North Senegal). Without dissolved inorganic nitrogen, C. raciborskii was unable to grow, unless EDTA was supplied. The addition of P, S, Fe, B, Ca, Co, Cu, Mg, Mn, Mo and Zn did not restore its growth. Variations in the percentages of heterocysts found in bioassays, in the concentrations of major and trace elements in Lake Guiers, and in the computed chemical speciation of all dissolved species using MINEQL+ software, led us to deduce that, after N, Fe was the second greatest growth-limiting nutrient. Assuming that the 'Free Ion Model' is valid for the indigenous species of phytoplankton, the concentrations of bioavailable Fe3+ were within the range of 10(-19) to 10(-22) M and were limited by the very low solubility of Fe-hydroxides. At such negligible concentrations, C. raciborskii is unable to take up the Fe necessary to ensure efficient nitrogenase functioning. The addition of EDTA led to the production of (III) Fe-EDTA complexes, which acted as an iron buffer that, in turn, increased the bioavailability of Fe3+ and the growth of C. raciborskii. These bioassays suggest that, in Lake Guiers, the primary limiting factor for cyanobacterial growth is nitrogen. They also demonstrate the lack of a sufficient concentration of complexing agents, which limits the bioavailability of Fe, and then the nitrogenase activity and diazotrophy of C. raciborskii. This cascading limitation could account for the seasonal fluctuations of this cyanobacterial population in Lake Guiers.

J	Wilcox, EJ; Wolfe, BB; Marsh, P				Wilcox, Evan J.; Wolfe, Brent B.; Marsh, Philip			Hydrological, meteorological, and watershed controls on the water balance of thermokarst lakes between Inuvik and Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, Canada	HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES												Thermokarst lake water balances are becoming increasingly vulnerable to change in the Arctic as air temperature increases and precipitation patterns shift. In the tundra uplands east of the Mackenzie Delta in the Northwest Territories, Canada, previous research has found that lakes responded non-uniformly to year-to-year changes in precipitation, suggesting that lake and watershed properties mediate the response of lakes to climate change. To investigate how lake and watershed properties and meteorological conditions influence the water balance of thermokarst lakes in this region, we sampled 25 lakes for isotope analysis five times in 2018, beginning before snowmelt on 1 May and sampling throughout the remainder of the ice-free season. Water isotope data were used to calculate the average isotope composition of lake source water ( ffiI) and the ratio of evaporation to inflow ( E=I). We identified four distinct water balance phases as lakes responded to seasonal shifts in meteorological conditions and hydrological processes. During the freshet phase from 1 May to 15 June, the median E=I ratio of lakes decreased from 0.20 to 0.13 in response to freshet runoff and limited evaporation due to lake ice presence that persisted for the duration of this phase. During the following warm, dry, and ice-free period from 15 June to 26 July, designated the evaporation phase, the median E=I ratio increased to 0.19. During the brief soil wetting phase, E=I ratios did not respond to rainfall between 26 July and 2 August, likely because watershed soils absorbed most of the precipitation which resulted in minimal runoff to lakes. The median E=I ratio decreased to 0.11 after a cool and rainy August, identified as the recharge phase. Throughout the sampling period, ffiI remained relatively stable and most lakes contained a greater amount of rainfall-sourced water than snow- sourced water, even after the freshet phase, due to snowmelt bypass. The range of average E=I ratios that we observed at lakes (0.00-0.43) was relatively narrow and low compared with thermokarst lakes in other regions, likely owing to the large ratio of watershed area to lake area (WA =LA), efficient preferential flow pathways for runoff, and a shorter ice-free season. Lakes with smaller WA =LA tended to have higher E=I ratios ( R-2 = 0.74). An empirical relationship between WA =LA and E=I was derived and used to predict the average E=I ratio of 7340 lakes in the region, which identified that these lakes are not vulnerable to desiccation, given that E=I ratios were < 0.33. If future permafrost thaw and warming cause less runoff to flow into lakes, we expect that lakes with a smallerWA =LA will be more influenced by increasing evaporation, while lakes with a larger WA =LA will be more resistant to lake-level drawdown. However under wetter conditions, lakes with a larger WA =LA will likely experience a greater increases in lake level and could be more susceptible to rapid drainage.

On the basis of the possible sources of metal pollution in the study area, the following elements were analyzed: As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb, V, Zn and Hg. The small number of lichen species, the often stunted appearance of the specimens, and metal analysis revealed widespread atmospheric pollution in the study area. The results indicate extensive anthropic impact. The highest levels of contamination were recorded for Hg, Cd, Pb, and V concentrations. Good agreement was found between bioindication and metal concentrations in lichens. The impact of anthropic activities is particularly due to steelworks and chemical plants, combustion processes related to energy production and vehicle emissions. In addition to air pollution, some natural factors, such as climate, rocky shores or ozone, were assumed to affect lichen occurrence. Comparison with the Lake Orta area in northern Italy showed Livorno Province was more contaminated by trace elements. Similar contamination levels were found in another area of Tuscany, probably due to the geological characteristics of this region. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Water quality parameters comprised of 9 variables i.e., WT, pH, DO, NO2-N, NO3-N, NH4-N, TP, SSM, BOD5 were measured in Gulluk Lagoon and Koycegiz-Dalyan Lagoon. Although there are important activities such as earthen pond fish farms, fish hatcheries, feldsbat and marble quarries, streams carrying domestic wastes, port, secondary residences and agricultural activities in Gulluk Lagoon, there are intense tourism and agricultural activities in Koycegiz-Dalyan Lagoon. The average concentrations of DO, TP, NO2-N results in Gulluk Lagoon and DO, TP and NH4-N results in Koycegiz-Dalyan Lagoon were determined in second class water quality according to surface water quality criteria. While both lagoons were found to be in "Good" quality class as a result of water quality index, Gulluk Lagoon was found to be "medium polluted" and Koycegiz-Dalyan Lagoon was found to be "slightly polluted" quality class as a result of comprehensive pollution index. It was observed that water quality index values of both lagoons decreased in the dry season, while their comprehensive pollution index values increased in the dry season. On the basis of the general averages of water quality index, it was found as Koycegiz-Dalyan Lagoon (85.0) > Gulluk Lagoon (84.05), and on the basis of the general averages of comprehensive pollution index, it was found as Gulluk Lagoon (1.34) > Koycegiz-Dalyan Lagoon (0.79). Relationships between variables were determined by geographical information systems (IDW technique) and statistical analyses (Descriptive statistics, Spearman rho correlation, Kruskal-Wallis test, multiple linear regression and Principal component analysis). As a result of multiple linear regression analysis in measured parameters, it was determined that the most important parameter affecting the water quality index in Gulluk Lagoon was NH4-N, and the most important parameter affecting the comprehensive pollution index was SSM. In Koycegiz-Dalyan Lagoon, it was observed that the water quality index was affected by the WT parameter and the comprehensive pollution index was affected by the SSM parameter. There is no difference in the concentrations of the average water quality parameters measured in both lagoons, and both lagoons are generally in the first and second class surface water quality class. However, Gulluk Lagoon, which contains more different pollutant sources than Koycegiz-Dalyan Lagoon, is shown to be more polluted according to water quality indexes. In addition, it has been determined that SSM is the most important parameter that determines the water quality among the measured water quality parameters of both lagoons.					; Döndü, Mustafa/GQQ-3372-2022; Özdemir, Nedim/AGB-2371-2022; Demirak, Ahmet/JZC-6725-2024; Dondu, Mustafa/GQQ-3372-2022	keskin, feyyaz/0000-0002-2813-994X; Demirak, Ahmet/0000-0002-6815-8037; Dondu, Mustafa/0000-0003-1441-539X													1527-5922	1527-5930				SEP 2	2024	25	5					351	373		10.1080/15275922.2023.2218661	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15275922.2023.2218661		JUN 2023											WOS:001003535900001

These changes will affect the species distribution of migratory birds, thus damaging the ecological balance of affected habitats. We used 9-year field quarterly data of phytoplankton and environmental factors in the Duchang Reserve (2011 to 2016 and 2019 to 2021) as the basis to analyze the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of phytoplankton, and explore the phytoplankton community succession and its driving factors through redundancy analysis. The results show that (1) during our sampling, 7 phyla and 93 genera of phytoplankton were identified; (2) the nutrient content of the water in Duchang Nature Reserve decreased, but the phytoplankton increased; (3) the factors influencing phytoplankton shifted from initially nutrient controlled to hydrological control; and (4) the driving factors of phytoplankton are seasonal. Nutrients are the main driving factor of phytoplankton in the dry season (January), while hydrological factors have a greater impact on phytoplankton in the wet season (July) and dry season (October).

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and toxaphene (TOX) were analyzed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection and negative chemical ionization mass spectrometry in 77 composites of four inshore fish species commonly preyed upon by bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from estuaries near Savannah, Georgia (SAV), Brunswick, Georgia (BRN), and Jacksonville, Florida (JAX), USA. Whereas seasonal and species-specific differences were minimal, differences among mean total PCB concentrations (Sigma PCBs) by estuary (42.0 +/- 48.3, 1.59 +/- 1.24, and 0.281 +/- 0.075 mu g/g lipid for BRN, JAX, and SAV, respectively) were highly significant. This estuary-specific trend also held true for mean total toxaphene concentrations (Sigma TOX): 49 +/- 100 (BRN) 1.2 +/- 0.52 (JAX), and 0.40 +/- 0.19 mu g/g lipid (SAV). Congener profiles of PCBs also were found to be significantly different among estuaries, with BRN and (to a lesser extent) JAX samples enriched with highly chlorinated homologs associated with Aroclor 1268, a legacy OC linked to a historical point source in Brunswick. The observed spatial heterogeneity in OC concentrations and PCB congener profiles suggests that contaminated fish from Brunswick pose the greatest risk to ecological and human health via biomagnification and seafood consumption; highly chlorinated PCBs (and possibly toxaphene) are transported in a southerly. alongshore direction; and the uniqueness of Aroclor 1268 underscores its utility as a signature proxy in future regional ecotoxicological studies.

J	Akitomo, K; Kurogi, M; Kumagai, M				Akitomo, K; Kurogi, M; Kumagai, M			Numerical study of a thermally induced gyre system in Lake Biwa	LIMNOLOGY												A current system consisting of cyclonic (counter-clockwise) and anticyclonic (clockwise) circular gyres is the most remarkable feature observed in the northern basin of Lake Biwa during stratified seasons. The present study numerically investigates its formation mechanism under uniform surface heating. The combined effect of variable bottom topography and vertical diffusion [the topographic heat accumulation (THA) effect] is essential for the formation of a cyclonic circulation in the lake. However, it was found here that nonlinearity of the flow and irregular coastal geometry are additionally needed to form the actual gyre system. When the nonlinearity is weak with large horizontal eddy viscosity, v(h) and diffusivity, kappa(h), only a basin-wide cyclonic (anticyclonic) circulation is formed in the upper (lower) layer around the northern basin by the thermal contrast between the shallow coastal and deep central regions through the THA effect. In contrast, when the nonlinearity becomes strong with realistic smaller values of v(h) and kappa(h), the basin-wide cyclonic circulation splits into two circular gyres for which the gradient-current balance is established. In response to this change, anticyclonic gyres are formed at deep levels in the regions between the two cyclonic gyres and between one cyclonic gyre and the coastal boundary because the same thermal contrast as in the weak nonlinear (or linear) case continues to be maintained between the coastal and central waters. As a result, a realistic gyre system is established although the anticyclonic gyres rarely appear at the surface in the steady state.																			1439-8621					AUG	2004	5	2					103	114		10.1007/s10201-004-0122-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10201-004-0122-9													WOS:000223274100006

Late Upper Palaeolithic fishing in the Fucino Basin, central Italy, a detailed analysis of the remains from Grotta di Pozzo	ENVIRONMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY												Fish remains have been recovered from seven Upper Palaeolithic sites in the Fucino Basin, central Italy. Analyses of fish remains from one of these sites, Grotta di Pozzo, are presented here and discussed in relation to previous research on fish remains from other Fucino Basin sites. It is recognised that in previous studies little consideration has been given to identifying, or confirming accumulation agent(s) for fish remains. Three potential non-human accumulation agents are identified and considered in detail, but these do not explain the element representation patterns for fish remains recovered at Grotta di Pozzo. As such, it is likely that the fish bones from this site do represent the remains of human activity. Given this interpretation, the assemblage characteristics suggest that Grotta di Pozzo represents a site used for exploitation and processing of fish for transportation for later consumption, most likely on a seasonal basis. Further work on the fish from other Fucino Basin sites is needed to reliably rule out non-human deposition and increase understanding of fishing strategies in the Fucino Basin during the late Glacial period.																			1461-4103	1749-6314				OCT	2009	14	2					155	162		10.1179/146141009X12481709928364	http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/146141009X12481709928364													WOS:000272842000004

Effects of Striped Bass Stocking on Largemouth Bass and Spotted Bass in Lewis Smith Lake, Alabama	NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT												Introductions of striped bass Morone saxatilis into U.S. reservoirs have caused concern among anglers that target other species owing to the perception that this predator reduces the number of other sport fish and can limit available prey supplies. Recently. this controversy arose in Lewis Smith Lake (8,583 ha). Alabama. prompting this study to examine the effects of stocking striped bass oil the resident population of black bass Micropterus spp. From October 2006 to August 2007, the diets of striped bass, largemouth bass M. salmoides, and spotted bass M. punctulatus were examined in this reservoir. The density and biomass of striped bass and black bass were computed front estimates of age-0 black bass abundance, striped bass stocking rates. growth. and survival. Bioenergetics models were used to estimate striped bass and black bass consumptive food demands. Striped bass diets (by weight) were dominated by shad Dorosoma spp. (64%), followed by crayfish Oronectes spp. (12%). while black bass and sunfish Lepomis and crappies Pomoxis spp. comprised 5% and 6% of the diet. respectively. Numerically, sunfish-crappies and black bass only comprised 0.28% and 0.16% of the diets of striped bass. The diets of largemouth bass and spotted bass (by weight) were dominated by crayfish (72% and 75%, respectively) and sunfish-crappies (21% and 9%, respectively), while shad comprised 6% and 14% of the diets, respectively. Diet overlap values between striped bass and black bass were generally low hut varied seasonally among, species. The highest overlap between the diets of striped bass and black bass wits observed in April and June. However. the relative weights of black bass did not decline or the frequency of empty stomachs among these species did not increase during or after this time. Overall, consumptive prey, demand was similar between striped bass and black bass. Bioenergetics modeling estimated striped bass consumption of shad, bass-sunfish-crappies, and crayfish averaging 14, 3, and 5 kg/ha, respectively, compared with 3, 6, and 16 kg/ha. respectively. for black bass. Shad consumption by striped bass and black bass (relative to the total annual supply) was within acceptable levels. Striped bass consumption of black bass was low. striped bass and black bass partitioned prey resources, and the temporal differences in maximum consumptive demand varied between black bass and striped bass. Thus, we found that the impact of striped bass stocking on the black bass population was minimal.																			0275-5947	1548-8675				OCT	2009	29	5					1232	1241		10.1577/M08-229.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/M08-229.1													WOS:000272025500005

POPULATION STRUCTURE OF THE WHITEFISH (COREGONUS LAVARETUS PIDSCHIAN, COREGONIDAE) FROM WATER BODIES OF THE BOLSHOI YENISEI RIVER BASIN (TYVA REGION)	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												The data on the morphology and biology of the whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus pidschian, from lakes in the basin of the Bolshoi Yenisei River (Tyva Region) are presented. The whitefish populations are shown to vary in the growth rate, morphometric and meristic characters and occupy different ecological niches. Significant differences were revealed between the populations in the number of gill rakers and that of perforated scales in the lateral line. C. lavaretus pidschian from the lakes investigated are euryphagous; however, in Noyon-Khol Lake and Kadysh Lake they feed mainly on pelagic crustaceans during growing season. Migratory whitefish populations inhabiting Borzu-Khol Lake and Todzha Lake are represented by both lacustrine and river whitefish, being similar in meristic traits and growth rate with C. lavaretus pidschian from the Bolshoi Yenisei River. In spite of the fact that the water bodies are located in the immediate proximity to each other that promotes the hybridization of whitefish, the morphotypes of lacustrine and migratory whitefish are persistent.					; , Evgeny/S-8642-2016; Zuykova, Elena/CAA-4558-2022; Bochkarev, Nickolai/JNS-8566-2023	Bochkarev, Nickolai/0000-0002-5456-0308; , Evgeny/0000-0003-4982-0301; 													0044-5134					JAN	2009	88	1					47	60																WOS:000263594400008

ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE PENINSULA MAIPU'S ISTHMHMUS (LAKE SAN MARTIN, SANTA CRUZ PROVINCE) IN ITS REGIONAL CONTEXT	ARQUEOLOGIA												The archaeological landscape of the Tar and San Martin Andean lake basins shows a high artifactual density related with lagoons and sand dunes of the isthmus of Maipu peninsula, which is located southwest of San Martin Lake forest edge. The lagoons exhibit the expedient use of a local available rock (green silicificated toba), while the sand dunes could be seen as an equipped space, with a higher artifactual diversity and evidences of utilized rocks. Technological information is introduced and compared with the one recovered at the east of the study area (south margin of the San Martin lake and Tar lake), where there is a very low proportion of artifacts manufactured in green silicificated toba. The results show the isthmus as the most western space redundantly utilized on a seasonal basis. It is also suggested that it could articulate logistical activities. These data exhibit the differences in the way and the intensity of the space used by hunter gatherer populations between the steppe and the forest. In this way, new information is added to the discussion of the hypothesis proposed by L. Borrero (2004) on the marginality of western spaces in relation with the eastern ones. Finally, the results are put into perspective with those obtained in other near Andean lake basins (Belgrano and Argentino).																			0327-5159	1853-8126					2009	15						187	205																WOS:000219326400010
J	Behling, H				Behling, H			Late Quaternary vegetation and climate dynamics in southeastern Amazonia inferred from Lagoa da Confusao in Tocantins State, northern Brazil	AMAZONIANA-LIMNOLOGIA ET OECOLOGIA REGIONALIS SYSTEMAE FLUMINIS AMAZONAS												Late Quaternary vegetation and climate dynamics have been reconstructed by pollen analysis of a lacustrine sediment core from Lagoa da Confusdo. The lake lies about 160 km southwest of Palmas, capital of Tocantins State. The study area is located in the cerrado (savanna) and cerrado/Amazon rain forest transition region of southeastern Amazonia. The record, dated by 4 AMS radiocarbon dates, provide insight into vegetation and climate dynamics of late Pleistocene and Holocene age. Pollen data indicate that the study region was dominated by cerrado (savanna), first of the campo limpo type (grassland savanna) between 60,300-51,700 (chronology A) or 29,000-27,400 C-14 yr B.P. (chronology B) and than of the campo sujo type between 51,700 24,670 (chronology A) or 27,400-14,000 C-14 yr B.P. (chronology B). Existing small areas of gallery forests increased slightly during the second period. Amazon forest taxa occurred sparsely in the study region. The palaeovegetation infer a markedly drier climate (low precipitation and long annual dry season) during the glacial periods compared to the modem climate. A sedimentary gap probably occurred during the full glacial and/or Lateglacial period, suggesting drier climatic conditions than during the two earlier periods. During the early and mid Holocene the carnpo cerrado type (savanna woodland) was dominant and the landscape was more forested by the stronger presence of gallery forest and Amazon forest trees. Precipitation was higher, and the length of the annual dry season was shorter than during the late Pleistocene periods. After 5460 C-14 yr B.P. campo cerrado was still dominant, but forest cover increased markedly by the expansion Amazon forest populations and palm trees, reflecting the wettest climate period recorded. The results from Lagoa da Confirsdo support the general trend of dry glacial conditions, as reported from other tropical South American lowland regions. The expansion of the Amazon rain forest since the mid Holocene in northwestern and southwestern Amazonia is now also confirmed for the southeastern Amazon region.																			0065-6755						2002	17	1-2					27	40																WOS:000181251400003
J	Elliott, JM				Elliott, JM			A continuous study of the total drift of freshwater shrimps, Gammarus pulex, in a small stony stream in the English Lake District	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The objective was to determine the major factors affecting the downstream dispersal (drift) of freshwater shrimps, Gammarus pulex. Sample replication and frequency are major problems in the quantification of drift. For the first time, these problems were avoided by sampling the whole stream continuously so that all the shrimps drifting downstream at the sampling point were caught in a net emptied at dusk and dawn in 1966, and every 3 days in 1967. 2. There was no consistent seasonal pattern in drift rates, but a high proportion of annual drift was taken in only a few samples. There was a nocturnal diel pattern of drift with peaks soon after dusk and just before dawn. A power function described the significant (P < 0.001) relationship between drift and flow, and was used to neutralise the dominant effects of flow by standardising total drift over 24 h, nocturnal drift and diurnal drift (drift per 50 m(3)). These were all significantly (P < 0.001) related to benthos density, but not to date, temperature, or length of the night or day. 3. The relationship between drift values and the independent variables, flow and benthos density, was well described (P < 0.001) by a multiple-regression model. Adding temperature, date, and/or the length of the night or day did not improve model fit. Variations in flow and benthos density explained 94% of the variation in total drift over 24 h, 97% of the variation in nocturnal drift, but only 44% of the variation in diurnal drift. A power function described (P < 0.001) the relationship between total drift and the volume of water sampled over 3-day periods in 1967. Flow explained 95% of this drift variation; it was unnecessary to add another variable such as benthos density. 4. The significance of this study is that it avoided the problems associated with the quantification of drift samples. Therefore, the conclusions are more robust than those of many previous studies. A high proportion of the annual drift losses would have been undetected by intermittent sampling. Temperature, season, night or day length clad no significant effect on drift densities, and the relationship between drift and benthos densities was proportional, not density dependent. The nocturnal increase in drift could not be interpreted as an antipredator behaviour. The dominance of flow and benthos density was apparent but the quantitative relationships posed further questions, especially those related to drift distances at different velocities.																			0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2002	47	1					75	86		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00782.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00782.x													WOS:000173397900007
J	Johnson, BM; Martinez, PJ; Stockwell, JD				Johnson, BM; Martinez, PJ; Stockwell, JD			Tracking trophic interactions in coldwater reservoirs using naturally occurring stable isotopes	TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY												We measured signatures of naturally occurring stable isotopes of carbon (C-13) and nitrogen (N-15) in important invertebrate and fish taxa in two coldwater reservoirs in Colorado that had different food webs, One reservoir, Lake Granby, contained a large population of an opossum shrimp, Mysis relicta, and the other, Blue Mesa Reservoir, did not. We compared temporal dynamics of isotopic signatures of all taxa between lakes to quantify sources of variability in consumer signatures and to assess potential turnover rates of isotopic signatures in the top predator. Stable isotope signatures varied little across season or body size within most taxa, but large differences across reservoirs were observed. Nitrogen signatures of lake trout Salvelinus namaycush were enriched in larger individuals in both reservoirs, indicating increasing trophic position with body size. Carbon signatures in lake trout livers were consistently lower than those in muscle samples but did not change more rapidly than muscle signatures, suggesting that either lake trout diet was relatively invariant during the study or that liver signatures change at the same rate as muscle si-natures in these fish. Inferences about diets from carbon and nitrogen signatures were corroborated by information from stomach analysis. Food web structure derived from stable isotope analysis indicated large differences in energy and materials pathways between the reservoirs with and without M. relicta. Rather than diversifying trophic structure by providing an alternative food source for planktivorous sport fish, as the introduction originally intended, M. relicta in Lake Granby short-circuited a major energy conduit, the zooplankton, from channeling pelagic primary production into sport fish biomass.

We investigated the potential competition and feeding impact of the common rotifer species, Keratella cochlearis and K. quadrata, on the abundant prostomatid ciliates, Urotricha furcata and Balanion planctonicum, in laboratory batch culture experiments. All four species have similar feeding preferences, co-occur in many freshwater environments, and are thus potential competitors for the same algal food. 2. Two small Cryptomonas species served as food for the ciliates and the rotifers in the experiments. Growth rates of each ciliate species were measured when they grew alone and when they were paired with one of the rotifer species. 3. Both rotifer species reduced the growth rate of U. furcata, probably primarily by direct feeding on the ciliates. Growth rate of B. planctonicum was unaffected by K. cochlearis, but was drastically reduced by grazing and/or mechanical interference of K. quadrata. 4. These results suggest niche partitioning of the sympatric ciliates with respect to their rotifer competitors/predators.					; Weisse, Thomas/HTQ-1404-2023	Weisse, Thomas/0000-0001-6103-6558; 													0046-5070	1365-2427				JAN	2002	47	1					53	64		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00780.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2002.00780.x													WOS:000173397900005

A population of at least 125 dolphins was recorded in the Karnaphuli and Sangu rivers and connecting canal. The overall encounter rate was 0.76 dolphins per km. Density was highest in the lower reaches of the Sangu, where we recorded 1.36 dolphins per km. These rates are fairly high when compared with other areas of shushuk distribution. Dolphin movements in the Sikalbaha-Chandkhali Canal were consistent with it being used as a corridor for migration and dispersal between the Karnaphuli and Sangu. Shushuks were also sighted in marine waters of the Karnaphuli and Sangu river mouths, adding credibility to the hypothesis that dolphins move along the coast between the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu systems, perhaps during the monsoon when freshwater plumes extend into the Bay of Bengal. No dolphins were observed in Kaptai Lake, a dam-created reservoir of the upper Karnaphuli, despite reports of occasional sightings by local fishermen. No shushuks were observed in the Bagkhali and Matamuhuri rivers, possibly because of seasonal-closure dams present near the mouths of both rivers. The main threats to dolphin survival in the Karnaphuli-Sangu system are probably accidental entanglement in monofilament gillnets, bioaccumulation of persistent contaminants and possibly collisions with motorized vessels and a decline in prey as a result of over fishing. The most significant conservation measure that could be taken would be to establish a protected area for dolphins in the Sangu River below the Dohazari Bridge.					; Braulik, Gill/X-9184-2019	Braulik, Gill/0000-0001-8919-4187; 													0030-6053					JAN	2001	35	1					61	72		10.1046/j.1365-3008.2001.00153.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-3008.2001.00153.x													WOS:000167164800007
J	Han, JJ; Xu, J; Chen, H; Xu, PC; Wang, LL				Han, Jianjun; Xu, Jin; Chen, Han; Xu, Pengcheng; Wang, Lingling			Spatiotemporal Patterns of Ammonia Nitrogen and Chemical Oxygen Demand in the Huaihe River-Hongze Lake System (Eastern China)	WATER												Understanding variations in contaminant concentrations and exploring their driving factors are essential for pollution control and water environment improvement. The Huaihe River Basin, as an important region in the eastern region of China, has attracted much attention to its water environment issues in recent years. Therefore, an in-depth analysis of spatiotemporal patterns of water quality parameters was carried out on the Huaihe River-Hongze Lake system, for the period 1998-2018, using the Mann-Kendall test (MKT) and wavelet transforms (WTs). Significant decrease trends of ammonia nitrogen (AN) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations were detected in the Huaihe River (HR) before 2008 using the MKT. High concentration in the contaminant load was a result of the effect of increased construction and decreased forest on increasing input of pollutants during this period. The results of the WT showed how factors (e.g., streamflow and water temperature), except land use, affect the variations in AN and COD concentrations. The comparison of spatiotemporal patterns of AN and COD between the HR and Hongze Lake (HL) showed their differences in contaminant transport regimes. The contaminants were rapidly transported downstream along the HR with high streamflow during the wet season, while these in the HL were less responsive due to the long residence time of the water body. In addition, rebounds of contaminant concentrations occurred many times at the confluence between the HR and the HL due to strong river-lake interactions, especially in the flood season. These results have implications for future water environment management in the Huaihe River Basin and in similar settings worldwide.																				2073-4441				JUN	2023	15	12							2157	10.3390/w15122157	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w15122157													WOS:001015581700001

Effects of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Control Using Imidacloprid on Leaf-Level Physiology of Eastern Hemlock	FORESTS												Widespread mortality of eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis [L.] Carr.) has been occurring due to the introduction of hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae Annand) (HWA), threatening millions of hectares of hemlock-dominated forests in the eastern United States. HWA feeds at the base of needles and removes stored carbohydrates, which can impact leaf-level physiology, contributing to the decline of the tree. However, these physiological mechanisms in HWA-infested hemlocks are still not clearly understood. We investigated hemlock leaf physiology year-round at three forested sites with various degrees of infestation. At each site, half the trees were treated with imidacloprid (Merit(& REG;) 2 F, Bayer, Kansas City, MO, USA) while the rest were left untreated. Imidacloprid is widely used to control HWA but can itself have phytotoxic effects. After one growing season, there was an increase in photosynthetic rates (7.5%, p = 0.0163) and stomatal conductance (7.1%, p = 0.0163) across sites in the trees treated with imidacloprid. After two years, the imidacloprid treatment also increased bud break from 22.5% to 88.7% at Fishburn (the most severely impacted site) and from 22.7% to 58.9% at Mountain Lake (the least impacted site), and slightly increased chlorophyll fluorescence for treated trees at Fishburn. Chemical treatment also slightly increased water use efficiency at Mountain Lake. These results suggest that HWA is causing tree mortality largely through a reduction in leaf area caused by decreasing bud break and also by a slight, but significant, reduction in leaf-level photosynthesis and stomatal conductance.

Human-Made 1,000 Hectare Archipelago "Marker Wadden" has Positive Impact on Regional and Flyway Populations ofWaterbirds of Dynamic Freshwater Ecosystems	WATERBIRDS												Marker Wadden is a 1000 ha artificial archipelago developed, since 2017, as a novel ecosystem to restore dynamics in a large Dutch freshwater lake with limited natural dynamics. The newly created habitats should, at flyway level, strengthen populations of threatened bird species that depend on dynamic wetlands. The archipelago includes basins with sandbars and mudflats subject to wind tides. Situated at 3 km distance from the mainland, ground predators are lacking. During the first five years of colonization (2017-2021) six pioneer breeding birds represented significant portions (>5%) of national populations. Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) and shorebirds of pioneer habitats were instantly numerous. Ducks and Black-headed Gulls (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) colonized from year two onwards and in year five gulls became the most numerous breeding birds. Staging birds such as ducks (including 13,000 Eurasian Teal [Anas crecca]), shorebirds, and spoonbills (Platalea leucorodia) appeared in internationally important numbers. We conclude that the archipelago indeed has become an important site for breeding and staging birds and at flyway level, especially in the growing season. Therefore, artificial semi-dynamic habitats with mudflats and developed at a sufficiently isolated and large scale, may mitigate losses of natural pioneer habitat in freshwaters.

Life-history traits in two invasive species of tilapias in Morocco	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												Life-history traits (LHT) of Oreochromis niloticus in the Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah reservoir (BA reservoir) and Oreochromis aureus in the Nador Channel were studied and compared with those of other populations in the world. Specimens were collected between June 2018 and June 2020. Females of both species were smaller at first sexual maturity than males (O. niloticus: 204 vs. 255 mm, O. aureus: 147 vs. 158 mm). The age of maturity for each species was estimated from seasonal otolith growth marks, based on the von Bertalanffy growth function. The asymptotic length was higher in O. niloticus (males 296 mm and females 339 mm) than in O. aureus (males 171 mm and females 169 mm). Based on a literature survey and the results of this study, the type of ecosystem (reservoir vs. river) influenced growth performance indices (phi and phi ') in both species, with reservoirs leading to a higher asymptotic length in both O. niloticus and O. aureus than rivers. Moroccan populations presented the lowest growth index in the populations assessed. These observations suggest that while both invasive species were able to colonise and adapt to their new environments, this was at the expense of limiting their growth and reducing their size at first sexual maturity.

J	Suffling, R; Scott, D				Suffling, R; Scott, D			Assessment of climate change effects on Canada's National Park system	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												To estimate the magnitude of climate change anticipated for Canada's 38 National Parks (NPs) and Park Reserves, seasonal temperature and precipitation scenarios were constructed for 2050 and 2090 using the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) coupled model (CGCM1). For each park, we assessed impacts on physical systems, species, ecosystems and people. Important, widespread changes relate to marine and freshwater hydrology, glacial balance, waning permafrost, increased natural disturbance, shorter ice season, northern and upward altitudinal species and biome shifts, and changed visitation patterns. Other changes are regional (e.g., combined East coast subsidence and sea level rise increase coastal erosion and deposition, whereas, on the Pacific coast, tectonic uplift negates sea level rise). Further predictions concern individual parks (e.g., Unique fens of Bruce Peninsular NP will migrate lakewards with lowered water levels, but structural regulation of Lake Huron for navigation and power generation would destroy the fens). Knowledge gaps are the most important findings. For example: we could not form conclusions about glacial mass balance, or its effects on rivers and fjords. Likewise, for the East Coast Labrador Current we could neither estimate temperature and salinity effects of extra iceberg formation, nor the further effects on marine food chains, and breeding park seabirds. We recommend 1) Research on specific large knowledge gaps; 2) Climate change information exchange with protected area agencies in other northern countries; and 3) incorporating climate uncertainty into park plans and management. We discuss options for a new park management philosophy in the face of massive change and uncertainty.

Carefully sourced, carefully managed: multi-isotopic analysis from Bronze and Iron Age equid teeth from Can Roqueta (Barcelona, Spain)	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS												Equids played an important role in the development of communication in past societies, and were part of the exchanges between populations. The multi-isotopic study (strontium, carbon and oxygen isotopes) conducted on equid teeth from Bronze and Early Iron Age Can Roqueta suggests that animals originate from diverse locations and their diet was carefully managed. The enriched oxygen and carbon isotopic ratios in equid teeth compared with other taxa from the same site suggest that equids may have drunk from water troughs, thus creating a 13C and 18O isotopic enrichment and partial covariance, similar to a "lake" effect. This is the most comprehensive study on equid mobility in Iberia so far.

J	Olden, JD				Olden, JD			An artificial neural network approach for studying phytoplankton succession	HYDROBIOLOGIA												Artificial neural networks are used to model phytoplankton succession and gain insight into the relative strengths of bottom-up and top-down forces shaping seasonal patterns in phytoplankton biomass and community composition. Model comparisons indicate that patterns in chlorophyll a concentrations response instantaneously to patterns in nutrient concentrations (phosphorous (P), nitrite and nitrate (NO2/NO3-N) and ammonium (NH4-H) concentrations) and zooplankton biomass (daphnid cladocera and copepoda biomass); whereas lagged responses in an index of algal community composition are evident. A randomization approach to neural networks is employed to reveal individual and interacting contributions of nutrient concentrations and zooplankton biomass to predictions of phytoplankton biomass and community composition. The results show that patterns in chlorophyll a concentrations are directly associated with P, NO2/NO3-N and daphnid cladocera biomass, as well as related to interactions between daphnid cladocera biomass, and NO2/NO3-N and P. Similarly, patterns in phytoplankton community composition are associated with NO2/NO3-N and daphnid cladocera biomass; however show contrasting patterns in nutrient- zooplankton and zooplankton-zooplankton interactions. Together, the results provide correlative evidence for the importance of nutrient limitation, zooplankton grazing and nutrient regeneration in shaping phytoplankton community dynamics. This study shows that artificial neural networks can provide a powerful tool for studying phytoplankton succession by aiding in the quantification and interpretation of the individual and interacting contributions of nutrient limitation and zooplankton herbivory on phytoplankton biomass and community composition under natural conditions.

J	Masumoto, T; Hai, PT; Shimizu, K				Masumoto, Takao; Hai, Pham Thanh; Shimizu, Katsuyuki			Impact of paddy irrigation levels on floods and water use in the Mekong River basin	HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES												During the Asian monsoon, water use is considered to be well integrated because of the sustainable use of the agricultural water supply. From the viewpoint of watershed management, paddy areas help regulate floods by serving as retarding basins (ponds), but they also ensure a rational supply of water resource, by taking advantage of natural hydrologic conditions. Paddies commonly serve both agricultural and flood-control functions in low-lying areas in Japan, Cambodia, Vietnam, and other Asian countries. We discuss herein the impact of irrigation levels oil flood, and water use by analyzing typical examples of paddies harmoniously used for agriculture and flood regulation in and around Tonle Sap Lake and its environs in the Mekong River Basin (drainage area, 790000 kin 2; river length, 4400 km). Flood storage by the Tonle Sap involves a unique reverse flow from the river into the lake during the flood season. Rice cultivation starts after the floodwater recedes, so floods and agriculture are closely interrelated. A second example involves reservoirs created by dikes in paddy areas that protect the urban areas of Phnom Penh from floods and supply irrigation water. A third example involves the use of colmatage, ill which a levee is created and water is led behind the levee from the Mekong and Bassac Rivers as the water levels in the rivers rise. Part of the water stored in this manner during the flood season can be used for rice production during the dry season. We then estimate the volume of flooded water on paddies in order to evaluate the impact of non-irrigated paddies oil floods and water use. We also evaluate the potential to harmonize the role of paddies in managing floodwaters with their agricultural role and propose policies, for Japan and the rest of the world, that could help resolve flooding problems.

J	EllisEvans, JC				EllisEvans, JC			Microbial diversity and function in Antarctic freshwater ecosystems	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Freshwater lakes occur through much of Antarctica and are characterized by short food chains dominated by microbes. Comparatively few studies have been made of continental freshwater lakes until recently, with the main emphasis being on the less extreme maritime Antarctic lakes. The wide range of trophic status seen at the northern extremes of the maritime Antarctic reduces markedly further south, but a wide range of micro-organisms occur throughout the latitudinal range. Information on seasonal and spatial patterns of microbial activity for freshwater lakes demonstrate rapid changes in community composition at certain times of year despite constant low temperatures. Benthic communities of cyanobacteria and bacteria are a feature of most lakes and are involved in a wide range of geochemical cycling. There is a need for more detailed taxonomic information on most groups and considerable potential for molecular studies.																			0960-3115	1572-9710				NOV	1996	5	11					1395	1431		10.1007/BF00051985	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00051985													WOS:A1996VW23000007

The procedures were originally designed for application in Canada with AVHRR data aboard the NOAA 14 satellite. They were tested here with both NOAA 11 and NOAA 14 covering the period 1989-2000. It was found that the active fire detection algorithm performs well with low commission and omission error rates over forested regions in the absence of cloud cover. Moderate errors were found over semi-arid areas covered by thin clouds, as well as along rivers and around lakes observed from sun-glint angles. A modification to a fire algorithm threshold and the addition of a new test can significantly improve the detection accuracy. Burned areas mapped by satellite were compared against extensive fire polygon data acquired by U. S. forest agencies in five western states. The satellite-based mapping matches nearly 90% of total forested burned area, with the difference being mainly attributable to omission of some nonburned islands and patches within the fire polygons. In addition, it maps a significant area of burning outside the fire polygons that appear to be true fires. The 10% omission error was found to be caused mainly by three factors: lack or insufficient number of active fires, partial burning, and vegetation recovery after early season burning. In addition to total area, the location and shapes of burned scars are consistent with the ground-based maps. Overall, the two algorithms are competent for detecting and mapping forest fires in North America north of Mexico with minor modifications.

The westerlies migrate seasonally and are thought to have shifted during past climate events, such as the last glacial termination. However, the timing, magnitude, direction, and mechanisms behind such shifts remain a topic of ongoing study. Here, we contribute to the understanding of past temporal and spatial changes in the SHW by mapping their fluctuations in the South Atlantic region from the last glacial maximum (LGM) to present. We use lake sediment proxies, including plant wax isotopes extracted from two tarns on Mt. Usborne, East Falkland (51.7 & DEG;S) to infer changes in paleoclimate and in the mean annual position of the SHW over the last -23,000 years. Together, the proxies indicate that the position of the SHW during the LGM lay north of the Falkland Islands. We interpret our plant wax isotopic record as showing a southward migration of the mean annual position of the wind belt beginning just before -21 ka, accompanied by warming at Mt. Usborne at -16.5 ka. The late-glacial climate was variable at the field site, and the mean annual position of the SHW may have fluctuated around the latitude of the Falkland Islands. The early Holocene was characterized by relatively warm, dry conditions with high evaporation rates, and the SHW may have lain south of the islands. A brief southern excursion at 7-6 ka was followed by gradual northward migration of the SHW for the remainder of the Holocene to the pre-industrial position. This northward migration was paired with increasingly wet, cool conditions in the Falkland Islands, and the islands appear to be experiencing some of the wettest conditions of the last 23,000 years during the late Holocene.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Weydahl, DJ				Weydahl, DJ			Analysis of ERS tandem SAR coherence from glaciers, valleys, and Fjord Ice on Svalbard	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING												Interferometric satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data was acquired from an area on Spitsbergen, Svalbard, during the European remote sensing satellite (ERS) Tandem mission in 1995-1996. Analyzing these data sets shows that the estimated SAR coherence is highly dependent on the satellite baseline length, and that corrections for this decorrelation effect is necessary if the baseline is a few hundred meters or more. Meteorological recordings are compared to SAR coherence estimates made at different seasons and surface categories: glaciers in motion, glacial forefields dominated by ice-cored moraines, lakes, rivers, and flat valleys with fine moraine materials like gravel and sand. It was found that temporal decorrelation effects are mainly due to changing surface conditions caused by precipitation and temperature variations around freezing, but that wind redistribution of snow also may play a role. Structures and cracks in the fjord ice as well as boundaries of lakes, rivers, and coastlines can be detected in SAR coherence images because of the contrast between high and low coherence areas. Low coherence is observed from those parts of moving glaciers that experience deformations shear, or zones of relative high velocity. The usefulness of 35-days interferometric SAR (e.g., the foreseen ENVISAT configuration) will be limited, even in sparsely vegetated areas like Svalbard, as compared to the ERS Tandem configuration.																			0196-2892					SEP	2001	39	9					2029	2039		10.1109/36.951093	http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/36.951093													WOS:000171080600021

Feeding habits and feeding relationships of species in the fish assemblage were analysed over a one year cycle. Differences in diet composition were found both between species and within species among seasons. Food overlap and trophic similarity among species also showed seasonal variations. Cluster analysis differentiated four groups of predominant diet: (1) macroinvertebrates (trout and largemouth bass), (2) detritus (nase). (3) cladoceran crustaceans and (4) an omnivorous feeding regime. with large seasonal variations in food habits. Food of fish species included in groups 3 and 4 (roach. white bream. barbel. common and mirror carp) varied seasonally. Using graphical models of feeding strategies. similarity indexes. cluster and multivariate analyses based on the relative importance of food categories in the diet of the species, we illustrate that the fish assemblage showed food resource partitioning according to food habits and foraging habitats within the reservoir.

The Danjiangkou Reservoir is the main water source for the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (MR-SNWDP), located in the vicinity of Henan and Hubei provinces in China. Aquatic microorganisms are key indicators of biologically assessing and monitoring the water quality of the reservoir as they are sensitive to environmental and water quality changes. This study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal variations in bacterioplankton communities during wet (April) and dry (October) seasons at eight monitoring points in Hanku reservoir and five monitoring points in Danku reservoir. Each time point had three replicates, labeled as wet season Hanku (WH), wet season Danku (WD), dry season Hanku (DH), and dry season Danku (DD) of Danjiangkou Reservoir in 2021. High-throughput sequencing (Illumina PE250) of the 16S rRNA gene was performed, and alpha (ACE and Shannon) and beta (PCoA and NDMS) diversity indices were analyzed. The results showed that the dry season (DH and DD) had more diverse bacterioplankton communities compared to the wet season (WH and WD). Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes were the most abundant phyla, and Acinetobacter, Exiguobacterium, and Planomicrobium were abundant in the wet season, while polynucleobacter was abundant in the dry season. The functional prediction of metabolic pathways revealed six major functions including carbohydrate metabolism, membrane transport, amino acid metabolism, signal transduction, and energy metabolism. Redundancy analysis showed that environmental parameters greatly affected bacterioplankton diversity during the dry season compared to the wet season. The findings suggest that seasonality has a significant impact on bacterioplankton communities, and the dry season has more diverse communities influenced by environmental parameters. Further, the relatively high abundance of certain bacteria such as Acinetobacter deteriorated the water quality during the wet season compared to the dry season. Our findings have significant implications for water resource management in China, and other countries facing similar challenges. However, further investigations are required to elucidate the role of environmental parameters in influencing bacterioplankton diversity in order to devise potential strategies for improving water quality management in the reservoir.

After some details regarding natural processes of existence and evolution of the mentioned lake, we have presented a few methods and techniques used in data collection and analysis. The extended period of time (nearly 10 years) of the current research, combined with the ones achieved before, have made it possible to interpret the heliotherm phenomenon in many ways: on short-term (daily), seasonal and multiannual one, for mid and long-term. We can observe a clear dependence of the intensity of the phenomenon not only on solar radiation but also on salt distribution, season and anthropic influence. Also, in contrast to the beginning of the 20th century, an unquestionable decrement of the phenomenon over time can be seen. Using GIS model in the case of Lake Ursu has made it possible for the identification of the heliotherm horizon not only in longitudinal but also on three-dimensional profile. The conclusions reveal the necessity of taking some measures to protect lacustrine environments and the perpetuation of the heliotherm phenomenon by using better ways of extracting resources and doing seasonal surveys.					; Alexe, Mircea/AAY-9712-2020; SERBAN, Gheorghe/AAB-3555-2019; ŞERBAN, Gheorghe/AAB-3555-2019	ALEXE, MIRCEA/0000-0002-6426-1299; SERBAN, Gheorghe/0000-0002-0595-9152; 													1842-4090	1844-489X				MAY	2014	9	2					103	111																WOS:000334903200010

The fish significantly depressed the abundances of copepod nauplii and rotifers, especially Hexarthra mira. The vulnerabilities of these prey might be determined by their swimming behavior and population density, suggesting that larval fish selectively prey on zooplankton that have a high encounter rate with the predator. The larvae did not have a negative effect on the densities of cladocerans, but fish predation altered the cladoceran community structure from the dominance of B. longirostris to that of B. fatalis. This result suggests that larval fish predation is an important factor that shifts the species composition of Bosmina in some lakes, the shift occurring in the season when fish larvae are abundant. Our results have shown that predation by the larval fish would control not only the abundance, but also the community structure of the small-sized zooplankton prey.

J	Hartman, KJ; Margraf, FJ				Hartman, KJ; Margraf, FJ			Relationships among condition indices, feeding and growth of walleye in Lake Erie	FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY												Condition indices are often used as surrogates of fish health, growth, and feeding and to compare, growth and food ecological well-being among fish populations. In an effort to identify easily measured indices. consumption were compared with gonadal-somatic index, liver-somatic index (LSI), fat-somatic index and relative weight (W-r) for ages 1-3 walleye, Sander vitreus (Mitchill), in Lake Erie from 1986 to 1988. The LSI and W-r were significantly correlated with growth rate or food consumption, but correlations were too small to be considered biologically meaningful. Furthermore, no consistent relationships between condition indices and growth or consumption were found among combinations of fish age and season. None of the indices are considered reliable surrogates for more laborious estimates of growth and food consumption for Lake Erie walleye. Significant relationships between W-r and relative abundance of key prey species warrant further investigation.																			0969-997X	1365-2400				APR	2006	13	2					121	130		10.1111/j.1365-2400.2006.00486.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2400.2006.00486.x													WOS:000236705800006

In a healthy reed stand close to the shoreline, the proportion of CH4 released to the atmosphere varied between 4% and 5% of NPP of P. australis. In a continuously flooded sparse reed stand in the middle infralittoral zone, this proportion was higher; plant-mediated emission was 18-24% of the NPP by P australis, and the proportion of total emission (including ebullition) related to the NPP of all vegetation (including algae and Lemna trisulca) was 15-20%. In a batch experiment in the laboratory, detritus from L. trisulca and littoral algae maintained significantly higher CH4 production than detritus from R australis. The results support the hypothesis that the high spatial and temporal variability in CH4 emissions in the littoral zone of the study lake was influenced by the quality and distribution of detritus in the anaerobic sediment.																			0003-9136					APR	2003	157	1					47	66		10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0157-0047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/0003-9136/2003/0157-0047													WOS:000183318300003

Reproduction of captive American kestrels (Falco sparverius) was suppressed when adult birds were exposed to dietary polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In this study, the reproductive effects of in ovo exposure to PCBs is explored, along with determining effects on reproduction in second-generation birds indirectly exposed to PCBs. Reproductive changes in this subsequent generation are examined separately in male and female birds. Captive American kestrels (F. sparverius) were hatched from clutches with eggs containing environmentally relevant levels of total PCBs (34.0 mug/g whole egg WW versus 0 mug/g controls); parent birds had been fed PCB-spiked (Aroclor 1248:1254:1260) food (7 mg/kg BW day(-1)) for 100 days until their eggs hatched. In 1999, the second-generation PCB birds were paired with unexposed kestrels having reproductive experience. In ovo PCB exposure suppressed egg laying completely in 25% of PCB females and resulted in delays in clutch initiation and smaller clutch sizes for PCB male and female pairs. There was no evidence in this study of in ovo PCB treatment effects on fertility or hatching success. The decline in reproductive success was also reflected in the reduced hedging success and higher incidence of complete brood mortality of PCB nestlings. Differences between in ovo-exposed PCB males and females but not between controls were evident in reproductive success. in ovo PCB exposure appears to have had greater effects on female kestrels until clutch completion, with a greater time lag between pairing and egg laying, reduced numbers of pairs laying eggs, and smaller clutches being laid. In ovo PCB exposure has greater effects later in the breeding season on male kestrels, which had poorer hatching and hedging success relative to the PCB females. Possible behavioral and physiological mechanisms involved in these reproductive changes are discussed.

J	VUORI, KM				VUORI, KM			DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF IRON ON RIVER ECOSYSTEMS	ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI												The direct and indirect effects of iron on the structure and function of lotic ecosystems are reviewed. In addition to the mining of Fe enriched ores, intensified forestry, peat production and agricultural draining have increased the load of iron in many river ecosystems. The effects of iron on aquatic animals and their habitats are mainly indirect, although the direct toxic effects of Fe2+ are also important in some lotic habitats receiving Fe-enriched effluents in cold seasons, in particular. Ferric hydroxide and Fe-humus precipitates, on both biological and other surfaces, indirectly effect lotic organisms by disturbing the normal metabolism and osmoregulation, and by changing the structure and quality of benthic habitats and food resources. The combined direct and indirect effects of iron contamination decrease the species diversity and abundance of periphyton, benthic invertebrates and fishes. Sorption and co-precipitation of metals by Fe-oxides decrease the bioavailability and toxicity of water-borne metals, but may increase the dietary supply of metals and lead to toxic effects along the food chain. At the cellular level, Fe functions both as a detoxification mechanism, as well as a cell degeneration agent by inducing the formation of hydroxyl free radicals. More research is needed on the factors that affect the environmental fate and ecotoxicological impacts of iron on river ecosystems. As the flux of iron is heavily affected by seasonally varying physical, chemical and biological processes, its impact on ecosystems should be studied on multiple spatial, and temporal scales and at different levels of biological organisation.																			0003-455X						1995	32	3					317	329																WOS:A1995TG64300009

In GMCR, decision-makers (DMs) and their preferences are determined. The DMs are defined as people, parties, or groups having the authority to make decisions and the power to get these decisions approved. This definition excludes some potential stakeholders with no ability to make and exert decisions, like the natural environment. Therefore, this study aims to find an impartial viewpoint representing the natural environment's interests. A new GMCR-based on genetic algorithm (GA) optimization is proposed to modify and optimize the final resolution of the GMCR regarding natural environment benefits. Having applied to a real-world case study, this methodology showed competence in satisfying the fundamental interests of the natural environment to an acceptable extent. This case study is about an endangered seasonal lake, where there is contention between the governmental and agricultural sectors. The results revealed that the disagreement between two conflicting groups could be resolved by modifying the current agreement to consider both groups' demands. Finally, GA, incorporated in GMCR, proved to be a robust optimization technique in complex environmental conflicts.

Further, traditional methods of survival estimation lack the ability to statistically characterize between the extremes of random and catastrophic mortality events. We estimated Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) duckling survival rates for 121 broods at nine study sites across the Great Lakes region from 2001-2003, using a novel statistical method that allows for the partitioning of random and correlated mortality processes. Results indicated that survival increased rapidly with age, did not change with hatching dates, did not differ among years, but varied across site-by-year replicates. Rates of random mortality were found to vary among site-years, while rates of correlated mortality varied little across site-years. In contrast to most studies of Mallard duckling survival, seasonal increases in duckling survival were not detected. We speculate that the observed patterns in survival rates with hatching date are related to productivity in Great Lakes brood-rearing wetlands and temperate regional climate.																			0010-5422					NOV	2005	107	4					898	909		10.1650/7739.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1650/7739.1													WOS:000233390700015

Migration of colonies is represented in the model through the dynamics of carbon-reserve metabolism during photosynthesis and biosynthesis. It was used to quantify combined impacts of light, temperature and mixing on the growth and migration of colonies with different diameters. These 3 factors characterise a vertically non-homogeneous water column. Although conditions of simulation are schematic, they allow identification of situations in which the ability to regulate buoyancy gives Microcystis an advantage over non-mobile phytoplankton. Even if some vertical structures appear unfavourable for the exploitation of light energy, they nevertheless offer some advantages for the access to nutrients. Each diameter has particular benefits, and the increase in diameter observed throughout the year is probably an ecological adaptation to fluctuations in the environment at a seasonal scale.																			0948-3055					JUN 20	2005	39	3					281	292		10.3354/ame039281	http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/ame039281													WOS:000230467100007

In canals feeding Water Conservation Area (WCA) 2A, unfiltered total Hg (HgTu) is less than 3 ng L-1 and relatively constant. In contrast, methyl mercury (MeHg) exhibited a strong seasonal pattern, with highest levels entering WCA-2A marshes during July. Stagnation and reduced flows also lead to particle enrichment of MeHg. In the marshes of WCA-2A, 2B and 3A, HgTu is usually <5 ng L-1 with no consistent north-south patterns. However, for individual dates, aqueous unfiltered MeHg (MeHgu) levels increase from north to south with generally lowest levels in the eutrophied regions of northern WCA-2A. A strong relationship between filtered Hg species and dissolved organic carbon (DOG), evident for rivers draining wetlands in Wisconsin, was not apparent in the Everglades, suggesting either differences in the binding sites of DOC between the two regions, or non-organic Hg complexation in the Everglades.

Blendon traps set for 531 trap days and 143 h of butterfly netting at 35 sites yielded 186 species from five families over a 4-month period during the wet season. Eight of these species constituted possible range extensions. Butterfly abundance and species richness were low in cultivated habitats but high in open riverine habitats; many butterfly species were found only in seasonally flooded grassland. This study constitutes the first butterfly species inventory from this poorly-known national park, shows that protection of dry season water sources provides an important conservation service for invertebrates as well as large mammals, and that increased cultivation outside miombo parks can reduce local butterfly diversity.

While this seems especially true for the rock-dwelling Mbuna species from Lake Malawi, the present study shows that geographic or habitat barriers are not sufficient to explain population substructuring in the less substrate-bound Utaka (non-Mbuna) species. We found similar levels of subtle population structure in the rock-dwelling Copadichromis quadrimaculatus and in the sand-dwelling C. sp. 'virginalis kajose' (F-ST < 0.01 in both species) without a discernable geographical pattern. We suggest that aspects of the reproductive strategy, by which seasonal aggregation alternates with more free-ranging stages, may facilitate the establishment of small population differences in Utaka. This hypothesis agrees with our finding that in these cichlids dispersal appears to be male biased.

EFFECTS OF WATER LEVEL FLUCTUATIONS ON Vallisneria nana IN THE BURNETT RIVER IN SOUTHEAST QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA	RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS												Changes in aquatic macrophyte populations in the Burnett River in southeast Queensland, Australia are described with respect to the effects of water level fluctuations and possible impact on the Queensland lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri). This protected fish relies on macrophyte beds as spawning and nursery areas. Studies were conducted prior to, during and following construction of a new weir on the river. Comparative results of impounded and non-impounded sites were conducted to investigate seasonal and inter-annual changes in macrophytes and the effects of both a rapid rise in water level when the impoundment first filled and a decline, on new plants in shallow water. Macrophyte communities in newly inundated areas were studied to determine the time taken for seedlings to emerge and reach a cover sufficient to represent spawning habitats for the lungfish. Vallisneria nana dominated the macrophyte beds, which were scoured from the river by a large flow event in May 1998, the effects of which persisted for at least 1 year. Most newly emerging seedlings of Vallisneria perished following a small decline of 7 cm in water level. Decrease in plant biomass and death of established plants in highly turbid water resulted within 6-9 weeks following larger water level rises of 4.0-5.5 m in the new impoundment. In the period leading up to the lungfish-spawning season at least 5 months is required for submerged plants to reach the 90% cover referred for spawning. Implications of the results for water level management and lungfish populations are discussed. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

According to the gamma model, optimum modal lengths for 1.25, 1.6, 2.0, 2.5, 3.1, 3.9, 4.4 and 4.8 cm mesh sizes were estimated as 6.61, 8.46, 10.58, 13.22, 16.39, 20.62, 23.27 and 25.38 cm respectively. When considering the minimum landing size, the findings of the study showed that use of gillnets which have less than 3.9 cm mesh size should be prohibited for the fishing of A. tarichi in Lake Van.					; Cilbiz, Mehmet/ABI-4446-2020	Cilbiz, Mehmet/0000-0002-7686-7570; demirol, ferhat/0000-0002-2777-7835; 													1303-2712	2149-181X				MAY	2023	23	5							TRJFAS21936	10.4194/TRJFAS21936	http://dx.doi.org/10.4194/TRJFAS21936													WOS:001087772700001

PALEOSOL-DERIVED PALEOCLIMATE AND PALEOENVIRONMENT RECONSTRUCTION OF THE RUKWA RIFT BASIN, TANZANIA: IMPLICATIONS FOR FAUNAL DISPERSAL IN THE MIOCENE-PLIOCENE	JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH												The East African Rift System records a key interval in the evolution of modern African ecosystems, documenting significant floral changes and faunal dispersals in the context of environmental shifts. To date, Miocene -to-Pliocene data from eastern Africa have been derived primarily from richly fossiliferous rift basins along the far north of the Eastern Branch of the rift, with more limited windows emerging from the Malawi Rift and more recently, coastal Mozambique. Here, we present the first quantitative paleoclimate data for the Miocene-Pliocene transition from the Western Branch of the East African Rift System, based on analyses of paleosols from the Rukwa Rift Basin. Paleosols derived from the fossiliferous late Miocene-early Pliocene lower Lake Beds succession in southwestern Tanzania preserve a shallow lacustrine setting grading into a system of alluvial fans and braided rivers with abundant floodplain deposits. Paleoclimate reconstructions using bulk geochemistry and clay mineralogy reveal a highly seasonal, semiarid, mesic climate during the late Miocene, with increased moisture availability in the early Pliocene resulting in a shift to subhumid conditions. Stable-carbon-isotope composition of pedogenic carbonates document a woodland/bushland/shrubland paleoenvironment across the Miocene-Pliocene transition. Results support the presence of Pliocene subhumid to humid habitats, dominated by woody vegetation offering shade, food, and water for faunal dispersal along an inland corridor connecting northern segments of the East African Rift System with southern Africa.

To assess the relative risk of excess sediment and nutrient loading to individual lakes due to (inter) rill erosion within the catchments, we used the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) and sediment delivery distributed model (SEDD) to estimate soil loss and sedimentation in 75 crater-lake catchments with diverse types and intensities of land use, including 17 catchments situated partly or entirely in national parks. We found that variation in potential soil loss (A(p)) among all studied catchments was strongly related to differences in mean slope within each catchment. We also found substantial seasonal variation in vegetation cover, and thus, estimated actual soil loss (A(m)), on both cultivated land and protected savanna grassland, whereas the vegetation cover of protected semi-deciduous tropical forest was seasonally stable. Lacking detailed field data to validate model output, we used the ratio between estimated actual soil loss (A(m)) and potential soil loss (A(p)) to evaluate the relative influences of land-use intensity and type, as well as the impact of protective measures. Our results showed that due to their characteristically steep slopes (21% on average), all crater catchments were highly susceptible to soil loss, and because most of them were small (203 ha on average), a large portion of the eroded material was transported to and deposited in the lakes. Given the strong dependence of the local population on these crater lakes as source of water and fish protein, and on the surrounding land for crop production, increased effort by environmental planners and managers is required to safeguard or restore the long-term availability of these natural resources. Avoiding bare soil conditions by restoring natural vegetation or employing agricultural techniques that provide high vegetation cover throughout the year are likely to result in considerable improvements.

The animals were exposed for 18 months. including two reproduction seasons. Among the animals given the highest dose of A50. the whelping frequency was reduced in the second reproductive season, and all kits died within 24 h of birth. Reproduction was also impaired by the lower dose of A50. Daily exposure to the 0-1-ortho-CBs separated from 0.3 mg A50 severely reduced kit survival. Reproduction was not significantly impaired by daily exposure to the 2-4-ortho-CBS separated from 0.3 mg A50 or by exposure to the blubber extract. We conclude that the reproductive toxicity in chronically PCB-exposed mink is caused by the aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor agonists. The lowest-observed-effect level for reproductive impairment was 2.4 ng 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) equivalents (TEQs) per kilogram body weight and day (22 pg TEQs/g feed). Ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (EROD) was strongly induced by the 0-1-ortho-CBs and pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase by the 2-4-ortho-CBs. High EROD activity was correlated with low kit production, and consequently EROD may serve as a marker for reproductive toxicity by Ah receptor agonists in mink.																			0730-7268	1552-8618				OCT	2001	20	10					2318	2327		10.1002/etc.5620201026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620201026								11596766					WOS:000172820300026

The objective of this study was to determine the ecological effects of ambient UVR exposure on epilithon (algal communities attached to rocky substrata) relative to an artificially reduced UVR environment. UVR exposure was altered in the littoral zone of a boreal lake by selectively filtering segments of the solar spectrum with large acrylic sheets. This 130-day study took place at the Experimental Lakes Area, northwestern Ontario, in 1998. Epilithon were monitored for changes in productivity, biomass, pigment, and nutrient and taxonomic composition. The absence of UVR increased epilithic photosynthetic rates 37-46% above epilithon exposed to ambient UVR, increased cellular carbon and nitrogen content, and consequently lowered C:P. UVR effects on algal metabolism were dependent on seasonal trends. Epilithic respiration rates and chlorophyll a concentrations were not significantly different among treatments. A reduction in UV induced taxonomic shifts in epilithon, with diatoms increasingly favoured under low UV conditions. Species richness and diversity were not affected. Overall, the results of this study, considered together with previous research, suggest that the epilithic community is sensitive to changes in the UVR environment of aquatic ecosystems.

This paper investigates soil catenas and natural slope professes from the region's last virgin tropical forests and compares these with catenas and processes on slashed and burned slopes. Soils were sampled and analyzed for physical, fertility, and taxonomic measures. This primary forest toposequence forms a typical downward translocation catena, with the thickest soils (>200 cm) in depressions, the thinnest soils on shoulder slopes, and moderately thin soils on the crests and backslopes. Most crest and sloping soils are Lithic Rendolls and contain simple O-A-C horizon sequences, and most soils have little sign of either eluviation or illuviation. A few deeper soils on the slopes are Vertic Rendolls and have moderate slick-ensides, whereas footslopes and seasonally drained depressions are well developed Vertisols. The primary forest soil catena was compared with two slash-and-burn milpas, one with comparable slopes and one with steeper slopes. The comparably sloped milpa had soil thicknesses that were 7.9 to 13.8 cm thinner, truncated horizons, and physical evidence of erosion. The steeper milpa had soil thicknesses that were 11.1 to 18.2 cm thinner and also had truncated horizons and physical evidence of erosion. Where ancient Maya terraces (Late Classic;ca. 550 to 830 A.D.) are present in the slash-and-burn landscape, an average of 25 to 46.5 cm soil remain upslope and 9.3 to 16.1 cm remain downslope. The findings show high soil truncation rates and erosion to bedrock in a decade in one place, though ancient Maya terraces are still holding 2.7 to 3.6 times more soil than the surrounding hillslopes. Despite high modern erosion, lake sediments show surprisingly low soil losses in the Maya Late Classic during the period of the most intensive land use. In contrast, studies at Copan, Honduras and in the northern Peten, where terrace evidence is scant, show high rates of erosion during this period.																			0272-3646					SEP-OCT	1998	19	5					378	405		10.1080/02723646.1998.10642657	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723646.1998.10642657													WOS:000080630100002

STUDY OF THE ISOTOPIC ECOLOGICAL NICHE OF THE COMMON COOT FULICA ATRA (LAC TONGA, NORTH- EASTERN ALGERIA)	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This study aims to determine patterns of isotope discrimination between diet and blood and feathers in the common coot (Fulica atra) in Lake Tonga, North-eastern Algeria, the first time in Algeria on the aquatic avifauna. For this purpose, we investigate the trophic position of the species looking for the seasonal variations in the diet. The stable isotope analysis of nitrogen and carbon was carried out to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the feeding ecology. After plotting the isotopic composition of all potential food sources in the mixing plot, consumed by the coat, whether it is on feathers or blood, the results revealed that the main source of the coot diet in all seasons is Najas pectinata, followed by Gambusia affinis. Whereas, for Nymphaea alba a stable contribution was recorded during both seasons (breeding and reproduction). The food selection of a species is predetermined by its ability to exploit its trophic space, on one hand, and specific nutritional requirements are also essential to various biological functions of the species concerned.					; RACHEDI, Mounira/KBQ-2081-2024; LAZLI, Amel/KBQ-6262-2024	Lazli, Amel/0000-0001-9929-7198; RACHEDI, Mounira/0000-0003-4270-448X; 													1589-1623	1785-0037					2023	21	4					3123	3138		10.15666/aeer/2104_31233138	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/2104_31233138		APR 2023											WOS:001043718800001

Despite their impact, the dynamics of these islands remain unexplored. This study investigates island dynamics within the Nalubaale, Kiira, and Bujagali dams in Uganda, exploring the causes of their formation and the subsequent impact on hydropower production. The study collects data of Landsat imagery from 2000 to 2020, CHIRPS precipitation, and Lake Victoria's water level datasets from 2004, 2010, 2013, 2017, and 2020. The results reveal a strong correlation between precipitation, fluctuating water levels, and floating island formation, with nutrient-rich runoff from municipal waste and agriculture promoting island growth. In addition, rising water levels lead to the dislodging of rocks and soil, contributing to floating island formation, which may manifest with a lag time of up to one month. The analysis shows higher correlations between precipitation, water levels, and floating islands during the long (March-May) and short (September-November) rainy seasons as opposed to drier periods (June-August, December-February). The findings indicate that southeast monsoon winds, which transport floating vegetation, also are essential in influencing island dynamics. Consequently, the major drivers of floating islands in Lake Victoria are identified as precipitation, water level fluctuations and wind variations. Finally, a negative correlation between floating island eutrophication and power production at Kiira and Nalubaale stations suggests that the increased eutrophication caused by the presence of floating islands leads to reduced power output at both Kiira and Nalubaale power stations.					; Song, Yongze/F-1940-2018	Awange, Joseph/0000-0003-3533-613X; Song, Yongze/0000-0003-3420-9622														2072-4292				APR 27	2023	15	9							2304	10.3390/rs15092304	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15092304													WOS:000988053700001

Source mechanisms and induced seismicity in the Val d'Agri Basin (Italy)	GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL												We present the results from a fully unconstrained moment tensor inversion of induced seismic events in a complex and high seismic hazard region (Val d'Agri basin, Southern Italy). The study area hosts two well-documented cases of induced microseismicity linked to (i) a wastewater injection well of a giant oilfield (the largest in onshore Europe), and (ii) severe seasonal level changes of an artificial lake. In order to gather information on the non-double-couple components of the source and to better understand the rupture mechanisms, we analyse seismic events recorded during daily injection tests in the disposal well. The computed moment tensors have significant non-double-couple components that correlate with the well-head injection pressure. The injection parameters strongly influence the rupture mechanism that can be interpreted as due to the opening/closing of a fracture network inside a fault zone of a pre-existing thrust fault. For the case of the reservoir-induced seismicity, no direct correlations are observed with the loading/unloading of the reservoir.

Copper technology at the Early Iron Age fortified settlements near Lakes Itkul and Irtyash, middle Trans-Urals	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS												During the EIA (7th-3rd c. BCE), the middle Trans-Urals were populated by the Itkul culture of metalworkers. Most of the Itkul sites were excavated in 1960-1980 ' s, and ever since then the copper smelting technology, and exploited ore sources remained limitedly understood. To provide insight into these questions, we consider the archaeological context of copper production and apply methods of OM, SEM-EDS and LA ICP-MS to analyse copper slag, technical ceramics and ores from the Itkul culture settlement of Dautovo-1 (Itkul-1). This data is considered against the analyses of ores from the EIA sites and the Gumeshevsky mine in the Polevskoy area located 35 km from Dautovo, and the formerly investigated copper slags (Stepanov et al., 2021) from the site of Irtyash-1 located 50 km apart. The obtained results confirm that secondary copper ores of the Gumeshevsky mine, long regarded as the main ore source of the Itkul culture, were smelted at the site of Dautovo-1. We also identify the plate slag as the residue attesting to the most frequently used smelting technique, which consisted of the smelting of secondary copper ores in shallow open furnaces or crucibles and under moderately reducing conditions. The smelt ended with the removal and fast-cooling of slag outside the furnace. In contrast to Dautovo-1, only slags from secondary metallurgical operations were found at the site of Irtyash-1, which aligns with the dominance of secondary copper-working remains at the latter site. The production probably was likely performed on a seasonal basis, the metalworking society was divided into smelters and copper-workers, and the copper supply was likely oriented at both domestic and external (nomadic) markets.

However, the relationships between microbial keystone taxa and water variables, which play a pivotal role in aquatic ecosystems, has not been clarified in detail. We analyzed the seasonal variation in microbial communities and co-occurrence network in the representative areas taking Lake Dongqian as an example. Both pro- and eukaryotic community compositions were more affected by seasons than by sites, and the prokaryotes were more strongly impacted by seasons than the eukaryotes. Total nitrogen, pH, temperature, chemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a significantly affected the prokaryotic community, while the eukaryotic community was significantly influenced by total nitrogen, ammonia, pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen. The eukaryotic network was more complex than that of prokaryotes, whereas the number of eukaryotic keystone taxa was less than that of prokaryotes. The prokaryotic keystone taxa belonged mainly to Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. It is noteworthy that some of the keystone taxa involved in nitrogen cycling are significantly related to total nitrogen, ammonia, temperature and chlorophyll a, including Polaromonas, Albidiferax, SM1A02 and Leptolyngbya so on. And the eukaryotic keystone taxa were found in Ascomycota, Choanoflagellida and Heterophryidae. The mutualistic pattern between pro- and eukaryotes was more evident than the competitive pattern. Therefore, it suggests that keystone taxa could be as bio-indicators of aquatic ecosystems.

The PCB concentrations in spruce needles and snow were mostly elevated to the east of the plant and contained congeners that were not present at upwind or distant sites. Several years of annual vegetation monitoring data indicated that PCB emissions increased prior to the reported accident. Within 3 km of the plant, there was a predominance of higher chlorinated congeners penta-, hexa-, hepta-, and octachlorobiphenyls in white spruce (Picea glauca) needles and snow. Polychlorinated biphenyl congener patterns varied seasonally in spruce needles, likely influenced by temperature effects on the volatilization and of particle-bound and vapor phase PCBs in the forest canopy. The similarity of deposition patterns in snow and needles in 1997 and 1998 suggested the PCBs in the surrounding area were derived by long-term fugitive releases of PCBs rather than an accidental release. In addition, hexachlorobenzene, a combustion by-product of chlorinated organics in waste incinerators, was not measured at elevated concentrations in spruce needles or snow east of the facility and, when detected, was not correlated with PCB concentrations. A radiometrically dated sediment core from nearby Chrystina Lake (AB, Canada) showed a gradual increase in annual PCB flux during the early years of operation of the ASWTC, followed by a higher PCB flux in 1997, indicating that the lake may have been directly contaminated by the accidental release.					; Schindler, David/A-3752-2014; Muir, Derek/F-6183-2011; Blais, Jules/AAV-2321-2020	Muir, Derek/0000-0001-6631-9776; Blais, Jules/0000-0002-7188-3598; 													0730-7268	1552-8618				JAN	2003	22	1					126	133		10.1002/etc.5620220116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620220116								12503755					WOS:000179881200016

Buenavista is the deepest section and includes seven pedostratigraphic units, with Andosol (surface unit) and Luvisol (all underlying units) types of pedogenesis. Both types indicate a humid forest environment, the divergency being related to differences in pedogenesis duration. Albeluvisol with a bleached E horizon in unit 5 indicates cooler but still moist conditions in the final Late Pleistocene, whereas strong vertic properties in unit 4 indicate a climate with contrasting seasonal variation of precipitation during the first part of the Holocene. In the upper part of the Ahuatenco section, Bt horizons of different pedogenetic events form a welded Luvisol profile instead of a set of separate paleosols due to less intensive sedimentation. Material of indurated Cm horizons (tepetates) in the lower part of the Ahuatenco section is a mixture of fresh coarse volcanoclastic components and re-deposited Luvisol clayey material, formed by mass movement associated with volcanic events. The resulting granulometric composition of these layers is favourable for structural collapse and hydroconsolidation, which caused hardening together with subsequent pedogenic illuviation and redoximorphic processes.

The lake is unlikely to develop into a large moraine-dammed lake, but while it persists, growth of the lake will probably continue to result in locally high rates of ablation, contributing to overall downwasting of the glacier surface.																			0144-7815		1-901502-31-7				2000		264					177	185																WOS:000168875400018

The high richness of taxa, particularly in littoral macrophyte zones of water bodies in tropical and subtropical flood-prone areas, is a repeatedly reported fact. However, studies on the composition of periphytic rotifers in the Neotropics are reduced and almost non-existent in some regions. A qualitative study on rotifers (Monogononta) associated with littoral aquatic vegetation and their seasonal variation was carried out in three flood-prone ponds in the "Esteros de Camaguan Fauna Reserve" in the Venezuelan plains. For the selection of the collection sites, the two-stage stratified method with proportional affixation was used. Samples of macrophytes and the water associated with them were taken in littoral zones. The percentages of occurrence and numerical frequency were calculated for each rotifer taxa. The faunal similarities and correlations within and between ponds in the same and different climatic seasons were estimated using the Jaccard and Spearman coefficients (a = 0.05), respectively. In total, 102 rotifer taxa associated with 11 species of aquatic macrophytes were identified. The genus Taphrocampa with two taxa plus ten other taxa, are new records for Venezuela and one of them for South America. The taxocenosis and the geographic distribution of the reported taxa reflect a typical composition of the littoral zones of tropical regions. The total richness of both planktonic associated with aquatic vegetation and periphytic assemblages were similar. The highest richness of rotifer taxa coincided with the rainy season and the lowest with the early rainy season. The rotifer fauna presented low similarity values within and between ponds according to seasonality and, with some exceptions, between planktonic and periphytic environments. The importance of sampling periphytic rotifers and the influence of the flood cycle, and the degree of macrophyte development in the structuring of periphytic rotifer communities, were confirmed.

We know little about the water bodies, specially considering that this biome covers the third largest system of lakes in Brazil. Some of these lakes are located inside the protected "Rio Doce State Park", but many others are found outside this reserve. These external lakes are seldom studied, but understanding their response to human activities is essential for the conservation and the protection of the lakes inside the Park. We evaluated the effects of degradation in a lake outside the Park, which shows a constant bloom of the toxic invasive cyanobacteria Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. Phytoplankton, climate and physico-chemical variables were assessed from 2011 to 2013 to evaluate which were the major determinants of the lake dynamics. Despite the seasonal changes, the lake was always eutrophic, and cyanobacteria, transparency and nutrients were the major indicators of water characteristics. The lake seems to be nitrogen-limited and cyanobacteria were negatively correlated with nitrogen levels, since the constantly dominant C. raciborskii is a superior competitor for N. We suggest that the monitoring of nitrogen levels is fundamental to establish management strategies to avoid harmful algae blooms in this Atlantic Forest lake.					; von Rückert, Gabriela/JCN-8772-2023; Figueredo, Cleber/GNP-5768-2022; Giani, Alessandra/H-9764-2012	Figueredo, Cleber/0000-0002-6248-1327; Giani, Alessandra/0000-0002-2524-8534													0102-3306	1677-941X				APR-JUN	2016	30	2					222	231		10.1590/0102-33062015abb0334	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0102-33062015abb0334													WOS:000377591800007
J	Yunoki, T; Velasco, LT				Yunoki, Takayuki; Torres Velasco, Luis			Fish metacommunity dynamics in the patchy heterogeneous habitats of varzea lakes, turbid river channels and transparent clear and black water bodies in the Amazonian Lowlands of Bolivia	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The causes of fish community organization in a system of habitat patches with different environmental conditions were described using a data set of 65 sites sampled during the dry season. Incorporating the patchy heterogeneous structure, variation partitioning allowed us to specifically evaluate the fine-scale neutral processes produced by spatial autocorrelation within habitat patches, and the broad-scale dispersal limitations between patches. Only the second subset of spatial variables was significant; dispersal limitation was relatively low between habitat patches of varzea lakes. An analysis of functional ecology allowed an empirical description of the functional mechanisms of alpha and beta niche differentiation, and an assessment of the phylogenetic signal. The trait-convergence assembly pattern among habitat patches indicated that fish in turbid river channels were better adapted to low light than fish in transparent black and clear water bodies. Also, fish in varzea lakes had a wider ecological range; this association indicated phylogenetic niche conservatism. The trait-divergence assembly pattern was almost expressed by body weight and was prominent in varzea lakes; combined with ecological range and sensory adaptation, this association indicated a marginal phylogenetic signal. These results suggest the radiation of species-rich clades with a high degree of sensory adaptation may have occurred in the seasonal environment of varzea lakes. This resulted in larger ecological distribution and innovative life histories tightly synchronized with periodic flooding. The lineage-specific sensory adaptation and subsequent landscape and evolutional history of habitat specialization were also found to actually contribute to the fish metacommunity dynamic in the Bolivian Amazonian lowland.						yunoki, takayuki/0000-0002-4107-3332													0378-1909	1573-5133				APR	2016	99	4					391	408		10.1007/s10641-016-0481-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-016-0481-1													WOS:000374670500006

Colonization and succession of a periphytic algal community on a natural substrate (Nymphaea spp.) was evaluated in a shallow reservoir (Lago das Ninfeias, PEFI, SP). This study aimed to evaluate the environmental factors responsible for the structural variability of a periphytic algal community. Samplings of abiotic and biological variables were carried out every three days up to the 15th day, and later at five days intervals for 30 days in the dry (4/07 to 08/03/2007) and rainy (9/01 to 02/08/2008) seasons. The petioles of Nymphaea spp. were randomly selected and cleaned. Periphytic algal structure was analyzed by measuring chlorophyll-a, algal density, biovolume, species richness and diversity. The rainy season was characterized by high temperature and nutrient availability and the dry season had the highest light availability. Periphyton biomass, algal density and biovolume were higher in the dry season than in rainy season. Different successional phases and trajectories were identified in each climatic period. Limnological conditions inside macrophyte stands changed seasonally, and consequently influenced the periphytic algal structure. The final conclusion is that the periphytic algae structure was sensitive to autogenic changes (succession), but the seasonal scale was the main source of variability in community structure.

Trophic relationships between primary producers and associated fauna in a pristine Cerrado pond	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												Ponds arising from groundwater in Cerrado of Central Brazil are oligotrophic but highly biodiverse environments. In this study, we used stable isotope ratios to test if there are variations in carbon and nitrogen acquisition by different primary food sources and if they are influenced by seasonality in a well-preserved pond. We hypothesized that periphyton is the main food source for macrophyteassociated fauna. We found that delta C-13, but not delta N-15, can distinguish between primary food sources; however, the isotopic signatures of food sources did not differ significantly between seasons. The delta N-15 values of macrophyte-associated fauna were significantly higher for predators compared with other trophic groups, but delta C-13 values did not differ significantly between groups. Emergent macrophytes and periphyton were the main food sources for scrapers (contribution of 42.5%) and collector-gatherers (contribution of 41.6%), respectively. Compared with emergent macrophytes, submerged macrophytes were associated with a greater abundance of fauna and algal biomass but were not a significant food source for associated fauna. Our findings demonstrate that in this small shallow oligotrophic pond in the Cemado, the stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen of food sources did not vary between seasons but did differ between aquatic macrophyte life forms. We point out the different functional roles of macrophyte life forms, with emergent macrophytes serving as an important food resource, while submerged macrophytes mainly provide physical structure					Bustamante, Mercedes/AAQ-7231-2020; de Mendonça Galvão, Luciana/JTS-8510-2023; Fonseca, Barbara/AAD-9760-2019; Nardoto, Gabriela/J-7459-2012	Fonseca, Barbara/0000-0002-7898-771X; Nardoto, Gabriela/0000-0001-8062-7417; de Mendonca-Galvao, Luciana/0000-0002-6932-026X													1129-5767	1723-8633					2019	78	3					310	322		10.4081/jlimnol.2019.1874	http://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jlimnol.2019.1874													WOS:000502534300004

Index-based methods for water body extraction in satellite data	APPLICATIONS OF DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING XLII	Proceedings of SPIE				Conference on Applications of Digital Image Processing XLII	AUG 12-15, 2019	San Diego, CA	SPIE				Several water index-based methods have been proposed in the literature, which, combine satellite multispectral bands in an algebraic expression. The objective of these water index-based methods is to increase the intensity contrast between water-pixels (surface water-body) and non-water pixels (built-up, soil, vegetation, etc.). The present investigation evaluates the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and the Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) using the Satellite data from Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A at different time scenes. Based on visual inspection of the Lake Metztitlan water body mapping results, a high performance of AWEI approached via the OLI and the MSI sensors is observed. In the selected study area of [9210x9380]m, a statistical water pixel percentage of 30.703616% is observed in a flooding season and 9.884537% for a dry season of the year.					; Toxqui-Quitl, Carina/G-8000-2015	Arreola-Esquivel, Mario Martin/0000-0002-4945-6186; DELGADILLO, MARICELA/0000-0001-8398-0304													0277-786X	1996-756X	978-1-5106-2968-4				2019	11137								111372N	10.1117/12.2529756	http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2529756													WOS:000511298300074

Water and fish samples were taken from Guessabo Lake during the dry season and the rainy season. The average Hg, Pb, Cd and Zn concentrations in the water samples decreased during the rainy season by 20.51%, 80%, 18, 26% and 61.4%, respectively. In contrast, the average concentrations of As, Cu, Mn and Fe increased by 10%, 84.3%, 48.98% and 11.45%, respectively. The concentrations of heavy metals in water samples follow the trend: Fe> Cu> Mn> Pb> As> Zn> Hg> Cd. All metals except Fe were within permitted limits for drinking water quality at all stations during both seasons. The increase of As, Mn and Fe in water samples during rainy season was inversely proportional to their covalent index. The average heavy metal pollution index (HPI) for each sampling station showed higher pollution at the G2 station. The average Heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) of dry season (28) decreased relatively after the rainy season (21). Pearson's analysis showed that cadmium correlates strongly with HPI (r = 0.896) and HEI (r = 0.95) and iron is also highly correlated with HPI (r= 0.961) and HEI (r= 0.999). The concentration of trace metals obtained in the muscles of Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus (demersal) and Tilapia spp (benthopelagic) showed that Tilapia spp concentrated more non-essential metals (Hg, Cd and As) than Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus. Human health risks of trace metals in fish muscle and water were low, but among the selected metals, As and Hg are the non-essential elements contributing more to the cumulative hazard quotient of HI (0.845) for children and (0.39) for adults.																			0970-020X	2231-5039					2019	35	6					1742	1755		10.13005/ojc/350617	http://dx.doi.org/10.13005/ojc/350617													WOS:000534476700017

THE EFFECT OF PHYSICO-CHEMICAL VARIATIONS ON PHYTOPLANKTON STATUS IN THE MARGIN OF CHOGHAKHOR WETLAND, IRAN	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Many human activities in the margin of Choghakhor wetland, (Iran) causes evaluation of the phytoplankton status in relation to the physico-chemical parameters in different seasons of 2011 in 5 marginal stations of the wetland. Water samples prepared in triplicate and temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate and phosphate concentration were measured using APHA methods. The phytoplankton identified, counted and Shannon diversity index (H'). Phytoplankton community included 59 genera, 43 families and 6 divisions, among which Bacillariophyta was the most common (46.6%) followed by Chlorophyta (32.0%), Cyanophyta (13.3%), Dinophyta (4.4%), Euglenophyta (3.0%) and Chrysophyta (0.8%). Phytoplankton density, nitrate, and phosphate concentration were different in different stations and seasons (P < 0.05). The highest density was recorded for Nitzschia followed by Cosmarium, Microcystis, Peridinium, Euglenaria and Dinobryon. Also, Microcystis density was maximum in station 5 [S5]. There were significant correlations between the phytoplankton density and nitrate concentration (r = 0.6, P < 0.01), Chlorophyta and phosphate concentration (r = 0.3, P < 0.01), Cyanophyta and phosphate concentration (r = 0.2, P < 0.05). Although wetland water was still clean (H' > 3), high density of Nitzschia and Microcystis as eutrophication bio-indicators showed starting of eutrophication. Microcystis as the most abundant genus of Cyanophyta must be seriously controlled to avoid blooms in the wetland.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2019	17	2					5173	5192		10.15666/aeer/1702_51735192	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1702_51735192													WOS:000462830400240

J	Eskandari, A; Saygi, Y				Eskandari, Armin; Saygi, Yasemin			Ecological surveys on the parthenogenetic Artemia populations in the hypersaline lakes of Anatolia, Turkey	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												The objective of this study is to provide information on the parthenogenetic Artemia populations in some hypersaline lakes of Anatolia (Tuz, Bolluk, Tersakan, and Acigol). Sampling studies were performed for abiotic factors and population parameters between November 2009 and October 2010. During the survey we focused on the local Artemia populations to investigate population dynamics, reproduction, brood size, and cyst and naupliar biometrics. Generally, the Artemia habitats in Anatolia were relatively shallow, and thus they were subject to major seasonal fluctuations. Dramatic declines in population size in Tuz and Acigol Lakes were found during this study. All Artemia populations were parthenogenetic and brood sizes of females showed significant differences among the populations (P < 0.05). The largest brood size was observed in the Acigol population and it may be concluded that local conditions for reproductive success were more adequate in this population. Substantial differences among populations were revealed during the studies on cyst and naupliar biometry. Cyst diameter mean values ranged from 231.8 to 266.9 mu m. The cyst diameters for the Acigol population are determined as the smallest in these populations and among the smallest values recorded in parthenogenetic populations. The total length of newly hatched nauplii ranged from 484 to 512 mu m for these populations.

J	Hertig, A				Hertig, Andreas			Monitoring of European lake trout spawning in small tributaries	WASSERWIRTSCHAFT												An on-going monitoring since 2005 of European lake trout spawners migrating into small tributaries (Q(347) < 100 l/s) of Lake Zurich and Lake Pfaffikon, Switzerland, revealed that migration only takes place during higher water flows due to the small size of the creeks. The catchment areas of the tributaries range from 4.9 to 15.1 km(2). The mean length of 402 spawners from five tributaries ranged from 45 to 55 cm with an overall mean of 52 cm for all individuals. It correlated positively with the low water flow of the respective tributaries. Compared to spawners from large tributaries of Swiss lakes, the mean length of the small creek spawners is far lower. All individuals were marked with fototagging for later individual recognition. Less than 10 % of the spawners could be observed in more than one spawning season. This low rate of multiple reproductions is in accordance with data from other Swiss lake trout populations and indicates that most of the lake trout spawners in Switzerland seem to be semelparous.																			0043-0978						2019	109	2-3					19	22		10.1007/s35147-019-0002-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s35147-019-0002-1													WOS:000460335900003

The Chahnimeh reservoirs are the major source of drinking and agricultural water in southeast of Iran, and evaluation of their water quality is necessary. The water quality index (WQI) is the most important indicator expressing the qualitative condition of water in simple terms, without mathematical or statistical complexity. Therefore it was used in this descriptive, cross-sectional study of the first Chahnimeh reservoir based on sampling during the four seasons in 2016. Eight sampling stations were selected in the reservoir to determine six variables (nitrate, nitrite, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, hardness, and pH). Despite spatial and temporal variations and fluctuations in these parameters, the results demonstrated that water quality in the reservoir is good. Moreover, the values for all measured parameters, apart from electrical conductivity, were within acceptable - i.e., recommended - ranges. Generally, considering the WQI values, water quality in the middle part of the lake was better than at its margins. Given the increasing importance of the Chahnimeh reservoirs, continuous evaluation and a water quality monitoring programme are required.																			0972-9860	1875-8568					2019	16	3					55	62		10.3233/AJW190033	http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/AJW190033													WOS:000476560800008

New data on Lake Mogilnoe (Kildin Island, Barents Sea): the results of the 2018 expeditions	ARCTIC BIOMONITORING	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				International Conference on Arctic Biomonitoring	NOV 26-27, 2018	M V Lomonosov No Fed Univ, Arkhangelsk, RUSSIA		M V Lomonosov No Fed Univ			Lake Mogilnoe (Kildin Island, the Barents Sea) is a meromictic lake located in the high latitudes of the Arctic. It was formed by separation from the Barents Sea and retained an underground connection with it through a rocky barrier. The first researchers of the lake mentioned the upper fresh-water layer, the middle salty layer, lower anaerobic layer containing hydrogen sulfide, and noted the existence of a layer with rose water in the redoxcline. Observations carried out during the 20th century pointed to a gradual change in the vertical structure of the lake: mineralization increase of the surface layer and the rise of the hydrogen sulfide distribution boundary. In the past 10 years, there have been signals about acceleration of these changes. This is a big concern about an isolated population of Kildin cod (G. morhua kildinensis) listed in the Red Book of the Russian Federation, an endemic to this lake subspecies of Atlantic cod. In July, August and October 2018, three expeditions were organized to Lake Mogilnoe to study the current hydrological state of the lake, seasonal variability of hydrological characteristics, and outline possible causes of the registered changes and the threat to the Kildin cod population.

VARIATION CHARACTERISTICS, INFLUENCING FACTORS AND HYDROLOGICAL CONDITIONS OF THE REVERSE FLOW FROM MEKONG RIVER TO TONLE SAP LAKE	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												In order to understand the interactive mechanism between Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake, long-series hydrological statistics were studied to analyze the variation characteristics, influencing factors and hydrological conditions of the reverse flow from Mekong River to Tonle Sap Lake. It was found that the reversal in the flood season lasts 122 days, with the flow volume reaching 37.7 billion m3 and flood peak flow reaching 8402 m(3)/s on average. The reversal reaches the maximum in August, accounting for 43% of the total yearly volume and 17.7% of the flow in Mekong River. Main factors influencing reversal flow include the difference in the runoff and water level between Mekong River and Tonle Sap Lake, and the water level of Tonle Sap River. The hydrological conditions presupposed that the reversal flow is linearly correlated to the product of water-level of Tonle Sap River to the power of 1.36 multiplied by that water-level difference to the power of 0.46. The result is expected to provide a scientific basis for the management of Mekong Delta and Tonle Sap Lake.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2019	17	6					13875	13895		10.15666/aeer/1706_1387513895	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1706_1387513895													WOS:000505251300084

Trend analysis of monthly and annual runoff based on a segmented M-K method in Fuhe River basin, China	5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WATER RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENT (WRE 2019)	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				5th International Conference on Water Resource and Environment (WRE) / 1st International Conference on Advances in Civil and Ecological Engineering Research (ACEER)	JUN 16-19, 2019	Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Macao, PEOPLES R CHINA		Macau Univ Sci & Technol			It is very important for water resource management to analyse the change rule of runoff. In this paper, a segmented Mann-Kendall trend analysis method,which is called segmented M-K method in the following, is proposed to analyse the periods of significant trend within the time series. This method fills in the gap that the changes of internal trend for long sequence are ignored in M-K trend test, by finding out the significant change period within the long time series. It may be a new method for the analyse of runoff changes. Fuhe River, which is one of the main rivers of Poyang Lake in Yangtze River basin, is taken for example. Based on the runoff data of the Lijiadu section of the Fu River Basin from 1957 to 2015, the interannual variation of runoff over Lijiadu section in Fuhe River basin was quantitatively analysed by using a combined trend analysis method containing linear regression, sliding average, cumulative filter, Mann-Kendall trend test, Mann-Kendall mutation test and segmented M-K method. The results show a light interannual variety and a trend of insignificant increase in annual runoff for whole time series in Fuhe River Basin. However, an insignificant decrease trend, which might course a shortage of water for development and utilization, is found in the period from 1997 to 2015 while a significant increase trend is found between 1963 and 1985. The annual runoff alternates frequently between abundance and drought. However, its interannual variation of monthly runoff is large, and 3 months include January, December and August show a significant increase. From the result of segmented M-K method, both significant increase trend period and significant decrease trend period could be found in flood season months, while only significant increase trend period is found in other months. In addition, the increasing period is close to the middle part of the total time series in dry season months, to the front part in flood season months, and to the rear part in months after flood season.																			1755-1307						2019	344								012108	10.1088/1755-1315/344/1/012108	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/344/1/012108													WOS:000562941100106

Temporal variations of larval digenean assemblages parasitizing Heleobia parchappii (Mollusca: Cochliopidae) in two shallow lakes from the Buenos Aires province, Argentina	IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA												The larval digenean assemblages in snail hosts are influenced by biotic and abiotic factors and by environmental disturbances due to human activities. Given their susceptibility to different types of impact, they can be useful tools for the study of temporal variations in parasite communities. The study of temporal dynamics in prevalence and species richness of larval digenean assemblages of Heleobia parchappii (D'Orbigny, 1835), in two Pampean lakes, provides a good opportunity to test the supposition that seasonal variations in digenean assemblages are determined by a series of biotic and abiotic factors that operate interdependently. To analyze the temporal variations, and to evaluate how local factors influence these digenean assemblages in Los Padres and La Brava lakes (Buenos Aires province, Argentina), 2,400 specimens of H. parchappii were collected seasonally, during one year. The digenean assemblages in Los Padres and La Brava lakes were composed of 13 and 12 species respectively. These larval digenean assemblages showed similarities in the number and in the seasonal frequency of occurrence of species (eight of which were present in both lakes). However, despite these similarities, the assemblages showed different temporal dynamics in La Brava and Los Padres lakes and, also, different correlations with the abiotic and biotic factors analyzed during this study (temperature, high of the water column and snail relative abundance). Temporal dynamics in prevalence and species richness of larval digenean assemblages of H. parchappii in both lakes seems to be influenced by a series of factors (diversity and abundance of definitive hosts, intermediate and definitive host location, snail relative abundance and anthropogenic disturbances). Our results highlight the importance of analyzing the role and interaction of local factors, especially in studies dealing with spatiotemporal fluctuations or with distance decay of similarities in species richness of parasite assemblages.

METAL LEVELS IN WATER AND THE MUSCLE TISSUE OF FISHES IN THE CACHORROS RIVER, SAO LUIS ISLAND, STATE OF MARANHAO, BRAZIL	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The present study evaluates physicochemical variables, perform a microbiological analysis as well as determine heavy metal concentrations in the water and muscle tissue of fishes from the Cachorros River. The analysis of metal concentrations in the estuarine water revealed high levels of Fe and Al, with values above the limits established by Brazilian legislation. The concentration of total coliforms and thermotolerant coliforms tended to be higher in the rainy season. Regarding metal concentrations in the muscle tissue of fishes, high levels of Pb and Cd were found, especially in carnivorous and detritivorous species, with values above the limits established by national legislation. Two-factor analysis of variance revealed that only Pb demonstrated a significant interaction between seasonality and the feeding habits of the fish fauna, with higher concentrations of this metal in the dry season among detritivorous species in comparison to herbivorous species.

J	Suárez, SP; Gebauer, G				Suarez, Silvia Parra; Gebauer, Gerhard			The fate of monsoonal atmospheric nitrate deposition in two forest catchments in Soyang lake watershed, South Korea: a mass balance and stable isotope approach	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												Over 60% of South Korea is covered by forests. Nitrate deposition plays an important role as nitrogen source in these forests. Nitrate input from deposition increases nitrogen availability leading initially to increases in productivity. However, later forests may become nitrogen saturated with nitrate leaching, denitrification and forest decline. Using a mass balance approach, we compared the atmospheric nitrate input and output by stream runoff in two forest sub-catchments, a deciduous and a mixed catchment, within the Soyang lake watershed, the main drinking water reservoir for the 20-million-person metropolis Seoul. A dual stable isotope approach was used to identify the origin of nitrate in stream discharge of the two sub-catchments. Extremely different monsoon seasons in 2013 and 2014 drove the nitrate discharge. Total nitrate-N export was closely related with rainfall events and intensities. Nitrate-N discharge at the deciduous forest was lower than nitrate-N deposition, thus sink conditions prevailed. Nitrate-N discharge at the mixed forest was consistently higher. During the heavy monsoon season of 2013 the mixed forest turned from a sink for atmospheric nitrate towards a source, i.e. nitrate amounts in the discharge were higher than atmospheric inputs. Nitrate isotopic compositions of stream water from both forests revealed soil nitrification as main nitrate source. However, under conditions of heavy monsoon rainfall direct runoff of atmospheric deposition nitrate was identified in the mixed forest. Lower nitrate assimilation capacities of conifers compared to broadleaf trees are probably the driver for a lower nitrate retention capacity making coniferous forests more prone to nitrate leaching.

J	Tan, XH; Peng, YL				Tan, Xuehong; Peng, Yunle			Ecotourism Environment Capacity of Wetland Park in Xuzhou City	EKOLOJI												In this paper, The ecotourism environmental capacity model was established from ecological capacity, spatial capacity, facility capacity and psychological capacity to estimate the ecotourism environmental capacity of YunLong Lake, DaLong Lake and JiuLi Lake in Xuzhou city. The results showed that: (1) The ecotourism environment capacity of YunLong lake, DaLong lake and JiuLi lake was respectively 15022-24072 thousand persons/year, 5646-8096 thousand persons/year, and 2517-3634 thousand persons/year. An early warning mechanism for the peak season human flow should be put forward according that the current annual statistics of the three wetland parks had exceeded the minimum limit and not reached the maximum limit; (2) The restriction factors of water environmental capacity of the three wetland parks were different, so different treatment plans should be put forward according to the situation of pollutants, so as to improve the water environment quality and environment capacity of ecotourism. Watching-bird capacity was the limiting factor of the ecological capacity of the three wetland parks; (3) The limiting factor of facility capacity of each wetland park was mainly parking space. Increasing the number of parking space without destroying the environment was the key factor to improve the facility capacity and even the environmental capacity of the three wetland parks.																			1300-1361						2019	28	107					3505	3513	UNSP e107393															WOS:000461678300392

Assessment of chemical and physical treatments to selectively kill non-indigenous freshwater zooplankton species	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Non-indigenous zooplankton species pose a biosecurity threat to New Zealand's freshwater native taxa. Nine species are known to have established in New Zealand lakes to date. The spread of some zooplankton taxa is linked to the translocation of farmed fish, principally grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella), and recreational vessel movements. The aims of this study were to assess the effectiveness of a range of chemical and physical treatments for transport water and associated equipment to kill freshwater cladoceran, copepod, and rotifer zooplankton species, and their risk to non-target fish. Sodium chloride was the most effective and applicable chemical treatment tested at length in the cladoceran and, combined with physical treatment via mechanical filtration of water or hot water immersion of equipment (to also manage the risk of diapausing eggs), represents an effective option for the control of non-indigenous zooplankton, with limited impact on stenohaline fish.

Community resilience in dealing with Tempe lake disaster	1ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON GLOBAL ISSUE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE, ENVIRONMENT & SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT	IOP Conference Series-Earth and Environmental Science				1st International Conference on Global Issue for Infrastructure, Environment and Socio-Economic Development (IC-GIESED)	AUG 30-SEP 01, 2018	Hasanuddin Univ, Post Grad Sch, Makassar, INDONESIA	Hasanuddin Univ, Publicat Management Ctr	Hasanuddin Univ, Post Grad Sch			Tempe Lake is the largest lake in Province of South Sulawesi, located in three regencies, i.e. Wajo, Soppeng and Sidendreng Rappang (Sidrap). Every year during the rainy season, the water overflows the lake causing floods, and during the dry season, there is siltation that results in difficulties of catching fish. The condition of the unstable lake often becomes a disaster for people around the lake. This paper aims to analyze the forms of community response or resilience during instability of water of Tempe Lake. The data used are from field studies conducted in June-November 2017. The study sites are focused at Tempe Sub-district, Wajo Regency with the consideration that the area is experiencing the severity of flooding and high silt. The method used is qualitative. The data obtained from direct interviews with some fishermen, farmers, and residents living around the lake and other informants such as Adat Chief, Village Head / Neighborhood Head, Local Government, and Macoa Tappareng (lake guard). The results of the study showed that when the overflowing water causing floods during the rainy season, fishermen and communities around the lake responded through a ritual ceremony of maccera tappareng in the form of a request to the lord of the lake in order not to cause a big disaster. Their houses which are floating houses are tied so well that they are not drifted. But behind the flood, the community also gained blessings in the number of fish catches due to the extensive fishing grounds. In the dry season where the lake becomes silt, the fishermen suffer from the lack of fish caught but obtain a blessing in the form of new agricultural land on the edge of the lake left by the water.

J	Zanga, N; Wilander, A; Inogwabini, BI; Bishop, K				Zanga, Norbert; Wilander, Anders; Inogwabini, Bila-Isia; Bishop, Kevin			FISHES OF LAKE TUMBA (DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO): EVALUATION OF PRESENT STATUS AND COMPARISONS WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES	ACTA ICHTHYOLOGICA ET PISCATORIA												Background. Lake Tumba with a surface area of 830 km(2) is very humic (pH = 3.6-4.6). The fishery is important for the riparian population but there are concerns about overfishing. The objective of this study was to assess changes in the fish species composition by comparing the presently reported survey (2005-2010) with earlier studies carried out in 1938-1939, 1955-1956, and 1959 Our hypothesis was that Lake Tumba had been overfished. Materials and methods. Fishing was done in the pelagial with gillnet (25 and 30 mm) and line with hooks at three sites within 166 days in 2005-2006 and 2009-2010. Results. A total of 40 species were identified. Five species were caught all years and at all sites, namely Chrysichthys cranchii (Leach, 1818), Chrysichthys ornatus Boulenger, 1902, Chrysichthys punctatus Boulenger, 1899, Mormyrops anguilloides (Linnaeus, 1758), and Tylochromis lateralis (Boulenger, 1898). Twelve species were only caught once. Weight Per Unit Effort (WPUE) differed with site and season: ranging from 0 to 4200 g.day(-1) and the Number of fish Per Unit Effort (NPUE) varied from 0 to 27 fishes.day(-1). Conclusions. Out of 49 pelagic species caught by Matthes in 1959, we considered five as diminished in numbers or even missing. This may be attributed to high fishing pressure. The protected site Mabali hosted the majority of previously reported species of which two were noted in Matthes's list but not caught by him. Many parameters demonstrated a "positive" difference between Mabali (which is protected from fishing) and the other sites. This site should be a reference area for future monitoring if its status can be maintained. A trend in the fishery based on interviews with fishers indicated a change from larger species to smaller. This was deemed a result of fishing pressure and nine species were identified as diminishing. The presently reported survey introduced quantitative aspects while earlier studies were qualitative. This impairs the ability to draw strong conclusions about overfishing and other anthropogenic activities. The threat of overfishing calls for the need for consistent quantitative monitoring of the fish population, including monitoring of waters in the drainage area, to enable assessment of impact of anthropogenic pressure.

HYDROLOGIC IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON POYANG LAKE WETLAND, CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												This study developed hydrologic models based on satellite remote sensing data from 2002 to 2010. Daily meteorological and hydrological data (1959-2010) were used as model inputs to analyse the relationships between meteorological factors and water area, and to calculate the daily water area and mean reduced water area on an annual basis to analyse the trend of changes. By analysing BCC-CSM1-1 model data, the study derived a qualitative assessment of the future water area of the Poyang Lake Basin, China The following results were found. (1) The water area had shrunk substantially since the 1990s, especially during the 2000s. Because of aridification, the water area had decreased by 22.5% from 1845 km' in the 1980s to 1430 km' in the 2000s. (2) Since 1990, the first day of its wet season had become delayed and the final day had advanced. Generally, the number of wet season days had reduced while that of the dry season has increased. (3) In all future scenarios, extreme events were projected to occur more frequently, suggesting dramatic volatility in water resources and great frequency of droughts, which would exacerbate the shrinking of Poyang Lake and represent a severe threat to its water security.

J	Zacharias, I; Dimitriou, E; Koussouris, T				Zacharias, I; Dimitriou, E; Koussouris, T			Developing sustainable water management scenarios by using thorough hydrologic analysis and environmental criteria	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Wetlands constitute a significant source of life since they incorporate unique habitats with endemic and migrant species. They also contribute to the preservation of high global biodiversity and they are under protection according to EU legislation. Nevertheless, during the last century, significant degradation has been observed in wetlands, mainly due to intensification of agriculture and poor water management practices. Calcareous fens habitat with the endangered species Cladium mariscus and Carex spp. is an ecologically significant wetland that undergoes great ecological stresses globally, due to the irrational use of water resources. In Trichonis lake, Western Greece, this habitat has been under deterioration during the last 50 years due to the lack of a sustainable water management plan that has caused destabilization of the hydrologic balance and high water level fluctuations. This human induced hydrologic regime has led to seasonal shifting between drought and flooding which constitute unfavorable conditions for this fen habitat and as a result significant elimination of this ecosystem extent has occurred. This study has adopted technologically advanced scientific methods such as GIS applications and remote sensing techniques to quantify the existing water resources and formulate a sustainable management scheme by considering both anthropogenic water uses and environmental protection.

American kestrels laid eggs with environmentally relevant total PCB levels (34.1 mug/g whole egg wet weight) when consuming PCB-spiked (Aroclor 1248:7254:1260) food (5-7 mug/g body weight per day) for 100d only in 1998. In 1999, the same adults laid eggs with estimated total PCBs of 23 mug/g. Effects of maternal (only female exposed) and paternal (only male exposed) in ovo PCB exposure were investigated. Maternal F-1 eggs contained predicted total PCB concentrations of 0.34 mug/g. Specific abnormalities occurred more frequently during dietary F-0 exposure, particularly aggressive courtship interactions, clutch abandonment, occurrences of cracked eggs, and developmental effects. Multiple developmental effects were more pronounced during than after dietary PCB exposure of adults, and although these effects were limited, nevertheless they occurred in the F-1 maternal and F-1 paternal pairs. However, the incidence of multiple deformities throughout the breeding season increased dramatically from 1998 13%) to 1999 (56%) in F-0 PCB-exposed pairs. Developmental abnormalities were unlikely to be attributed to the extrinsic factors of disease, genetics, or nutritional (vitamin D-3) deficiencies, but rather to adverse changes in parental behavior and intrinsic factors involving altered genetic material and PCB exposure. Readily cleared PCB congeners may induce specific types of behavioral and developmental abnormalities, but persistent congeners and metabolites are likely producing (1) odd laying patterns, (2) developmental effects including embryonic underdevelopment and edema, and (3) increased incidences of multiple deformities within a clutch.

We analyzed 408 cord blood samples collected between 1993 and 2000 for PCBs, chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethylene (DDE), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and n-3 fatty acids. We also gathered information on the mothers (age, past and present residence, ethnic group, use of tobacco during pregnancy, and breast-feeding during previous pregnancies). From 1993 to 2000, mean concentrations of PCBs, chlordanes, DDT/DDE, and HCB in cord blood decreased by 63%, 25%, 66%, and 69%, respectively (p < 0.0001). Multiple regression analysis with the year of birth as the main independent variable yielded a strong significant exponential decrease for all contaminants (in all age and ethnic groups). We detected no monthly or seasonal pattern. We used n-3 fatty acids concentration as a surrogate of maternal fish consumption. Fish consumption declined only slightly between 1993 and 2000, but this decrease did not contribute significantly to the reduction of OCs. These results show that prenatal exposure to persistent OCs has declined significantly between 1993 and 2000 in this population.

J	Barth, JAC; Veizer, J				Barth, JAC; Veizer, J			Water mixing in a St. Lawrence river embayment to outline potential sources of pollution	APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY												Water mass balances on an isolated embayment (Hoople Bay) in the St. Lawrence River revealed a small stream (Hoople Creek), local groundwater and the St. Lawrence Main Channel as the 3 principal water sources. The latter had an average evaporative isotope signal that was inherited from the Great Lakes (delta(18)O(H2O) = -7.0parts per thousand) and an average Cl- content of 0.55 mmol/l. Hoople Creek and Hoople Bay waters were more variable in their isotopic composition and Cl- contents, while local groundwater was assumed to have a homogeneous composition year around. These parameters constituted an equation system that was solved with matrix operations to yield monthly contributions of the 3 endmembers. Influx of groundwater and Hoople Creek dominated the embayment only after higher snowmelt discharges, while the Main Channel contributed more than 50% during the remainder of the year. Preliminary results suggest that potential pollution in the Main Channel would strongly affect Hoople Bay and similar ecosystems along the river. Nevertheless, more detailed data are needed for a better water balance over longer time periods. The 3-component mixing technique serves as a good tool to evaluate seasonal water fluxes and may also become useful in other mass balances. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.					A.C.

Transparency was significantly higher and the content of N and P decreased inside the communities, as did the rate of sedimentation of organic suspended matter in the Phragmites australis community. Modeling revealed that macrophyte restoration could decrease phytoplaniton biomass, increase fish biomass, exergy, structural exergy, zooplankton/phytoplankton ratio and transparency (Xu et al., 1999b). It is concluded that macrophyte restoration can purify lake water, regulate lake biological structure and control eutrophication.					; Li, Qing/KCZ-1775-2024	Tao, Shu/0000-0002-7374-7063; 													0018-8158					JUN	1999	405						169	178		10.1023/A:1003867309767	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1003867309767													WOS:000083818600016

We found a highly significant response of benthic bacterial activity to nutrient additions, which was reflected in greater (about two-fold) ammonification rates and, to a smaller extent, a significant tendency for a greater exoenzymatic activity. Nutrient additions significantly raised bacterial activity, without altering the seasonal changes in bacterial activity. As a result of the increased bacterial activity, the organic content of the sediments declined significantly, by about 33%, after one year of nutrient addition. Hence, nutrient additions to the seagrass meadows enhance seagrass production but also accelerate bacterial decomposition of seagrass carbon, thereby reducing the capacity of the sediments to store organic carbon. These results demonstrate that sediment nutrient availability limits bacterial activity in these Posidonia oceanica meadows, and identify bacteria as important nutrient consumers in these systems.

The Effects of Lakeshore Development on Common Loon (Gavia immer) Productivity in the Adirondack Park, New York, USA	WATERBIRDS												The effects of lakeshore development on reproductive success of Common Loons (Gavia inimer) were examined in New York State's Adirondack Park. It was hypothesized that loon reproductive success would be negatively affected by the increased amount of shoreline development that has been occurring in the Park in recent years. Additionally, it was further hypothesized that the average distance from the nest site to the nearest point of development would be greater for successful nests than for failed nests. Historical nest productivity data collected from banded Common Loons on 53 lakes over a period of 7 years were evaluated along with residential development data collected during two field seasons in 2004 and 2005. Mean distance from successful nests (n=28) to the nearest shoreline development unit (442.7 m, Range: 41.4-1,540.0 m) was greater than the mean distance from failed nests (n=32) to the nearest shoreline development unit (343.1 m, Range: 2.2-1,222.9 m). Presence of nesting pairs was significantly related (R-2=0.25, P=0.001) to increased shoreline length and decreased amount of development. Common Loon chick hatching success was significantly related to the density of development on small lakes (P=0.033), but not on large lakes (P>0.05). Our results indicate that the amount of development on lakes is not as important to nesting Common Loons as the placement of development in clusters along lakeshores. The clustering of development on one part of the lake will allow Common Loons to nest a distance away from developed areas. Thus, this study provides additional support for the buffering of loon nesting areas from development as a conservation/management tool to enhance their reproductive success.																			1524-4695	1938-5390				APR	2014	37				1		94	101		10.1675/063.037.sp112	http://dx.doi.org/10.1675/063.037.sp112													WOS:000335613500012

Twenty-three nigorobuna and 11 gengoroubuna specimens caught using set-nets in the lake's south basin were surgically fitted with acoustic transmitters and then released. Signals from the fishes were recorded by 23 receivers installed around the lake. Between April and June 2007, the first spawning season after release, signals were received from all tagged fishes. Thereafter, until the second spawning season, signals were collected from 26 and 45% of released nigorobuna and gengoroubuna individuals, respectively. Seasonal habitat preferences for these species were studied by distance-based analysis. The analysis revealed that nigorobuna tended to stay near their spawning area in the south basin of the lake throughout the year, whilst gengoroubuna tended to show a seasonal migration pattern between the north and south basins. After the spawning season, the latter species migrated to the north basin where it remained until the next spawning season, when it returned to the south basin. This is the first report of seasonal migration of nigorobuna and gengoroubuna in Lake Biwa.

J	Li, R; Scholtz, MT; Yang, FQ; Sloan, JJ				Li, Rong; Scholtz, M. Trevor; Yang, Fuquan; Sloan, James J.			A multimedia fate and chemical transport modeling system for pesticides: II. Model evaluation	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Pesticides have adverse health effects and can be transported over long distances to contaminate sensitive ecosystems. To address problems caused by environmental pesticides we developed a multimedia multi-pollutant modeling system, and here we present an evaluation of the model by comparing modeled results against measurements. The modeled toxaphene air concentrations for two sites, in Louisiana (LA) and Michigan (MI), are in good agreement with measurements (average concentrations agree to within a factor of 2). Because the residue inventory showed no soil residues at these two sites, resulting in no emissions, the concentrations must be caused by transport; the good agreement between the modeled and measured concentrations suggests that the model simulates atmospheric transport accurately. Compared to the LA and MI sites, the measured air concentrations at two other sites having toxaphene soil residues leading to emissions, in Indiana and Arkansas, showed more pronounced seasonal variability (higher in warmer months); this pattern was also captured by the model. The model-predicted toxaphene concentration fraction on particles (0.5-5%) agrees well with measurement-based estimates (3% or 6%). There is also good agreement between modeled and measured dry (1:1) and wet (within a factor of less than 2) depositions in Lake Ontario. Additionally this study identified erroneous soil residue data around a site in Texas in a published US toxaphene residue inventory, which led to very low modeled air concentrations at this site. Except for the erroneous soil residue data around this site, the good agreement between the modeled and observed results implies that both the US and Mexican toxaphene soil residue inventories are reasonably good. This agreement also suggests that the modeling system is capable of simulating the important physical and chemical processes in the multimedia compartments.																			1748-9326					JUL-SEP	2011	6	3							034030	10.1088/1748-9326/6/3/034030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/6/3/034030													WOS:000295327900033

A total of 723 specimens from the Bukvora Baor, Bangladesh were used to estimate the total body length (TL) and body weight (W) which ranged from 5.5 to 14.5 cm and 1.62-26.45 g, respectively. The estimated asymptotic length (L infinity) of this species (15.38) was in comparison with average length at 10 cm from 723 specimens along with the rate of 0.70 yr- 1 for approaching to asymptotic length. The obtained growth performance index (phi) 2.2 indicates that this species is not economically feasible to bring under aquaculture. At an average annual water surface temperature of 28 degrees C, natural mortality, 1.71yr-1 indicating good ecological suitability of Bukvora oxbow lake (Baor). The estimated current exploitation ratio (0.24) reflected under -exploitation status with total instantaneous mortality (2.25 years -1) and fishing mortality (0.55 years -1). The recruitment pattern of this species was observed across the year, with main peak occurring during the period of April to May. The estimated total steady state biomass (3.91 metric ton) and MSY (4.40 metric ton) based on length-structured virtual population analysis (VPA) length-structured virtual population analysis (VPA) through FiSAT II schedule indicating the sustainable production of this species. The obtained values of proximate compositions (% of protein, fat, Moisture, ash) showed no significant variations during different seasons throughout the year. The monthly measurements of GaSI showed significant alterations (p < 0.05). The value of essential minerals (Na and Ca) was recorded 9.18 mg and 245.19 mg per 100 g of fish flesh, respectively. Target hazard quotient and Cancer risk for all detected heavy metals were far below the recommended levels by United States Environmental Protection Agency. Therefore, the target fish species from oxbow lake is safe and have no human health risk. Therefore, the outcomes of this research would be very worthwhile in carrying out specific management for G. chapra in Baor ecosystems.					Rahman, Md Habibur/AAF-3094-2021; Rahman, Md.

J	Windolf, J; Jeppesen, E; Jensen, JP; Kristensen, P				Windolf, J; Jeppesen, E; Jensen, JP; Kristensen, P			Modelling of seasonal variation in nitrogen retention and in-lake concentration: A four-year mass balance study in 16 shallow Danish lakes	BIOGEOCHEMISTRY												The mass balance for total nitrogen (N) was studied over a four-year period in 16 shallow mainly eutrophic Ist order Danish lakes. Water was sampled in the main inlet of each lake 18-26 times annually, and from the outlets and the lake 19 times annually. Water was also sampled from minor inlets, although less frequently. N input and output were calculated using daily data on discharge (Q), the latter being obtained either from the Q/H relationship based on automatic recordings of water level (H) for the main in- and outlet, or by means of Q/Q relationships for the minor inlets. Annual mean N retention in the lakes ranged from 47 to 234 mg N m(-2) d(-1), and was particularly high in lakes with high N loading. Annual percentage retention (N-ret-y%) ranged from 11 to 72%. Non-linear regression analysis revealed that hydraulic retention time and mean depth accounted for 75% of the variation in annual mean N-ret-y% and, in combination with inlet N concentration, accounted for 84% of the variation in the in-lake N concentration. N-ret% varied according to season, being higher in the second and third quarter than in the first and fourth quarter(median 18-19%). A simple model was developed for predicting monthly nitrogen retention (N-ret-m) on the basis of external N loading, the lake water pool of nitrogen N-pool, hydraulic loading and lake water temperature. Calibration of only two parameters on data from the randomly selected 8 out of 16 lakes rendered the model capable of accurately simulating seasonal dynamics of the in-lake N concentration and N-ret-m in all 16 lakes. We conclude that with regard to shallow, eutrophic lakes with a relatively low hydraulic retention time, it is now possible to determine not only annual mean nitrogen retention, but also the seasonal variation in N-ret-m. Prediction of seasonal variation in N loading of downstream N-limited coastal areas is thereby rendered much more reliable.

J	Andrushchyshyn, O; Magnusson, AK; Williams, DD				Andrushchyshyn, O; Magnusson, AK; Williams, DD			Ciliate populations in temporary freshwater ponds: seasonal dynamics and influential factors	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The ciliate populations of two temporary ponds in southern Ontario were studied throughout their aquatic phases in 2001. Pond I (similar to1 ha) held water for 98 days, whereas Pond II (similar to0.25 ha) held water for 34 days. Populations were assessed both within the ponds themselves and within a series of enclosures in which invertebrate predator pressure was manipulated. 2. In the natural pond water, total ciliate abundance in Pond II rose rapidly from day 1 increasing two orders of magnitude by day 7. In contrast, total abundance in Pond I began at the same level as in Pond II but increased much more slowly, reached a plateau of around 500 individuals L-1, and increased again late in the hydroperiod. 3. Despite being only 500 m apart, the two ponds were fairly dissimilar in terms of their species richness and species composition. Pond I contained 50 species compared with 70 species for Pond II, with only 24 species shared. Additional species occurred within the enclosures raising the total species richness to 145 species; 88 from Pond I, 104 from Pond II, with 47 species (30%) in common. Pond II contained more mid-sized ciliates (50-200 mum), whereas Pond I was dominated by smaller ciliates, especially in mid-May and early June. In Pond I, cumulative species richness throughout the hydroperiod was highest in the predator addition enclosures (65 +/- 4 species), followed by the partial-predator exclusion enclosures (50 +/- 4). Lowest species richness was found in the control enclosures (39 +/- 2) and in the pondwater controls (39 +/- 0). Differences between the ciliates in the natural pond water and the enclosures appeared to be related to a greater concentration of phytoplankton within the enclosures (perhaps resulting from extensive growth of duckweed, Lemna , outside), and higher densities of zooplankters in the pond. 4. The physicochemical environment influenced species richness, total abundance and the number of rare species (27 in Pond II versus 13 in Pond I). Variation in ciliate abundance in Pond I could be explained by the number of days after filling (39%) and enclosure treatment (23%). These two parameters also explained 72% of the variation in species richness in Pond I (46 and 26%, respectively). Sixty-five per cent of the variation in abundance in Pond II could be explained by the measured parameters: number of days after filling 27%, pH 19%, and nitrate levels 12%. Fifty-two per cent of the variation in species richness was explained by the environmental parameters, of which pH was the most influential. Species succession was a strong feature of both ponds and its relationship to environmental variables and the presence of other organisms is discussed. 5. Addition of invertebrate predators resulted in higher abundance and higher species richness for a limited time period in one of the ponds - suggesting that differences in foodweb dynamics may influence ciliate community composition.																			0046-5070					MAR	2003	48	3					548	564		10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01028.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2427.2003.01028.x								32390671					WOS:000181027400015

The spatial and temporal distribution of the sediment microbiota, the metabolic potential of bacterial communities and the species composition of the genera Bacillus and Clostridium, as well as sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were investigated regarding the close interactions between the lake sediment and the overlaying water column, the special water chemical parameters, and the extensive reed coverage of the lake. Aerobic microbial activities were tested with community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) using BIOLOG microplates. The quantification of the anaerobic fermentative and sulphate-reducing bacteria was done by the MPN (Most Probable Number) method. The cultivation of bacteria adapted to the special physico-chemical characteristics of the lake was carried out employing selective media. Multivariate analysis of CLPP data indicated that the microbial communities of the sediment separated from that of the water and showed seasonal variations of the utilised carbon sources. The results of the MPN demonstrated that the counts of the fermentative and sulphate-reducing bacteria in the reed rhizosphere were about one order higher than in the sediment. Among the isolated bacterial strains, a large number were characterised as facultative or obligate alkaliphilic and also moderately halophilic. The partial sequencing of 16S rDNA of the selected representatives resulted in species of aerobic bacteria, such as Bacillus pseudofirmus, B. halmapalus, B. cohnii, B. (Marinibacillus) marinus, and anaerobes, such as Clostridium putrificum - sporogenes, C. scatologenes, C. bifermentans, Desulfotomaculum guttoideum, Desulfovibrio alcoholivorans, and Desulfovibrio burkinensis.
